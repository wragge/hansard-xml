<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of honourable members to the plight of children who suffer from the little recognised disorder, attention deficit disorder, and the anxiety and problems that are suffered by their families. Honourable members may not be aware that this disorder, also referred to as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was actually identified as a disorder of the nervous system in the 1940s, but little was done for its treatment or control. It is now known that ADD or ADHD has a significant genetic component and that sufferers have key regions of the brain that function abnormally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children with ADD have a developed mental immaturity and lack of production of dopamine. Medication is needed to replenish that deficiency and to improve the transmission of impulses between cells. It is a complex clinical problem and, unfortunately, only about 50 per cent of children appear to grow out of the disorder with maturation after puberty. The real tragedy, however, is that in spite of all that is known now about ADD many children go undiagnosed. Some are even blamed for the behaviour that is the very symptom of the disorder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies in Australia show that ADD and ADHD affect 18 per cent of the school age population, mainly males. Boys with this disorder outnumber girls in the ratio of nine to one. It is twice as common in twins as it is in their brothers and sisters. It causes learning disabilities and secondary emotional, social and family problems. It causes enormous stress on families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typically, the ADD sufferer is the child who rushes from activity to activity and then seems at a loss for things to do. He becomes upset, often violent, when things or people fail to behave as he wants them to behave. Toys are smashed, parents and classmates are abused. He rushes into the street, onto a ledge, up a tree, without the thought of consequences and, as a result, he has more cuts, bruises, abrasions and trips to the doctor than other children. He is the child who races around all day leaving a trail of destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some ADD children steal, lie, break, light matches on impulse, whine, badger, tease and annoy without stop. Older children will be the class clown and show off to their peers, even at the risk of life and limb. Parents and siblings have to cope with the marked tendency to be bossy. Their social aggressiveness drives other children away. ADD children tend to have mood swings and cycles, so their behaviour is unpredictable. The result of this behaviour is difficulty in school. Underachievement is almost the hallmark of the ADD child. When they start school they often have trouble colouring, cutting out with scissors, tying shoe laces and buttoning. Their handwriting is illegible and their inability to concentrate has a snowballing effect. Poor performance leads to criticism, which leads to poor self-esteem and then lack of motivation. So the school's social structure makes the ADD child's problems greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continuing into adulthood, ADD can contribute to alcoholism, drink driving, delinquency and crime. ADD is a life problem. Hyperactivity, distractability and impulsiveness are not just school problems but life problems. They disrupt family life, sometimes making it impossible for normal social activities. Relationships with grandparents are strained and parents' friendship ties break down. The child's peer group relationships are unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADD really constitutes a major public health problem. It consumes considerable resources and treatment with stimulant drugs, and this has increased markedly over recent years. Prescribed drugs for ADD have more than doubled between 1990 and 1992. Research continues into its riddles. Obviously the answer lies in research into neurochemical, endocrinological and morphological compositions of the neonatal and juvenile human. In the meantime, parents have to cope the best they can with the treatment they can get. Certainly, diagnosis of ADD when performed by a medical practitioner attracts Medicare benefits but, unfortunately, the Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee, the body which makes recommendations to the government on drugs available as pharmaceutical benefits, has rejected on several occasions in the past applications for the listing of Ritalin, which is recommended as one of the management strategies in the control of ADD.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considered Ritalin to have no therapeutic advantage over the listed drug dexamphetamine, which is considerably less expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to parents of children who consume up to 15 tablets of Ritalin at any one time. When one considers that a packet of 100 costs in the order of $75, one can see the effect on a family budget if one has only one such child. In a family with more children, the expense is obviously unbearable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manufacturers of Ritalin are currently considering making a formal application to the committee requesting that this drug be listed as a benefit for those parents for whom dexamphetamine is not suitable. Stimulant medication is generally regarded as safe and can bring dramatic improvement for some children, but obviously it carries its own dangers: dangers of the potential for overprescription; dangers of the `play lunch' drug fed to kids by overly ambitious parents in a bid for higher marks; dangers that medication can give children the wrong message that they are not responsible for their own behaviour; and dangers of the side effects of weight loss and depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medication, however, is only part of the treatment. What is really needed is a holistic approach involving parents, educators and doctors. Unfortunately, because of the violence associated with the disorder, it should also involve police and welfare agencies. That is why I strongly support the efforts of the Raymond Terrace ADD-ADHD support group, which is in my own electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of personal desperation, Mrs Lyn Mulley of Raymond Terrace started a monthly support group at her home. Meetings have been attended by 20 to 40 people. In October 1992 she invited Mr David Porter, a clinical psychologist for the lower Hunter, to speak at a public meeting. Over 100 concerned parents attended. Another hundred attended a similar meeting in May last year. This gives us some idea of the extent of the problem and the distress of the families of these children. Left untreated, children may end up as drug addicts, or alcoholics, or may commit suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Raymond Terrace ADD-ADHD support group has put together a booklet. It has contacted other support groups and individuals asking them to share their experiences in a positive or a fun way while at the same time offering support for their very real problems. Responses were received from all states of Australia, from America and from England. The quality of the material was so high that the group decided to seek funding for the publication under the community organisation support program, which is administered by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. This program makes funds available to community based organisations to undertake activities with national relevance to the portfolio of this department. If the application is successful, this booklet will bring a message of hope to all parents of ADD children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message in the stories and poems is about how much these people love their children and how hard has been, and still is, the battle against ignorance. It is a moving book about encouragement and sharing understanding with others so that they do not have to face this often devastating ordeal alone. The Raymond Terrace support group has orders already for its book and plans to send it to other groups throughout Australia and advertise it in America and England. The stories and poems, some of which have been written by the children themselves, will be illustrated by other children suffering from ADD. Appropriately, it has been called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Angels Disguised as little Devils</EMPHASIS>&mdash;ADD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also recently had the privilege of attending a meeting of the Hunter support group in Maitland. It became obvious to me that there is a need for wider community awareness. It was a horrifying insight into the suffering of parents. They told of having to resort to calling police to control the violent behaviour of their ADD children. Some have even feared for their lives. Many could show me bruises and cuts inflicted by their own children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not uncommon for all the children in a family to be affected. Some parents I spoke to have three ADD children, and they are at their wit's end. Many spoke of the desperate need for respite care&mdash;for the parents and for the children. They spoke of the urgent need for counselling, but essentially the message went out for understanding from the greater community of what it means to have such a child in a family. For that reason, I am convening a meeting of committee members and representatives of the education department, the police department and welfare organisations. Perhaps after sharing our knowledge we can look to a national conference. We also need to consider funding for treatment, research and parent and teacher education. We need to give consideration to these disorders when setting our national health goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADD is increasing dramatically. It has been described as the child psychiatric epidemic of the 1990s. It does not really matter whether this is because of better techniques in its detection or whether there are environmental factors that are as yet unknown. What does matter is that we must and can do something to help these children and their families. I can think of no better way to celebrate this International Year of the Family than by providing positive support for these families caring for children who, through no fault of their own, suffer from attention deficit disorder. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The youth culture of today is a multiplicity of components and that fragmentation of ideals, styles and codes makes it difficult to know how to precisely define the young. There are so many subcultures, so many music genres with which they align themselves and so many dress codes which more or less reflect the music and video cultures they have absorbed. These styles and cultures are fairly transient too. They surface and are gone almost in an instant. Suddenly, what was in is out, what was trendy is passe and the Simpsons are being passed up for Beaver and Butthead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980, Alvin Toffler, author of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Third Wave</EMPHASIS> wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As change accelerates in society it forces a parallel acceleration within us. New information reaches us and we are forced to revise our image file continuously at a faster and faster rate. Older images based on past reality must be replaced, for unless we update them . . . we become progressively less competent. We find it impossible to cope.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This speed-up of image processing inside us means that images grow more and more temporary . . . Ideas, beliefs and attitudes skyrocket into consciousness, are challenged, defied, and suddenly fade into nowhere. . . Ideologies crack. Celebrities pirouette fleetingly across our awareness. Contradictory moral and political slogans assail us.</PARA>
<PARA>I might say, Mr Speaker, that this fragmentation is making life very hard for commercial advertisers who are at a loss to produce a single image of youth which will appeal to all young people. Coca-Cola is one multinational company which has experienced the problem, developing up to 30 commercials for a single season, relying on animation and computer images in place of images of real people rather than risk presenting an image which some people cannot relate to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue was raised last October on the ABC's youth affairs program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Attitude</EMPHASIS>. In that program Adelaide advertising strategist Steven Drummond termed today's youth Generation X and identified the extreme difficulties in marketing to young people. Drummond said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generation X is categorised by the fact you can't categorise them in any particular box . . . Generation X is really just a series of subcultures without a dominant fashion or music force that we can see . . . Generation X is a group that is defined by age and not much else.</PARA>
<PARA>Drummond went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's interesting&mdash;the impact of the recession. I think it's the obvious dominant force, particularly for those in their early 20s. Those people really have no identity in terms of their occupation and that's how our society typically defines our identity so a lot of that is coming through that they'll express themselves through fashion and music . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, there are also less favourable methods of expression and it is a very sad sign of the times that the desire to destroy, damage or deface public and private property has become part of today's culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us take the graffiti of the urban landscape for granted. I will admit that some of it is expressive, creative and demonstrative of some of the artistic talents of young people, but tagging&mdash;or the leaving of a single name or symbol which identifies the artist or tagger amongst other young people&mdash;is nothing more than an eyesore. It is also an expensive eyesore as it costs local councils and private property owners a great deal of time and effort to remove the unwanted blemishes from their walls, houses, boats, fences, sheds or wherever else the tagger chooses to make his or her mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time in my electorate tagging has become the source of agony for a number of local business people and residents. They have watched helplessly as the number of tags mount on the freeways, the street signs and, of course, on their own properties, and they are tired of the taunting of the young people who walk the streets at night or just hang around parks or the local cemetery with nothing to do or nowhere to go. Graffiti has become one of their pastimes. In the words of Professor Julius Sumner Miller, why is this so? Where are we failing young people and for what reasons are they expressing themselves in such a socially unacceptable way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth problems have been studied for years. Each study ends up with more or less the same conclusions: that youth today do not have particularly high self-esteem, they lack confidence about their own future and they feel a need to escape the restraints and conditions we adults place on their lives. Two reports spanning almost 20 years prove my point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1974, the report of the National Youth Council of Australia's youth say project was presented to the then minister for tourism and recreation, Frank Stewart. The report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recreational priorities of Australian young people</EMPHASIS> revealed that, of the 1,258 people aged between 12 and 20 who were involved in the youth say project, most had a common view about the shortcomings of youth facilities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was noted that, until about the age of 12, most of these children would be involved in team sports. I have observed that this is still mostly true, as evidenced in the high participation rates in junior football, teeball and little athletics, to name a few organisations or activities across Australia. However, after the age of 12, the report noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their recreational preferences are strongly in favour of socially based, loosely structured active and passive pastimes under their own control. Competitive, traditional, highly organised, supervised, goal orientated patterns of activity involving long term commitments are just not popular.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say that young people involved in the study showed strong feelings of negativity, felt a loss of belonging or community, resented the distrust of young people displayed by adults, missed appropriate social venues and outlets and felt uninformed and confused about what opportunities were available to them. Furthermore, they were generally apprehensive about the legal system and of police, restricted by public transport and frustrated by their experiences of school and work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1993, a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A lost generation</EMPHASIS> was prepared by the Australian Youth Foundation. The AYF studied and surveyed 725 young people of many ages, races and socioeconomic backgrounds. These people would have represented almost every type of family in every electorate across Australia. There was nothing atypical about them, although the responses to the questions asked by the AYF were at times both alarming and depressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AYF revealed that the surveyed youth felt injured in some way by the negative media coverage of young people. They felt restricted by social security legislation and the difficulties in finding full- or part-time work. They found school unproductive and they felt alienated from their local communities. They agreed that violence was a real part of their lives. They feared racially motivated attacks and sexual assault at home, at school or on the street. They linked poverty to crime and believed that there was a steal or starve principle at work in the community. They felt that information was not made widely available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The surveyed youth criticised public transport services limited operation outside normal commuting hours. They also spoke of a lack of entertainment facilities, especially for youth, which would stay open late in the evenings and provide activity oriented programs from time to time to bring young people together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report in April 1974 and the one in November 1993 have shown that basically the youth in both surveys have said exactly the same things. They are still afraid of the same things, they still want the same things and they are still confused about the same things. I intend to discuss these points, because I am also aware that many of them relate to my electorate, which, according to the 1991 census findings, has a particularly high concentration of young people. Fifteen per cent of the total population of Moore is aged between 15 and 24. Additionally, Moore has the second highest concentration of young people between the ages of five and 14 in Australia, which means that a large number of kids are growing up and looking for things to do. Potentially, the situation could get much worse if the needs of the young are not addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite sure this is not something that the residents of the suburbs in the electorate of Moore will take lying down&mdash;and nor will I, as their local member. For this reason, I have formed an association with local business people, police, youth workers, state members of parliament, local government, young people and others with a view to giving young people the kind of facility that they really want&mdash;not one that we think they want, but one which they have indicated would suit them and which would help to alleviate the problems of boredom, particularly in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the members of the group, the Northern Suburbs Youth Development Association, are adamant that this should not be a case of the squeaky wheels getting the oil. Young people in the area must demonstrate that their trust can be earned and that they would be responsible enough to manage a youth facility on their own with minimal input from adults.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We want them to be able to make their own rules and enforce them, and to take charge of the centre with confidence and enthusiasm. Such a principle has been successful elsewhere in the world, with Alice's Cafe in the Northern Territory being a fine example of a commercial project run entirely by youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long run, this is the type of establishment we want in the developing city of Joondalup, but it is a longer term objective, and an interim project is being nurtured to act as a stopgap measure. Already a large shed has been identified in the Joondalup business park which the Wanneroo City Council will make available as an interim centre. It requires modifications, but our consulting architect, Mr Duncan Jordan, is convinced that it has tremendous potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whatever the building or location, we must be sure that we have listened to young people and that we create a kind of place which makes them feel comfortable and which eliminates whatever feelings of isolation or alienation they may be experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend the efforts of those who organised the blue light discos that are carried out throughout the electorate on a regular basis. In particular, I commend Dave and Dianne Peet, who are responsible for coordinating the Wanneroo blue light disco, which has played such a tremendous part in providing young people in my electorate with alcohol-free, supervised activities. That is something that was lacking before the establishment of the blue light discos throughout Western Australia, but in particular in my electorate. The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recreational priorities of Australia's young people</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social pursuits involving relaxed opportunities for meeting each other, dancing, music making and talking are highly cherished pastimes . . . . The strong clamour for autonomy in their affairs is not a complete repudiation of adult participation . . . but a firm reminder that we have been far too intrusive or assertive as adults about what they should be doing. They see an acute need for resourceful adult help given in the spirit of an opening and listening partnership and not an anxious and prescriptive proprietorship.</PARA>
<PARA>Young people realise the value of advice from older people, but on a limited basis. They want independence and they want a simplistic entertainment structure&mdash;not one that is highly regimented or highly organised. If we are bold enough to test the waters perhaps we will be pleasantly surprised by the leadership qualities and skills of our local youth. Such an initiative must be nurtured in government policy, but unfortunately it is not. We have experienced various and changing policies on youth problems in the past, and none seems to be able to deal effectively with the plurality of youth needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education has been mooted as the answer. Task forces have come and gone. The Hawke Government declared youth `Priority One', and upgraded the Office of Youth Affairs in 1985. With the collapse in Australia's terms of trade in 1987, and the fall of the value of the Aussie dollar, the priority of youth issues slipped from one to somewhere lower down the scale, and the Office of Youth Affairs was renamed and moved again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the short-lived youth training program eventuated and the community youth support scheme was merged with an array of other community services. Overall, this was a year which represented a shift away from youth as a distinct area of policy, and which marked the commencement of the Burdekin inquiry into youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of that report in 1989 found that there may have been as many as 70,000 homeless youth across the country as a result of family conflict, unemployment, poverty and the government's failure to provide adequate services in the area of income assistance, housing, education, health, and employment and training. They are still important factors, which are making the lives of many families raising children difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the government's knee-jerk responses to the Burdekin report was to increase the youth homeless allowance and to shorten the qualifying period. The outcome is that since 1987, when just 940 youths claimed the benefit, the number has skyrocketed to more than 10,000. This suggests that some young people would sooner claim the benefit than reconcile with their parents in instances where that may have previously been the case, when the regulations of the YHA were more stringent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A senior research fellow of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Frank Mass, is one critic of the present lack of vision for youth. In the paper `Shifting responsibility&mdash;a decade of youth policy' published in the summer edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth Affairs in Australia 1990-91</EMPHASIS>, Mass argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is needed is a set of policies which embodies a valued and positive role, a place for young people in our society. Instead there is a sense of uncertainty as to the value that should be placed on youth and consequently a lack of commitment to a full investment in the future to be offered to the young. This lack of certainty is communicated to young people and their families. By developing a policy mix of carrot and big stick, the government has given the clear message that there is not much of a place for young people . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, as a direct result of the economic climate the Labor government has created, it can be proven that families are losing hope and that the social problems we are encountering&mdash;including graffiti and criminal behaviour by the young, divorce, separation and even child abuse&mdash;can be linked to the inability of families to cope with the financial strains of their daily lives, and their irrational decisions and actions are obvious indications that they have been set on a dangerous downward spiral. As Alvin Toffler said back in 1980 in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Third Wave</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Value systems splinter and crash, while the lifeboats of family, church and state are hurled madly about.</PARA>
<PARA>I am determined to work towards a fair go for young people in my electorate by giving them hope and encouragement. I have been ably assisted in my endeavours in the Northern Suburbs Youth Development Association by community-minded people such as Gil and Cid Clemente, John Craft, Lance Wilson, Superintendent Dick Milner, Duncan Jordan, whom I mentioned earlier, the Reverend Joe Sullivan, and Dave and Dianne Peet from blue light disco, who have come together with a common goal of helping Generation X. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a youth policy advisory committee, comprising students of local high schools in my electorate, which has also been instrumental in raising matters of concern to the young. I strongly encourage other members of the House to become actively involved with young people, if they are not already. Young people do have a healthy suspicion of politicians, and it is little wonder given what they and their families have experienced in the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many ways in which we as representatives of the people can take an interest but the most important way we can show our interest is to listen to the young people of Australia and establish how they think we can be of the most assistance. I think the result of this would be the formation of more groups or associations around this country&mdash;such as the Northern Suburbs Youth Development Association&mdash;which can play an active role in working for the betterment of youth options for the brighter future of our young. By tackling the cause of our social problems instead of having knee-jerk reactions and applying bandaids we are bound to make some headway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the commencement of my speech I indicated the high concentration of young people in my electorate. Moore is a very young electorate; it is an electorate of families and young people. We have had some tremendous disappointments in recent years, through government policy, and I think that policy is something that ought to be reversed. My area has the second fastest growing municipality within it&mdash;the city of Wanneroo. Wanneroo is an area which is staggering in its growth. The demand for housing, services and infrastructure is incredible. People in the Wanneroo local council are forever asking me to represent them because they are desperate for help, particularly from the federal government, in providing the infrastructure and services which many people around the country in areas that have been well settled or developed take for granted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (1.05 p.m.)&mdash;In following the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I make a couple of initial observations. It is pleasing to note that, despite the vituperative way in which he has entered some debates in this parliament, he at least was able to concentrate on an issue of great merit not only to his community but also to the wider Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot say that that is the case with all of the opposition speakers in this debate. I want to raise briefly the contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and, in doing so, highlight the way in which, in my view, he has used this parliament yet again to attack an individual who is outside the parliament. I do not believe, given the standards that the community should expect from parliamentarians, that we should be allowed to use this House to attack, vilify and otherwise libel people in a way which has been done in this parliament over the last week. This happened to the Australian Labor Party candidate for the seat of Fremantle by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) and the honourable member for O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind a feisty debate, nor do I mind the odd comments being thrown across the chamber towards government members or vice versa, but it is an entirely different story when we are talking about people outside of this place. Although I have been in this parliament for only almost seven years, I have noticed the way in which the honourable member for O'Connor and other members of the opposition have used this place as a coward's castle. I think the time has come to call them to account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is what we have come to expect. This raises the key issues of the disarray which exists within the opposition, the panoply of contenders for the leadership and the sorts of proposals which we have seen. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has aptly directed his attention to those. What we are seeing from the opposition is the view that we need to forget policy; do not worry about the key issues of the day; do not worry about coming into this place to have a debate or to raise issues around questions of employment, industry policy, regional policy or the young unemployed. What those opposite do is come in here and attack people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that this is all a diversionary tactic&mdash;and we all know it&mdash;because of the plight of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). All we have to do is look at this morning's headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>: `Dissatisfaction with Hewson at a new high'. I will not read the details of this particular article because I am sure that all opposition members have got it nailed on their notice boards and have sent it out to their electorates. I am sure that all of those who are pretenders to the throne of the Leader of the Opposition are gleefully sitting back in their little holes wondering when it will happen&mdash;sooner rather than later, I would have thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear fact of the matter is that those opposite have basically abdicated any responsibility for talking about public policy issues. But the government has not. The interesting thing that I find, as I work in my electorate and travel around Australia, is that the community is really interested in knowing how we will finally come to terms with the vexed question of long-term unemployment; what the industry paper will contain; and how the government will address regional policy. We have not seen one positive contribution on any of these substantive policy issues from the opposition over the past few months. All we have seen from the opposition are these vituperative attacks upon individuals. It is about time they were called to order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues around this question of public policy that I want to address. Last week you would have seen, Mr Deputy Speaker, a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> report on Aboriginal health featuring the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson. On that program he highlighted very graphically the inadequacy of housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around Australia, particularly in remote areas. What we saw from the relevant Northern Territory government minister was a response which implied that all the responsibility for this was the Commonwealth's. But that is far from the truth. The Northern Territory minister was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> on Saturday, 22 January 1994 as implying that the Northern Territory government contributed $25 million per year for Aboriginal housing and infrastructure whilst the Commonwealth government contributed only $15 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the House what the figures really are. In the 1993-94 financial year, the Commonwealth contributed around $50 million. This comprised $19.4 million from the Commonwealth-state housing agreement; $19 million from the national Aboriginal health strategy; and $12.36 million through ATSIC's community housing and infrastructure program. The Northern Territory government's contribution to housing and infrastructure in Aboriginal communities in the 1993-94 financial year was a massive $4 million, plus $2 million in kind. But that was a dramatic increase on its contributions over the previous two financial years. In 1992-93, it put in around $2 million and in 1991-92, less than $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the Northern Territory government but all state governments in this country, particularly those with a large Aboriginal constituency, which have done precious little to address this particular issue. A great deal more needs to be done. Senator Richardson is quite correct when he points out the appalling nature and paucity of Aboriginal infrastructure and housing and the consequent health issues that flow from that poor infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem will not be resolved by the attitudes being taken by the Northern Territory government. Let me put you in the picture, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Northern Territory government has the highest per capita debt level of any government in Australia at around $9,000 per head or $36,000 per family. As its key priority for the last few years, it has chosen to use Loan Council borrowings in expenditure of $160 million to build two great edifices&mdash;a new parliament house and a supreme court building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could ask: what are the priorities of the Northern Territory government? Using its capacity to borrow and having us repay the debt, as we are doing, for these two edifices, would it deign to borrow $160 million on the public account to address housing and infrastructure shortages in Aboriginal communities? What do you think the answer is, Mr Deputy Speaker? I am sure you know, an astute person like you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), who is sitting opposite, would understand that the Northern Territory government has chosen its priorities, and they do not address the key issues of Aboriginal health. It has chosen to pork barrel in the most obscene way without addressing the needs of a significant poor proportion of its electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time when the Minister for Health quite properly and appropriately addresses the public's attention to this very important key public policy issue, we see a response from the Northern Territory which is less than adequate. It should have said, `Yes, you are right. Collectively, we need to do a great deal more. We need to work cooperatively to do a great deal more and we will work with you'. It should not have tried to say to people, `We have done our bit. It is all the Commonwealth's fault'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Senator Richardson has already accepted that the Commonwealth has a massive responsibility in this area&mdash;something with which we concur. I am sure the shadow minister opposite also accepts that responsibility. Housing and infrastructure are essentially state responsibilities and these are matters which should be addressed by state and territory governments. But they should be done cooperatively, with the assistance of the Commonwealth agencies, with the use of Commonwealth resources where they are appropriate and with consultation and negotiation with ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations throughout Australia. It is not appropriate for the Northern Territory government to continue as it has done in the past and basically abrogate its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned previously the Northern Territory CLP senator who abuses the chamber by using it as a coward's castle, as a place to personally attack Aboriginal people&mdash;libel them, in my view&mdash;who are outside the parliament. On Australia Day 1991, when looking at whether Aboriginal people&mdash;in the Northern Territory in this instance, but I assume his remarks apply to all of Australia&mdash;should have appropriate facilities and housing, he made this gem of a statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I firmly believe we would be better off putting a TV set into every underprivileged humpy, before a water tap.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the CLP senator who sits with the National Party in the other chamber. That is what he sees as his priorities. That is how he would respond to the plight that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people find themselves in around northern Australia and, in this case, in the Northern Territory. It is hardly adequate. I am sure it does not reflect the priorities of the honourable member opposite. I am glad the shadow minister is nodding his head in affirmation of what I have just said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that the public debate was directed to this issue in an appropriate way. A great deal more resources need to be put into Aboriginal health and housing. But I point out in addition&mdash;again addressing this issue of priorities&mdash;that Commonwealth grants to the Northern Territory this financial year amount to $1.12 billion, which is a per capita grant of $6,635. The per capita grant for New South Wales is $1,571, so the Northern Territory gets 4.2 times that which the New South Wales government gets for its services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very good reason for this. The states have different capacities to raise revenue from their own sources and face different costs in providing the same public services. We accept that. It is entirely appropriate. I will defend till the death the right of the Northern Territory to receive these additional funds to provide services. But the fact of the matter is that these services are not provided. The Northern Territory government has abrogated its responsibility and it has determined priorities which are not about providing these sorts of resources to Aboriginal communities&mdash;the most disadvantaged people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will illustrate that point by referring to some recent figures on Aboriginal education attainment levels. Recently a survey, the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, was completed and the results were contained in a discussion paper which was released last week. The discussion paper contains some very interesting statistics. I will refer to a piece of socioeconomic data which reinforces the disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in my case in the Northern Territory. The average overall annual income of people aged 15 years and over in the Northern Territory was $20,180; second only to Canberra, which was $23,446. The average income for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory was $9,600. That is less than in any other state. So, on the one hand, the Northern Territory has the second highest average per capita income across the population but, on the other hand, Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are more disadvantaged income wise than Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look further at these statistics we see the appalling standards which now exist in the Northern Territory. In 1989, the year 10 retention rate for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory&mdash;this is calculated on a year 8 base&mdash;was 61.38 per cent. In 1993 that figure had dropped to 41.19 per cent. There has been a dramatic drop in the retention rate of Aboriginal kids in schools in the Northern Territory. If we look at the retention rates for years 11 and 12, the figures replicate that sort of scenario. The retention rates for Aboriginal people in year 10, year 11 and year 12 are lower than anywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures indicate the way in which the Northern Territory government has addressed the issue of Aboriginal education. This is not because it has not been given resources. As I have just indicated, it gets not only those special add-ons as a result of grants from the Grants Commission but also special funds which are negotiated with the Commonwealth government for Aboriginal employment programs. The fact is that Aboriginal students in the Northern Territory represent around 35 per cent of the total school population, for most English is their second or third language, and more than 50 per cent suffer from some level of hearing impairment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary school staffing ratio in bush schools in the Northern Territory is 28 to one. The Northern Territory schools have no ESL program, no additional staffing and the ratio is 28 to one. What do honourable members think the ratio is for urban schools? It is 22 to one. This is another element of disadvantage and, in my view, it shows gross discrimination by the Northern Territory government. What it has failed to do is to address the real needs of Aboriginal students in the Northern Territory. It has failed to recognise or provide the appropriate resources to fund those students so that they can reach the stage of getting into year 10, if they are lucky enough, and year 11 or 12 so they can get the skills they require to get a job. That is a fundamental objective of education. Any person interested in social justice would agree that the platform for people to get into the work force is a sound basic education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that, as a result of the policies being followed by the Northern Territory government&mdash;and, dare I say, other state governments in Australia&mdash;the possibility of these young Australians getting into the work force and getting a sound basic education has diminished, not improved, over the last few years. That is a direct result of the policies being pursued by the Northern Territory government. I suggest that honourable members opposite, instead of going the man and not the ball, should concentrate on these significant public policy issues and debate the merit of them and not debase this parliament by attacking individuals. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I find his comments about the Aboriginal activities in the Northern Territory somewhat interesting, considering that this federal government has had some 10 years to get it right. One would have to wonder whether there was an election on the way in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also made some comments with respect to policies on our side. One can hardly say that at the last election we did not come out with a clear set of policies. We certainly did; it was a very definite set of policies. He need not worry&mdash;we will come out with a very clear set of policies between now and the next election. The real problem that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has is the fact that we have not released our policies yet, and that there is a vacuum in government policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has been used to doing over the last few years&mdash;it cannot do this at the moment&mdash;is knocking our policies rather than pursuing the issues to develop and improve this country. This was highlighted by the honourable member's comments about what is not being done for Aboriginals. The government has had 10 years to do something and it has not done a damn thing. Now it is trying to come out before an election and say what should be done by others, what is not being done and what it is going to do in the future. Instead of talking about what the government is going to do in the future, it should get on with the job and do the darn things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like it address an area that I am most concerned about. This government, over recent months, has had an air of stench about it in respect of elements of corruption. This is one of the areas that the honourable member for the Northern Territory could think seriously about getting some of his colleagues to address if he wants to get on top of the problems that they have. Stories in many areas of inappropriate mechanisms for tendering are rife. There are many areas that must be got on top of if this government is to expect to last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas that I would like to address is an area in Telecom that purchases photocopiers. About four or five years ago, Telecom made a number of decisions relating to its purchasing requirements. Firstly, it devolved central purchasing decisions to the departmental management division and decided not to access the DAS contracts negotiated for purchasing through the federal funds. These decisions resulted, firstly, in no fixed pricing guidelines; secondly, in the scraping of the central equipment and asset register; thirdly, in the elimination of purchasing skills; and, fourthly, bulk buying pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, had a major effect on the manner in which the department dealt with the people that it purchased goods from. Instead of having, for example, two or three people at a state and federal level buying photocopiers&mdash;and this is the area that I have concerns about&mdash;it had a situation where there were some 100 people buying these copiers. This left the system open to exploitation and to unscrupulous salespersons. There are rumours rife in this industry, particularly in the photocopy industry and photocopy businesses, that there has been somewhere in the order of $16 million of over expenditure over the last few years. Some of the companies names that come to mind&mdash;and I am not going to make reference to the companies at the moment because I think it would be inappropriate to do so&mdash;are considered as the more reputable suppliers of photocopiers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These stories persist. Part of the reason I am raising this matter today is that there are some very specific details. Generally, rumours are not supported by a great deal of detail, but I have to say that there are some very detailed items of information flowing through in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that the process that these unscrupulous salespeople have been using is to inflate the purchase price above the DAS contract figure and extend the period of payments for rental from three years to five years. This, in effect, gives the offending companies some two to three times the yield on capital. Part of this yield is offered back as an incentive either to the buyers by way of free equipment or to the salesmen by way of commissions. Obviously, the companies involved look at getting their slice out of the process as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the companies involved are considered to be reputable photocopier companies. It concerns me a great deal that this type of comment is being raised about these companies. This situation is not restricted just to the few top companies, because over a period of time the smaller operators who consider they are being hard done by, as they cannot compete, intend to go in and operate on the same basis. So a company may have a piece of equipment&mdash;a copier, for example&mdash;that would normally sell for, say, $16,000. The price is inflated to some $30,000, the rental is taken over five years instead of three years, so the actual selling price is some $42,000. The kickbacks from this go out by way of, as I say, either equipment or commissions or by way of additional profit to the companies, depending on the company that is involved. There are abundant stories about salespeople in these sorts of situations. One salesperson in particular made in the order of $130,000 in sales commissions in just one month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also problems involving toner, the supply of which for the life of the copier in the department has traditionally been part of the price of the copier. That toner is actually being invoiced separately so that it is an additional amount of income for the company which, once again, can be distributed on a commission or other basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that concerns me the most is that these activities have been known about in Telecom for some considerable time. In fact, two of the major offenders have been given a one-year contract with a four-year option. Telecom is saying to the smaller operators who sell these copiers that they do not necessarily have to work by the rules. It is saying to the people in the department that there is an opportunity to get free equipment&mdash;it might be free to them, but it is not free to the community at large because somebody is paying for it. In fact, the taxpayer is paying for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that this type of activity is continuing in departments. It concerns me that they have not got on top of this issue, particularly when there have been internal inquiries on it. It concerns me that contracts let are given to companies that were involved in this type of scam. Let me say here and now that I will not allow this issue to rest; I will pursue it. I just hope that the minister involved&mdash;and I recognise that there has been a change of minister since these particular accusations were levelled&mdash;realises that I intend to continue to pursue this matter because, as somebody who has come out of the small business area of our community, I recognise how difficult it is to get into the marketplace in the first instance. I recognise how difficult it is to keep a team of salespeople working on what are realistic commissions and working in a reputable manner when there are people around who are working in a far less than reputable manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the earlier comments of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, who accuses us of having a lack of policies at this stage. We do not have to come up with the policies because, after all, those opposite are the government. The honourable member needed to look behind his own minister's door first. He needs to look at accountability. This government in recent days, as I would have thought it should, has gone through an exercise in which accountability has started to hit home as being a real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we are prepared to ensure that people who do not operate in a reputable manner within departments are penalised for not doing so, and are removed from those positions, and unless we are prepared to make sure that every dollar that flows through departments can be accounted for&mdash;not on whiteboards, but on documented paper&mdash;then as a country we will go backwards and end up with the same sort of respect as do governments in many of the Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough for us to say that we cannot control everything and have a handle on every issue. We must make sure that a satisfactory standard of performance is required of all departments and employees in these departments. It is the responsibility of the appropriate ministers to ensure that that occurs. I get somewhat upset about this when I see small business operators, one of whom in particular is battling to keep his house and his family together. He may well lose his house because he cannot get contracts, not due to any fault on his part but because somebody else in the system is prepared to take what amounts to a bribe. It is disgraceful. I do not like genuine, honest working people being put out of business under such terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that many of the political difficulties that now face the Liberal Party and the National Party have been brought on by the very sound economic management of this government over recent years. From the time the packages of 1991 that were designed to stimulate the economy started to take effect, the standing of the opposition has continued to decline. That is well recognised, I believe, in the coalition. As a result, all we heard from those opposite in that period was from a series of shadow economic spokesmen bemoaning every piece of good economic news that was released, trying to give that news a hollow ring and trying to frighten people into the belief that the economy is in some sort of hole and that those opposite are the ones with the answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We just heard from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), that those opposite do not need to have policies&mdash;they certainly do not have them. They are bereft of policies and unable to find direction. The exercise they have gone through continues to be completely cynical. Those on this side of the House&mdash;and I am sure many on the other side&mdash;realise that if it had not been for those policies of stimulation that this government introduced, stimulation that the coalition opposed; the interest rate reductions, which the coalition opposed; the industrial peace that we created, and that the opposition would have destroyed; and the outward forward-looking policies that the coalition members never had&mdash;or if they did they would never have had the guts to implement them&mdash;the economy would be in tatters and we would still be trying to live off the sheep's back. We all know that with the falling commodity prices for our primary products it would not have been possible to continue that way. Under a government by those opposite we would still have had high tariff walls and inefficient domestic manufacturing industries incapable of providing the national wealth from the international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation bills before the House mark a continuation of the strong and positive economic policies of this government. There is no doubt that measures in the budget, and in past budgets, have been unpopular with some sections of the community. Some people do not like the idea of change&mdash;it does upset them. But as the Labor government has done throughout its nearly 11 years in office, we have had the courage to make decisions which are right for this country and the vast majority of the community. We have not shirked our responsibility in making the hard decisions which are needed to get us working as a competitive and caring society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That contrasts very strongly with the courage and economic policy making that we have seen from the opposition. Apart from Fightback&mdash;at least half of which, probably all, has been dumped and the rest of which really does not rate a mention&mdash;the opposition has not had the guts to decide who should be its leader. The economy in Australia today is vastly different from that which we inherited from the coalition 10 years ago. In terms of the great amount of cultural and attitudinal change that has occurred in this economy, it is a very short period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had double digit inflation and double digit unemployment at that time. Forget the record levels of industrial disputation, the lack of adequate medical care or social services. Look at the nature of the economy that those opposite handed us. Despite being able to see the warning signs, the coalition was happy to let the economy drift along as it had done through the salad days when the rest of the world was paying top dollar for our raw materials. But the rest of the world stopped paying top dollar and it was evident to all that the level of wealth we once enjoyed from our unimproved primary produce would not return. The opposition did not have the gumption to implement the types of economic policies that it had recognised for years should be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That it knew some of the measures that had to be taken was evidenced in its support for the moves to free up the economy that this government immediately introduced. From that time, the industry has been retooling and is now competing in many areas with the rest of the world in both price and quality, and winning. Perhaps it was the opposition's lack of faith in the Australian people and the Australian business community which prevented it from taking the necessary steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the decade since those opposite were last in office we have seen some remarkable performances in the international market. We should not lose sight of the magnitude of change that has occurred amongst our exporters, particularly amongst our manufacturing exporters, which is helping to place us in a very good position as we head towards the end of the decade. Exports have trebled, manufacturing production has doubled and exports of elaborately enhanced goods have trebled. These are now the fastest growing components of our export trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low commodity prices and a recessed world economy over the past couple of years have made things difficult for the domestic economy. The restructuring that has occurred in almost all our manufacturing industries and throughout government agencies has meant that an unacceptable number of people have been forced out of work. But this restructuring has also meant that Australian business and industry is now much leaner and better able to compete in international trade. It is in this area that our employment and economic growth will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three weeks ago the Treasurer (Mr Willis) gave us some useful information on how that is occurring. He advised that gross domestic product was due to grow at 3 1/2 per cent this year and not at the predicted 2 3/4 per cent. That growth is higher than the growth in virtually every other country in the OECD. When we consider that the average growth in the OECD was 1.1 per cent, it means that GDP in Australia is growing at three times the rate of similarly developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer also gave us enlightened figures on export growth. He said that budget forecasts were that export growth would result in a quarter of a per cent growth to GDP but now, because of strong export performance, it would add about 1 1/2 per cent to GDP. Exports were growing at seven per cent as opposed to budget forecasts of 5 3/4 per cent. This growth in export activity and the strengthening of our domestic economy has had an equally positive effect on employment forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is still a serious problem which this government recognises and will continue to address, but the latest figures on employment growth are encouraging. We have exceeded budget forecasts of employment growth of 100,000 by recording 116,000 for the half year, and we are confidently predicting that employment will grow by more than 200,000 over a full year. That is employment growth of 1 3/4 per cent, not the three-quarters of a per cent forecast in the budget. All this is occurring with growth in the CPI of just two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This healthy change to our economic outlook has not come about by accident; it has come about through aggressive economic policies over the past two years, particularly since the release of the One Nation statement. It is true that the economic impetus of One Nation took longer to take effect than was expected or hoped. That was largely because of a lack of confidence in the business and wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That lack of confidence, of course, was fuelled in no small degree by the opposition economic spokespeople who, to their great discredit, talked the economy down at every opportunity. Had it not been for the opposition's constant negativity, scores of people who were hurt by the recession may have been spared much of the pain they experienced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adding to the lack of confidence was last year's election. Business and industry could not plan their investments because they did not know what they would be facing. They did not know whether they would be able to continue to work under a government with progressive but stable management or whether everything would be tipped on its head. A year after the election, and with investment returning apace, Australia is now set for a period of long and sustained economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact on my electorate has also been substantial. I would like to preface my comments by repeating the words of the current, but I believe temporary, Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when he made his address in reply in this House on 19 August last year. He claimed that the budget deficit would not be $16 billion but something in the order of $25 billion. He got it wrong by $11 billion. People who remember that, and many of the other statements he has made, must surely doubt anything he says. With an $11,000 million miscalculation, how could anybody trust him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get from the opposition now? As I said at the beginning, there is no policy, no direction and no leadership. Talk about honour among thieves! From my reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last week, we even have members of the parliamentary Liberal Party taking legal action against each other. Team work does not exist on the other side. There is no harmony. Those opposite are simply trying to have a fight and to take issues that are not there. They have no direction and no focus. They are busy fighting amongst themselves and cannot find direction at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic policies of this government allowed me to announce in November that about $16 million worth of tax cuts would be delivered to residents of my electorate prior to Christmas. That provided a tremendous economic shot in the arm, not only for my electorate but multiplied throughout all electorates across Australia. It gave individual taxpayers more spending power, boosted business activity and allowed businesses to employ more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the economic boost from the tax cuts which helped Australia record such strong pre-Christmas business activity. The 1993-94 federal budget provided $80 million over four years to develop tourism in regional areas and to increase international promotion of Australia as a tourist destination, and that is of tremendous benefit to an electorate like mine. Of that money, $42 million is being delivered over four years to develop tourism in regional and rural Australia and to establish the tourism forecasting council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Tourist Commission was allocated an additional $38 million over four years for overseas marketing and $2 million in 1993-94 towards the establishment of the partnership Australia initiative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the course of four years, $23 million has been made available to help growth through strategic planning, the development of local tourism infrastructure and the coordination of tourism information on a regional basis. Ten million dollars has been allocated for the implementation of the national ecotourism strategy. Funding will be provided for a program to complement the work of the states, environmental groups and tourism organisations in promoting sustainable tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has recognised the need to help rural communities to assess the tourism potential in their areas and to look at coordinated marketing strategies for rural tourism projects. Although Australia has diverse and unique holiday experiences to offer tourists, only one-third of international visitors spend nights outside major capital cities and international gateways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further strategic development of tourism in regional areas such as ours has the potential to offer attractive destinations and experiences to all ranges of tourist markets, add to tourism growth and bring a share of that growth to regions such as the north coast of New South Wales. Developing policies for growth in regional and international tourism is a far cry from the policies of the opposition, which would have hit the tourist industry for six with a 15 per cent GST. I know for a fact that the tourism industry really had great doubts about the Fightback policy of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also implementing policies to improve the lot of low income earners in the important area of health. I have calculated that 32,000 residents in my electorate will be able to benefit from the dental health provisions contained in the budget. On the New South Wales north coast, there are often delays of up to 18 months for people awaiting treatment under the state government's public dental health scheme. The government has recognised that people on low incomes generally have poor dental health because of inadequate access to dental care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that I could trace our current strong economic performance back to the One Nation statement of 1991. The immediate kick-start provided through the local capital works program was, I believe, one of the most successful programs run by this government, recognising the need to get spending under way in rural and regional areas. For communities with high levels of unemployment, the government provided millions of dollars to allow important works that had been on local government books&mdash;in many cases for a long time&mdash;the opportunity to commence. It was not a program of painting rocks white. It was a program to provide important public facilities, to provide an injection of funds into those communities and to get people working. In my electorate, under that program there have been art galleries reconstructed, city halls refurbished, tourism oriented cycle tracks built, parks created, libraries built, sporting facilities constructed, and the much longer list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a program that the Leader of the Opposition described in parliament on 20 August 1992 as pork-barrelling.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important part of One Nation was the focus on improving transport across the nation with a standard rail gauge and improved port facilities. For over 90 years governments have talked of a standard rail gauge between Adelaide and Brisbane, but nothing has ever been done. It is this government which took the important step of achieving a single rail gauge with no stops between Adelaide and Brisbane. It will be to the benefit, economic and otherwise, of this nation for the future that that has been done. So many people have talked about it in the past but never had the gumption to do it, and this government has done it. </PARA>

That doctrine is either dishonest or comes from ignorance. I have already provided figures on GDP growth that show us outperforming others in the OECD in the order of three to one. Had we been achieving the average 1.1 per cent of the OECD nations, the opposition may have had some realistic claims that we are just the fortunate beneficiaries of an improved economic outlook worldwide, but we are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are leading the world out of this recession and it has been because of the measured stimulation that this government provided to the economy. While we were providing a stimulus to the economy to get it moving, the opposition was saying that we should cut $10 billion from expenditure. This would have only sunk us deeper into recession. The Australian people recognise that; they are not fools, as many in the opposition believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can draw an analogy which should be clear to the motor sport loving Leader of the Opposition: if a person's car is stalling, he does not lift his foot off the accelerator and apply the brakes, he gives it a bit more fuel in order to get it going. That is what the government did and that is why the motor is starting to purr now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having provided the stimulus, it is now important that the government ease off the pedal to get the budget deficit back in order.

The government has undertaken a program of far-reaching and dynamic reform and this has been designed to improve Australia's economic performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook, issued a statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Best and fairest</EMPHASIS>, which outlined this government's industrial relations strategy for the 1990s. That strategy was based on the belief that labour markets need to have a balance of social and economic influence. We believe that it is mutual fairness between employers and employees that makes labour markets work well. The strategy aimed to, among other things, encourage and support productivity gains through workplace bargaining and spread best practice and workplace reform. One of the means of achieving those goals was through the establishment of the best practice program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could all bring to mind examples of organisations that have excelled in their field. We generally do not appreciate that many of those organisations, which are recognised for innovation and achievement, are participants in the best practice program. I will identify a number of those organisations and I indicate that they are across all sectors of the Australian economy. Some examples are: Aerospace Technologies of Australia, Colonial Mutual, Don Smallgoods, Dulux Australia, Smorgon, Edgell-Birdseye, Kellogg, Tubemakers, Australian Resorts, Challenge Bank and Australian News Print&mdash;to name some of the best Australian companies which have been involved in the best practice program. As an internationally competitive economy we need to promote best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Best practice is simply the best way of doing things. More specifically, it refers to the cooperative way in which firms and their employees continuously improve business activities in all key areas. The best practice program was announced in March 1991 and the government committed a total of $25.6 million through 1991-92 and 1992-93. A further $10.5 million was committed for 1993-94 and 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best practice program remains an integral part of the government's micro-economic reform agenda.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the program involves business learning from business. Success and innovation are adopted and promoted as the role model for other firms to follow. The list of companies which have participated and benefited from the program and which are now helping to promote the fundamental concepts of best practice makes an impressive list of achievers&mdash;achievers who recognised the potential of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is through this approach&mdash;business demonstrating to business the real benefits of adopting new and innovative approaches to work&mdash;that we will be able to build a more competitive Australian economy with more competitive Australian enterprises.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the two rounds of the best practice program which have already been funded, 43 companies have been provided with grants to assist them in implementing reforms in all areas of their operations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enterprises which have been successful in bidding for the grants have themselves been involved in demonstration activities&mdash;seminars or forums&mdash;where they related their experiences and have helped other organisations to appreciate how best practice can be adapted for their own organisations and develop an understanding of key concepts such as continuous improvement, benchmarking, enterprise agreements and quality improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Involvement by enterprises in this program has not been entirely for altruistic reasons. In addition to helping many other enterprises, participating firms have found that they have made significant achievements and are seeing benefits, including improved productivity, improved management-employee relations, improved occupational health and safety records, developing a more highly skilled work force, greater organisational flexibility and building better partnerships with suppliers and customers. The best practice program has been a success and it has achieved international recognition. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 17 February stated that the Democrat majority leader in the US House of Representatives, Mr Dick Gephardt, is planning to introduce legislation in June to establish a program in the US emulating the Australian best practice program. The report also stated that a senior aid to Mr Gephardt plans to visit Australia to study the Australian program as part of efforts to lift US international competitiveness. The best practice program is seen as unique in the way that it combines government, union and employer support in holding up examples of best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not the only reflections on the quality and success of this government's approach to industrial relations. Dr Ray Marshall, former Secretary of Labor and member of President Clinton's Dunlop Commission, was also reported as saying that the planned Clinton shake-up of the US system may borrow heavily from Australia's industrial relations experience. This includes initiatives such as occupational health and safety councils, the training levy and the increasing emphasis on relating wages to productivity. Dr Marshall also warned that the US model is a path to a doomed `low wage, low productivity, low value added strategy'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US is looking to emulate the Australian strategy of developing a flexible work force that can adapt to industrial change and that can compete at the top of the skills markets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) recently launched the third round of best practice grants and invited interested firms to apply for funding. Of the funding committed for 1993-94 and 1994-95, $4 million will be used to fund approximately 30 small and medium enterprise projects. Applications will close on 12 April 1994. This approach of targeting a particular sector is premised on the fact that Australia's future prosperity is dependent upon the success of the small to medium sized business sector. We recognise the need to develop a genuine best practice culture, enhanced export performance and employment generation. This program is an ideal mechanism to promote business development. To ensure that the message and benefits of best practice are widely understood, the Department of Industrial Relations will hold a best practice week in various centres around Australia over the period 11 to 15 April. The theme is `Achieving success' and the events will provide business with a unique opportunity to hear industry leaders and international speakers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has dumped sections of the Fightback policy&mdash;we do not know exactly which ones&mdash;but it has not done anything about development of policy. Not only is this sad for the opposition, because of course there is no way it can win an election unless it actually develops some policies and puts those policies to the Australian people; it is sad for Australia, because the important thing is that in a healthy democracy the debate should really be on the key policy issues and on the administration of those policies to the extent that there have been some failures. But the fundamental issue has to be the debate on ideas, on directions, on visions, on policies. Unfortunately, we are not getting that from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder that today in a radio interview on the Ranald Macdonald program former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser basically described the current federal Liberal Party as not a credible alternative government. He said that it was basically full of older and superficially more experienced people but these people had a long time ago obviously abandoned the idea of policy development and were simply now looking at various forms of approach, such as personal attacks, as a way of trying to resolve the problems that this opposition has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned, as I have said in my book on social justice, that there is a very serious shortfall in this country's democracy when the opposition is not prepared to actually develop significant and substantial policies. If we contrast that with what is happening within the government, the contrast is extraordinary. Not only is there vigorous policy debate within the government; in fact, there are policy developments in a whole range of very key areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, for example, all of the employment issues that have been discussed with respect to the response to the green paper. We have the regional development issues which have been discussed in relation to the Kelty recommendations. We have the new paper industry policy. We have a whole range of initiatives in the areas of health and welfare. We have the development of policies and ideas in the areas of social justice and social development. Not only do we have initiatives in all of those very significant areas; where there are disagreements, debate is taking place in relation to them. The contrast between the current opposition's lack of ideas and the fact that these ideas ferment within the government in all these issues is extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want today to refer to some of those key government policy developments. The overarching philosophical concept which drives all these policies within the Labor government is the concept of social justice. There was a time when the Liberal Party embraced the concept of social justice. It was at the time of the formation of the party. When the party was formed by Robert Menzies in 1945, he made it clear that he was disowning the previous conservative approaches and taking a new path. What was the new path? That path accepted the existence of the welfare state as part of society. Part of that concept is the concept of social justice. I will have more to say about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Robert Menzies embraced an alternative direction for conservatives in the formation of the Liberal Party. That Menzies heritage&mdash;there is no doubt that Malcolm Fraser is right on this point&mdash;has been totally disowned and lost by many of the key people in the opposition, who, in their ideological grasp of the ideas of Thatcher, Reagan and the New Right, have abandoned one of the key platforms of the Liberal Party in its formation; that is, the idea that, in addition to a market economy, there has to be some form of social justice and social welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the political debate during the Menzies era and afterwards was really about how we run a mixed economy and how we look at developing those social justice programs. But, particularly from 1983 onwards, the conservative parties did not debate the appropriate targeting of those programs or the best way to deliver social justice but attacked the concept of social rights and social justice. We had an attack on the ideas that people are entitled to a minimum income when they are unemployed and to a reasonable standard of living when they are sick or elderly. All of those concepts were attacked by various spokespersons of the New Right, and embraced to different degrees by different people in the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has always been a group in the opposition that has dissented completely from this approach, but those people have always been kicked aside. After the opposition's election defeat, there was the development of the idea that there would be some hope. The election of Dr Wooldridge as deputy leader of the Liberal Party suggested the possibility of a move by the party towards an embracing of ideas of social justice and social concern. What have we seen? Dr Wooldridge has been pushed aside and the same old gang, the extreme Right, with its New Right philosophy, has come in and dominated the Liberal Party in its direction in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, the debate in this parliament is really within the Labor Party. An example of such a debate concerns what to do about the long-term unemployed. We have not had a single response from the opposition to the serious issues raised in the green paper. Can we believe it? The government is about to make recommendations, but where is the opposition? It has nothing to say. Yet the recommendations of the green paper&mdash;the green paper was put forward by an independent body&mdash;to the government have been widely discussed in different sections and by different individuals within the Labor Party. Nothing has come from the conservative parties. The recommendations of the green paper deal with a fundamental social justice issue, which is the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental premise of the green paper is that the long-term unemployed are going to be in difficulties even if there is economic growth and employment growth. There will be significant employment growth with the growth of the economy. But many of these people, some of whom have been unemployed for more than two years, are going to be in difficulties because a culture develops in which unemployed people lose their confidence and some of their abilities and they are not really in a position any more to participate in the work force. That is a waste of human resources on a massive scale. That issue is addressed in the green paper, which says that in addition to the policy of growth we need other recommendations and other actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the opposition said about unemployment? As far as I can see, the maximum that has come from the opposition is a suggestion that we do not need any further action and that we do not need to adopt a job compact, as recommended in the green paper, because economic growth will take care of all of our problems. That is a nonsense approach to our policy development and it is certainly a nonsense approach when we are concerned with social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking forward to the government's response to the green paper and I am looking forward to the adoption of measures within the budget. Such measures could involve a job compact or an attempt to do something for every single long-term unemployed person through labour market programs, jobs specifically tailored for them or private sector jobs which are subsidised to help those people get back into the work force. We understand that those measures are costly, but we have an obligation as a society to do something about unemployment. It is incumbent on the government, therefore, to accept the central recommendations of the green paper and put in place the jobs compact; reject the ideas being put forward by some members of the opposition that we can just let economic growth take care of every issue; and actually do something about social justice in relation to unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish I had the time to talk about the other issues of regional development and industry policy, both of which are favourite topics of mine. But I want to talk about some of the issues that I am directly concerned about, and have responsibility for, with respect to social justice matters. The most fundamental issue, which responsibility was given to me by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is the implementation of the access and equity program. This is, in a sense, a pre-eminent social justice issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have a society of cultural diversity in which we have managed to bring together many different people through a policy of multiculturalism, which I strongly support, which allows these different cultures to develop and to enrich Australia's culture. At the same time, we have not paid enough care and attention to the social and economic needs of those groups that are disadvantaged. I refer particularly to those from non-English speaking backgrounds and to Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we, as a party and as a government, are to achieve our social justice objectives, it is incumbent on us to achieve the outcomes of the access and equity policy. That policy tries to achieve a situation where every single person, irrespective of cultural, ethnic or racial background, has access to all of the services of government and has equal treatment within the structures of the community and of the society, including equal treatment within the economic structures of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the equity component, we know from the recent report by the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Irene Moss, that members of certain ethnic groups in the community are in a severely disadvantaged position. This is not a phenomenon merely of the first generation. Irene Moss makes the important point that, in the case of certain ethnic groups, the disadvantages and discrimination can carry on into the second generation and even further. She has warned that there is a danger not merely that we will have a society of the rich and the poor&mdash;because, of course, they always exist&mdash;but that we will have a division whereby at least some people of non-English speaking background will continue over the generations to be economically and socially disadvantaged. That is an unacceptable position from the point of view of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore important that access and equity not merely be words and a few programs here and there but actually be a policy that penetrates, as is intended, all of the government departments, all of the services provided by government and, through that process and through changing community attitudes, all of society. The access and equity strategy has gone through some transformations. The main focus at the moment is on ensuring much greater participation by people of non-English speaking background in all realms of society and in all structures, including government structures. That participation has to be undertaken by looking concretely at what has actually happened and saying, `Well, that is not good enough, let's do better'. Government departments have to do this. They have to look at the composition of their employees. They have to look at the targeting of their policies. They have to be able to say, `Are we actually doing enough for those people who have been either directly or indirectly discriminated against because of racial or ethnic background?'. I believe that such a strategy has to be implemented in a very serious way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated since assuming this responsibility, it is my intention to discuss these matters with the ministers of all the key portfolios in government to see whether we can set concrete goals and achieve targets in these areas. We certainly need strategies. Let me give the House one example. In the area of migrants in employment, Irene Moss points out that there are some ethnic groups where, for what appear to be cultural factors or insufficient knowledge of English, unemployment is much higher than it is for the average community or even for the average of some other ethnic groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we need a migrant employment strategy. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is adopting such a strategy. I will be working with the minister to help develop that strategy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The biggest issue that confronts Australia remains unemployment. The government must be vigilant in not allowing the recent run of positive economic indicators to result in a lessening of its political will to tackle this problem, because it would be a lost opportunity. There continues to be recognition in the community that growth alone will not be enough to deal with the problem of unemployment. For example, in December last year there were 126,000 Victorians who were defined as long-term unemployed. It has been estimated that by June 1998, with current policy settings in place and economic growth alone providing jobs, this figure could still be as high as 81,000. This figure is far too high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, unemployment does not affect all regions equally. In parts of the electorate of Scullin the problem of long-term unemployment has become endemic. For example, in the city of Whittlesea, which has over 100,000 residents, there are 8,000 unemployed people&mdash;nearly 16 per cent, and over 3,000 of these are long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the figures released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which did an analysis by region of long-term unemployment rates as of August last year, the two regions most relevant to the seat of Scullin have long-term unemployment rates over the Australia-wide rate of 3.9 per cent&mdash;north-eastern Melbourne has 5.9 per cent and north-western Melbourne has 6.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those affected it is rather trite to say that it is a tragedy. It is a tragedy for not only the individuals but the families and the wider community. Again I say in this chamber that these people look to a Labor government as the only hope for assistance. There is a considerable level of appreciation in the community of the depth of the problem and an understanding that government must take bold steps to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that reports that have appeared in the media recently suggesting that the government is considering a relatively modest package of measures financed solely by spending cuts and privatisation are alarming. The proposal for a jobs compact contained in a paper prepared by the expert committee on employment opportunities set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) involves additional expenditure in the order of $1.3 billion in 1994-95 and $2 billion in 1995-96. In my view these figures are the absolute minimum that a government should consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, however, rumour abounds that the suggestion of the proposed jobs levy to finance this additional expenditure is, if not off the table, close to the edge&mdash;to paraphrase the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). It is unfortunate that more consideration has not been given to this proposal. There has been a considerable amount of work conducted by ACOSS and others which clearly shows how an income tax surcharge could be introduced at progressive rates from zero to five per cent with adequate protection for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This levy could potentially raise between $3 billion and $4 billion per annum. There is some preparedness in the community for this. People understand why the levy is being considered. It is up to government to not lack the political will. In this context it is important to remember that Australia is a low tax country by OECD standards. In 1992 general government revenue in Australia totalled 33.3 per cent of GDP&mdash;the second lowest in the OECD. More recent figures place Australia at the bottom of the OECD tax table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the jobs levy is not to be considered, there are other options. For instance, the ACOSS submission to the committee looking into employment opportunities lists a number of options. First, it proposes the reintroduction of a national gift and inheritance tax. ACOSS points out that appropriate exemptions and arrangements can be made to meet the reasonable requirements of spouses and rural land-holders. It estimates that, over time, this tax would raise about $2 billion. Secondly, ACOSS proposes that loopholes in the capital gains tax be closed. Improving the efficiency of investment could raise about $300 billion. Thirdly, ACOSS suggests that the second round of One Nation tax cuts be abandoned, with a potential saving of $3.6 billion. Fourthly, ACOSS calls for the introduction of a wealth tax and makes the point that most OECD countries have such a tax. Fifthly, ACOSS calls for a reduction of superannuation concessions for high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter that I have raised in the past on more than one occasion and I do not mind revisiting it yet again. This government has given strong and consistent support to  private retirement incomes. As the Prime Minister has stated in the past, this is the first government since Federation to recognise the right of all Australian workers to superannuation; the first to actively support its extension to areas of the work force long left forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other points which need further consideration, including the fairness of the generous tax concessions afforded to superannuation. The flat tax rate of 15 per cent introduced in May 1988 still represents a considerable concession to wealthy taxpayers who would normally be subject to the top marginal rate of taxation on employment and investment income. I have previously quoted Rick Krever, a senior lecturer in law at Monash University. I wish to quote from some of his work which appeared in the journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impact</EMPHASIS> in July 1988, where he made some comments on the effects of the May 1988 statement. Krever had this to say about the regressive aspect of the impact of taxation expenditures:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of government subsidy has dropped, but the upside-down effect remains untouched. Compared to the tax that would normally be levied on a taxpayer's remuneration and investment income, the new tax on contributions and fund earnings represents no concession for lowest income taxpayers, a slight concession for low income taxpayers and a massive concession for high income taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only the rich continue to enjoy significant tax hand-outs from the concessions.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989, these tax concessions amounted to about $4 billion in forgone tax. In its submission, ACOSS points out that if the 15 per cent tax on employer contributions and fund earnings  could instead be levied at the marginal rate of the taxpayer, minus an annual flat rebate, around $400 million could be raised and taxation would be far more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also relevant to consider what use this enormous pool of national superannuation savings is being put to. One question which has not received sufficient public attention is the need for a requirement to invest superannuation funds in public infrastructure and other publicly useful projects. Each year superannuation assets grow by a massive sum. In 1989 it was estimated that current savings in superannuation funds were in excess of $100 billion&mdash;three times the 1982-83 level. As a result of the government's actions since 1983, it is estimated that by the year 2000 superannuation funds will receive more than $30 billion a year in new contributions, leading to a growth in assets of about $60 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) stated at the time, the political issue of the 1990s will be how as a nation we can best use this pool of national savings. The Deputy Prime Minister pointed correctly to the needs of Australian infrastructure not only for expansion of infrastructure but also for maintenance of existing infrastructure. The need was identified clearly in the main conclusions of an 1987 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which was another Langmore report, maybe more important than this week's Langmore report. The report had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no reason to believe that Australia will be immune from a build-up of rehabilitation needs of the type that has occurred in other developed nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintenance and replacement needs will substantially increase during the rest of this century due to the overall age pattern of Australian infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are still significant gaps in Australian infrastructure networks, all of which it would be desirable to fill and some of which it is essential to fill. We may have to cope with the ageing of much of our existing infrastructure before we have completed many of its networks.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar recognition of Australia's needs into the next century, although on a slightly different tack, led to a recommendation included in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia reconstructed</EMPHASIS> for the creation of the national development fund. This report suggested that savings of superannuation funds might be directed to new industrial capacity and housing. It is high time that this proposal was re-examined adding infrastructure as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was saddened to see in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday that a further suggestion that had been put on the table for use of superannuation funds&mdash;that is a proposal to force the superannuation industry to invest in smaller businesses and venture capital&mdash;might also be slipping off the table. The report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> indicates that the former Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), had this under consideration before the new Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) replaced him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this is not the case and that a worthwhile suggestion such as this can form part of the industry statement. I welcome the suggestion in the report that a further element of the proposal is still under consideration, which would be an improvement on the One Nation tax breaks that aimed to encourage superannuation funds and others to invest in small and medium sized businesses and in large infrastructure projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACOSS, in its submission, also called for the effective rate of fringe benefits tax on concessionally taxed fringe benefits to be raised and the introduction of sales tax on certain luxury items. All of these proposals at least merit further investigation. Others have suggested other ways in which revenue could be raised to fund the jobs compact and other measures without spending cuts or privatisation. There have been calls for the restoration of a 60 per cent marginal tax rate for taxpayers earning more than $75,000 and for a minimum corporate tax rate of 20 per cent. I support the earnest consideration of these propositions because it has to be stressed again and again that Australia is a low tax country by international standards. These proposals are in accordance with the basic fairness of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite and other specialist interest groups in the community will cry crocodile tears about the detrimental effect of tax rises, but in this regard I am reminded of the recent statements of the highly regarded economics professor from Harvard University, John Kenneth Galbraith. Speaking about the vexatious problem of unemployment, he commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax relief as a remedy can rightly be ruled out. Its effect on private expenditure and the broad flow of aggregate demand is at best theoretical. Those who propose tax reduction as an economic stimulus are usually concerned with advancing personal pecuniary interests.</PARA>
<PARA>Galbraith went on to argue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There remains only one effective course of public action to break out from stagnation and the unemployment equilibrium. That is peace time expenditure to do what wartime expenditure did to end the Great Depression. We may prefer an economic society where this is not necessary. Unfortunately it does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a crucial point, an inescapable reality. Earlier, I suggested that the jobs compact was the bare minimum that the government should consider in response to the problem of unemployment. Economic growth will provide jobs for many unemployed people, but the most disadvantaged job seekers&mdash;the young, mature aged, those from non-English speaking backgrounds and those with disabilities&mdash;will miss out if we rely on growth alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in my speech I quoted from the paper put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which analysed long-term unemployment. In considering this issue, I heartily endorse the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who spoke before me. The paper put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics had this to say about long-term unemployment trends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last ten years, migrants from Non-English Speaking Background Countries have consistently had the highest long-term unemployment rates, while migrants from Main English Speaking Background Countries generally experienced similar long-term unemployment rates to people born in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are to appropriately address the present problems of unemployed people, especially long-term unemployed people, we must address the special needs of those people from non-English speaking backgrounds. In the process that has been currently undertaken to try to realistically have a look at the way in which employment can be created, we should take a realistic reassessment of what we mean by the nature of work. It may well be that for some people the traditional concept of a full-time job is no longer appropriate or possible. Our social security system is based around these traditional notions and, as such, it is very inflexible when dealing with part-time work, voluntary work and other forms of endeavour. Government must also reconsider the sort of employment undertaken by the public sector, taking proper account of its social usefulness as well as its economic costs and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr John Quiggin, fellow in the centre for economic policy and research at the ANU, has recently pointed out that the best way to solve unemployment is to hire people. Quiggin's analysis is based on the premise that the fundamental cause of unemployment is the decline in the demand for labour, primarily in the health and education sectors. In other words, the publicly financed community services sector has not continued the postwar expansion, thereby compensating for the contraction of employment in older sectors such as manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quiggin argues for the expansion of community and public service employment to 25 per cent of the labour force. This would entail the creation of about 350,000 new jobs. Quiggin points out that such an approach is in keeping with the ethos enshrined in the 1945 white paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Full employment for Australia</EMPHASIS>, which recognised the importance of the social wage. It is perhaps relevant to again look at that white paper and make the following observation about what it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, a significant contribution to living standards has been made in the past, and will continue to be made, by a higher level of social services. Some of these are in the form of direct money payments, such as invalid and old age pensions, child endowment and widow's pensions. Others are services provided directly by government authorities, including education, health and medical services, kindergartens and libraries.</PARA>
<PARA>Whose electorate could not see an improvement in these facilities? It would be unfortunate if the opportunity to do this was lost because of an attachment to arbitrary targets, such as the deficit as a percentage of GDP by a fixed date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government and community must recognise that the private sector has repeatedly failed this country at times of crisis. At the moment, the conditions for the private sector could hardly be better. There is record low inflation, low interest rates, a 33 per cent corporate tax rate, record industrial peace and extended wage restraint. This government has done more than any government in the nation's history, certainly more than the Liberals could ever achieve, to create a climate conducive to investment and growth, yet unemployment remains unacceptably high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a considerable amount of debate about what ought to constitute an appropriate level of migration as we emerge from the recession. The economic debate gives cogent cases both for and against. I urge the government to look at this in the context of an appropriate population policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, in his 1979 Boyer Lecture Bob Hawke spoke perceptively and persuasively about the importance of full employment in postwar Australia. Full employment was the cement that bound our society together and enabled us to face the challenges of a changing world and to some extent nurture a degree of compassion for the less privileged amongst us. That cement is crumbling and as it crumbles we can discern the beginnings of fracture in our society. Indeed, it is not difficult to perceive the emergence of two societies&mdash;the employed and the unemployed. We must ensure that we avoid that becoming a reality. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But things are changing. Some of the recent revelations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hite Report on the Family</EMPHASIS> will show us why. Shere Hite has been studying human nature and, in particular, our sexuality for many years. Her latest report investigates the often secret life of the family and, in particular, children of the family. The report was based on more than 3,000 responses from the US, Britain, Germany and other nations to questionnaires about childhood, sexual development and parent-child relationships. Its revelations for many, including me, are in a sense an affirmation of what we subconsciously already knew and often a heart-rending recognition of ourselves and our parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hite concludes that what we have thought of as the Western nuclear family, the hierarchical male dominated family, is an entity not worth preserving if our children are to develop a healthy self-image and be able to enter into mature adult relationships. Hite says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The golden age family bliss exists more in people's imaginations than in their experience. The current slogan "preservation of family values" really means not preservation of love in the family but preservation of the hierarchical family.</PARA>
<PARA>Some of her findings may surprise those who firmly believe in this kind of family. She found that 79 per cent of boys from two-parent families said that their fathers behaved as if they were superior to their mothers; 81 per cent of men who grew up with just their mothers found it easy to form good relationships with women later, as opposed to 40 per cent of men from two-parent families; less than 24 per cent of boys said that their father was affectionate towards them; children in two-parent families are often torn by a loyalty crisis between their father and their mother; and boys reaching puberty are taught both that women are objects of desire yet objects of contempt, leading to a love-hate relationship with women in later life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her findings on the way in which boys and girls were brought up are certainly no surprise to me, as they exactly reflect my own experience. She found that women were feminised from an early age and discouraged from expressing anger or independence of any kind. Sexuality was to be repressed at all costs and their developing maturity, including menstruation and the personal discovery of their own bodies, was considered a shameful thing and to be hidden from the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many children in the era in which I was growing up experienced just the kinds of things which are described by Ms Hite. Learning about sexuality, about the essential facts of life, was something which was simply not discussed. The onset of menstruation can be very traumatic for young girls and without a supportive and informed mother it can be even more difficult. It should be a cause for celebration. Likewise, developing early relationships is also fraught with problems, especially when the only instruction we have is to `Be careful', `Don't do it', `Be a good girl' and `Don't be home late'. On reflection, I am often amused at the thought that nothing naughty could happen before midnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Boys, on the other hand, were taught to be manly, not to cry, not to express emotion of any kind and, in fact, to express cruelty in order to reinforce their manhood. How many cats have been skinned in this cause? How many times have we heard expressions such as, `Act like a man', `Don't be a sissy', and, `We'll knock him into shape'. Youths were taught that if they associated with girls they were considered to be sissies. Girls were not for friendship but for sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as girls were conditioned to be wives, homemakers and mothers, boys were also conditioned to be providers. Girls were taught to have no greater ambition than that of a homemaker, while the pressure put on boys to be strong and to achieve must have been equally traumatic. Because of the difference in emphasis on the upbringing of girls and boys, their attitudes towards each other were often incomprehensible. I remember growing up thinking that boys, and eventually men, were superior. I never questioned this assumption. It therefore came as a great shock to me to meet a strong woman and an inadequate man. I felt embarrassment. However, once we learn to accept that we are all human beings with frailties, talents and skills of our own, it should make no difference whether we are male or female. We are who we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This so-called normal family was based on patriarchy&mdash;the superiority of the male who projected his authority onto wife and children. Their response was that of fear and blind obedience. Perhaps my experience of blind obedience was made doubly important because my father was a naval officer. Along with long periods of not having him around were those still horrifying experiences of a person coming into the house and trying to change the way things operated by stamping his mark on the household. I was terrified of my father in those days and now mourn the loss of a relationship which should have been close and affectionate. I also feel sad that he was a person who was conditioned to be the dominant one in the household and had to re-establish this dominance each time he came home from sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying these things I am not attaching any blame to either the dominant father or the submissive mother in these families. They were repeating what they had been taught by their own parents. It is only during the last 20 years or so that the cycle has been broken. In our democratic society we would not tolerate such a framework in any community organisation, but we have tolerated it in the family for many hundreds of years. We have looked on such families which produced manly boys and submissive feminine girls and thought they were normal. In fact, they were repressed&mdash;we were repressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moulding of the children under this kind of authoritarian upbringing has not allowed the development of the true self&mdash;the self-image which allows us to be who we are as individuals. For many of us, breaking out of this mould has been a long and arduous journey. It has often been heartbreaking and traumatic. It has resulted in emotional instability and the inability to truly form mature relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many of my generation, this resulted in unstable marriages, conflict, marriage break-ups and, for some of us,  avoidance of commitment. We may have grown up as good children, being obedient to our parents and always doing as we were told. It may be seen as good that our children are seen as ideal when they cause no problems and are constantly obedient. However, I suggest&mdash;as Hite also indicates&mdash;that, for those of us in this situation, the obedient exterior was hiding a rebellious individual trying to break out. This often resulted in immature and inappropriate behaviour in dealing with such things as alcohol and sex. That obedient good little girl often raises her head in my life, and I have to push her back to where she belongs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without the freedom to develop our own independent thought patterns, which will often bring conflict between parent and child, we are not able to develop that true self. All we do in that case is to accept blindly the guilt, fear and discipline which is imposed by another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that there is no ideal family and, in fact, that an ideal family is one which can admit to its children that it has made mistakes. This is surely a better role model for children than those who observe the so-called perfect parent who never makes mistakes or at least never admits to them. Trying to emulate the perfect parent can be a recipe for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the findings of the Hite report, which is also borne out by my experience, is that signs of physical affection in the family have often been rare. It has been seen as inappropriate at times for fathers in particular to hug their children. I am sure this was even more so in the case of fathers and sons. I can never remember my father touching me  at all, not even as much as a pat on the head. Hite draws attention to this lack of physical contact in the young and notes that this often results in subconscious seeking of physical affection in inappropriate places and in inappropriate ways. John Bradshaw, an American expert on personal development and the family, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You know what molesters tell us? That they go to playgrounds and look for the most obedient children.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have enormous things we have to learn about families . . . So much to learn about those good looking families where somebody has all the power. It's important to understand that these are not democratic families. Patriarchy ignores all the emotions except fear.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not surprising that many parents who feel that power is important would fear allowing their children to express their emotions and to at times disagree with their parents. This is the kind of democracy which develops balanced adults at the risk of some conflict in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last 20 years or so women have begun to break out of the mould. They have learned to be proud of the fact that they are women; that they can be themselves without the power behaviour. The so-called liberation of women has caused a great deal of trauma, as any change does. But in this change there is also great hope for men, because it gives them the chance to be who they are, to get off the power trip, to abandon the need to be patriarchs, and to allow their true emotions to be expressed without condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The women who have grown up in the last 20 years have had the opportunity of seeing their mothers as role models, as women who have been able to think for themselves, to have an independent career as well as to raise a family, and to pass on feminine wisdom to their daughters. Prior to that time young women grew up with a feeling of disappointment that their mothers did not pursue their own self-identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was growing up I received conflicting messages from my mother. All my upbringing was geared towards that of a homemaker and mother. However, the verbal message was, `Don't waste your time with marriage. You'll only be unhappy like me'. It was not until much later in life, long after the death of my father and when all the children had left home, that I realised what my mother's real interests were. She was never given the space to express these during her marriage when her prime interest was bringing up children. The thought of such an unfulfilled life I find very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as women in my era looked for role models from their mothers and were left wanting, so boys looked to their fathers as role models. The father projecting the patriarchal model would certainly have stamped this on his son. Heaven help the poor boy who was not able to live up to this macho image. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whether we like it or not the shape of the family, if not its composition, has been changing over the years and, I would suggest, changing for the better. Children may well be, on balance, better off with two parents. But this is not always necessarily the case.

Does he believe it gives rise to any relevant public policy concerns of any kind? What are the peculiarities of the international aluminium market which have required this course of action by suppliers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, which I think goes to the very core of one of Australia's most important industries. As most people would be aware, there is a very large oversupply of aluminium in the world market. This has caused an enormous collapse in the world price. This has been brought about by a unique circumstance, and one which we all should be very grateful for&mdash;as you should be&mdash;and that is the collapse of the former Soviet Union. In the Commonwealth of Independent States, there is now no need for aluminium for the previous war machine. That has led to a huge surplus in aluminium supplies now coming into world markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a number of meetings around the world&mdash;in Moscow, Washington and Brussels; I think one is to be held this week in Canada&mdash;as a result of which the industry itself has decided that it will restrict the amount of production. There is no complicity of government in this. It is not a government decision. There is no unilateral decision or bilateral decision between governments. It is a decision the industry has made which has brought about a rise in the aluminium price by some considerable amount since the start of this year. I think it is one with which we should be quite pleased, in view of the very important role that aluminium plays in this economy. A number of Australian aluminium smelters have announced reductions in production. Hopefully that will have a minimum effect on employment in that industry. In the longer term, this is not a bad thing for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the world's largest exporter of alumina and bauxite. As the former Soviet Union's industry grows, we will be in a position to provide&mdash;through Vladivostok and other ports, into the Siberian section of the former Soviet Union, which is the most modern&mdash;high-quality feed stock for its industry. As the Russian economy picks up and the domestic demand for aluminium comes up, there will be increased demand for our feed stock and increased demand for our alumina. We are about the third largest world exporter of aluminium. This is a very important industry for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish the right honourable member for New England would say something different from `make a statement'; he sounds likes a broken record. The question asked me to comment on the fiscal framework paper which we released today. Perhaps I should explain to the House exactly what this paper is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This paper is somewhat unique in budget formulation in the history of the nation. We have embarked on a more open budget preparation process this year than has ever been the case before. My predecessor, as Treasurer, after the events following the last budget, believed that it was appropriate for us to have discussions with minor parties in the Senate about their concerns about the budget prior to the budget rather than subsequently. In a formal document with those minor parties, the government agreed to a process of involvement by them in the budget preparation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first step in that budget preparation involvement for them was agreement to the fiscal framework. This sets out the budget strategy. Once there is agreement by the minor parties to it, they can be involved in further discussions, put up items for consideration, have discussions with portfolio ministers, perhaps have some costings done by the government on the more important ones and, finally, have some discussions with ERC ministers. The government's own caucus will be involved in a similar process with the ministry. So we do have a unique and open process this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should very briefly indicate what is contained in the fiscal framework paper. In essence, it sets out the government's central objective, which is to restore and enhance economic recovery so as to maximise growth in employment and living standards. It also recognises the government's obligation to ensure that economic recovery flows through, as far as it can, to all groups in the community, especially the long-term unemployed, and to ensure that we minimise regional disparities in economic prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see an obligation in those areas. We have a number of reports on those areas. The government will give its response to those reports in formulating this year's budget. So those areas, along with industry policy and some further initiatives in relation to native title, represent the priority areas for the government in this year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper then goes on to discuss the state of the economy. It picks up the revised forecasts that we have made available to the House in recent times for this financial year. It also indicates a growth of around four per cent for 1994-95. It indicates that we also expect that employment will be growing at about 2 1/2 per cent in 1994-95, which will certainly enable us to make some headway against unemployment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper then sets out the medium-term fiscal strategy, which is to reduce the budget deficit from the 3 1/2 per cent of GDP estimate for this year to around one per cent by 1996-97. This is a reasonably challenging task. It is certainly more challenging than the tasks which a number of other governments around the world have set themselves. But we stress our adherence to that objective and spell out the reasons for it, which are, in essence, to promote growth, to promote national savings and to keep government debt relatively low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then discuss the short-term fiscal outlook for this year, and those numbers have been given to the House. The figures show essentially a 3 1/2 per cent of GDP deficit for this year, but they indicate that the boost to revenue is unlikely to flow through to 1994-95 in a way which enhances our capacity to do more in that year than we had previously expected, because of lower inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper then looks at the budget's fiscal framework being quite tight in those circumstances. We need to have a credible reduction in the deficit in terms of the medium-term objective, and we need to provide for initiatives in our key priority areas. We indicate that the jobs levy is around but the government's preference is not to implement it. There is little room for expenditure outside priority areas and there is a need for some reordering of expenditure priorities to make room for the priority areas. We also indicate that the precise level of the deficit will be determined by the government as it moves towards the finalisation of that deficit. The starting point for the deficit is estimated at this time to be a little under 3 per cent of GDP. This is a unique document.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is again directed to the Minister for Resources. I refer to the march on parliament today by 1,200 coalminers to protest recent cuts in coking coal prices. I ask the minister: does the coal export sector need to achieve productivity gains equivalent to $10 per tonne to remain competitive and to hold its labour force? Does the minister agree that a more flexible labour system would help achieve this goal? Given this, will the minister now finally signal the government's intention to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member once more for his question. As he knows, the Coal Industry Tribunal is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations. On the broader issue of the strike that is taking place in the demonstration today, whilst I do not think it is the most appropriate action in the circumstances, I understand the frustration felt by the coal industry workers. They have seen a large amount of productivity gain over recent years. They have seen huge changes to work practices: a seven day week, three shifts a day, 365 days a year. It is a very efficient industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the world's great supplier of coal but we are not the only supplier, as the honourable member would know. We have 30 per cent of world trade in coal, and that amount does not make us a dominant player. The frustration we felt in recent times has been over the coking coal price but, as I said in the House last week in relation to a question from the honourable member for Hunter, coking coal is a commodity that is in decline. There is less coking coal required, particularly in Japan due to its recession and particularly due to the decline in its steel industry. Unlike the Australian steel industry, the Japanese steel industry has not been through restructuring. We are now negotiating prices on steaming coal with the Japanese, and the fact that steaming coal is going to be increasingly in shorter supply is to our benefit. There is going to be a huge demand.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I am aware of the ABS report. In fact, it came out on the same day as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked a question about its contents last week. Interestingly, he did not refer to that report. Nevertheless, he asked me why it was that Australia's long-term unemployment rate is higher than Canada's whilst the unemployment rate of the two countries is similar. I stand by the answer I gave last week to that question which went to issues of structural adjustment and the significant job growth that has occurred in the Australian economy&mdash;a job growth, I might add, that is 50 per cent higher than that of Canada.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go to the conclusions in the report, because I think that what the deputy leader has had to say to this House is quite misleading and dishonest. On page 53 of the report, having stated that the long-term unemployment problem is not unique to Australia, it goes on to conclude that there is a tendency for those countries with higher unemployment to actually have higher incidences of long-term unemployment and vice versa, with the exception of Canada. The report then goes on to say that Australia's high unemployment rate and its incidence of long-term unemployment was slightly lower than might have been expected given this high unemployment rate. In other words, Canada is not the benchmark but, quite frankly, an exception.</PARA>

It was misleading because the report concludes that Australia in terms of its long-term unemployed is doing better than the UK, Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. It is true that we are doing better, but we are still not doing well enough. That is why the government's attention through the white paper response is directed to ensuring that we sustain high levels of economic growth and, at the same time, target the long-term unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see the real reason the deputy leader wants to draw an analogy between Canada and the Australian situation when we look at the facts associated with the Canadian position. Whilst the government of this country supports and provides a fair and equitable universal income support regime for the unemployed, Canada provides unemployment insurance which runs out after 50 weeks. Remember the coalition policy in the last election: cutting people off the dole after they reach a certain time&mdash;in its case after nine months.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason for the interest of the honourable member for Chisholm in Canada is that those opposite want to cut people off income support regardless of the state of the labour market; they want to slash spending on labour market programs; they want to force people into low paid jobs; and they want to absolve themselves from solving the problem of the long-term unemployed by believing that economic growth alone will sort that out.

In fact, the Trade Practices Commission has estimated that by reducing conveyancing fees by $100, the consumers of Australia would save about $80 million a year. Of course, solicitors are not alone. In Western Australia legislation requires that all architects' advertising be approved by the architects board, and in South Australia regulations prohibit architects from working for inadequate fees and from putting forward design proposals without payment.

But we say that, where restrictions to entry are imposed by associations rather than by governments, they should be open to public scrutiny. The onus should be on the professional associations to justify why they should be able to engage in anti-competitive behaviour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to some of the findings in the discussion paper on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. They are very important. I would urge members of the opposition in particular to pay some attention. The figures concerning preschool education, for example, indicate that, while the gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and other Australian four-year-olds has almost halved, there is nevertheless a significant gap of almost 10 per cent in participation at that level. The research also shows that a high proportion, over 13 per cent, of five-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are not participating in any form of education at all. These are mainly kids living in remote Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the junior secondary level, while most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children complete a full primary school education, at the junior secondary level significant numbers of these children do not complete the compulsory years 8 and 9. In fact, an estimated 25 per cent or more of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids leave secondary school before the end of year 10, which is the normal minimum leaving year. Senior secondary participation similarly reveals a gap. Participation across the whole of Australia last year to year 12, retention to year 12, was 77 per cent, but for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids it was only 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, these figures reveal startling gaps in attainment. If we do not address these specific education needs, frankly, we cannot say that Australia is a country where social justice rules. We admit that fixing these crucial problems that have been outlined in the discussion paper will certainly take time. One does not solve the educational impact of two centuries of cultural dispossession overnight nor does one solve it with top down solutions which might look good on paper but which are not based on what Aboriginal and Islander communities recognise as their own educational wants and needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I express the hope that the opposition and the various state and territory governments recognise this and that they join with the Commonwealth in treating this as the bipartisan issue of national importance it most assuredly is.</PARA>

The auditor's concerns do not go to the issue of the use of credit cards, which I think the Auditor-General assumes is a very sensible way for government to conduct business. One of the reasons why credit cards were introduced was to ensure rapid payment for small items for people with whom the government deals. It has obviated a huge number of criticisms that have come to government over the years for being a slow payer. I do not think the Auditor-General had a major problem with the system at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When some of his complaints were examined, part of the problem seemed to be that the way in which the credit cards were registered went not so much to items purchased but to the organisations, shops or whatever that the items were purchased from. For example, what seemed like a most unusual purchase by, say, a Defence official at a gift shop turned out to be the acquisition of goggles for the military for exercise purposes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister yesterday referred to a string of very successful outcomes at the COAG meeting in Hobart last Friday. One of them was the agreement by the states to an Asian language development program. Essentially COAG, the heads of government, has agreed to endorse the development of a plan that will see the teaching of Asian languages and cultures in primary schools. The decision came as a consequence of a report that COAG commissioned and, in particular, a concern that high school students studying a second language over recent decades had declined pretty significantly. This plan builds on the importance of developing second languages and, at the same time, gives particular focus to those within the Asian region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the focus is on Asia, the Commonwealth had two concerns about the recommendations that came forward. One was that, in the development of any program, it did not direct away from the European and other community languages, and that is the understanding by which we will continue to develop this plan. In other words, it will not take away from those other languages. Secondly, the Commonwealth had a concern at the mandating of the four specific Asian languages but, in discussions with the states, it has been recognised that that decision is essentially a matter for the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision sits comfortably with the government's commitment to APEC and to better relations with Asia. In addition, it strengthens our longstanding commitment to multiculturalism.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This first annual report on the Commonwealth government's response to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is about accountability. It is about ensuring that implementation of the commitments made can be subject to detailed scrutiny by parliament, by the Australian people and, in particular, by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It is about making government decisions transparent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why this report is so detailed. It ensures that the national government meets its responsibilities to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to the wider Australian and international community and to the media for implementing commitments made in response to the royal commission. This is itself in line with the royal commission. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first recommendation of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was aimed at ensuring clear public commitments by governments to respond to the recommendations, report on their implementation, and ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations were consulted and directly involved in the implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response of the Commonwealth to recommendation 1 went significantly beyond the terms of the recommendation to establish a detailed accountability regime of which this report forms a part. The Commonwealth government's response to the royal commission supported 338 of its 339 recommendations, open accountability for action taken on those commitments, and a central role for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and community organisations in the implementation processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all else it must be remembered that the royal commission report was a national commission of inquiry which enjoyed the support of the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments&mdash;and, ultimately, the federal coalition. It should be stressed that almost two-thirds of its recommendations are directed to issues of criminal justice reform and of reforms of police, prison and coronial practice which are under the exclusive jurisdiction of state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This annual report for 1992-93 is a whole-of-government report, which means that relevant Commonwealth ministers have endorsed those sections of the report falling within their ministerial responsibility. All state and territory governments have committed themselves to an equivalent form of open and detailed reporting on the action they have taken to implement the royal commission recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several central issues must be understood by commentators on and critics of the royal commission.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the royal commission found that the reason for the 99 Aboriginal deaths in custody between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989 was not a disproportionate rate of death compared with the wider custodial population. What is overwhelmingly different is the rate at which Aboriginal people come into custody compared with the rate of the general community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, criminal justice, police, prison and coronial reform were the responsibility of all states and territories, and specific action should be taken by those jurisdictions to effect reforms. Third, while such reforms are critically important in reducing the tragically high arrest rate for Aboriginal people, the root cause of the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal imprisonment was the extremely disadvantaged position on every socioeconomic measure in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, this disadvantage can be effectively addressed only if the Commonwealth and state and territory governments allocate their resources equitably. This means that mainstream programs in all jurisdictions must aim to deliver social justice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. ATSIC's specialist programs must be seen as supplementary&mdash;on their own they can never adequately redress the extreme disadvantages experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Action by our nation to address these broader issues is therefore essential to achieving sustained change in the rates of imprisonment and deaths in custody of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report on the first year of a coordinated Commonwealth effort by 24 departments and agencies focuses on the first stages of an implementation effort. Where relevant, in each section of the report, information is provided on the relevant Commonwealth government department responsible for the implementation of the specific royal commission recommendation in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day the Commonwealth announced stage one of its response to the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), and I announced the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. We said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a part of the process of reconciliation the Federal Parliament had given unanimous cross-party support to a commitment that the Commonwealth would work with State and Territory Governments to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations as a national objective leading to the centenary of Federation in 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By providing the State of the Nation Report on Aboriginal social justice the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be acting as a watchdog over the nation in its achievement of that Aboriginal social justice objective.</PARA>
<PARA>We also agreed that the monitoring mechanism for the implementation of agreed recommendations of the royal commission will be of crucial importance in the preparation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the Nation Report</EMPHASIS> and would be supplemented by information collected by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under its legislative powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that, in his first report, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, while not assuming the prime monitoring function, has acknowledged the appropriateness of his reporting on particular recommendations. It should be emphasised that the powers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner are extensive and include powers in relation to state and territory governments as well as the Commonwealth government. I also welcome the announcement by the commissioner in his report that it may well be appropriate for him to consider the adequacy of the monitoring process itself. The government would welcome any constructive ideas for enhanced scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been a deep personal commitment of mine that the royal commission report would not be allowed to gather dust on the shelf. However, it must not just be left to governments to give effect to the royal commission commitments. If the media and the wider Australian community really believe in the importance of the process of reconciliation and see indigenous social justice as a national priority, they must play their parts, both in acting on the royal commission recommendations and in ensuring that all governments honour their commitments arising from the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament, too, must play a crucial role in following through the royal commission recommendations. In accordance with the government's response to recommendation 1 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, after the statement by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), and with his leave, I will be moving a motion to refer this report to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I congratulate the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) on making his statement. It is a rare event for ministers of this government to come in this chamber and make statements these days. I am particularly pleased that he has done so, because it is a serious topic and one which I will certainly treat seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement, the minister referred to the issues of accountability, detailed scrutiny by the parliament and government decisions being transparent. Obviously, we welcome those sentiments. He raised several central issues. I want to very briefly comment on some of them. Firstly, he said that the rate at which Aboriginal people come into custody compared with the rate of the general community is much higher. We would all accept that that has to do with the disadvantage of the Aboriginal community generally, the cultural clash and, in many cases, outright racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the minister mentioned that criminal justice, police, prison and other reforms are often the responsibilities of states and territories. I have to say from my own observations when travelling around the country that I do see some signs of change, but clearly we have a long way to go. Thirdly, the minister said that, whilst those sorts of reforms are important, clearly the root cause of the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal imprisonment is the extremely disadvantaged position of our indigenous people. There is no question that that goes to the very core of the problem. Health, housing, education and employment are very real and tangible issues which we as a country have to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the minister said that mainstream programs in all jurisdictions must aim to deliver social justice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and that ATSIC's specialist programs are only supplementary to those mainstream programs. I certainly support that statement. However, it has sometimes been disappointing that there seems to be a different view within the government as to where those programs should be delivered, which minister should claim jurisdiction&mdash;this minister or the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson)&mdash;and whether they are to be in the social justice package that is to come or not. The government needs to have a much more coordinated approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to record my disappointment when, early this morning while I was present in the chamber, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) launched a very extreme attack on the Northern Territory government about these issues, quite clearly with the lead-up to the Northern Territory elections in mind. That does not do any of the issues concerned any good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister referred to the appointment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, who is to report and act as a watchdog. I certainly hope that he does that. I have certainly heard him say within the last few days that he feels he is underresourced. I am not so sure that that is the case. He needs to make sure that he acts as a watchdog and reports rather than perhaps tries to become a player in some of the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome certainly the minister's commitment to make sure that this report does not gather dust on the shelf. He has my support in that respect. I also support his comments about the relevance of the media and the wider Australian community becoming involved in resolving a number of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst obviously we welcome the drop in the number of deaths in custody, we have to issue caution about the low numbers of the sample. It would be premature for the government to congratulate itself just yet. For example, in 1990-91 there were eight deaths in custody; in 1991-92 there were 10; and in 1992-93 there were six. That is obviously a drop, but it is on a very small sample. Unquestionably, a good sign is that no deaths in police lockups were reported&mdash;the deaths were in other forms of custody. Nevertheless, it is very early days to get too carried away. There has been no change in the numbers of Aboriginal people in custody. Effectively, the number now in custody is the same as it was at the time of the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that, whilst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up only 1.2 per cent of the adult population of this country, they form 14.1 per cent of the prison population. Aboriginal people are still 26 times more likely to be taken into custody than the broader population. It seems to me, therefore, that those figures still very much have to be addressed; they are clearly totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I recognise from the minister's statement and the report he has tabled that it takes time to set up the mechanisms to address these issues and the wide-ranging matters of serious disadvantage, which the commission identified as the root cause of this high rate of Aboriginal imprisonment, I am disappointed that he has made some public comments criticising the states. It seems to me that, if it takes the federal government time to set up the mechanism, the states obviously also need that sort of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear Mr Wootten, the commissioner, on the radio saying that lip-service and bureaucratic activity seem to have characterised some of the response to the report. He was asking when will we get some results. He said that nothing has changed in terms of the numbers imprisoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wootten also made a point&mdash;I certainly caution the minister for the future&mdash;about the need for our taking responsibility for dealing with these issues at the federal level rather than blaming the states. Quite clearly, as a result of the 1967 referendum, the Commonwealth has prime responsibility for matters to do with our indigenous population. It is not sufficient to wash our hands and say, `It is up to the states; matters of health, housing and education are in the state jurisdiction'. The federal government did not do that in Mabo with land management. I am not suggesting that it takes over the bureaucracy of health, housing and all the rest of it, but clearly the federal government has prime responsibility. It is up to the government to take a lead. It cannot say, `Those are states matters', and blame the states if nothing happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is spending $400 million over five years&mdash;quite rightly, in my view&mdash;to try to get on top of some of these issues. But it is no good putting that amount of money towards this issue unless mechanisms are in place, both federally and with the states, to make sure that that money will be spent effectively. Therefore, it is important that the Commonwealth government redoubles its efforts in getting the states and itself well organised to make sure that next year when the report comes to the parliament we are not talking about setting up mechanisms or problems between the government and the states but we are able to report to this parliament some very real and tangible progress and improvement in the most disadvantaged part of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in Tasmania yesterday and spoke to the police superintendent there, and I was in New South Wales a couple of weeks ago. I heard in both Tasmania and New South Wales many reports about improvements in the system. There are some tangible results and improvements. I hope, as the years go by, they will be reflected in the numbers. It is important to remember that we also need to attack these issues on the ground. Finally, I agree most strongly that it is appropriate the report be referred for detailed scrutiny to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I support the minister in that move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I took my place in this House last March and listened to some of the early debates by government members committed to a centralist agenda I felt a deepening disquiet. The disquiet has not diminished as I have taken part in the work of this parliament and its committees. In fact, I reflected on this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial on the removal of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) from the ministry and the defence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of his ex-minister. The editorial said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . left unanswered the crucial question of what standards he expects of ministers. That will be a lingering problem for the Government because it is increasingly clear that Mr Keating's imperious style is at odds with the wishes of most Australians. . . . Mr Keating has signalled that shabby administration and unacceptable behaviour is all right as long as ministers can tough it out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That will not wash with taxpayers fed up with the way money has been squandered at the whim of some self-seeking politicians.</PARA>
<PARA>His support of ex-Premier Carmen Lawrence fits well into this category as she is someone who can tough it out and who is self-seeking. It is not unfair to suggest that a person who a few weeks ago indignantly affirmed her intention to remain as opposition leader in Western Australia, even describing the media reports as `Liberal mischief making' and who is now packing her bags for Canberra, may be equally inconsistent when it comes to taking a Western Australian perspective. It escaped her notice last year that the question of land title and land management is a basic constitutional responsibility of the elected government of Western Australia. Clearly, it is a responsibility that, unlike the Premier of Queensland, Dr Lawrence was very keen to abrogate. She fell back on centralist rhetoric in stating, `I want to see national solutions'&mdash;the time-honoured euphemism for centralising power in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She described the cynical, inconsistent political deals done by this government in preparing its Native Title Bill as proper consultation. She had the gall to describe this weaving, backtracking government as consistent in its goal to come to terms with Mabo and provide economic certainty. Certainty is the last thing that the Native Title Act will give to the people of Western Australia. She was correct, however, in acknowledging that in respect of unrelenting centralism the Keating Labor government is indeed consistent. In staking her claim to a federal cabinet position, Dr Lawrence fell back to a declaration that she was an Australian first and a Western Australian second. As a federalist, I do not believe that it is a question of crude priorities as glibly expressed by Dr Lawrence. Recourse to this rhetoric is meaningless and shallow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are good Australians because we are good Western Australians who know that national interest will never be served by damaging our local economy through centralised decision making. It is time to explode the pretence of this centralist Prime Minister and his government that they are concerned for the proper representation in Canberra of the vast, wealth-producing state of Western Australia. The people of my state are being subjected to a massive confidence trick, being told that once their defeated ex-premier takes her place in the Keating ministry their interests will be protected. The evidence is otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Prime Minister is a committed centralist who undermined his predecessor by sabotaging Bob Hawke's tentative moves toward a so-called new federalism. The Prime Minister has placed on record his contemptuous description of the federal Senate that gives honest and equal representation to the smaller states as `unrepresentative swill'. That all Australians should begin to experience some disquiet at the persistence of an imperialist Prime Minister to blatantly continue his grab for more power was highlighted by an article written by the Clerk of the Australian Senate, Harry Evans. The article titled `Putting Constitutionalism Back in the Constitution' should make the alarm bells ring for all Australians. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a particular need to articulate the case for constitutionalism in relation to the concentration of power within the structure of the central government. For 200 years or so the greatest political philosophers warned that it was dangerous to allow the executive and legislative powers to be exercised solely by one person or one body, and that this was the short road to tyranny. Now that we have allowed exactly that situation to develop, we may well ask whether we know better than the philosophers and whether they were deluded after all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the current state of our system of government vindicates the old sages and manifests the very dangers they foresaw. It is now accepted in Australian parliamentary politics that the government will use its parliamentary majority in a lower House to suppress any effective scrutiny or control of its activities by the legislature. Yet the text books continue to tell us that scrutiny and control of the executive is one of the prime functions of parliament, certainly its classic rationale under the theory of responsible government.</PARA>
<PARA>Harry Evans is in good company when he expresses his concern about the possible tyranny that comes from central powers. As  a leading dissident under a communist regime, and now the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel saw his country oppressed by totalitarianism. In his address to the Congress of the United States he warned that people are manipulated, not always by brutal methods but often by professional apparatuses that release citizens from all forms of concrete and personal responsibility. In his inaugural speech when he became the President of the Czech Republic, Havel said we should teach ourselves and others that politics should be an expression of a desire to contribute to the happiness of the community rather than the need to cheat or rape the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate satisfaction of the release of citizens from taking personal responsibility is soon replaced by the high cost of concentrated power in the hands of few. The states are constantly fighting to retain control of what constitutionally has been assigned to them, and all Australians, in particular all state premiers, should support the wisdom of our forefathers and guard their democratic rights assiduously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor premiers and, on occasion, federal Labor ministers proclaim that they are giving our state a good deal if they secure a few extra dollars. The interests of Western Australia in a viable federal system are not that simple and I suspect the same applies to every other state in this country. We need not only a fair share of revenue but the right to elect our own state governments to make their own decisions in the areas within their constitutional responsibility. What we had been getting after a decade of Labor rule at both state and federal level was a quiet, deadly erosion of these rights, as the proportion of federal revenue received by Western Australia in tied grants has increased from 40 per cent to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact of life that the greater the proportion of tied grants, the more the federal civil servants are employed second-guessing their state counterparts and the less decision making remains at state level. Western Australians might ask just what Dr Lawrence did to try to check this process, the result of many cosy agreements at ministerial and administrative levels that slowly build up a wasteful, interfering extension of federal bureaucracy into matters of state responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where the federalist credentials of Labor premiers can so often be found wanting, despite their occasional bursts of federalist rhetoric. Even this government's talent for misrepresenting the facts could never pretend that the out-going member for Fremantle upheld the interests of Western Australia in cabinet. Few people have more clearly fitted the role of Canberra's emissary to the west, rather the converse. Now we are told that his successor is a good federalist who will somehow put things right. Dr Lawrence showed a total lack of consistency in her championing of the Western Australian Inc. royal commission after she had strenuously denied the need for such an investigation for most of her first year as premier, in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that this Prime Minister is no born-again federalist. Rather, he is looking for a talented, reactive politician who can assure the people in the west that they live in the best of all possible worlds and that they are getting a fair deal. Carmen Lawrence's credentials indeed lie very much in the field of damage control. That was the purpose of her three years in office. While Labor propagandists extol her personal popularity, I would remind government members that the preferred vote of 55 per cent gained by the incoming Court government last year still equalled the worst ever postwar defeats of the ALP in Western Australia. Her own margin of 52.7 per cent in a traditional Labor seat was not impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Political damage control does not create jobs in Western Australia; it does not attract investment; and it does not supply any kind of vision for the future. This is, of course, a government devoid of any constructive and generous vision of a better Australia. The Prime Minister's light on the hill is a narrow, bitter, centralist republic where executive government will reign unchecked and government will always claim to know best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, Dr Lawrence is being marketed as a champion of women and yet the record stands that, in July 1990 in relation to the matter of Western Women and the Women's Information Referral Exchange, she wrote a congratulatory letter to the latter. In 1991 the organisation went into receivership. In 1992 she denied any knowledge of Western Women. Finally, in this matter, an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 18 December 1992 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lawrence has played base politics in shutting down the Committee to avoid further political discomfort in the run to the election.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lawrence tries to portray herself as a clean-skin removed from the discredited tactics of her predecessors. But she has proved to be just another political manipulator.</PARA>
<PARA>This little venture meant the loss of life savings for a number of women. Given that Dr Lawrence sought to distance herself from any responsibility in this regard this is hardly supporting evidence for her championing the cause of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No amount of vote buying will disguise the fact that we have a centralist Prime Minister who is working consistently to gut all states of decision making powers. No amount of image building will alter the fact that the ALP candidate for Fremantle is committed to the very same agenda. I am sure the Australian public is already beginning to think that the rhetoric has very rarely been matched by the actions of this government or by the latter Western Australian government. It just has not happened. I am sure that the Western Australian public is beginning to think that maybe it should look beyond the rhetoric and start looking at the public record, which is not a particularly good one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to achieve what Harry Evans said about our constitution and about maintaining a democracy and if we are to listen and observe the experience of Vaclav Havel, then we will take very seriously these matters of the federal government overriding the rights of the states and usurping the powers that constitutionally and properly have been given to the states. It is time for all Australians to be very concerned about this usurping of power and what it means to them in the long-term in terms of their democratic rights. As I said, it looks like an easy solution to be given the option of not taking the responsibility for oneself, but it is a very short-term solution. Every Australian, every politician and every state Premier must give serious thought to the matter of democratic rights and to the rights of states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, no amount of vote buying will disguise the fact that we have a centralist Prime Minister who is working consistently to gut all states of decision making powers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The serious implications for Western Australia of the constant and continuous erosion of Australia's federal system of government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is code for a range of things: firstly, the worry on the part of honourable members opposite as to the serious political consequences for the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, now that he finds himself out on a limb, by himself in an isolationist position, divorced from his fellow conservative state premiers and divorced from the rest of the community; secondly, the concern about the damage that will be done to the citizens of Western Australia by the approach that is being taken by the Western Australian government; thirdly, and most importantly&mdash;this was the subject of most of the honourable member's speech&mdash;the worry that those opposite have as to the political damage which Carmen Lawrence will do to them when she is the honourable member for Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the speech of the honourable member for Pearce was a series of personal abuses of the candidate for Fremantle and the former premier. I am sure that Carmen Lawrence will be able to respond adequately to those in kind and in spades when she arrives. I will respond to a couple of points made by the honourable member for Pearce. Firstly, she spoke about the right to ensure that citizens have the opportunity to elect a state government. I would like the opportunity to elect a state government in Western Australia on the same basis that we are elected to this House: on the basis of one vote, one value and not on the basis of a corrupt, gerrymandered, malapportioned system which those opposite support and sustain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the substance of the MPI, I need go no further than to refer to the comments made by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), when responding to the ministerial statement given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) shortly after question time. The shadow minister referred to the Commonwealth having prime responsibilities for national issues. He said, `It is not sufficient to wash our hands and say, "It is up to the states, those are state matters" and blame the states if nothing happens'. Among the more responsible members of the opposition there is a view that the system we have in this country is a cooperative federal system. The Commonwealth of Australia cannot abrogate its prime responsibilities, take the soft option, and then blame the states for it. Those opposite should start to form a view as to what their attitude is to our federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday, 25 February we had a very adequate explanation of the general view that is taken of our current federal system, which arose in the context of the COAG meeting. Let us see what the attitude of the Commonwealth government is to cooperative federalism at this point of our federation's history. In the run-up to the COAG meeting, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) issued a statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the eve of the COAG Conference in Hobart I take the opportunity to repeat the Government's call for a new commitment to change. A new consensus about change.</PARA>
<PARA>That is our position. In cooperation with the states we want to ensure that change for the better is made in our country. At the conclusion of the COAG meeting, the Prime Minister, when interviewed after that meeting, was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Could I say that this was a very effective meeting. I did say last week that I thought that the Council of Australian Governments has been an effective body, I said that over the course of this week and proposed a continuing and cooperative approach to the Commonwealth/State federal structure in this country. Now, this today has produced a very significant outcome adopting competition policy criteria for the whole economy. And that includes not just the existing area covered by the trade practices act, but for government business enterprises or bodies and including unincorporated enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating, have you read Mr Court's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebuilding the Federation</EMPHASIS>?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It hasn't been drawn to my immediate attention, no.</PARA>
<PARA>The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why have you decided to relax the level of tied grants to the states?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We haven't decided to relax the level of tied grants. What we've said is that we want to deliver programs effectively, these programs are often best delivered jointly between the Commonwealth and the states. And we've got portfolio ministers and state line ministers working in councils bringing reports on housing, on health and community services to the next meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the government's approach. A further question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating, Richard Court described you, before he came to this meeting, as a creeping centralist . . . ?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, he's much more agreeable inside the meetings,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we are getting to the heart of it now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have got to say. And the result is . . . look, don't take any notice of what I say, look at what we do. At three meetings of COAG we've produced a national rail highway, a national training authority, food and product standards, now the adoption of major, mainframe competitive principle of the Hilmer variety for an economy-wide adoption. It means that there is cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and the notion that anyone can try and beat states interests into some sort of an issue which is exclusively, therefore, to the detriment of their state . . . really I don't think that stands up when you look at the outcomes coming from these cooperative meetings.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I make two clear points about this&mdash;that uniform taxation is the glue that holds the Federation together. It's what makes what would otherwise be six economies one nation. That's not to say that the program delivery under these things should not be examined. But, that doesn't mean that we can't have huge cooperation in other matters be they transport, be they standards, be they in electricity or water. And what we're showing is that we're getting on with those as again we did today with electricity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the government's position. We need go no further to accept the fact that that is the position adopted by all of the conservative state governments. I will now read from the communique from COAG that was signed and agreed to by not just other conservative state premiers but Richard Court. The introduction to the communique states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council of Australian Governments today held its third meeting, in Hobart. The Council, comprising the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers and the President of the Local Government Association, had wide ranging discussions aimed at increasing co-operation among all spheres of government in the national interest. The key objectives of the Council's deliberations were to assist in bringing about a more competitive and integrated national market, and more efficient and effective arrangements for the delivery of services in areas of shared responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Communique sets out the agreed outcome of those discussions.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into detail about the Hilmer competition matters, but I will quote, for the benefit of those opposite, that part of the communique which relates to Commonwealth-state roles and responsibilities as agreed to by Premier Court:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council did not have the opportunity to conclude its consideration of the report from the Working Group which it established at its previous meeting to identify those functional areas which exhibit inefficiencies in existing intergovernmental arrangements and where progress could be made in clarifying the roles and responsibilities of governments. It agreed that this should be the main item on the agenda for the meeting of the Council in August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council did, however, agree that in some areas a clear allocation of functional responsibility to one level of government may be appropriate. In other areas, where roles and responsibilities are shared, the Council considered it may be more appropriate to delineate roles and responsibilities of the different levels of government within and across particular functional areas in order to produce more efficient and effective service delivery, eliminate overlap and duplication, minimise imposts on the economy and enhance accountability. The Council agreed that the overriding objective should be to improve outcomes for clients and value for money for taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council noted that the practice of tied grants has sometimes led to duplication and confusion of roles and responsibilities between the States, Territories and the Commonwealth. The Council acknowledged that any review of Commonwealth/State roles and responsibilities should include consideration of tied grants with a view to reducing their incidence.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what is stated in the communique.

<PARA>That is the attitude taken by commentators to the current status of our federal-state relations. Let us have a quick look at the document which Premier Court tabled at that meeting. All honourable members would be aware of the attitude taken to that document, which was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebuilding the federation</EMPHASIS>, by the conservative premiers. I quote from a transcript of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABC News</EMPHASIS> on Friday night, 25 February, in which, firstly, Premier Kennett and then the other conservative premiers were asked whether they had seen Premier Court's document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">KENNETT</EMPHASIS>&mdash;"I don't want you to tell anyone, but I haven't read it as yet."</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">GROOM</EMPHASIS>&mdash;"Ha! Very Interesting. (pause) It brings back memories . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the precise point. I will now turn to the document. I will not even try to go through this document at length. But I want to draw to the attention of the House the memories that it brings back for Premier Groom. In the introduction Premier Court acknowledges the fact that we are now a modern nation state moving into the next century. In the document he states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one would dispute that Australia is a different country from the one in which the Federal system of Government was established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation we are attempting to meet the new challenges and opportunities that are being presenting by the new era in world trade and our fast developing Asian neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this document is a positive first step in an informed debate which will lead to a rebuilding of the Federal system of Government in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>But when we look at the document itself it is not looking to the future of either my state or our country. We find a document that starts in 1900. The executive summary states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1900, and subject only to very light Imperial control from London, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">each of the Australian colonies was legally and constitutionally independent.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Those were the memories that sparked up in the mind of Premier Groom, and that is where Premier Court wants to take us back to. And there are a few insidious things on the way. Under the heading `Centralised tax powers' it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the War, the High Court upheld Canberra's authority to levy income taxes. This resulted in the States being forced out of the income tax field.</PARA>
<PARA>The flavour of this document is Richard Court's secret agenda&mdash;double income tax. He wants a separate state income tax for Western Australia. That is his agenda. Let us also look at what it says about the external affairs power in the paragraph on external affairs. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Originally the scope of this power was small, because most of Australia's external affairs were handled in London.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he harks back to. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">has</EMPHASIS> altered the Compact has been Canberra's deliberate use of the external affairs power, with the High Court's assistance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So, unlike the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), he is not content to be handcuffed to the 1955 white picket fence. He is not content, unlike most honourable members opposite, to be handcuffed to that era. Not only does Richard Court want to take us back to the 1900s; he is handcuffed to Lord Forrest's grave in Karrakatta at the corner of his own electorate. That is where he wants to take us back to. That is his mind-set. Under the heading `The picture today', again it laments:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loss of income taxing powers . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent High Court and Commonwealth decisions have, for all practical purposes, barred States from re-entering the income tax field.</PARA>
<PARA>So his lament is, `Let's go back to Lord Forrest's era, but, while we are doing it, let us give Western Australia, through Richard Court, a separate state income tax'. What comfort does this give? Richard Court refers to Sir John Forrest being commissioned by the Governor to form a ministry in 1890. Then we see the hidden agenda emerging again under the headings `Reluctance to federate', `Should Western Australia have gone alone?' and `The move to secede'. Here we have the disgraceful conduct of Premier Court giving succour to a movement which suggests that Western Australia should secede from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at this document we see the things that Premier Court is harking for. He is not content to be like the honourable member for Bennelong, handcuffed to the 1955 picket fence. He wants to go back to John Forrest, but he wants a state income tax in the process. Richard Court really does the citizens of Western Australia a grave disservice because he puts Western Australia out in isolation from all of the other premiers. The honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) quoted from the editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. I will quote from an article in the `News Extra' entitled `Court misses with States' rights drive'. That is the real problem for him. The lead paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Channel 7's Canberra bureau chief, Dennis Grant, summed up the mood at the Hobart meeting of State leaders and the Prime Minister Paul Keating last Friday. He told viewers: "Frankly, Richard Court has made a bit of a goose of himself."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view was that the wheels had fallen off Mr Court's States' rights barrow. And his own sort&mdash;fellow Liberal Premiers&mdash;had hardly helped his cause.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, the subject of the matter of public importance referred to the serious economic implications for Western Australia of Australia's federal system. I will tell honourable members what the economic implications are. Together with Queensland, Western Australian is our strongest state. I will tell honourable members why this is the case. It is has nothing to do with Richard Court. The things that Richard Court has done have added nothing to Western Australia's economic strengths. That has come from the changes made by this government to internationalise Australia's economy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was somewhat bemused by the remarks of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). His contribution almost exclusively consisted of reading from the media. I hoped that we might have had some original thoughts from the honourable member. It seems that we will have to wait for those thoughts on this subject&mdash;and on many others, I suspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside the prime duty of a member of the House of Representatives to represent the people of his or her electorate, which representation is bound to be deficient&mdash;and I have real concerns about that&mdash;if any one event is to hasten the erosion of state responsibilities and centralised power in this city of Canberra it will be the election of the ALP candidate to the seat of Fremantle in the forthcoming election. There has been a lot of high grovel in sections of the media about the merits of Ms Carmen Lawrence, former Premier of Western Australia. In the process they have overlooked some matters and this has led to the tendency to sweep under the carpet the `best' traditions of the Burke, Dowding and latterly Lawrence administrations. They are there to be seen and they are on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this parliament should see Ms Lawrence elected, we are going to have an exercise in memory. She will be a perfect replacement for the former minister for sports rorts. I will give honourable members an example of her memory. Ms Lawrence was asked a question before the royal commission into WA Inc:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July to November 1988 did you believe that the purpose and effect of the government involvement in PICL was fully and accurately explained to the public?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A. Cannot recall.</PARA>
<PARA>The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did you attend a Cabinet meeting in about July 1988 at which Mr Parker and another minister discussed Rothwell's current financial position?</PARA>
<PARA>She answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No recollection.</PARA>
<PARA>She was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1988, SGIC and GESB each supported Rothwells to the extent of $50 million. Please state when you first became aware of such support being proposed or having occurred?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Lawrence replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No direct knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA>This woman has more ways of saying `I cannot remember' than any politician that ever lived&mdash;with perhaps the exception of Ronald Reagan. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to consider the past record of the Labor candidate for the seat of Fremantle. She voted with the government of Western Australia for the motion that the government support Rothwells with a $150 million guarantee. She voted for a motion to support the government taking an equity investment in the Kwinana petrochemical project. She voted against the motion to accept the WA McCusker report, in regard to which an amendment stipulated an urgent need for the WA inquiry. She opposed opposition calls for a special investigation of Rothwells. She opposed motions for an independent commission of audit to examine government business dealings. That is the person who aspires to be the member for Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as March 1993 when Ms Lawrence was asked about a possible move to federal politics&mdash;and she repeated the gaffe time and again&mdash;she revealed that she had turned down an 11th hour offer to run for the federal seat at the previous election because she believed it to be morally wrong. Twelve months later it is now morally right. What does that say about the calibre of the woman who aspires to represent the people of Fremantle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given her memory, she will meet a lot of new friends every day here because there are a lot of people wandering around, and she is going to see the same people and they will be new to her given her memory. She has the qualities to replace the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) in this Labor cabinet. We recall the fact that she could not remember having overdrawn and improperly drawn on a $5,000 parliamentary imprest account which she ultimately had to pay out, but she has a perfect memory to replace the honourable member for Canberra. With that memory she is in line with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who on occasions cannot even remember to lodge his personal tax return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be few people with worse credentials than Ms Carmen Lawrence to represent the best interests of Fremantle, or Western Australia, in this parliament. This claimed newfound interest in the interests of Western Australia that we read about in some sections of the media does momentarily attract media time and space, but what about the record? There simply is not time to catalogue all the relevant matters which would be of interest to those people who might be espousing the cause of Ms Lawrence. She only recently caved into the Prime Minister on Mabo when she conceded the most fundamental of state responsibilities in the management of land title. She did that, with all the huge and detrimental implications that has for our state of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indicative of a larger problem with Ms Lawrence: her failure to stand up for the interests of the people of Western Australia, and her demonstrated willingness to put those interests second to those of her Labor colleagues in this town. As one journalist said of her recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her commitment . . . to retaining her home state's interests as her first priority . . . may prove more slippery than a Murray River carp when the Labor power blocs decide to exert their authority.</PARA>
<PARA>That is it in a nutshell. This will be the same slipperiness that she demonstrated two months ago when she undertook to stay on as the state Labor leader until the next election and, more recently, when she said that serving politicians should not quit their seats between elections. She was not talking about the former member for Fremantle, let me assure you; she was talking about herself and her state colleagues. What has she done? She has quit. Mind you, so would I given her abysmal record and the abysmal failure of her campaign last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that Carmen Lawrence is capable of abandoning commitments as soon as the opportunity arises. We have seen it in this case, and she did it readily; she played hard to get but it was false, it was insincere. Whether the misuse of the foreign affairs powers is either real or perceived, the process undermines the responsibility of the states in general and Western Australia in particular. I have searched high and low for something Ms Lawrence may have had to say about the interests of Western Australia. It was only recently, when she announced her candidature, that she found interest in the subject at all. That is the only reference I could find&mdash;not a word; not even fleeting resistance to what has happened in this&mdash;</PARA>

The characterisation of her candidacy by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as `a pit stop on the road to Canberra' is apt. That is all that can be said for it. She progressed from 27 June 1991 when, as premier, she refused to accept Labor's national land rights aspirations to a stage where, in state opposition in 1994, she embraced the most far-reaching legislation imaginable in the form of the Native Title Act. There was not a whimper of protest then. It is hard for me to imagine a greater disservice which could be done to this parliament, but more importantly to Western Australia, than having Ms Carmen Lawrence as Keating's representative in Fremantle. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Crosio), who is at the dispatch box, during the speech of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) I was wondering what the hell we were talking about. I had to keep looking at the terms of the matter of public importance. I did not hear very much from him about Western Australia's rights or about the federal system. It was, like just about every speech given in this place recently by honourable members from Western Australia, just another denigration of Dr Carmen Lawrence. We can expect nothing better from them in the lead-up to the by-election because those opposite know they will lose it and they know that Dr Lawrence will make a fine new member of the front bench of this government. At least the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) did address herself partly to the issue, despite the fact that she also indulged in the denigration and bating of Dr Lawrence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I will address myself to the issue. It is always a vexed issue and it is something with which, believe it or not, I do have some sympathy. I worked for the New South Wales government for some time and I know that at times there are problems of conflict, overlap and all of those sorts of things. When Australia became a federation 94 years ago it did so for very good reasons. It did so because this continent is a nation and we became constitutionally, even if not in spirit, a nation at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that we are not yet a nation, having heard the honourable member for Pearce say that she is not an Australian first. Why is she in this place if she does not put her country before all else?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reality is that when Australia became a federation we had to overcome the differences between the states: we had to get on another train at state boundaries because the rail lines were different and, even now, when families go from one state to another they have to adjust to a new education system. Central government cannot be compared with totalitarian countries, as the honourable member for Pearce likes to say. It is typical of people from the other side to cry totalitarianism and to look for reds under the beds. Central government has worked with the states to bring legislation and regulation which is of benefit to the whole of Australia. Unfortunately, the current Premier of Western Australia is not very keen on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that the honourable member for Pearce did not bother to mention COAG, which was a great milestone last week in bringing together state and federal issues. The honourable member for Pearce, like so many of her colleagues, is living in the past. An editorial headed `Centralism versus State taxes' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 24 February says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that the debate move beyond the old stereotypes&mdash;yet federal-State relations seem chained to the prisons of the past.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the honourable member for Pearce finds herself chained to the prisons of the past. In her speech on the Native Title Bill, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To hurriedly overturn 200 years of legal precedent to right the wrongs of the past is flawed thinking.</PARA>
<PARA>What an appalling statement for somebody to make!  Her predecessor, Mr Fred Chaney, was probably very disappointed with that statement. It is certainly flawed thinking to believe that just because we have been doing something wrong for 200 years we should not change it now. There is constant emphasis on states rights instead of state responsibilities. I noticed that at least the honourable member for Curtin used that word. We have responsibilities, not rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular area of interest to me as a person who represents an area of great environmental sensitivity is the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system. We have great problems with the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system. I am constantly frustrated that this is a state responsibility. As a federal member, there is very little I can do. I sat here feeling great envy during the debate on the Murray-Darling legislation. I envied the Murray-Darling people because their river system runs through three states; therefore, a body has been set up in cooperation with those states and the Commonwealth to do something about cleaning up that river system. I certainly wish the Hawkesbury-Nepean ran through another state so that the federal government could do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know how much Mr Court cares about the environment. Every state except Western Australia has agreed with the Commonwealth to establish a national environment protection council. Why is Mr Court not interested?  He does not want to protect the environment in Western Australia. He does not want to cooperate with the other conservative states and the federal government. This council would establish national standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) has been criticised a lot. We cannot pass up an excuse to give her another kick after she has left the ministry! But at least she was attempting in the environment portfolio&mdash;the environment portfolio seems to have been overlooked a lot in the last few months&mdash;to establish national environment standards against the redneck opposition members of this state and this redneck Premier. The environment is a national issue. Everything that goes into the environment&mdash;water and air quality&mdash;is a national issue. Air does not stop at state boundaries; nor do some rivers. The rivers which do not stop at state boundaries suffer the consequences of catchment areas of other states. We have to get over this nonsense of states rights on issues like the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education and training is another area. The National Training Authority, which has recently been set up, is another good example of cooperation, of working together, to bring about a central and cooperative system. It is not a matter of the central government imposing itself on the states; it is a matter of cooperation. That is what the COAG meeting was about last week. I am sure that is why the honourable member for Pearce omitted to mention COAG. She knew it would be an embarrassment. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) mentioned in his speech how pleased the other state premiers were with the cooperation that was taking place in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Pearce also mentioned&mdash;I think this is absolutely laughable&mdash;that the former honourable member for Fremantle was such a Canberra person that he neglected his own electorate. I would suggest that a man who was in the prime of his political career&mdash;10 years younger than I who have just come into this place&mdash;has chucked a good career in this place to live in Fremantle. He said a number of times how tiring it was to travel from his home. He wanted to be with his family at home in Fremantle. I am sure he is there because he loves the place. If he did not, he would have moved to Canberra. Those sorts of petty criticisms let down the side of an argument that might have had some substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the honourable member for Perth left, he gave me a few notes containing points that he did not have time to make. He points out that the many advantages Western Australia has gained are due to federal policies. The export culture that the federal government has established is a fine example. Western Australia is fortunate&mdash;it has nothing to do with any government&mdash;in having a great number of natural resources. It is that export culture, the low inflation policies of this government, international competition and low tariffs that have helped to make Western Australia a rich state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am from New South Wales, as honourable members know. I am on the other side of the country from Western Australia. It takes four to 4 1/2 hours to fly to Perth. Until I came into this place, I had made only very brief visits to Perth. I think it is a wonderful place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill is to implement the terms of an agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland for the management of the wet tropics area of North Queensland. An agreement concerning the wet tropics world heritage area management scheme was signed by the then Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland in November 1990. It allowed for the establishment of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, a wet tropics management agency, a community consultative committee and a scientific advisory committee. The legislation is to manage the wet tropics area, complementary legislation having passed through the Queensland parliament in 1993. Originally, we were going to match that legislation, but as we are simply complementing the Queensland legislation this is a very slight bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth while to look briefly at what the management scheme covers. The wet tropics of Queensland management scheme covers five different sections. First, there is the ministerial council, the responsibility of which is to coordinate policy and funding of the wet tropics between Queensland and the Commonwealth at ministerial level. Secondly, under the ministerial council comes the Wet Tropics Management Authority. It is the responsibility of the authority to report back to the council and to devise and make recommendations which go to the council, as well as be responsible to the council for the oversight of the management agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings us to the third section, the management agency. The management agency is responsible, through the authority to the ministerial council, for developing and implementing management plans for the authority. There are then also two other committees. The first of these is the consultative committee, which is a community consultative committee. Its purpose is to allow the members of the community to have an input into the management of the authority. This comprises a wide range of people from the community, including local government, tourists and Aboriginal representatives. The other committee is the scientific advisory committee, whose responsibility is to advise on research and those scientific matters affecting the management of the wet tropics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the details of the bill. As I said, the details are very slight. There were only three things in the original bill brought to the parliament, before it was introduced into the Senate. They are, firstly, that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories would appoint two members to the Wet Tropics Management Authority; secondly, that staff could be seconded from the Commonwealth to the authority; and, thirdly, that an annual report would be tabled in parliament every year. At the time this bill was introduced into the Senate, the Australian Democrats brought in some amendments, two of which were adopted&mdash;I might say despite the opposition of the coalition. Although the opposition will not be opposing the bill in the House of Representatives, I think our opposition was totally appropriate in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the amendments brought on by the Democrats and which passed the Senate was that the Commonwealth minister, in appointing two people to the authority, should specify that one of those people be an Aborigine. As was pointed out by Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Campbell, the opposition thinks it is quite appropriate that an Aborigine be on the authority but we do not think that should be specified in the legislation, for the simple reason that there are only two appointees through the bill to the authority&mdash;whoever is most appropriate to fill those two positions. At present, the two positions are filled by Dr Keto and Mr Donaghy. Both those people are eminently qualified. Mr Donaghy is a representative of the Cairns commerce and tourism organisation and Dr Keto is a conservationist. I would not like to suggest which one of these members should be excluded to include an Aborigine. Perhaps one will be in the future, but that is certainly a matter to be decided on the qualifications of the people coming into the authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I object very deeply to tokenism. I think to write into this legislation that an Aborigine be put on to that authority simply on the basis that he or she is an Aborigine is demeaning to all indigenous people. Our indigenous people have enormous knowledge and qualifications of the land and where they are qualified they will be appointed. It is, I suspect, to the shame of the former Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories that to this date she has not seen fit to appoint to this position an Aborigine as one of her two people. I ask, as she has not done that in the past, why she saw fit to put it into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also added to the bill was the recommendation that the Commonwealth minister, be it he or she in future, should use his or her best offices to prevail upon the Queensland government to appoint an Aborigine to future consultative committees. I point out that the present consultative committee requires an Aborigine to serve on it. As the only other committee is the scientific committee, Senator Ian Macdonald asked quite justifiably in the Senate why this needed to be placed in the legislation. Once there is a scientific committee and a community committee, we cannot see where the other committee would arise. If it is a specialised committee, surely what is important is that the person who goes on to that committee be specialised in the matter for which the committee has been set up, not simply be appointed because he or she is an Aborigine. Certainly on the consultative committee that is presently in existence it is required, as is appropriate, that an Aborigine be on that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter, in speaking to the amendments in the Senate, referred to the nomination of the wet tropics as a world heritage area and that the Aboriginal culture had been mentioned as part of that nomination. The way Senator Coulter put it, it sounded like the wet tropics had been nominated partly for their cultural value. That is not accurate. The wet tropics were nominated for their natural and conservation value. It is true that Aboriginal heritage was mentioned in the nomination, but it was mentioned in one paragraph only. It was not supported as part of the nomination. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are two types of nomination for world heritage listing. One is the natural aspects of an area and the other is the cultural aspects. If the Aboriginal culture had been a strong element in the nomination, that would have gone up as part of the nomination, but it did not in fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it remains that the wet tropics of Queensland, which is an absolutely fantastic and unique area&mdash;it has been well described in the Senate, so I shall not go into it further here&mdash;was put on the World Heritage List for conservation value. Therefore, I ask: as there are only two Commonwealth appointees to the authority, how are they decided? Is the person there for conservation thrown off? This raises a difficulty. It would be my expectation that there will be Aborigines who, perhaps after Dr Keto has finished her term, will naturally fill that conservation role who will have the expertise to go on to the authority, having those conservation requirements and knowledge of the area, which would satisfy the reason for which the area has been nominated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having mentioned the world wet tropics area, I am aware that the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), who will be following me in the debate today, is about to table some findings of a survey on the wet tropics which he was kind enough to hand to me before he spoke on it. I was distressed to note in one of those areas the effect of world heritage listing on the local economy. In the south region, 36 per cent of the people surveyed believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy; in the tablelands 54 per cent believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a condemnation of the government, not because it is a world heritage area&mdash;I believe that is important and essential for Australia&mdash;but because, with the removal of the logging and in declaring it a world heritage area, the government did not live up to its commitment to the people of Ravenshoe and other areas to provide jobs, which was a promise that it made. The promise has not been kept and, as a result, families have been totally and utterly devastated. Unemployment has risen and families have been dispersed throughout the area. When the government declares world heritage areas through the legislation, of which I will speak a little more in a moment, it has an obligation to make sure that those people dispossessed by it find other means of employment, otherwise conventions such as the world heritage convention will come into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the state of world heritage in Australia. World heritage is positively regarded by all other countries in the world. Each year the International Union for the Conservation of Nature turns back hundreds of applications to have particular areas put on the World Heritage List. People in other parts of the world are absolutely ecstatic when one of their areas is put on the World Heritage List; they see it as a positive boom to that area. Tourists from other countries are aware that that area is special and unique and is worth seeing because it is on the World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the condition in Australia. In Australia people fear and loathe world heritage, which is very sad for this government. It goes to the heart of the world heritage in this country and the legislation that was drawn up in the early 1980s&mdash;I believe in 1983&mdash;on world heritage by the then minister, Barry Cohen. That legislation is the most draconian piece of legislation I have seen in my time in this place. It allows the minister to go into a declared world heritage area&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that world heritage areas do not belong to the Commonwealth, they can be private land or national parks; a whole range of areas can be declared world heritage areas&mdash;and say to a private land-holder, `You can no longer do this in your area', and there is nothing in that legislation that guarantees compensation. The result of this has been that people all around Australia fear that, if their area is declared a world heritage area, they will be prevented from doing some activity and they will not be paid compensation. </PARA>

I will tell honourable members what has happened. Willandra Lakes was declared a world heritage area because its archaeological values have been totally and utterly degraded. There has been no protection of that area. The honourable member for Leichhardt should go up there and walk around the area. He will see the sand moulds that contain thousands of years of Aboriginal history. The tourists have been allowed to run and walk over them. There are no walkways through the area and no Commonwealth money has gone into the area whatsoever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker. The parliamentary secretary has commented on the care of Willandra Lakes. I invite her to go out to Willandra Lakes and have a look at what has happened under the 13 years of Labor management. As I said, the area has been degraded and the people who live there have been suffering extraordinarily under the world heritage regime. World heritage boundaries were drawn up on the basis of the property of the people who owned land&mdash;not on the values of the world heritage list but on the land&mdash;with no thought given to the fact that in the future that would be the way it would be administered. As a consequence, the people of that area have lost income. They have not been able to crop because, on the basis of world heritage, they have lost capital value and they believe they cannot sell their properties without it. That is what has happened to the people in Willandra Lakes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary asks, `Why should he go to Lake Eyre?'. The Prime Minister, out of the blue, in March 1993, suddenly announced to Australia in general that Lake Eyre Basin would be nominated by the end of the year, without any consultation with the people at Lake Eyre. What did these people do? They had never heard about world heritage. They rang the people at Willandra Lakes, went across to Shark Bay, talked to the people in Western Australia and found out what happened with world heritage. They realised the possibilities of world heritage and what it could do to them. Since then, certain groups have approached the ex-minister and said, `What will you do to help us get world heritage working again in Australia?'. They said, `The first thing we need is a change in that absolutely draconian legislation which allows a minister to go in and dictate what can happen in an area and not offer any compensation at all'. It is not required by the legislation'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation, amongst others, has asked for a change to that legislation. The previous minister cared so little for it that she said, `We like it the way it is'. That is despite the fact that she had lost two nominations&mdash;the Nullarbor Plains and the Lake Eyre region. So that is the history of this government on world heritage. It is a sad history. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This beautiful area is exceptional in that it is one of only 12 areas in the world that meet all four criteria for world heritage listing. It is well worth mentioning the criteria. They are that the site is, first, an outstanding example representing the major stages of the earth's revolutionary history; second, an outstanding example representing ongoing geological processes, biological evolution and man's interaction with his natural environment; third, contains superlative natural phenomenon, formations and features; and, fourth, contains the most important and significant natural habitats where threatened species of animals or plants of outstanding value live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a diversity of landscapes that make up the superlative natural phenomena, formations and features of the wet tropics. Scenic areas include typical tropical rainforests with cathedral-like high canopies and giant trees, some over 3,000 years old, to dense vine forest with diverse life forms of strangler figs, twisting vines, climbing palms, ferns, lilies and orchids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The region is one of extensive sweeping forest vistas with forest-clad mountains, often contrasting with the drier eucalypt forests. The area in my electorate north of Cairns combines beautiful lowland tropical rainforest and white sandy beaches and fringing reefs offshore. This combination of reef and rainforest&mdash;both are world heritage listed&mdash;is unique in the world and is a special attraction that brings so many Australian and international visitors to Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tropical forests make up seven per cent of the earth's surface but contain more than half of the world's biota. Biodiversity is recognised internationally as an important goal. Proudly, Australia was one of the first signatories to the biodiversity convention. The wet tropics of Far North Queensland has the most intense biodiversity of anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ecological factors of the wet tropics are important but so too are the pure aesthetic factors. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I am sure that you have traversed the wet tropics area of Far North Queensland. It is just magnificent. Unfortunately, I do have enough opportunities to walk in the rainforests in my electorate of Leichhardt. I think there is a mystical character to the rainforest which goes beyond anything that I could put into this speech and I am sure that you would agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also important economic factors. An article in the last <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> mentioned the rivalry between Cairns and Townsville. It analysed why Cairns has gone forward in relation to tourism and, unfortunately, Townsville seems to have been left behind. The airport was also mentioned in that article. Certainly local initiative by the private and public sectors assisted with the Cairns airport, but it is no coincidence that the upsurge in tourism to both reef and rainforest in the far north that occurred during the late 1980s&mdash;certainly it is continuing in the 1990s&mdash;came at the same time as the world heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people are asked why they want to come to the far north as a tourist attraction, they mention the Great Barrier Reef but more and more they are mentioning the Daintree region and the wet tropics. So, obviously, it is a very important and  significant region. I think the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) is way off beam even to suggest that somehow the listing of the wet tropics has cost jobs. Tell the tourism industry in Far North Queensland that the listing of the wet tropics has cost jobs! That is just not true. It has been a job maker, not a job taker. </PARA>

The success of the government's world heritage listing has been shown recently by a community attitudes survey conducted by AGB McNair, to which the honourable member kindly referred. The survey found that 80 per cent of the people in the whole region supported the listing. That is up six per cent since 1992. The survey is interesting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part of that survey, which I have not sought to incorporate, talks about the awareness of world heritage listing. Spontaneous awareness of world heritage listed areas is greatest for Kakadu, rating 32 per cent in the cities, but for the wet tropics it rates 68 per cent regionally. Total awareness of the wet tropics as a world heritage listed area has risen significantly since last year&mdash;regionally, from 71 per cent to 87 per cent, and in the cities it is up 12 per cent, from 31 percent to 43 per cent. So it is obvious that the listing of the world heritage area positively helps tourism in Far North Queensland and that means it positively helps jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional survey on the management of the wet tropics looks at reasons for dissatisfaction in 1993. Of those surveyed, 36 per cent were dissatisfied because it was taking too long, nothing was happening and there was not enough progress. These people are not showing fear and loathing. They are asking the Commonwealth and the Queensland government to get on with the job. Further reasons for dissatisfaction included: too much bureaucracy, 23 per cent; do not hear anything, 18 per cent; too much of politics, 12 per cent; developers have too much influence, seven per cent; stopping development in the region, threat to jobs, six per cent. The number of people who are dissatisfied because developers have too much influence over the wet tropics is greater than the number of people who are dissatisfied because development is being stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly welcome some recent amendments that have been incorporated into the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill in relation to Aboriginal interest in the wet tropic rainforests. It is fit and proper that the preamble of the bill should now recognise that `Aboriginal people have occupied, used, and enjoyed land in the area since time immemorial'. I also look forward to the appointment of an Aboriginal representative on the board of the authority and I commend the Rainforest Aboriginal Network for the thorough and competent job it is doing in representing Aboriginal concerns both to the government and to the authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people must be represented on the authority. It has been a fairly major oversight that Aboriginal people have not previously been on the authority. It is very important&mdash;and I hope the honourable member for Hindmarsh is listening&mdash;not only because of the High Court's decision in the Mabo case and because Aboriginal people are part of the community but also because of the Aboriginal people's indigenous knowledge of the wet tropics region. They are the people who have had close knowledge of this region for thousands of years. It is very foolish for any government and any authority to disregard this indigenous knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area of the wet tropics most frequently recognised by people outside the region is the Daintree-Cape Tribulation area where local people first made a stand in drawing national attention to the construction of a road through the rainforest. That area of Douglas shire is now under enormous pressure from thousands of tourists who flock to see the beauty of the reef and the rainforest. Fortunately the local council and its far-sighted chairman, Mr Mike Berwick, have been working in conjunction with the Commonwealth to devise development plans for the area that will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) address adequately the needs and rights of local residents and landowners;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) preserve the area's environmental assets; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) provide for a sustainable and prosperous eco-tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has been asked by the council to assist financially to allow it to draw up possible plans, and these representations have been favourably received. As a government, we have recognised that a small local community cannot bear the full burden of managing and protecting such a precious national resource. I take this opportunity to thank the two private trusts&mdash;the Daintree Rainforest Foundation and the Australian Bush Heritage Fund&mdash;that have been responsible for raising money nationally to purchase a biologically valuable block that will be managed in conjunction with the surrounding protected areas in the Daintree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the success stories that the Commonwealth government has created with the listing of the wet tropics and with the cooperation of 11 councils is the North Queensland community rainforest reafforestation program. Currently about 70 young people who are employed under LEAP are being trained and working at planting a variety of trees on private property for future harvesting as timber. Over 100 other young people have gone through the program and over 300 local farms have benefited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must take this opportunity to correct some serious misrepresentations made in the Senate last week by Senator Ian Macdonald, who criticised the Wet Tropics Management Authority over the size of its $5.5 million community relations project. Senator Macdonald accused the authority of self-promotion and self-aggrandisement without checking the facts. The reality is that the bulk of this money&mdash;in fact, $3.5 million&mdash;was spent on infrastructure maintenance, construction of visitor facilities, walking tracks and roads and the establishment of new visitor centres, all of the most important features needed to get people into the area and have them go away satisfied with the experience. I wish that coalition spokespersons would check their facts instead of going off half-cocked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So to the future of the area. Pressures are building up as the coastal strip of Cairns is developed and land will become in short supply, putting pressure on the rainforest and on world heritage buffer areas. I express my support for the idea of a tunnel from Cairns to the tablelands to facilitate the development of that region. The idea of a tunnel from Smithfield just north of Cairns to the bridge on the Barron River near Kuranda has been raised by the Chairman of the Mulgrave Shire, Mr Tom Pyne. I believe the tunnel idea is truly visionary. It is the sort of project that is scoffed at&mdash;understandably, because of the cost. Queensland Department of Transport officials estimate the cost of the tunnel to be somewhere between $100 million and $300 million. The cost, however, will be offset by a number of factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cairns is growing fast. Anyone who has flown into Cairns knows just how close the rainforest covered wet tropics mountain ranges are to the coast. I think you would know that yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker. Cairns is spreading out in a north-south direction because of this mountain range. The coastal strip is already feeling the pressure. It is highly sought after development land for both housing and tourism development and a lot of areas are prime cane land. This pressure is squeezing development up the hillsides at the expense of pockets of rainforest. If Cairns continues to grow at its current rate, the coastal development strip will eventually extend from Port Douglas to Cardwell. We simply cannot afford the associated infrastructure costs and, just as importantly in the context of this legislation, the environmental costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the tunnel proposal has the support of the far north community. Most people agree that it would be an environmentally and economically reckless attempt to widen the Kuranda range road. Already the range road is congested by heavy traffic servicing the growing tablelands population as well as tourists visiting Kuranda. In the wet season the range has a tragic history of fatal and near fatal accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mulgrave Shire Council supports the tunnel because it takes the pressure off the increasingly congested coastal strip. The Mareeba shire at the other end supports it because it has low value rural land ready for residential development and it will be an alternative route to the coast. The North Queensland greens support it as a way of relieving pressure on the coastal strip and the Wet Tropics Management Authority certainly prefers it to widening the Kuranda range road as a way of taking pressure off the coast. The sugar industry would support it because the five-minute travel time to the coast would make it much more economical to get cane from the Atherton Tablelands to the sugar mills on the coast. The area of real growth in sugar is the tablelands. There is an opportunity for some people involved in tobacco production to shift to sugar production, but the problem is getting the cane from the tablelands to the mills on the coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to preserve the wet tropics area for future generations, maintain the sugar industry in the far north and meet the demands of a rapidly expanding residential population in the region, the federal government has to get together with the Queensland state government and industry and build this tunnel. In the long run, the tunnel will pay for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the not too distant future I would like to be able to comment upon the construction of such a tunnel as an example of an important initiative that the Commonwealth has taken in the far north. I am proud to be a member of this government that has taken these initiatives. I will continue to do all in my power to ensure the prosperity of the region that I represent in this House. I will encourage and support the crucial role of the Wet Tropics Management Authority in ensuring the sustainable use of the region's world renowned natural assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be great for the coalition's credibility if, one day in a debate about world heritage in this House&mdash;I did not notice the honourable member for Hindmarsh saying this&mdash;it would concede that the Queensland National Party government was very wrong in opposing world heritage listing of the wet tropics. It is hyporcritical for the coalition to come in here today and not mention that. The opposition went right down the wire, from the Bjelke-Petersen government to the Ahern government, in opposing wet tropics listing in the courts and in the political sphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to congratulate the Hawke Labor government on its far-sightedness in listing the wet tropics world heritage area. I congratulate Senator Richardson, the current Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I also congratulate the former minister, Ros Kelly, because she has taken the wet tropics from the stage of listing to the stage where this legislation is before the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before presenting my contribution to this debate, I wish to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). I am in receipt of the AGB McNair survey that he sought to incorporate. He was at pains to say that there had been no economic effect as a result of the listing of the wet tropics. I note from the report to which he referred that for the south region, which obviously was one of the regions polled, the positive effect is listed at 14 per cent and the negative effect at 36 per cent, and that for the tablelands the positive effect is listed at 13 per cent and the negative effect at 54 per cent. They are not my figures; they are his.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly there is some benefit applicable to Cairns. No doubt Cairns was doing pretty well on its own. I would imagine that a lot of these people who have chosen a lifestyle in an area such as the wet tropics did not really want to be shifted to Cairns and into that urban environment. Whilst no doubt the honourable member for Leichhardt would agree with the figures he has asked to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, it appears that some interpretation would be needed. As to the effect on the residents' own community in the tablelands, the positive effect was 18 per cent and the negative 34 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill is brought to this parliament under the external affairs power, which I think is section 51(xxix) of the constitution, and of course the power related to the area of the right of the executive to sign treaties without the approval of parliament. This legislation, of course, does require the approval of parliament; it is a flow-on. I want to take the opportunity today to especially pay attention to that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1987 the Commonwealth nominated the wet tropics area of North Queensland for world heritage listing. Senator Richardson, the then environment minister, banned logging of rainforests using his power under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. The area was placed on the world heritage list in December 1988. I think the honourable member for Leichhardt, had he stayed around to listen, would admit that that was a very traumatic time in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation followed the role that Senator Richardson took upon himself, having polled or come to the decision from other polling that the green vote&mdash;and, of course, more importantly, the preferences of certain green candidates&mdash;was going to be very important in that election, and we had this procession of heritage listings. Senator Richardson would be well versed in that process because the trade union movement has a similar role, in that union bosses get one wage increase and then, very shortly after that, if they do not go out to get another one, people start to question the need for their existence and for paying union dues. So there is this constant procession of feeding the troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later&mdash;I think it might have occurred when the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) was the minister&mdash;the town of Carnarvon, in an area well known to me, Shark Bay, in north Western Australia, was also listed. I lived on the coast of Shark Bay for 25 years. Today the people are extremely disillusioned as to the result of that listing. I made the point at the time, knowing the area as I did, that I could not consider what its heritage values were. Of course, the reason that it attracted the attention of the government was that many years ago some fishermen regularly fed some dolphins, which became tame and regularly visited the spot. They have become a tourist attraction, but they are not heritage. They could go away if people stopped feeding them&mdash;and if that is the heritage, it has gone. Mention was also made of stromatolites, which are black rocks that have a very long history of growth and development involving hardening of algae. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that various places that attracted popular and tourist attention around Australia were ticked off one at a time for heritage listing. What has been the result of that? I got the greatest shock of my life during the Mabo debate when, in consultation with representatives of the mining industry, one very senior person casually mentioned that people had been going overseas to the World Heritage Commission to find out what could be done in Australia. They had to go to a group of people representing countries&mdash;I do not know which ones&mdash;some of which might just have similar mineral potential and would rather develop theirs than ours. Of course, we can bet theirs is not under heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of our private sector are now travelling overseas. The tragedy of it was that these blokes did not mention it as being something of horror or shock; they have come to learn that they have to spend money to travel overseas to get approval to carry out works and to create employment and development and overseas income in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation becomes even more ironic when we are going through a great national debate, spearheaded by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that puts the case that Australians should be independent of foreign influence and that they should consequently be able to set their own agendas. Of course, we know what that is all about. It is about the Prime Minister's personal hatred of the United Kingdom and, of course, the fact that our political system happens to rely on the Westminster system&mdash;it is not bound to it by any means, but it relies on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister runs around saying to people, `Would you like to be independent?'. If he asked me that question, the answer would be yes. If he asked anybody else, the answer would be yes. When, having decided on that, he says to people, `What sort of political system would you like?', or, `What sort of election or appointment of a head of state would you like?'&mdash;when they get the options put before them&mdash;they start to worry. But that is what we are having put to us in one breath whilst, from research that I have conducted, as of 1992 Australia had signed 112 treaties or conventions with the United Nations, each one committing the people of Australia to knuckle their forehead to foreign influence. Let us get it straight. If the Prime Minister positively agrees with a free and independent Australia, why does he do those sorts of things?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My research takes me a bit further. When I look at this documentation, which I think might be from reports on the constitutional debates, which talks about the external affairs power and the power of the executive&mdash;originally vested, of course, in the crown under our constitution&mdash;to sign treaties without consultation of the parliament, I find out how other countries which do have a national pride and a pride in their constitution or bill of rights deal with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States, the constitution gives the President the executive power to make treaties, but only if two-thirds of senators present concur. In that case, because the Senate is the states house of America, as it is the states house of Australia, each state, represented by its senators, has to give approval&mdash;up to two-thirds; a very high majority. That is how the Americans deal with it. They do not just sign their lives away. Furthermore, it is recognised in the United States that the treaty-making power is subject to some limitations, in that it cannot be used to override expressed prohibitions contained in the constitution such as the guarantees of liberty as contained in the bill of rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we not do that? If we so dearly love our country and our independence, why do we use the signing of treaties for the express purpose of overriding our constitution? Why have we created a situation, as we have with this heritage legislation&mdash;we are dealing with a component of it today&mdash;where businessmen have to travel overseas to talk to foreigners? Our miners have told me this personally, without complaining about it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen this matter become almost a low farce. One of the great rights written in our constitution is the right of land management. The heritage legislation imposes itself particularly on that right and certainly on items that are above the ground. It is very much associated with land management. Section 51(xxxi) of the constitution, which deals with the power that is given to the Commonwealth, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws.</PARA>
<PARA>That right of the Commonwealth contains the very powerful caveat of just terms. If the Commonwealth puts itself into the business of land management, it will pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing these sorts of treaties, be they in the heritage legislation or the external affairs power&mdash;in other words, the Racial Discrimination Act, et cetera&mdash;all being used to override the rights set down in our constitution for the people of a state. I underline that. So often we hear people sneer at the concept of states rights because they perceive them as the power of a premier or the elected government, forgetting that they are the elected government and that they do have that right. The people have elected them and expect them to represent their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear today in the MPI the comments of two speakers as to how Carmen Lawrence failed to do that. She gave away railway lines and our licensing system, et cetera. State premiers are not supposed to do all those things. They are elected to do the specific job of representing the interests of people, which vary from state to state for all sorts of good and proper reasons. That is where I want to come to on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Senate, at least in voting terms, is still representative of the interests of the people of each state in equal numbers. Senator Harradine has proposed in the Senate in various ways since at least 1983 that the Senate be given some power to approve of these various treaties before they are signed. Should this parliament go out and sign these treaties, as it surely has in the industrial relations area in recent times? I wonder whether it rang up the ILO and asked it to write out a few treaties in the area of industrial relations so that it could sign them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most people would know, particularly from the constitutional debates, it was only at the last second that the founding fathers chose to put anything in our constitution relevant to industrial relations. Even then, they were given a power to conciliate and arbitrate, and that was the end of it. But that has been expanded by the government's rushing off to the ILO, signing treaties and conventions and then coming back here and imposing requirements and laws across all of Australia when the people of certain states with elected governments had an entirely different view. They elected those governments on the platform of that entirely different view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Western Australia were in no doubt about what the Court government proposed to do in the area of industrial relations when they voted it into office. It was not only clearly known in its policy; it was advertised day after day by the trade union movement in a massive scare campaign. The people voted for Court and that policy. The federal government's signing a treaty will overrule the wishes of the people of Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of the bill is the use of the heritage legislation to implement certain agreements between the Queensland government and the Commonwealth government. The only reason the Commonwealth government has any right to have this legislation before the parliament and have it likely to survive in the High Court is that it signed a treaty. It gave this property to the heritage commission at the United Nations. Although we still seem to be running it reasonably well ourselves, I wonder how long it will be before some group of tourist operators comes to me, as has the mining industry, and says, `We have to save some money. Can we get a government grant? We have to go to the heritage commission to find if we can build a motel'. That is the basis of what I am talking about. I am coming to the very core of what this is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very core of this matter is the external affairs power and whether or not executives on my side of politics, the Labor side of politics or some new side of politics should be able to do in Australia what practically no other country in the world does. Certainly those with the pride in their nation that the Americans have do not do it. The Americans do not give the President the right to go off signing treaties; they make it subject to a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Not even the Senate can override its constitution. Yet these sorts of treaties are being used in Australia for that express purpose, and it is wrong. That is why, in many ways, we can ask questions about this specific legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with what the Commonwealth government chooses to do, because the people of the state of Queensland, through their elected government, have already taken action. That is why I support this piece of legislation. Of course, there are still those who lost their jobs, livelihood, future and lifestyle. I suppose that is not the only time it has happened. However, it is amazing how people losing their jobs on an oil rig was of great concern to the Western Australian Labor Party but people who lost their jobs through a national park listing in Western Australia was not. All those good people in the timber industry came around today to see us. They ran a candidate against the Labor Party in Western Australia in the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who have voted for Labor all their lives are the victims. That has been proven time and again. Through initiatives taken in our state with CALM, in association with the Commonwealth, good programs can be laid down for conservation in state governments. State governments are on the ground. They know about these things. There is no need for these sorts of treaties generally if the people of a state do not want them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been too much politics in this program. People will stand up in this chamber in 20 or 30 years time and condemn us for this expedient political approach. They will condemn us because they will be sick of going overseas to get permission to do what they would normally do in Australia as independent Australians. No other country would sell its own people out in this fashion just to centralise a bit of power.

The two pieces of legislation will implement the terms of an agreement originally struck between the premier of Queensland and the then Prime Minister on 16 November 1990. The agreement provides for an approach of cooperative management towards this environmentally sensitive region.

Senator Ian Macdonald was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 9 February of this year as opposing the appointment of an Aboriginal representative onto the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Apparently, Senator Macdonald and his coalition colleagues do not believe that Aboriginal people should have a voice in the wet tropics. They fail to appreciate that this region contains the only recognised Australian Aboriginal rainforest culture. Parts of the area around the remote Russel Valley are believed to hold un-excavated records dating back more than 10,000 years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If we look at the history of our government in this respect, I believe it is one that we can be very proud of. Over the past decade Labor has saved the Franklin River in Tasmania, stepped up efforts to help conserve the Barrier Reef, spent $320 million on landcare projects and been at the forefront of the international campaign to stop mining in the Antarctic. These are not insignificant achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990s, Labor nominated Fraser Island, Macquarie Island and parts of the Antarctic for world heritage listing; set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets; passed endangered species legislation; and focused on urban environmental concerns such as water and air quality as well as waste minimisation. It is important in this respect to refer to the Council of Australian Governments meeting in Hobart, attended by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), where an agreement on national guidelines for air pollution, water quality and noise emission was achieved. It was a considerable achievement to attain the cooperation of state governments on matters that are of vital importance to Australia. This is one area that the former minister, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), has worked unceasingly on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has also established a process for ecologically sustainable development. Under the former minister, Labor established the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency and the Australian Heritage Commission. It also granted funding for community conservation groups through the voluntary conservation organisations scheme. This gives a greater number of Australians the opportunity to participate in green issues at the community level. There is a raft of other achievements which, if time permits, I will refer to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor policies have seen Australia become a leader in world environment policy. Australia is a world leader in implementing the World Heritage Convention with nine properties on the World Heritage List&mdash;something that the honourable member for O'Connor appears to deplore. This country has earned worldwide praise and recognition for not allowing mining in Kakadu or on Fraser Island. These are areas where the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has said that no harm would be done. With over half of Australia's forests and three-quarters of Australia's rainforests lost since European settlement, Labor has gone a long way towards rectifying this imbalance by its recognition of the wet tropics of North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the opposition going to offer us had it succeeded in gaining power just under 12 months ago? Unlike the coalition, which has been notorious for opposing the listing of world heritage areas, we have a commendable record. Under the opposition's discredited and discarded Fightback package, the power of veto over world heritage areas would have been handed back to the states. As the former minister said in an MPI three weeks ago, the opposition will always kowtow to the states on environment matters, as on many other matters of policy. That is another reason why those opposite are still in opposition. Their policies would enable some development minded state governments to exploit areas of environmental significance and embarrass Australia's reputation as a green leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past decade the coalition has opposed the protection of the Franklin River, campaigned for the expansion of uranium mining and perpetuated the myth of `black and green' tape to support developers. Under Fightback it would have withdrawn funding for community conservation groups, slashed by half the budget of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, demoted the significance of the Australian Heritage Commission, increased petrol consumption by up to 25 per cent, thereby increasing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and&mdash;very importantly for the electorate of Capricornia and elsewhere&mdash;axed $10 million worth of funding to the Bureau of Meteorology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was delighted to represent the former minister in opening the new Bureau of Meteorology in Rockhampton. I was gratified to learn that not only the staff of the bureau but all those who use its vital weather forecasting facilities were thrilled and delighted to have this new facility in Rockhampton, an area that has in previous times been affected by floods and cyclones. It is vital to the beef industry in particular&mdash;I hope the honourable member for Wide Bay would agree with me&mdash;that we have effective weather forecasting across this country. But in the name of economic rationalism and in its wonderful Fightback package, those opposite were going to take $10 million off the Bureau of Meteorology. They would have expanded nuclear energy facilities, including the use of nuclear power stations. This is the sort of environmental nonsense they were peddling. It is one of the many reasons why they lost the plot and the election just under 12 months ago.</PARA>

Of course, she also led the debate today for the opposition. In that previous debate she had the audacity to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The environmental health of Australians has suffered and the Australian environment itself has deteriorated.</PARA>
<PARA>In her speech she focused on a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A green league of nations</EMPHASIS> which suggested that the OECD had said that Australia's standing was rather poor. Let me mention that the report is not in fact an official OECD report. It is a report by a private group, the New Economics Foundation, which produced the report for an English newspaper. Many people have called into question the validity of some of its assessments. The authors themselves said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was a relatively quick and dirty exercise . . . The eleven indicators (on which the scoring was based) represent a relatively ad hoc selection of potential indicators . . . While mindful of some valid problems in interpreting the data . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This was a less than valid exercise but, typically, it was used by the opposition to slate our performance. On that occasion the honourable member for Hindmarsh said that we had turned world heritage in this country into an absolute farce and a joke. She failed to say that the reason why most of the information did not go to this organisation to provide an effective report was that the state governments did not provide the information, whereas the federal government had provided a 30-page submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we all remember about that MPI on the environment was the abysmal performance of the opposition spokesperson on these matters, the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I will just refer to a couple of the issues she raised. She asked the minister, `Where is the biodiversity strategy?'. Well, the strategy for biodiversity was approved by cabinet in 1993 and it is freely available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hindmarsh also took the then minister to task for her role in the bushfires. While the bushfires were raging, the former minister was consulting with the New South Wales environment minister to discuss assistance for burnt out national parks.

The fine record of this government and the record of the former minister have resulted in very effective strategies for not only the wet tropics of Queensland but also a whole raft of environmentally important issues that this government has been prepared to take up and get on with the job of doing, in contrast to the fossilised views of those opposite who come in here and continue to carp. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have the privilege as Australians to live in a beautiful country which has many magnificent natural resources, scenery and an environment that is the envy of many other places in the world. We should be proud of that and accept our responsibilities to care for it. Sadly, Australia's record over the years has not always been without blemish. I find it disappointing that the government seems to choose to hang its environmental credentials on world heritage listing. It has been particularly in the area of world heritage listing that this government has failed dismally. It has failed in its administration of our responsibilities to the World Heritage Convention but, perhaps more importantly, it has failed to satisfy the people who have been affected in world heritage areas and it has failed to provide appropriate management plans to support our obligations in world heritage areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be on the World Heritage List should be a great honour. But in Australia it has been turned into a politically divisive matter which has caused a great deal of anxiety and concern in the community. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Labor government has brutally used the questionable foreign affairs powers to usurp a role over management of vast areas of Australia. If the conservationists had their way and their wish list were agreed to, perhaps half the country would be world heritage listed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take that kind of an approach cheapens the whole world heritage process. Instead of our world heritage areas being very special places, unique in the world, the extension of the list indiscriminately to almost any piece of territory that the conservationists cross cheapens those areas that have already been listed and degrades the whole process. What has happened in Australia is that, as a result of the aggressive attitude the Labor government has adopted towards world heritage listing, a fear of the world heritage listing process has built up around the country. I frequently hear in my electorate it being referred to as some kind of international conspiracy to subvert our national sovereignty. It should not be regarded in that light. But, because of the way in which the government has treated the world heritage process, it is not surprising that there is this kind of negative community reaction to the whole issue of world heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the process has been grossly oversold by many people, within both the conservation movement and, sadly, the government. It is simply a nonsense to suggest that by merely world heritage listing an area its protection is guaranteed. It does nothing of itself to protect an area. In my electorate, the government proposed to nominate to the World Heritage List the Tin Can Bay heavy artillery firing range. This is an area that has been blasted, bulldozed, bombed, shelled, mortared and mined for quite some years. Yet it was the intention of the government&mdash;and this was clearly stated by the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), in a written answer to a question I asked&mdash;to continue to shell, mortar and bomb this area even after it had been world heritage listed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if it is acceptable to bomb, mortar and blast an area that has been world heritage listed, it is quite clear that to merely put it on the list offers no protection at all. The protection of a world heritage area comes from a management plan that is developed to care for the area or by declaring parts of the area a national park. Indeed, national park status offers much greater surety of protection and a much greater guarantee that the area will be looked after and cared for for future generations than does world heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) suggested that it was world heritage listing that led to the protection of the North Queensland rainforests. That is a nonsense. It is the fact that the area is a national park that has led to the pristine forest areas being protected. It is the management plans which may be developed and which ensure the area is appropriately planned that will guarantee the protection of the area. World heritage listing of itself does nothing other than to put the area on a list. It does nothing other than draw attention to its existence. It is the management plan that is put in place that is critical to the future protection of an area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think it is essential that before any area is proposed to be included in the World Heritage List the management plan should be developed. For instance, before the government goes to an area and says, `We are considering nominating 900,000 hectares of this area for world heritage listing', the management plan must be put before the Australian people. It should particularly be put before the people who are likely to be affected by the listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would not have been the controversy associated with our world heritage listings if people had known what was proposed for the area before the nomination was made. Much of the concern is built around a lack of knowledge of what it means to be world heritage listed. Much of the concern is also built around the fact that everyone knows that many of the claims being made by the proponents of world heritage listing are utterly baseless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, it is a complete nonsense to suggest that all we have to do is world heritage list an area and there will be an instant tourism boom. In fact, history has suggested the opposite. We find that with most areas that have been world heritage listed once the controversy dies down they generally suffer a reduction in the number of visitations and it requires a long, detailed and extensive promotions campaign to build up interest in that area once again and to get tourists flowing back into the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Promotion is what encourages tourism. Appropriate tourism developments and infrastructure are what support the tourist industry. World heritage listing is merely something that can be used as a marketing tool. It does nothing to guarantee visitations to the area. Sadly, when management plans are developed they often lock tourists out of areas that they have previously visited. They place restrictions on the number of people who may be able to visit an area and they reduce the opportunities and the freedom people have to visit areas that they previously were able to visit. I think that is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are developing an environmental elitism in Australia which says that not only should we protect an area but also Australians should not visit it as well. It is frankly pointless to declare environmental parks and world heritage listed areas and then say to the Australian people that they are off limits for all but those in an elite group. We want to retain our special areas and we want to look after those parts of Australia that future generations have a right to enjoy, but a part of caring for them must surely also involve a regime for enjoying those areas. When we lock up an area and exclude people from visiting it we do not do our environment or our community a service. We need to build on and take advantage of the special areas that we have in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that in developing plans for our world heritage areas we be sure that we take into our confidence the local people&mdash;ensuring that they play an active part in developing a management plan. It should not be just academics in faraway places that develop the management plans. I think that has been part of the trouble that has occurred in the North Queensland wet tropics. People have been brought in from outside to develop management plans and to play a supervisory role over what should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is beyond doubt, as was suggested in the survey referred to by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), that there is a view in North Queensland that the World Heritage Management Authority has caused needless delays through senseless bureaucracy and that the management processes have slowed down any kind of development or use of the region's natural resources. In fact, on many occasions it has been necessary to go to the ministerial council to try to break through deadlocks that have occurred in the management arrangements. Relying on environment ministers to break deadlocks is clearly going to mean a long, delayed process being associated with whatever may happen in the region. </PARA>

It is interesting that members of the government get up and say that world heritage listing is a great bonus that is going to bring instant wealth and riches to a region, but that they then find it necessary to offer compensation packages. The compensation packages are necessary because when logging is stopped and developments are prevented there are job losses. Ask the people of Ravenshoe, Maryborough, or of other world heritage areas.

This money has tended to be thrown into those areas without any responsibility, without any care being given to the way in which it is to be spent. In the case of the North Queensland compensation package something like $7 million went to the wrong organisation. This was money utterly wasted. In my own electorate the story is sadly similar. Most of the money has actually gone to pay the wages of Queensland government public servants. Very little of it has gone to the workers or the companies who have lost their livelihoods. Most of the money has gone to pay the wages of public servants to do work they otherwise would have done anyhow. No-one in the Commonwealth seems to be standing up to ensure that this money is wisely spent. </PARA>

That is about as logical as these calculations have been&mdash;$13 million was added to the Fraser Island compensation package to pay capital gains tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a lot more on a future occasion to this House about the way in which the $51 million allocated to the Fraser Island compensation package has been spent. It has been equally as great a scandal as the North Queensland compensation package. That is simply not good enough. It is not good enough for government members to absolve themselves from responsibility by thinking of a big number and pretending to spend that amount of money in an area. A proper management plan should be developed which minimises inconvenience and maximises the benefit to the area, guarantees protection, and ensures that the area is available for future use while ensuring that the resources available are used to their maximum benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropics bill initially attracted little opposition. However, amendments made to it&mdash;largely at the instigation of the Australian Democrats but supported by the government&mdash;have done considerable damage to the bill. The Democrats have added a totally illogical preamble. This is a bill about protecting the North Queensland wet tropics. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) said, the North Queensland wet tropics were listed because of their nature and conservation values, not because of any particular involvement with the Aboriginal people. The preamble added to this bill is utterly illogical. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . considerations taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal people have occupied, used, and enjoyed land in the Area since time immemorial.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure what `time immemorial' means. I certainly question whether Aboriginal people have been in the area since time immemorial, anyhow. The preamble then goes on to justify the entire bill on the basis that Aborigines were there previously. It ignores the real reasons why this bill is in existence; namely, that the area was nominated and accepted for world heritage listing because of its great nature and conservation values. It is therefore illogical for the bill to require the Commonwealth to appoint an Aborigine as one of its two representatives on the management authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly Aborigines live in that particular area. I have no objection whatsoever to an Aborigine being appointed to the management authority so long as that appointment is on merit and the Aborigine is able to contribute in a constructive way towards the management of that large area and bring with him or her the necessary skills to provide a benefit to the authority. But I object, as a matter of principle, to people being chosen irrespective of their ability just because they are Aborigines. Two per cent or thereabouts of that region's population are probably Aborigines, yet 50 per cent of the Commonwealth nominees have to be Aborigines. That is just illogical. There are probably more Italians than Aboriginals living in that area yet there is no requirement to have an Italian or anybody else of a particular race on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we set a very dangerous precedent in this bill when we start talking about appointing people to government positions on the basis of their race. It is indeed racism of the worst kind. If this bill were to say that no Aborigine shall be appointed to the management authority there would be widespread condemnation and I would join in that condemnation, but it is equally silly to say that people must be appointed to this authority just because of their race. I think that this is an objectionable addition to the bill by way of amendment initiated by the Democrats and supported by members of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World heritage listing was granted because of the area's nature and conservation values, not because Aborigines have made their way over that particular area in previous generations. The appointees&mdash;of which there are only two&mdash;need to be appointed on their merits. The current appointees are Dr Keto, a well-known conservationist, and a Mr Donaghy from the Cairns tourism authority. I find it hard to believe that the Commonwealth government will not want to pander to its environmentalist lobby and appoint an environmentalist as one of the representatives to the board. Does that mean that the local tourist industry and the local land-holders, many of whom have their land world heritage listed, are not going to be represented in any way on this management authority? I find that objectionable and disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not bad enough, this bill also requires the Commonwealth to lean on the Queensland government to appoint an Aborigine as one of its representatives. Again, I think it is totally inappropriate for the Commonwealth to try to decide who the Queensland government should appoint as its representatives. It is also objectionable that the Queensland government should be required to appoint somebody on the basis of race. This bill is therefore demeaning of Aborigines. It is insulting to them to suggest that they are unable to be appointed on their merits and that specific positions need to be created on this basis. The ex-minister in her first reading speech got it right when she pointed out that this particular bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provides for a regime of cooperative management of this sensitive and unique environment . . .

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the pursuit of balance in environmental matters is possibly the most challenging agenda facing Australia's decision makers. Sometimes the balance has gone one way and sometimes it has gone the other way. There has been a national debate on the area of the wet tropics, covered by this Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill. On the one hand, the logging community of North Queensland had an industry that was viable, sustainable and which sought to preserve and maintain ongoing use of the timber that continues to grow in that area. On the other hand, militant environmentalists felt that it was important to sacrifice that industry in the interests of preserving the thousands of hectares of rainforest. Everyone would also support the protection of world important flora and fauna. So this argument went to and fro: on the one hand, the argument for jobs, the economy, certainty and development and, on the other hand, concerns about the environment. The government has not really had the right approach in very many areas.

It enables the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to nominate members to the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, you yourself very accurately pointed out how the amendments forced on the government by the Australian Democrats require this parliament and the federal government to discriminate by having an Aborigine on that authority, not on the basis of competence&mdash;no-one would object to Aborigines being on the authority on the basis of competence&mdash;but on the basis of their race. In some respects, we could say that the amendment forced on the government by the Democrats is a racist amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you pointed out very accurately, Mr Deputy Speaker, the amendment requiring an Aboriginal person to be placed on the authority by the federal government is demeaning to Aboriginal people. Furthermore, the government, as part of its deal to secure passage of the legislation through the Senate, had to agree to have the federal parliament bring its powers of persuasion to bear on the Queensland Labor government to follow suit. In other words, one Aborigine will be appointed by the federal government and possibly a second Aborigine appointed by the state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, if they are the right people, the best people and the most competent people to be appointed on merit, I for one would not object, but I am opposed to tokenism. I am also opposed to racist appointments. After all, the whole idea of world heritage listing is to protect the unique environment of the area. It is not designed to pander to any group in the community, particularly one which may well have had a very long association with the land but which makes up only two per cent of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at the preamble to the legislation, inserted at the insistence of the Democrats, I sometimes wonder whether the Democrats are seeking to establish the basis for some kind of Mabo claim. The preamble says:</PARA>

I hope that, upon return to government and when the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), is a minister with some responsibility for this area, we will in fact repeal the native title legislation, which is a recipe for racial disharmony and uncertainty.

Many local people in Ravenshoe were owed many thousands of dollars and they have been declared bankrupt. That is a tragedy. The community was paid a lot of money&mdash;blood money, as I think you described it in your own speech, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;to compensate people for this so-called wonderful thing called world heritage listing, yet the money has not got through to and has not benefited the community, the people who have in fact been required to suffer financially and personally as a result of a decision which was deemed to be in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the situation concerning Ravenshoe not to say necessarily that it was wrong that such a fragile environment should be protected but simply to highlight the problems which occur when a federal government is prepared to use the powers given to it by the High Court, through the very wide interpretation of the external affairs power, to ride roughshod over the views of local people and local and state governments. </PARA>

It is also important to have a responsible decision making process when it comes to environmental issues. </PARA>

The wet tropics is home to an incredibly diverse range of primitive angiosperm, a flowering plant family. Of this particular species, 13 of the 19 can be found in the wet tropics. Some of the trees in the wet tropics region are estimated to be more than 3,000 years old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to note that in this legislation, and in the complementary legislation carried by the Queensland parliament, provision has been made for the day-to-day management to be carried out by the state government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All over&mdash;I am familiar with this part of the country which is the subject of this item of legislation. I share some of the concerns that have been expressed today, but I also share pleasure that many parts are part of a world heritage situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropics of Queensland represent a truly remarkable part of the Australian landscape. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will know by now, the wet tropics cover an area of 900,000 hectares between Townsville and Cooktown. The area is designated as state forest and national park, although a timber reserve accounts for just under nine per cent of the area. I would digress from my notes to say that I, too, am one of the people who believe that the borders of the wet tropics land were drawn far too broadly and widely and contain areas that should not be part of the world wet tropics area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is the diversity of plants and animals contained within the wet tropics which make this area such as an environmental asset to this country. It has been estimated that some trees within the rainforest are over 3,000 years old. The oldest tree I have seen there is estimated at 400 years old, and I must tell you that it is a wreck. The area is also home to a wide variety of native Australian fauna. So it is not surprising that this particular area should be the focus of environmental debate in this place&mdash;not enough, but at least we have one of the few opportunities to debate it at this time. What is surprising, however, is this government's and in particular the former environment minister's lack of action in the world heritage area. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) has already covered this topic within this debate, though I will make some comments later in regard to the former minister or, as she should be correctly called, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is basically non-controversial and merely implements the agreement between the Queensland state government and the Commonwealth government which was signed in November 1990. This is a complementary bill to the Queensland Wet Tropics World Heritage Protection and Management Act 1993, which was enacted by the Queensland state government last year. And I say full marks to the Queensland government for taking only three years to bring in its legislation; it is better than the Commonwealth, which has taken four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is generally customary with bills of this nature, the coalition will not be opposing this legislation. That should come as no surprise, for the coalition has a proud record of achievement on real environmental matters. In regard to world heritage, which we are debating here today, I think it is timely to remind the House that it was the coalition which secured the listing of the Great Barrier Reef, the Willandra Lakes and Kakadu on the World Heritage Register in 1981. To hear some of the speakers on the other side today, their memory obviously does not go back quite far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A year later, the coalition had proposed the listing of the Lord Howe Islands group and the western Tasmanian wilderness area on the World Heritage Register. It was, in fact, a coalition government which first established a federal environment department, and it was also a coalition government which proclaimed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park&mdash;something that is forgotten when we are talking about the then Queensland government and the Commonwealth government at that time. It also created the Kakadu and Uluru parks. So there is ample evidence of the coalition's prior achievements in environmental protection, and particularly in the area of world heritage listing. As a parliamentary member of the coalition at the time of those achievements, I think it is timely and important that, as we debate this issue of world heritage, we recall that the coalition brings to this debate a history of real achievement regarding world heritage matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this bill is not contentious, though the preamble has presented problems as have been discussed fully&mdash;and I use the correct titles&mdash;by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). The agreement between the Queensland state government and the Commonwealth allows for the Commonwealth to nominate two directors to the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Clause 5 of this bill deals with that aspect. The bill, via clause 6, also allows the process whereby Commonwealth public servants can be seconded to the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Listening to the debate, I cannot recall anyone having quite pointed that out before. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final main provision of the bill, clause 8, as I understand it, is to make it obligatory for the report of the authority to be tabled in parliament within 15 days of its receipt each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There does not appear to be much else contained within this bill, except the preamble. In terms of financial implications, the bill has no beneficial financial effects. However, it is my understanding that the agreement provides that the Commonwealth contributes $10 million for capital works and other such costs in the general management of the wet tropics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, have been to Ravenshoe and visited there shortly after the troubles that the then minister for the environment went through. I am distressed to hear that Ravenshoe is now a mendicant town. As non-contentious as this bill may appear, past experience has shown that one has to be very careful in having the former minister for the environment, the honourable member for Canberra now, responsible for administering public money, but that seems to have passed now. However, in view of her resignation yesterday, it is readily apparent to the opposition, the press and the general public that this former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories was hopelessly incompetent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat ironic then that, at a time when the absolute incompetence of the former Minister is on the front page of every newspaper in the country, we are debating a bill which was going to give the minister more money to administer. This is a sad irony, which becomes all the more intriguing when one considers that the electorates which contain the wet tropics are actually marginal Labor electorates&mdash;Leichhardt and Herbert. Presumably, the funding arrangements for this wet tropics agreement were worked out on the whiteboard in the former minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I issue a welcome to the new Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Richardson, who in reality is being retreaded&mdash;not that his experiences in North Queensland bear talking about today; I will do that at a future time and in some detail. However, it is interesting to note that it was Senator Richardson who was the minister responsible for the listing of the wet tropics on the World Heritage Register in December 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the articles in the press in recent days have focused on the froth and bubble style of ministerial practice of the former minister for the environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has continued the practice of previous Labor governments in making major government announcements outside the parliament. The former minister for the environment, the honourable member for Canberra, also avoided parliamentary scrutiny of her decisions in a similar manner&mdash;and did so constantly.

The government and the former minister did not take seriously the concerns of people living in areas proposed to be listed on the World Heritage Register, as illustrated by the example of Lake Eyre.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January of this year the National Farmers Federation made a plea to the former minister, the honourable member for Canberra, for compensation for farmers who have been affected by world heritage listing. I do not know whether the NFF received a response from her. I surmise that she was preoccupied with other activities&mdash;of a sporting nature  perhaps. While it is all very well for the former minister to seek publicity by making pronouncements on environmental matters, this needs to be supported by community consultation and effective management to ensure that any such decisions are properly implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the former minister was very good at seeking the publicity limelight, but when it came to the hard graft of making sure these environmental decisions were fair and supported by an ongoing process of review, she was seriously lacking. That is why we should not be deluding ourselves into thinking that Australia does not have environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent OECD report, which was a damning indictment of Australia's environmental record, is testament to this. This report was a badge of shame for the former minister for the environment. It goes to the heart of the matter that it is substance that counts in environmental matters and not grabbing a few headlines here and there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a minor one, and I do not intend to take much more of the House's time. I raise one final issue which relates to the relative popularity of seeking world heritage listings. In March last year Mr Bing Lucas, the Chairman of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN&mdash;the Commission on National Parks and Protected Areas&mdash;made some sensible comments in relation to world heritage. Mr Lucas was of the view that some conservation groups had attempted to `get on the world heritage bandwagon'. He said that some conservationists were unrealistic in their ambitions about world heritage. We know that. I have a tendency to agree with Mr Lucas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that, when assessing whether or not an area is suitable to be listed on the World Heritage Register, four criteria are used. First, the site must be an outstanding site exemplifying the earth's evolutionary history. Second, the site must be an outstanding example representing ongoing geological processes, biological evolution and the interaction between humans and their natural environment. Third, the site must contain superlative natural phenomena, formations or features. Fourth, the site must contain important and significant natural habitats where threatened species of animals or plants of outstanding value live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a site to be listed on the world register it is clear that it has to be very special environmentally; otherwise the concept of world heritage will become debased. So we have to be careful in nominating sites for proposed listing on the register. I believe that some conservation groups do no service to their cause by downplaying the significance of what it means for an area to be listed on the world heritage register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will naturally support this bill in accordance with its proud record of achievement on environmental records. But in this process we urge the new minister to seriously examine the consequences that such listings on the world register may have for local communities. I do not know whether the new minister, Senator Richardson, is earmarked for the environmental portfolio for the long run. Much of the press comment seems to indicate that he will be a caretaker minister while the government anxiously awaits the outcome of the Fremantle by-election. I caution the government not to count its chickens before they are hatched. The Liberal Party has an excellent candidate for this by-election and I for one would not be surprised if the former Premier of Western Australia did not make it to Canberra. That is not relevant to the bill, but I felt like saying it. Be that as it may, I request of the new minister for the environment, for however long he will remain within this portfolio&mdash;</PARA>

I also wish the parliament well whenever it has a world heritage matter brought before it.

The Great Barrier Reef was listed as a result of the joint efforts of the coalition government of Prime Minister Fraser and the Queensland government led by Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. I think it is appropriate that we realise that in Australia today there is a greater feeling and attachment to the environment than there ever has been in the past. So this bill comes at an appropriate time to make that acknowledgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill formalises an agreement by the state of Queensland and the Commonwealth to work together to conserve the wet tropics. It covers basically three areas. First, it enables the Commonwealth to nominate two members to the six-member board of directors of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Secondly, it enables the Commonwealth minister to make Australian Public Service personnel available to the WTMA. Thirdly, it provides for the annual report of the authority to be tabled in the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has had a chequered career. Agreement was reached between the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Premier of Queensland back in 1990. But the protection of this whole area under world heritage goes back to 1986-87. It is that part of it that has had a chequered career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropics is a protected area of 900,000 hectares. It is only a small portion of the Queensland land base which, unfortunately, has been diminishing as far as tree structures are concerned. I go on record with others to say that there was an excess extravagance by those who drew up the boundaries which affected, and are still affecting, the livelihood of many people in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, along with other members of the coalition, I visited the wetlands and rainforests. I was able to see that, in spite of the great emotion that was building up against the Queensland government of the day, a great management plan had been in place for the previous 20 to 30 years which involved selective logging of the areas, making sure there was regeneration and actively managing the areas. But a large stick has been used. These are now world heritage areas. It was quite incorrect to say that the areas were under the threat of being detimbered and that those in the forestry department were a lot of vandals. This was obviously a political ploy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should have been at that stage, and there should be in the future, a greater awareness of the effect that a declaration would have on the lives of people. The reality is that people elect us to this parliament. It would be interesting to go back to those areas now to try to find out where the $75 million which was appropriated for structural adjustment was spent. I know that an $8 million contribution is the subject of an inquiry because the money was not actually spent in the area; it was spent down south, below the border, to provide new sawmills. As somebody else has said, a great amount of that money has gone to public servants, not to the people who lost jobs or to the small businesses that closed down. When we were in Ravenshoe we looked at the problems that would develop if it were declared a world heritage area. Unfortunately, we now have the reality. As I said, it is very difficult to find what the $75 million has been used for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to realise the effect that this type of declaration will have on the lives of people. We are dealing with the opportunities of the people and the quality of life of people. We are looking at jobs. The prospects of many people have been unfairly diminished by a situation which I believe was not entirely necessary. It is no good going back over the past, except to learn from the past when entering into future declarations. One of the things that has been learnt by the environmental people is that unless a sovereign state steps forward and says it wants an area to be under a heritage listing, it should not be the prerogative of a central government using external powers to achieve that end. This did create a lot of bitterness and that bitterness stays on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are not talking about the only wet tropics area or the only rainforest in Australia. At the back of Mackay is an area which has been declared as a national park for the last 20 or 30 years&mdash;again, the product of a conservative government in Queensland. It is not correct to say that certain people were rapists in respect of everything to do with the environment. I have been to that national park. Recently the park asked for advice on the management plan. Not knowing much about timber, I wrote back and suggested that if it was looking at a management plan, it might change the name of the park from the Eungella National Park to the Ian Wood National Park&mdash;</PARA>

He is associated with it and loves it. It was a real pleasure to get to know the chap at that time. If ever two people have done so much work for the environment in identifying, establishing and trying to retain the flora we have, it is these two people.

She secretly learnt how to fly. In due course, she had to let her husband know what she was doing. From 1931 to 1937, in what is called a remarkable six-year burst, she set a number of aviation records, both Australian and world records, that have never been equalled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member were any great success, he would not be here! The truth is that this system was, in many ways, self-regulating because those who got a grant had to put in a certain percentage of the money. Most of these grants went to local government. So there was a clear incentive to ensure that the program was real and beneficial. The money was not paid until the project was finished or until contracts were signed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Engaging in McCarthyist tactics of continually shifting the questions all the time is bound to create some conflict. It was claimed that the honourable member for Canberra had misled the House by saying that she had not authorised any grants that had fallen outside the guidelines. The opposition then turned up a grant of $11,000 for a band. It was quite reasonable and correct of the former minister to say, `This wasn't outside the guidelines because it was referred to me by my department and I said that the scheme was okay'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department looked at the guidelines and said that those guidelines required the money to be spent on capital equipment but then said, `These people only want to buy instruments'. For a band, instruments are capital equipment. A band does not need houses or buildings unless it wants to play the bongos on the roof of a tin shed. So the accusation regarding that grant was petty, mean-spirited and highly political&mdash;McCarthyist in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has this arisen? The answer is clear: the opposition simply has no policy. This is very dangerous for Australia because the one thing the Westminster system needs is a good opposition. It is quite clear that we have not had that in this House in recent years. If we had had a good opposition there is no doubt that we would have been a better government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority into the NCA's use of underworld figure James McCartney Anderson as a protected witness should be a matter of public alarm. The report outlines how the NCA ignored a murder to convict Abe Saffron on tax avoidance charges. The NCA spent more than $157,000 on Saffron's former business associate, Anderson, funding a number of overseas trips for him, all to obtain his testimony against Saffron&mdash;testimony of doubtful value. Page 94 of the report shows that if Anderson had not been used as an informant he would almost certainly have been charged and convicted with Saffron. Who said that crime does not pay?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureaucrats at the newly formed NCA were so keen to get their No. 1 target that they ignored the evidence of Anderson's more serious criminality and involvement in the murder of Juanita Nielsen. For the NCA, the ends justified the means. Common decency went out the window in a rush to justify the organisation's existence. In failing to investigate the Nielsen murder, the NCA joined elements of the New South Wales police in a shameful cover-up of the murder of an innocent woman&mdash;a person whose only crime was to oppose property development in the street where she lived, as thousands of residents do throughout cities everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week's report by the New South Wales ICAC's Commissioner Temby is a timely reminder that corruption still reaches into the higher echelons of the New South Wales police. Today, one of the original investigators in charge of the Nielsen case is in line for the job of commissioner. I refer to Assistant Commissioner Norm Maroney, who was also attached to the NCA when Jim Anderson was an informant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 July 1975, two days after Mrs Nielsen disappeared at Anderson's Carousel club, the duty officer at Darlinghurst police questioned Eddie Trigg, the club's night manager. Trigg said that Mrs Nielsen had gone to the club `about publicity for the disco', according to the committee report. He then said, `I told her that the directors of the establishment had decided not to advertise at that time due to poor business'. The next evening, detectives Maroney and Karl Arkins interviewed Trigg, who contradicted his first story and said that he paid Mrs Nielsen $130 for a half-page ad and that she had then left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The veracity of the statements of Trigg and Anderson were accepted without question, as was any evidence which indicated that Nielsen had departed from the club. They were apparently not willing to listen to persuasive evidence that connected her disappearance with her opposition to the redevelopment of Victoria Street by Frank Theeman, a friend of Anderson. They apparently accepted a report by an associate of Anderson that he had seen Nielsen getting into a yellow car, thus taking her away from the Carousel club where her murder almost certainly occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on this evidence, Assistant Commissioner Maroney, now in charge of the case, spent the next 18 months tracking down the owners of 1,500 yellow Fords, all to no avail. While the police had strong evidence linking Nielsen's disappearance to the developer Frank Theeman, they ignored it. Indeed, within weeks of the disappearance, Theeman admitted paying Jim Anderson $25,000. When he asked them to keep it secret for personal reasons, they complied and wasted their time on the futile yellow car link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disgrace that the Nielsen murder has remained unsolved, particularly after the information brought to light at the three-month Nielsen inquest in 1983, after which nothing effective was achieved by the New South Wales police. This is consistent with its profile throughout the whole case. The Nielsen case has been characterised by inaction and, at best, reaction rather than by a commitment to finding the murderer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people may regard the Nielsen case as old hat, because they believe it will never be solved, but this is to ignore its central importance and the principle of accountability. It is a case which goes to the very heart of corruption of the New South Wales police, and not upsetting the status quo of cosy police relationships with Sydney's crime kings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has really happened is that millions of dollars of public money have been wasted; the police have achieved nothing; Jim Anderson has been protected, and the murder of an innocent woman has been ignored by the National Crime Authority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Education funding in Victoria for capital works provides a real contrast in the attitudes, commitments and ideology of this federal Labor government and that of the New Right extremists of the Liberal state government. As honourable members will be aware, the federal government is primarily responsible for funding capital works in non-government schools&mdash;and fund them we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 months I have been able to announce the following grants: $685,000 to St Kevins Primary School in Hampton Park for seven new classrooms; $972,000 to St Francis Xavier College, Cranbourne Campus, for a new library and technology facilities; $295,000 to Hillcrest Christian College, Nyora for a technology centre and refurbishment of the library; and $495,000 to St Agathas Primary School, Cranbourne, for new classrooms and pupil amenities. That is more than $2 million in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enormous population growth in my electorate means that the demand for schools, both government and non-government, is steadily on the increase. These grants were welcomed by the local communities who were to benefit. However, some concerns were raised that the Commonwealth should be funding state government schools for capital works. I checked it out and found that the Commonwealth is funding massive capital works in state government schools in my area, but with no recognition being given from the state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth funds are given to the state governments and administered by them. There are very broad guidelines that the states must adhere to, but generally it is up to the discretion of the state as to what areas and which schools the money is spent on. All the money must be spent on schools, therefore debt reduction strategies or similar state government financial policies have no effect on the amount available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has pumped millions of dollars into government schools in the shire of Cranbourne, and over half a million dollars more than the state government over the last three years. The figures from the State Directorate of School Education show that in the years 1990 to 1992 inclusive the Commonwealth spent more than $8 million on capital works in government schools in the shire of Cranbourne. This figure compares with $7.6 million provided by the state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact the level of funding from the Commonwealth to the state government has actually increased every year. These increases have been legislated for the eight years from 1985. In 1993 over $1 million of federal money was spent in Cranbourne schools. Courtenay Avenue Primary School received a grant of $770,000; Coral Park Primary School, $54,000; Cranbourne Secondary College, $65,000; Kooweerup Secondary College, $60,000, and Rowellyn Park primary school, $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is obvious from these figures is that since the election of the Kennett state government there has been a decrease in the level of capital funding from both federal and state sources to schools in Cranbourne&mdash;only about $1 million in federal funds in 1993, compared with more than $8 million in the previous three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has there been this major cutback in funding allocation to the Cranbourne area? It is not because of a lack of need. There are still school sites vacant in rapidly growing suburbs. There are still secondary colleges bursting at the seams. There is still an obvious and well-acknowledged need for more government schools. Yet this Liberal state government continues to wind down not only its own funding commitment to Cranbourne, but also that funding provided by the federal government for capital works at state government schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be clear about this&mdash;the state government determines where this funding is allocated. It is responsible for the lack of educational facilities, and it is responsible for previous funding levels not being maintained. But it is not only its obvious lack of commitment to the growing suburbs of outer Melbourne but also the absolute hypocrisy of its position which is exposed in its announcements of the limited amount of new capital funding projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government takes complete credit for any capital works funding in state government schools. That is the great thing about the Kennett Liberals; they cut funding to all sorts of worthy causes; they claim credit for federal government initiatives, and all the while they maintain an imperious ruling mentality&mdash;not unlike members on the other side, unfortunately in a situation where they will never be able to exercise it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on page 8 today reported the fact that the state federal electoral officer for WA, Barry Young, has been obliged to write to all candidates in the Fremantle by-election telling them of a fact that should be well known, particularly to such experienced persons in the political system: that is, they cannot canvass for votes in aged persons hostels and other places where mobile polling booths will operate. It so happens that by coincidence I sat in on the briefing of the Liberal candidate, Geoff Hourn, when he was told clearly by Liberal Party officials of this particular rule and when he was told clearly not to go to those particular places&mdash;notwithstanding that most candidates would. The Liberal Party knew its responsibility, but according to this article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Young said his warning was prompted by a report that Dr Lawrence had visited Fremantle's Stan Reilly Lodge on February 17.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ex-premier of Western Australia, a woman who stood up in the parliament and put laws down, does not even know how to comply with the normal electoral laws of Australia&mdash;laws written by her own people. Furthermore, that is the law and nobody should know better than she not to break it. Everybody has been trying to contact Dr Lawrence recently. She does not want to answer questions on anything. Of course, she can no longer say, `I can't remember'. She went through a stage of being a cabinet minister and going into every cabinet meeting with plugs in her ears because she never heard any evil&mdash;notwithstanding that WA Inc. was on every day. The response from the Labor Party is: Dr Lawrence refuses to answer. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence was not available for comment yesterday. However, ALP state secretary Mark Nolan said she had merely introduced herself to people at the lodge.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act forbade people to canvass, solicit or try to induce votes in or near a polling booth.</PARA>

<PARA>The article goes on to say that the act is wrong. The government has the right to change the act, but I put it to honourable members that an endorsed candidate for the Labor Party suddenly turns up at an aged persons lodge and the Labor Party has the temerity to tell us she was not there looking for a few votes. That is the basis of my objection. Her memory is something unbelievable. She forgets overnight&mdash;I call her Miss Forgetful. She cannot remember anything. Maybe she did read that section of the electoral act&mdash;if the Labor Party organisation in Western Australia had done its job&mdash;that said that candidates are not allowed to go to these places. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is sometimes said that the press gallery runs Australia. I disagree. To me, the gallery often seems obsessed by a search for strong leaders who might be able to run the country. Instead of dominating the policy agenda, the gallery indulges in a disproportionate coverage of personalities rather than policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that many politicians resent journalists. No-one here will shun publicity, but when it comes to day-to-day contact, politicians believe journalists want something new and controversial while they want to persuade the public that their views are right. They think that interviewers get their kudos by catching out interviewees at the cost of discrediting public figures and the institutions they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach is an oversimplification. It ignores all the demands journalistic processes and communication mediums place on the reporting of news. More than that, it begrudges the role journalists have as transmitters to the public of what goes on in this place. Our media has a vital role to play in holding to account those who exercise power. If journalists lose creditability among the public, they are undercutting this primary function. A public without confidence in its journalists is less free. This makes journalists' ethics so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I learnt that the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, which incorporates the Australian Journalists Association, was reviewing its code of ethics and inviting the public to make submissions as part of the review. However, I did not learn this from any of the main media outlets. Instead, the information came from the editor of the South Australian Uniting Church newspaper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Times</EMPHASIS>, Mr Nicholas Kerr. He had heard it on the ABC. My staff found a small piece on the AAP but, according to the parliamentary library, out of all the daily newspapers they monitor each day it had scored only one mention, in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. This points to a problem. Journalists must live up to certain standards, but it is also essential that decision makers&mdash;the editors and proprietors&mdash;do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AJA's code of ethics lists 10 rules, requiring members: to be fair and honest and disclose necessary facts; to avoid undue emphasis on gender, race, religion or physical ability; to respect all confidences; to divorce their personal and financial or commercial interests from their professional interests; to give full identification before obtaining interviews; to respect grief and privacy; and to correct inaccuracies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code forms the core of media self-regulation, but many actual decision makers are not members of the AJA and therefore are not covered, despite endorsing the code and expecting staff to abide by it. So why do we not hear more about media ethics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a decline in public confidence in journalists over recent years. There has been a perceived failure in self-regulation, and in some states legislative solutions have been sought. This has occurred at a time when new media opportunities, such as pay TV, are opening up and the concentration of media ownership has led to calls for guarantees of editorial independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Senate committee is currently investigating the rights and responsibilities of the media. The police association in my own state of South Australia told the committee last year that it favoured some form of licensing system for journalists. I am sure that most people would be disturbed by the abuse of power that could exist under such a licensing system. At the same time, there is a genuine concern about the implications of allowing journalists to protect sources, awarding them powers not afforded to the police, doctors or even priests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review of the AJA code deserves more publicity, but even it has its own weaknesses. The preamble, which in part reads, `Respect for truth and the public's right to information are over-riding principles for all journalists', could be used to cover a multitude of sins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press council is largely seen as a toothless tiger. The ill-fated experiments of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> with an in-house ombudsman suggest this is not the way to go. The media's work is too important. Journalists and proprietors need to work together to develop a system of accountability which preserves press freedoms while enshrining effective self-regulation before they are hit with the heavy hand of the state. </PARA>

The nature of the demands placed on Senators and Members and the extent of their duties and responsibilities, including participation in the political process, inevitably causes occasions to arise when activities are challenged as being of a party political nature. Consequently, it is important that the subject of a complaint is investigated and assessed on its merits. The display of material in Electorate Offices is treated in a similar fashion and Senators and Members are asked to refrain from displaying material which is primarily of a party political nature in the public areas of their Electorate Offices as it may offend a section of the community. Where instances are brought to the attention of the Department of Administrative Services, the Senator or Member concerned is asked to remove the offending material.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, in 1987 the Australian Customs Service (ACS) did seize rifles imported into Australia by Mr Ron Owen of Gympie, Qld;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The consignment of rifles imported by Mr Owen was cleared by the ACS following advice from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) that the samples inspected were not of machine gun construction and had passed all aspects of the requisite safety test.</PARA>

The question of compensation for the actions of the ACS and AFP has been thoroughly and independently considered by the Commonwealth Ombudsman who concluded that the circumstances of this case do not justify such a recommendation.
