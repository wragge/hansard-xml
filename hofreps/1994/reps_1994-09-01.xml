<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rose last night to speak on the first amendment which has been proposed by the opposition, but unfortunately&mdash;or fortunately, from some points of view&mdash;I had only 35 seconds in which to speak. When listening to opposition members during this debate, I wondered whether they had done any research and looked at the nature of title which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have argued for over many years in Australia and which has been the subject of a number of very formal inquiries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the liberty last evening of going to the library, which is not too far away; even opposition members can access it. If they had gone there, they would have seen the Woodward royal commission report and, for the benefit of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), a report of Paul Seaman QC, in the Aboriginal land inquiry which was undertaken in his state of Western Australia in 1984. The first term of reference of that inquiry was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically the Inquiry shall consider the most appropriate form of title over land reserved for the use and benefit of Aborigines or leased for Aboriginal Communities.</PARA>
<PARA>In the context of the recommendations of the report, it is very clear what they have said. I quote from the body of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The persistent claim by Aboriginal people at the hearings throughout the State was for a "strong title" which cannot be sold.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In both strongly traditional and less traditional areas land is seen as a base upon which to re-build Aboriginal society and culture which must therefore be passed onto future generations of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal witnesses at the hearings constantly expressed concern for the future of Aboriginal people and said that granted land should not be able to be sold. Aboriginal people are keenly aware that, in their present situation, they do not normally wish to hold the title which they might be tempted to sell because sale would defeat the whole purpose of the benefits which they look for in land rights. That is the guts of what this amendment is all about.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Paternalism', he says. This is an Aboriginal inquiry set up by the Western Australian government, by Paul Seaman QC. I turn to the Woodward Aboriginal Land Rights Commission. Justice Woodward said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt about the nature of the title which should be granted.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The views which I expressed in my first report that title must be communal and inalienable . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should understand that it is about communal rights&mdash;collective rights&mdash;and that is the way in which Aboriginal people have consistently expressed their view to this government. That is the view Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory have expressed to me whilst I have worked with them. I have never once heard the view being espoused by the honourable member for O'Connor or the shadow spokesperson, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). I do not know whether these people do not give me their views, but I suggest that the views I have been given have been given very forthrightly, as they were given forthrightly to the shadow spokesperson and her erstwhile temporary leader when he was at Utopia and other areas of Central Australia and made a goose of himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the nature of this amendment goes to undermine the very essence of the form of land holding which Aboriginal people have been aspiring to, and have continually argued for, in this country. The fact is that not one Aboriginal submission to the government has espoused the views which have been put by the opposition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As many would be aware, my electorate contains the Maralinga and Pitjantjatjara lands. They account for something like 20 per cent of South Australia and 30 per cent of my electorate. There is a very strong view emerging from some within those Aboriginal communities that land rights, as they have evolved over the last decade or 20 years, have been denying people access to their own land. All we are asking for in this amendment is that there be greater flexibility given so that the land fund may be able to grant money to individuals or family groups. The government is strongly objecting to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) said that he had never heard of it; he had never heard that individuals or families may want to have individual title or family title. I inform the member for the Northern Territory that Mr Donald Fraser, former chairman of the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Land Council, assures me that that is exactly what he wants. Donald has fought for this right for many years and has been denied it by successive Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great tragedy is that, as we play politics in this  place with Aboriginal people, we deny them the opportunity to make progress. I have visited those areas many times. Perhaps when people see the frustration Aboriginals feel with the system which has denied them access to their own lands in the name of land rights, they might step down from their ivory tower; they might step down from the arrogance of urban paternalism, from the arrogance of a rather intellectual argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are asking is that the corporation be given the right or the machinery to be able to grant funds to individuals or family groups. It is still up to the corporation to be able to grant this money. I specifically asked Mr Fraser last night for his permission to talk about this matter this morning. He said to me, `We have been denied access to our land.' He further said, `We had greater access before the land rights legislation went through.' It is time that we stopped playing politics, that we looked for genuine bipartisanship, that we offered the responsible hand&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about amendment No. 1, which is the subject of debate at the moment. I am rather disappointed with the degree of rancour that has occurred in this debate both last night and this morning. Obviously there is some excitement on both sides of the House. I think we need to calm down a bit and consider the objectives of the legislation and the amendments: that is, to do things better for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I say to my friends on the other side, `Don't be consumed with self-righteousness, which is the way that you are coming across. You are not the repository of all wisdom on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.' A great many people on this side of the House have a high degree of sensitivity about the aspirations, problems and needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 37 amendments being proposed by the opposition, and I am speaking to amendment No. 1. To those members of the government who are here and to others who may be listening, I say, `You may not like some of them, but if you are fair you will admit that not all of them are bad.' I believe that this amendment is fair. Last night the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said that he was concerned with the substance of the legislation. I agree that we all need to be concerned with the substance of the legislation. This is why I support this amendment. Last night the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who has just entered the chamber, made reference to sound administrative practice. I support him in the need for sound administrative practice in the administration of this bill when it becomes an act&mdash;hopefully, with some amendments accepted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment provides for the corporation to grant interests in land to Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders, to grant money to Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders, and to guarantee loans to Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. I cannot, for the life of me, see what is wrong with this amendment. After all, we were just told by the last speaker, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), that ATSIC makes loans to individuals for business ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, if it is all right for Commonwealth money to be made available as loans for business ventures or grants, is it not equally valid for individual Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders to receive benefits under this particular bill when land is so important to them? I am afraid I cannot understand the logic of those on the other side who just reject it out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that Australian Commonwealth taxation money is made available in grants to individuals from most portfolios in this parliament, whether it is for sporting activities, for the arts, or for a variety of other purposes. The principle of making grants, guaranteeing loans, or whatever, for individual Australians is in place, it is a reality. I suggest, with all respect to my friends on the other side, that they have blinkers on in relation to this. Do not, for heaven's sake, reject everything out of hand just to get back at the opposition. There are some good things in the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 1 is a sound amendment. It extends the benefits of the legislation to Aboriginal individuals. I see nothing wrong with that. I see nothing wrong with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders being treated equally with other people right around Australia who do get grants, who do get guaranteed loans, from every portfolio in this parliament. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to reconsider this amendment. I think it is a very sound one which will benefit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>

That is one of the important aspects of this bill which cannot be implemented if it is provided for individuals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you were really fair dinkum about this, you would allow the honourable member for Chisholm and others to have a clear vote, and they would come across and vote with us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Alan, you wouldn't know anything about it. Let me give three reasons in particular why we cannot and will not accept this amendment. The first reason is that there is a need to provide for the continuity of Aboriginal ownership. If you are going to provide land under some type of freehold title for Aboriginal individuals, Torres Strait Islander individuals, families or partnerships, it will also entitle them to dispose of that land. I do not believe the Australian people would take too kindly to the proposition that in 10 years time, as a result of this arrangement having been put into place, there will be in real terms, in today's dollars, $45 million being made available every year for the purchase of land for Aboriginal communities and for Aboriginal purposes which, at least in part, might go to individuals and to families and to partnerships which they can then dispose of because it would be their freehold land. That is the No. 1 reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason&mdash;and this has been emphasised&mdash;is that one of the purposes of this legislation is to provide land for Aboriginal community purposes. It is a recognition, not of the guilt of European Australians for the past, but a recognition by European Australians&mdash;the whole Australian community, including the Aboriginal community at present&mdash;of the reality of the past and the dispossession. As we emphasised before, the provisions of Mabo will not make any difference for about 70 per cent of the Australian Aboriginal population because they are the most dispossessed, they are the most displaced, they are the people who have been dissociated from their land to the greatest extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason is one of accountability. This was emphasised by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). Points were made by the member for O'Connor in referring to the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council and to the reference in the newspaper today. I mention in passing that that is a New South Wales creature. It has nothing to do with the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House would be aware that, in the recent past, I have put a lot of time and effort into this area of interest and I have travelled and consulted extensively around the country. I have to say, with some considerable sadness this morning, that I believe the events from both sides in this chamber during this debate have not advanced the welfare, the cause or the benefit of the indigenous people of this country. The attitudes displayed on both sides&mdash;I found the attitude of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) particularly disappointing&mdash;have not helped the reconciliation process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not disagree with what the government has said in the detailed amendment that is before us at the moment but has sought to give it more flexibility and to extend it a bit. I find it particularly upsetting and disturbing&mdash;as did those who were in the chamber yesterday when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) spoke&mdash;that the minister, quite clearly, without seeing the detail of those amendments, rejected them out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could say that is the government's right. I think that is a point of view. If the government is going to continually talk about wishing to improve the situation of this country's indigenous people, then it is far better done with some cooperation. I have not heard anything from the government side in the general debate or in the consideration in detail stage that makes sense to me as to why the government cannot move at least a little on some of these amendments. It seems to me that the government is saying that reconciliation and cross-party support is fine provided it is on the government's terms but if other people want to make some constructive suggestions, they are just being obstructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt at all that the coalition has taken a substantially different position on this issue from that which it has been advocating for a long time.

I would have thought that, if all of us in this place were genuine about trying to improve the lot of indigenous people in this country, we would have dealt with some of these issues rather than indulging in the somewhat unedifying spectacle that we have seen during the last few hours of debate on this bill. In the short time that I have been a member of this chamber, which is about 4 1/2 years, I do not think that I have seen a more personally acrimonious debate than this. If we are to advance the cause of indigenous people in this country, it seems to me that it behoves us all to try to show a little more generosity of spirit.

I certainly respect the work he has put into resolving issues which face the indigenous people of this country. However, he ignores the genesis and the purpose of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill as drafted by the government. The genesis of the legislation is the historic Mabo decision of the High Court where the High Court said that the indigenous people of this country were unlawfully dispossessed of their land by white settlers. In speaking of the indigenous people of this country, the High Court was referring to a class of people&mdash;not individual people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the High Court decision, the government has very properly recognised, through the Mabo native title legislation, that those indigenous people who have access to land which has not been alienated by title or leasehold have native title rights over that unalienated land. The High Court also pointed out that there are many in that class of people whose land has been alienated by either leasehold or title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill should be seen as complementary to the Native Title Act; it is not in isolation of the Native Title Act. We should view it as having the same function as the Native Title Act, which is to give land back to a class of people, the indigenous inhabitants of this country, who have been dispossessed of rights as a collective group. That is exactly what it does. How can one separate land rights by individual grants to individual Aboriginals?

The points that have been made by the opposition speakers clearly demonstrate their total ignorance of Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal community life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole purpose of this land acquisition fund is to give Aboriginal communities the opportunity to own land. That is a reflection of the reality of Aboriginal culture and the structure of their society. The purpose of this fund is to build a fund that for many years to come will have the capacity to continue to purchase land that can advance the interests of Aboriginal people as a community. If we allow individuals to own land, the whole process of alienation of sections of that land from the community title will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite say, `What is wrong with a family having it?' or `What is wrong with an individual having it?' they are ignoring the fact that individual family circumstances or individual relationships in a community may change. There is a whole range of reasons why a particular individual may leave that community or may wish to be divided from that community. What you are suggesting by this amendment is that that land be lost to that community, because that individual will be the one with the title to it. Therefore, there is no community benefit; there is just one individual's benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this fund is not necessarily to benefit an individual person but to benefit the community as a whole so that the corporate interests of that community are advanced and that land belongs to the whole community.

They do not want individual ownership, because they understand the divisions that will occur by that process.

So I have probably had far more extensive consultation with Aboriginal people than certainly the shadow minister and most other members, except the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), who has been a very active worker in this area and who has participated with me in a lot of those visits. </PARA>

So the certainty is that four out of seven will be indigenous. The chances are that five out of seven will be indigenous. They have to at least have knowledge of Aboriginal community life.

The board can still give all of the land to corporations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the coalition's amendment No. 1 to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill is one of the most progressive options ever offered to Aboriginal people. I am disappointed that the government is choosing to reject it. It seems that the government does not believe that individual Aborigines should be allowed to own land or that any government assistance should be provided to individual Aborigines to own land. The government talks about land rights but, when individuals want to purchase property on their own, no assistance is available. Assistance is available only to remote corporations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me fairly strange to argue, on the one hand, that Aborigines feel the land is part of their soul and is so important to their daily life, health, wellbeing and every other aspect but then, on the other hand, to say to them that they cannot actually own that land; that it has to be owned by some remote corporation, a part of the Aboriginal industry; that only those people in land councils can have title to the land. I believe that if, on the one hand, we talk about land rights and the importance of land to Aborigines and then, on the other hand, say that we will not help them buy land we are being utterly inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned yesterday, the government has developed an extraordinary Aboriginal industry. Real power in Aboriginal affairs is concentrated in a few people to the exclusion of others, and nepotism is rife. There is an extraordinary concentration of grants to a small group of people. Yesterday the minister said that he rejected these amendments because he had spoken to a list of people who did not want them. Then he read the list which consisted of a whole group of land councils. These are the very people who are at the heart of the Aboriginal industry; the sorts of people that under this legislation will get all the money. It seems as though they do not want to share their honey pot with the Aborigines who want to own the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a real spiritual association with the land, I think we should be facilitating individual Aboriginal groups and families to purchase the land and hold the title for themselves. That would really give Aboriginals the closeness to and responsibility for their land. I think that would not only re-establish those links between Aboriginal people and their land but also give them responsibility for that land. They would have some reason for hope in the future that they could build a better lifestyle for themselves and their families. They do not feel that association with the land when somebody in Canberra&mdash;or an organisation such as the Northern Land Council, over which they have little or no influence&mdash;has title to that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this amendment offers a real opportunity for a turnaround in the hopes and aspirations of ordinary Aboriginals. They will no longer have to rely on nepotism or the goodwill of a land council and its white advisers in the Aboriginal industry in order to get title to or have an association with the land that is important to them. They will have the opportunity to receive funding from taxpayers to acquire land in their own names. Yesterday I likened this a little to the way in which the old agricultural banks used to help farmers get established on the land&mdash;young farmers purchase schemes. I think this land fund would be really valuable if it were able to provide funding, particularly on a loans basis, to assist Aboriginal people to get established on a parcel of land of their own in an industry of their own. That would give them an opportunity to build for their own future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the government does not want Aborigines to own land. The only people who are allowed to own land are those who are part of the Aboriginal industry&mdash;the Aboriginal corporations and the like. I think we will make real progress in the health, welfare and education of Aboriginal people when they have an opportunity to possess the title to their land. Then they can identify with a particular parcel of land that is theirs, not a corporation's. They can take responsibility for that land and pass it on to their children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want at this point to enter into this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. The opposition has had two months to consult with any number of Aboriginal people anywhere in Australia about these particular issues, and it failed to do so. A caravan, comprising the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and his shadow spokesperson, went to Central Australia to discuss issues of importance. They could have used that opportunity to discuss their amendments with not only Charles Perkins but also the land councils and indigenous people around the Northern Territory.

I refer to it as unalienated land, and I believe that is what it is: land that nobody other than the Crown has any effect over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are good people, they have achieved quite a considerable degree of integration in their local communities, they are Aboriginal, they come from those areas, they can trace their heritage through those areas; and they would like some land.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to a couple of the points made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in his response to my earlier remarks. I was not critical that he had chosen to speak to the land councils about the coalition amendments. It is reasonable that he should talk to that group. My comment was to reflect on the quality and objectivity of the advice he would have got from the land councils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land councils, as a key part of the Aboriginal industry, will be at the centre of acquiring land from this particular land fund. They are the bears that have their hands in the honey pot, and they do not want to share the honey pot with anyone else. It is these particular land councils that are the owners of vast areas of Australia&mdash;something like 16 per cent. They are the owners of the land, not the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was trying to make the very important point that, if we really believed in land rights, if we really believed that the ownership of land is important to Aboriginal people, we should let them own the land and not put some kind of corporation in the way. We should give individual people the opportunity to purchase land and, if there is to be a fund, that fund should be able to direct some of its money towards assisting individual Aborigines, individual families or individual groups who want to acquire land for their own use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make is in relation to a letter from Mr Perkins in which he said that he wanted the fund to be approved with `no strings attached'. If that is the case, the government should be supporting our amendment because we are seeking to reduce one of the strings that is currently attached: namely, that only corporations can own the land. We are seeking to grant them additional flexibility so that land ownership can also be provided to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there would be very real advantages in attaching specific responsibility to specific parcels of land so that one Aborigine, as distinct from everybody else in the world, would be able to say that that is his land for which he has responsibility, instead of putting in place land councils and other corporations&mdash;which, as I mentioned earlier, are a key part of the Aboriginal industry&mdash;as the only ones that can be trusted with the ownership of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a most unfortunate attitude for the government to have taken; it is a most unfortunate approach to have developed in this whole area. Much more progress could be made for individual families. They could demonstrate to other Aborigines and to other Australians that they are able to carefully manage property, make it better and provide something for future generations to work towards. They could demonstrate that they are able to be worthwhile custodians of the land and, in addition, make it productive for our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the minister has misrepresented my concerns on the advice he sought. I discount the value of that advice because I believe it was vested interests speaking very strongly in defence of their own protected position. I am not saying anything about the validity of ATSIC elections. I will not make any comments at this stage about the irregularities associated with those elections and their legitimacy to fill those positions. I think that is irrelevant at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thing is that the advice that was given came from a sector with a particular vested interest.

Those views were stated in our party room.</PARA></TALK.START>

I kept asking the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) whether Noel Pearson, who seems to be the first spokesman she rings up on everything, was elected. The answer, of course, is no.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to get back to the nature of the amendment and the utter confusion on the other side about Aboriginal affairs. It is possible for Aboriginal people, like other Australians, to purchase land. The government has provided, through the structure of ATSIC, a possibility for Aboriginal people, because they are disadvantaged, to benefit by way of loans through ATSIC. It is difficult for Aboriginal people to go through banks, so they get subsidised loans, just like the farmers get subsidised loans. That is the mechanism by which individual Aboriginal people can purchase land, like any other Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition at the last election wanted to cut ATSIC's funds by 10 per cent. That would have meant 10 per cent less money in this country for Aboriginal people to purchase individual land. What hypocrisy from the other side. This legislation is about compensation for dispossession&mdash;something completely different. Groups of Aboriginal people, clan groups, language groups, have been forced off the land with the complicity of governments and with the complicity in a lot of cases, I am afraid, of the European population in this country. Now they have to be compensated. We have to look towards the future to provide them with economic independence. As a responsible government we have to look  towards providing benefit to the greatest number of Aboriginal people. To do that we have to accommodate groups of Aboriginal people that come to us and say, `We want to use this land for an economic purpose' or `Perhaps we did have some affiliation with this land. We cannot qualify under the Mabo legislation. We want to use this land, we want to develop this land, to build our future.' That is the nature of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a ridiculous situation it would be if a group of Aboriginal people came along wanting to buy a piece of land, then one Aboriginal person came along with no affiliation with the land wanting to buy it, then someone from Melbourne came to my electorate and said, `I like that bit of land; I want to purchase that bit of land' and then someone from Western Australia came along and said, `I like that bit of land, too. It is a good bit of land. I will purchase that bit of land.' What utter nonsense. </PARA>

How can the children of Aboriginals and their children's children benefit if you give land to one individual?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to a couple of the quite extraordinary statements made by the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). Her comment that to enable individual Aborigines to own land through the land fund would open up the possibility of corruption is an ill thought out and insulting statement. To suggest that individual Aborigines cannot be trusted to own land is an affront. To suggest that when individuals own land it is more likely to involve corrupt practices than is the case with the land councils is also a defiance of history. When you look at the very patchy record of some of the land councils, the qualified auditors' reports, the suggestions of nepotism and misuse of funds, it is remarkable to suggest that they are the pillars of virtue to protect the land fund from corruption. That has not been the experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Providing individuals with the responsibility for land, I would submit, improves accountability. Each individual would be responsible for their own land and the management of the funds that are provided to them. There would be a clear chain of responsibility and a clear capacity to report on the stewardship of the funds that have been available. So I utterly reject the suggestion that to provide individual ownership of land increases the risk of corruption. I submit that precisely the opposite is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second comment made by the honourable member for Capricornia which I would contest was that somehow or other individual ownership of the land is an Anglo-Celtic view of title. That tends to imply that corporations and companies and elections are a part of the Aboriginal old ways. They are not. If ever there is something that is a part of an Anglo-Celtic tradition it is the establishment of corporations and companies. That degree of complexity was by no means a part of the old Aboriginal ways and their way of dealing with the ownership of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest again that individual and family ownership of land is much closer to the old ways than the establishment of complicated corporations, reports to central bodies in remote capital cities and the sort of system that is being proposed by the government under these arrangements. In every sense what is being proposed by the opposition in this amendment is much closer to the objectives espoused by the member for Capricornia than what is in the bill at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to respond to the remarkable speech of the member for Leichhardt&mdash;remarkable for its enthusiasm rather than the legitimacy of its content. He suggested that Aborigines from far away may actually want to buy land in a particular area. That is precisely what the government is trying to set up in its proposals. It wants urban Aborigines to go out into country areas and buy land. Somehow or other it is all right if it is done through a corporation but it is not all right if it is done by an individual. Again, I reject that kind of concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what is happening at present. I referred yesterday in my remarks to John Lee Jones in my own area, a person who is laying claim to most of my electorate at present. We had not seen him before the Fitzgerald inquiry opened up the possibility that there might be some role for Aborigines in the management of the Great Sandy Region. Now this man has appeared on the scene from who knows where to claim the area. This is the same man who is claiming $40 million worth of rewards from the Victorian government because his forefathers may have been associated with the capture of Ned Kelly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to take up the time of the House unnecessarily, but I feel compelled to respond to what the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) had to say. The implication of his line of argument would turn not only government policy in this area but all government policy on its head. Are we now going to set up a style of government where we hand out money willy-nilly to people without any sort of due process or any sort of accountability?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My argument was that accountability is important. It was the coalition that again raised the issue that there should be more accountability in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs than in other areas. But we have an amendment before us which seeks to throw all that to the wind. The result will be that we will have no accountability and no due process. The logical extension of the argument of the member for Wide Bay is that if someone says, `I would like to own this bit of land,' we will hand that person the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) said, this part of the bill provides a process to deal with compensation for dispossession. It is not about giving a loan here or there so someone can get land easily. I hazard a guess that this amendment has been put forward to give the opposition a reason to participate in the debate, because there is not a great deal of logic in its essential element. The end result was that this ill thought out proposal hit the deck yesterday morning. We are being told that we should give the opposition more time. It had from 30 June. The opposition is having about as much trouble as the Russian space station is in getting its act together and getting an interlock device in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wide Bay made some pretty questionable remarks about backyards in his speech at the second reading stage yesterday. He got back to the old issue. At the bottom of this is the statement of the Leader of the National Party in Queensland which urges the coalition to go back to its original position and not to have the land acquisition bill at all. There is so much rhetoric on this issue coming from the opposition. The member for Wide Bay does not want any accountability.

Trying to reach agreement on this bill with the coalition is rather like trying to reach agreement with an octopus: you shake one hand but there are seven other hands floating around the parliament that are not part of the deal and are not prepared to agree with it.

So we were being presented, and we are still presented on the basis of what the Leader of the Opposition has said in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, with a clear statement that we have to agree to all these amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has provided absolutely no justification whatsoever for the government not accepting this amendment. He resorted to some recollections of previous speeches, but did not address the content of the amendments at all. It is no good just name-calling and saying processes within the opposition are a reason for rejecting an improvement to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the minister seriously suggesting that no matter what improvements the opposition could make to the bill, no matter how acceptable they might even be to the government, the government is still not going to vote for them because of some predetermined position? That is bloody-mindedness of the worst kind. Does this government want its legislation to be shoddy? Is it not prepared to accept genuine suggestions for improvements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is trying to imply in his comments that it does not matter how good a proposal the opposition puts up, the government will refuse to accept it. That is just plain stupidity. The government says, `It does not matter how wrong we are, we are going to use the might of numbers to push this legislation through and fail to correct its deficiencies.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition is suggesting in these amendments is, I would have thought, perfectly reasonable and acceptable; namely, that money should be spent for the purposes for which it was provided. Surely that is a reasonable suggestion, yet the government is going to toss it out because it will not accept advice from anyone. The government says, `It does not matter how wrong our legislation is, how flawed it might be, it is going to stay that way because we are not prepared to listen to anybody else's advice. We are not prepared to make it better.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is entering into this debate with that kind of attitude, it really will be a pretty unproductive four or five hours we have ahead of us. No matter how good our arguments are and no matter how well we may win the argument around this chamber, the might of numbers is going to be used mercilessly, irrespective of merits. Frankly, that is not what democracy is about. That ought not to be what this chamber is about. It ought to be about making the best possible legislation for Australia; it ought to be about accepting worthwhile amendments; and it ought to be about making the legislation as good as it possibly can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is not prepared to improve the legislation. I think that fact needs to be remembered by Australians when they are reviewing this issue. When we come back in a few months time to look again at this legislation, as we inevitably do when the government uses its might of numbers irrespective of the facts to force legislation through, a black mark will be placed very much against this minister and this government who have refused to accept the advice of others who believe that all wisdom rests on their side and that no-one else is entitled to make suggestions to make the legislation better. I think that is a very dangerous sign for our democracy. The minister should provide precise reasons why the amendment moved by the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) is to be rejected. He has failed to do this, and that is to his shame. </PARA>

Has the parliament constrained the board of ATSIC in the way that you are now seeking to do with the Indigenous Land Corporation? The answer is no, we have not sought to constrain it. I think that is a rather pertinent and important point. In the most significant indigenous organisation in this country, with a budget ultimately in the order of a billion dollars, there is no such constraint.

But the bottom line is: even if we accepted all the amendments that you want, the Leader of the Opposition is on the public record as saying that he is still not necessarily going to support the bill because there is another raft of amendments for the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have to refute what the minister has just said. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has said no such thing. Let us look at the logic of this position. We have said in the past that we were going to oppose the land fund, but we are actually in here today debating it. It is no good saying, `Whatever you have said in the past, we know what is in your mind and what you are going to do in the Senate.' It has nothing to do with this amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the minister should be able to get away with it, and I was trying to make sure that he did not. The main thrust of this amendment is that we change the words in the bill from `A grant or guarantee is subject to such terms and conditions as the Indigenous Land Corporation determines' to say that there should be some time frames detailed for the actions given; that moneys granted must be used solely for the purposes for which they are granted; and that if the board&mdash;that is, the board of directors&mdash;is satisfied that moneys are not being used for that purpose, it must and will take steps to reclaim them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in a few ventures in my time, some of which have been very successful and some of which have been not so successful. I cannot imagine that any director would oppose those propositions. No director that I have ever met would. They are reasonably minor, but particular. These sorts of amendments are very important, but government members say, `We will not agree to them because they are not important,' or `They do not add anything to the bill,' or `They reduce the powers of the board members.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said, `It is important to give the board flexibility.' In regard to financial matters, no board wants a lack of flexibility that is onerous. But this is not onerous. There is nothing onerous about this. It is just about accountability, which is the second main thrust of our amendments. The first amendment was about flexibility&mdash;something that the minister just said we should give the board. He just said, `It is important to give the board flexibility.' He did not want to give the board any of the flexibility in the first amendment. He wanted to tell it that it could give land only to corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we want a bit of accountability. The problem we have encountered with all of these amendments is the absolute illogicality of your position in not dealing with them. When we dealt with the first amendment, I pointed out that the board would have the choice. We gave it a bit more flexibility&mdash;something that you are so keen on&mdash;and now we are asking for some accountability. It is something that no responsible board member would ever even quibble with. I will finish my speech before the allotted time expires, because many members wish to speak in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer the last question first. I find it extraordinary that the coalition seeks to advance an argument which is founded on two entirely different propositions. Earlier we were talking about an entirely different subject matter. In this case we are talking about an unprecedented attempt&mdash;as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) so aptly reminded the House&mdash;in the legislation of this parliament to write in terms which are not in any other legislation, and in particular not in the legislation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear that, while the shadow minister is going around saying that the coalition has given in principle support, the coalition has given nothing of the sort.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to a couple of the comments that have been made by members of the opposition with regard to amendments 2 and 3. As has been outlined by the minister, neither amendment strengthens the accountability procedures in any effective way. What they do is bind the corporation's board in a way which is far more restrictive than is required in any other piece of legislation affecting either Aboriginal affairs or any other corporation or community organisation that this government has dealings with and gives grants of money or loans to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is one of the big problems we have with amendments 2 and 3 and the perception that the opposition is seeking to perpetrate in these amendments, which is that we expect Aboriginal organisations to be far more accountable than any other organisation that this government deals with. It is a problem that we have had too often in this parliament. This problem has been debated in this parliament and its relevant committees with regard to Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Opposition members are being inconsistent in putting forward this amendment. As they said previously, they wanted to provide flexibility to the board in the determination of who was eligible to gain grants of land. We pointed out quite clearly that that was totally inconsistent with the basic purposes of this fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this amendment, the opposition is now seeking to tie the board up in knots. It is seeking to put very restrictive clauses into this bill which outline what the terms and conditions should be. Rather than giving the board the capacity to make those judgments itself, the opposition, by this amendment, is seeking to constrain the board in a very difficult way which will result in enormous difficulties for the board in administering its responsibilities in these land dealings. That will not improve the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) made the point in his contribution that the government should respond when there are genuine amendments being put forward. I agree with him. If these were genuine amendments, I would be more  than happy to say that the government should be looking at them. The government has looked at each one of them. We have looked at whether each proposed amendment strengthens the bill, makes the bill clearer and makes the process easier and simpler. The fact of the matter is that not one of these amendments passes that basic test. One therefore has to question the genuineness of this series of amendments. I do not believe they were motivated by a genuine desire to make the land acquisition fund work better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the two proposed amendments is that they will not improve the operation of the land acquisition fund and the capacity of the board to administer the grants that it might make. These amendments are consistent with a position which some people in the community seek to espouse that says that Aboriginal organisations have to be three or four times more accountable for every dollar they are granted than any other department, corporation or community service organisation that the Commonwealth has dealings with or delivers grants to. That is the big problem that is behind these two amendments. They will not improve the fund or the opportunities for Aboriginal people to have access to land and to make good use of that land. They will make their job that much more difficult. That is why we are rejecting amendments Nos 2 and 3 as proposed by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I raise another matter of concern that has been raised by Aboriginals in Western Australia. A fund for a Rottnest Island deaths group meeting on Rottnest was made contingent by ATSIC on the group's agreeing to ATSIC's developmental proposals. In other words, it was told, `You won't get any money to organise this meeting unless you agree to putting our items on the agenda.' In other words, there is perhaps a need for greater accountability on the part of ATSIC in a range of areas, including in Western Australia and on the question of moneys that are being expended on housing, and training projects in relation to housing, for Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the minister has an interest in ensuring that these types of activities are conducted properly. He should look more closely at the acquittal of moneys that have been granted in such a way.

The coalition's proposed amendments suggest that there ought to be a requirement that the board of the corporation include a specification of time frames in relation to its decisions.

We do not seek, in the form of legislation, to regiment each and every aspect of the daily activities of the boards that we appoint. That is why we appoint them.

They have said that, through this amendment, we are requiring that when land is purchased there should be a hospital or a school or something else unlikely on it.

Is that such a terrible amendment? It is asking that when the Indigenous Land Corporation spends a large amount of money&mdash;it will have $45 million a year to spend&mdash;it should look at how purchasing a particular piece of land will improve the lot of the community and address the needs of that community. If there are two possible pieces of land to buy and one does not have a road&mdash;so the children cannot get to school and the women cannot leave the community&mdash;the corporation could say, `This purchase is going to be detrimental to the health and education of this community so it is preferable to look at the other piece of land.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment No. 4 is also not acceptable to the government because, in the words of the shadow minister, `it seeks to refocus the bill away from land to a broader agenda.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that it has not been the government that has misrepresented the opposition's position. In the interests of an honest debate, I ask the shadow minister: which government member was she referring to as the person who said that the opposition was insisting upon a hospital being built before land would be purchased by the fund? I have been present for most of this debate&mdash;certainly while the amendments have been considered&mdash;and I have not heard anything of that sort, nor have I read anything in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. If I am wrong, I will be happy to say that that is not the intention of the opposition amendment. I think a number of deliberately erroneous things have been said in the course of this debate. I am curious to know what the shadow minister was referring to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that the coalition, by moving this amendment, is advancing an argument which deliberately seeks to fudge the issue. That is why the government so strongly objects to the amendment and why indigenous people are passionately opposed to this form of amendment. What the coalition seems unable to do is to recognise an unambiguous human right of dispossessed indigenous people to gain some land as an economic base&mdash;or for cultural, ceremonial or other reasons&mdash;for their future and that of their family. It is that lack of an unambiguous recognition of the rights of indigenous people that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country find so disappointing. That is why Commissioner Perkins, speaking on behalf of ATSIC, has asked the coalition to rethink its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the debate on the coalition's proposed amendments, it is true that the Australian media have misunderstood some aspects of the amendments. But whose fault is that? Is it up to the government to explain the intention of the coalition amendments? I would have thought not. Surely that ought to be the responsibility of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), or the shadow minister, or any one of the frontbench members of the coalition. The fact is that it suits the coalition to have the Australian media misunderstand this issue. It is seeking to give a much wider and very unsavoury appeal to a misunderstanding held by many people in the wider community about this issue of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, through the whole of the native title debate in 1993 and now in 1994 in relation to this bill, is sending a message to the Australian community. The message is one of justice, one of explanation about the rights of indigenous people, and one of the importance of land to indigenous people and the central place of land in the reconciliation process. If those opposite do not think that is an important view, they should go back and look at the act that set up the reconciliation council. They should look at the first word that is used concerning the commitments of the parliament and the Commonwealth to meeting the aspirations of indigenous people. I know what is there because I wrote it. The first word is `land'. Without land, people cannot establish an economic base. They cannot have housing, communities, or schools. It is the failure of the opposition to give a principled and unrestricted acknowledgment of that important human right for indigenous people that they feel is so disappointing about the coalition's current policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you will see why we reject this proposal. As was pointed out by Commissioner Ross very well on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program on Tuesday evening, Aboriginal people see the issue of access to land as a question of human rights. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) said that these issues of citizenship rights&mdash;health, education and housing&mdash;are issues which ought to be addressed by state and territory governments, which have the direct responsibility for the delivery of those services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be very instructive for the opposition spokespersons at the table to look back at the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) in the second reading stages of this bill. He made the opposition's intentions very clear. To members of the opposition this is not an issue about land. They see this money being used, never mind what is being said now by the opposition spokesperson, for the improvement of health and housing&mdash;basic citizenship rights which are the direct responsibilities of state and territory governments. The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the government serious about the things that matter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise, the things that matter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">including health, education and housing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The government is serious. It is also serious about addressing the fundamental need in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community for land. That is the principal objective of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the opposition saying that the corporation will not take proper account of the wellbeing of Aboriginal people when it is allowing money to be spent on land purchases? What is the opposition saying about this corporation? The real issue with housing, education and health is that the state and territory governments have abrogated their responsibilities. The appalling state of Aboriginal health and housing can be sheeted home directly to the performance of state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Northern Territory government has reduced its health expenditure on Aborigines. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) portrayed this problem the other day. The minister pointed out that the Northern Territory government reduced expenditure on the Aboriginal health service on Bathurst Island at the same time as it received increased expenditure from the Commonwealth. That Aboriginal health service on Bathurst Island may have to close its doors. That is directly the responsibility of the Northern Territory government. It has nothing to do with this bill. If the opposition were concerned about addressing housing, education and health issues it would go with this government to the state and territory governments and say, `Accept your responsibilities.' To date, it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to look at the housing issue in terms of the accounts of the Northern Territory government. This financial year the Commonwealth government is providing to the Northern Territory government $19 million for Aboriginal housing. The Northern Territory government also gets around $850 million in general purpose grants, weighted for disadvantage, to provide services&mdash;including housing&mdash;to all its citizens. The disadvantage takes account of Aboriginality and dislocation, distance and disadvantage, and yet the contribution of the Northern Territory government this year to housing in Aboriginal communities is exactly $19 million&mdash;the amount given to it by the Commonwealth. It has spent none of its own money. Not one cent of that money is being spent by the Northern Territory government on housing in Aboriginal communities, and yet you are telling the community that Aboriginal people, who properly say that these citizenship rights are the responsibility of state and territory governments, should accept the responsibility in this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, to address a matter that was raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon). He spoke about bipartisanship. One of the reasons why we have infiltrated the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill with some thoughts about health, housing, education and economic viability&mdash;which are very important&mdash;is that, despite all its rhetoric, the government has failed.</PARA></TALK.START>

If we are going to have a bipartisan conversation, if we are going to make a bipartisan decision, if we are going to make a bipartisan contribution, then we have to have our minds open.

Not only did the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pre-empt your decision but, if I heard you correctly&mdash;and excuse me if I am not addressing my remarks through the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;the minister said it was the Aboriginal leadership who had made this decision. I think he said words to the effect, `We did not have to make the decision; the Aboriginal leadership made that decision about rejecting these amendments.' We will look it up in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us assume that you were vaguely true. I put it to you that there are a lot of things passed in this House that do not have the total acceptance of the future recipients. The future recipients of many grants and results of legislation passed in this House would like for themselves all sorts of beneficial things that are not granted by legislation from this House. In fact, there are some other responsibilities which you might like to address. Every time you get on your feet you quote what the Aboriginal community wants, but we assume that that is all expressed in the bill. I presume that everything that the Aboriginal community wants is in the bill. You certainly did not discuss the bill with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some people called taxpayers, and we are responsible for making sure that the taxpayers' money is properly spent. I put it to you, Minister Tickner, that there is no-one else in Australia who is likely to get $500 million to be spent on land acquisition in the next 10 years. You will say, `Well, they're not indigenous,' and I will say, `But some of those people have been totally dispossessed of everything that they ever had: their families, their livelihoods, their land and their freedom.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) leaves the chamber, I would like to respond to what he said. The government is, I stress, deeply conscious of its responsibilities to govern for all Australians. It just happens that this is a bill, a quite fundamental and historic bill, addressing the dispossession of indigenous people; so it is only appropriate that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should consult and negotiate over a prolonged period with the indigenous people, whose human rights were to be enshrined in the proposed legislation which is now being debated in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased that I have the call. You would like me to have the call too, because I have to go into that chair and relieve you as soon as I finish speaking. I rise as a result of the invitation of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who several interventions ago asked for somebody to please tell him who on the government side had actually made some sort of claim about our wanting to have a hospital or a school, or something of that nature, on land purchased under the fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister responded to the shadow minister when she refuted that particular suggestion. The minister then said, `Well, I have been here for almost all of the debate, and I have not heard anybody say that.' I know the minister will be highly delighted and absolutely pleased, because he is a searcher after truth, that immediately after he said that I accessed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on the parliamentary database. I would like, in the interest of accuracy, to scotch once and for all the erroneous suggestion that some member of the opposition has said that land to be purchased under this fund must have a school, a hospital or a health service on it. The member who made the reference was the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). He commenced speaking at 12.29 p.m. yesterday. I will not read the whole speech from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but he said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a land bill and the purpose of the fund is to acquire land for Aboriginal people . . . The funds are not all that extensive. The opposition is proposing that we dilute those funds. Those opposite say&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is where he is putting a false quote into the mouths of those opposite him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We don't want to know about other funds or other legislation which might be relevant in these areas of education, housing and health. We insist that when you look at the question of land, you look at the question of health, housing and education.'</PARA>
<PARA>That was not what we said. The honourable member went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That sounds all right if we applied those standards to everybody in Western Australia or the Northern Territory who is a land developer. Do we say to a land developer who is using private funds, `Before you even acquire the land, let alone develop it, we have to be satisfied that the land is in close proximity to a school, which will deal with the problems of children, and that there is a level of medical service clearly and demonstrably available'? Of course we do not.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely true that I and other members of the coalition are deeply concerned about the issues of health, education, employment and housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have, it is true, raised those issues in connection with this fund. But it has to be pointed out that at no time&mdash;to my knowledge or, certainly, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record&mdash;has any member of the opposition made the rather silly suggestion that before people can buy land out of this fund there should be a school, a hospital or a health service.

At that press conference, he quite publicly&mdash;the transcript is available, if the honourable gentleman would like to read it&mdash;made it clear that the government would consider each and every one of the opposition amendments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to return to the amendment before the chair. I would like to pose to the coalition a further reason why the proposed amendment is inadvisable. Remember, this is a fund directed towards the acquisition of land.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the honourable member that there could not be anything more important to many Aboriginal people than to have absolute control over sacred sites&mdash;sites of great spiritual significance. Of course, the spiritual values of indigenous people are not things that merely the government recognises. I am sure there are a great many members of the opposition who respect them. Might I say that those in the broader spectrum of Australian churches and religious faiths, to their very great credit, also acknowledge and respect the spiritual beliefs of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the honourable member for Cowper that this question of access to, and control through ownership of, a site of great significance is something that the board of the corporation would properly have great regard to.

I just give this as merely one example of the inadvisability of this particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said in the course of this debate, the amendment is all about politics, and it is the politics that the government rejects and indigenous people reject absolutely. Indigenous people want an unambiguous, ungrudging recognition of their human rights to land. They do not want the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) to trample all over that right and to send all the wrong messages to the wider Australian community about their aspirations to land. That perhaps more than anything else is why I am so deeply personally opposed to this amendment. It sends all the wrong messages to the Australian people, and the opposition fails to give unambiguous recognition of the essential and pivotal importance of land to indigenous people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame when the debate in this chamber is reduced to the affected reasoning of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). I remind government members about the supposed purpose of their own bill, which is to improve the lot of Aboriginal people. On this side we certainly accept and support that sentiment but totally consistent with that sentiment is this amendment that we are supposed to be debating here today. It simply says that, when pursuing a policy of acquiring interest in land, except where the circumstances make the pursuit of such a policy impractical or inadvisable, there should be regard at all times `to the need to ensure'&mdash;having regard is hardly something which the government could surely object to&mdash;`that the health, housing or educational needs or economic viability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities will be improved as a result of the acquisition of land or interests in land to which those persons may have access'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely that is the purpose of the bill. If the government were at all accommodating in trying to get some sort of bipartisan support in this, I would have thought it would have regarded it as a fairly innocuous and supportive amendment and would have accepted it. But the government members are jumping to their feet and objecting to it on the most spurious grounds. If you object to that, it really makes you wonder what the bill is all about. It makes me wonder what the government's agenda really is. It seems that it just wants to oppose what we are putting up. We are only trying to assist it in getting a better bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking in effect of $24 million extra on top of the $21 million that ATSIC already spends. If any Australian looked at the land situation with Aboriginal people in Australia now, they would see there is ordinary land which Aborigines can buy like anybody else; there is land rights land which the states administer; there is the ATSIC land which already exists; there is Mabo land or native title land; and now we are going to have land acquisition fund land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases, despite this land which has been acquired for Aboriginal people, Aborigines are still living in the most appalling circumstances, which is regrettable. Members on both sides of the chamber agree that that is the case. In fact, in many places, Aborigines are living in the worst conditions where they own the most land. So before we start rushing in to acquire more land we should put some sensible legislation in place, such as this amendment advocates, to ensure that the best use is made of the land for Aboriginal people. That is all we are asking for: to have regard `to the need to ensure that the health, housing or educational needs or economic viability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be improved'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic viability is something that is being totally overlooked here. It is very important not just for the Aboriginal people and what they will get from the land where it is appropriate but for their credibility and the goodwill that they will engender under the reconciliation that we are supposed to be moving towards with the rest of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard, I would urge the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to look again at the wording of this amendment and to accept it. If he does not accept it, he should at least come forward with some reasonable arguments as to why not. It just seems to me that the mind of the minister is made up. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was of the mind right from the beginning to reject it outright. I find it a very regrettable situation and I would hope that the minister would reconsider. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get back to the debate, I must admit that the honourable member for Sturt did make a relatively constructive contribution this morning: he did talk about the history of bipartisanship in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. That is perhaps in the past, but he did talk about bipartisanship. That reference was highlighted by the contributions that came afterwards in which the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) talked about this government's failure and then the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) referred to 11 years of failure, presumably of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a failure&mdash;and there are problems in health and housing and all those other areas in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; there is no doubt about that&mdash;it is not a failure of a government; it is a failure of 200 years of European settlement in this country to which governments have contributed. If the honourable member for Sturt is right and there has been bipartisanship, it must be a failure on the part of all of us. We cannot both be right. If there has been bipartisanship, we must all share the failure. I accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister quite rightly asked the shadow spokesperson, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), whether she would give a guarantee in this House that there would be no more cutbacks to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. That is quite an appropriate question in view of the Fightback policy with its 10 per cent cut. So it is a very appropriate question. I cannot remember whether the honourable member for Hindmarsh has contributed to this debate, but she certainly has not been able to give that undertaking nor, I suspect, could she do so today. I do not think she has the power to do that. Nevertheless, I would suggest that that is the most pertinent question in relation to this amendment because it is obviously important that issues such as health, housing and economic independence are addressed. However, they will not be addressed by this coded amendment. </PARA>

Under the constitution of Australia, which you all refer to so often in this place, the responsibility for these issues lies with the states.

I agree with that. I think it is a key amendment, in that this amendment really has the effect of tearing the substance out of the particular purposes for which this legislation has been introduced. The primary purpose is to make funds available to Aboriginal people who will not and cannot benefit under the provisions of the Native Title Act so that they can get access to land for a whole range of reasons, all of which will be relevant to their general welfare. </PARA>

The member for Hindmarsh, in her third contribution to the debate on this amendment, said that she was conscious of and had personally observed the appalling conditions that Aborigines live in. We have to measure the genuineness of the concern of members of the opposition and the possible rhetoric which they have used in this debate against their record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has quite correctly drawn our attention to the fact that a central part of the Fightback package was to tear $90 million a year out of Aboriginal funding. This particular legislation is provided for the purpose of securing additional land for Aboriginal people in Australia, and more suitable land for economic viability purposes as well. In real terms, the amount of money that would be involved in the fund from now until the 10-year cut-off of government injections of public money is about $45 million. At the time of the last election the opposition went to the people of Australia with a package, with a formula, with a blueprint for government which involved ripping $90 million out of Aboriginal funding&mdash;for health, for housing, for education, for social conditions, for employment generation and for all of the purposes to which those funds are being applied for Aboriginal people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I relate part of my comments to those made by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). He made the observation, which was noted by numerous people on his side as a demonstration of our economic and social perfidy, that under Fightback we were going to take $90 million out of the budget for Aboriginal affairs. That is correct. It is also correct that we were going to reduce the budget of every single department of state by an equivalent amount of about 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because our objective was to make those decisions across the board because we believed then that they were the right decisions for Australia, particularly in view of the national debt, which continues to grow inexorably month by month. At least that point demonstrates that the direction we were aiming to take Australia, had the people chosen us, was basically correct. I do not wish to see any member of the government stand up in here and try to make a virtue out of necessity because of the weaknesses in the government's own legislation that has been brought before this House. To argue that somehow or other we have deliberately selected Aboriginal affairs for a reduction in government expenditure is simply not the fact. I want that clearly on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were again accused by the honourable member for Charlton of perfidy in our approach and, according to him, our apparent lack of concern for Aboriginal welfare in the wider context, not only regarding land but also housing, education and welfare. I have no doubt&mdash;I sincerely hope I am telling the truth when I make this observation&mdash;that the honourable member for Charlton has also visited Aboriginal settlements in the Northern Territory, and that he has been to outstations and seen the conditions in which many of those people live. I am sure he would agree with me that, generally, those conditions are appalling. We try to do the right thing by Aboriginal welfare by saying, `You now have access to land and you, of course, have the right to live where you like on that land.' That is the general philosophical position. It is a position chosen by the government and it is a position shared by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let no side of this parliament be so naive as to suggest that, having accepted a principle, it necessarily follows that the application of that principle in terms of the lifestyle of the people who live there is in any sense satisfactory to them or to us. Time and time again, when I was shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, I would go to outstations and the people would say to us, `You have given us the land, but look at the way we have to live.' I would be left speechless. Perhaps my colleagues on the government side, under those circumstances, could have come out with a little fib here and a little fib there. The truth of the matter is that those people were desperate then and, sadly, some years later, many of them are still desperate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been trying to emphasise that, when a decision is made to purchase land, irrespective of where it may be, side by side with that decision consideration must also be given to the conditions which will exist for the people who want to live on that land. If giving them land means that their access to education, their access to health, their access to any possibility of employment or prospects are significantly diminished, then obviously commonsense tells you that funds need to be made available to prop up the purchase of the land with the necessary resources to ensure that, having moved onto that land, that community has something on which it can base its economic and social wellbeing. That is the essence of our approach. It is nothing that we are ashamed of; it is simply commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this government to come in here and for the minister to say after a five-minute examination of our legislation that he is dismissing it out of hand simply misses the point that we have been making all along. Why does he dismiss it? Apparently it is because we did not talk to various Aboriginal leaders. That simply suggests that legislation from the government side is not drafted by the government but exclusively by Aboriginal leaders that tell the government what they want. We have been trying to make the point that, in too many cases, individual Aboriginal communities and families in those communities&mdash;whether they be small families or extended families&mdash;are being left out of the equation because they do not have political strength. Those people who shout the loudest are the ones that the government listens to, and not necessarily to the ordinary Aboriginal people whom we want to help. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two points I want to make. Firstly, I congratulate the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) for again putting the opposition on the spot and for making it very clear that the cuts in Fightback will impact harshly on the education, employment and housing of indigenous people. Secondly, there has been no response from the shadow minister to match the government's commitment to maintain expenditure in these areas. With the greatest of respect, she and the coalition ought to be saying, `Let us have a difference of opinion about how programs are managed and how programs are directed. Let us quarantine expenditure in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs from cuts because it is the pre-eminent issue of social justice in this country.' That is why we differ from the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). We do not believe in across-the-board cuts; we believe in social justice. That is our guiding light.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think honourable members opposite liked what I had to say then. To make a further, quite separate and distinct point, the honourable member for Bradfield made a very important point about the need for long-term planning in relation to providing infrastructure and services on land which is purchased by the land fund or which is currently purchased by ATSIC. That is certainly something that has been recognised by the whole parliament in the passage of the ATSIC Act, the preparation of regional plans and the placing of the decision making power in the hands of indigenous people. The point that I wish to make is that the government has reinforced its commitment to doing just that by ensuring that two members of the board of the fund are going to be members of ATSIC. Quite obviously, there will have to be a great deal of cooperative work undertaken between ATSIC and the board of the fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another reason why this amendment is so poorly judged. I have a very easy and simple illustration. It often happens that areas of great importance to Aboriginal people are being held by non-indigenous people in private ownership for a great period of time. It is land that may be of enormous spiritual importance to those people. As members from the more rural areas will know, perhaps once in a decade or once in 50 years that property gets on the market. What on earth would a responsible board of a land fund do in those circumstances? Would it have regard to this amendment? It would be moving with the speed of light to try to get an option on the property to secure it for indigenous people. That is why we are calling it a land fund. Sure, these other issues have to be addressed, but let us not pretend that, with one stroke of the pen, there will immediately be a school, housing and other infrastructure on that land. The land has to be acquired first. It just amazes me and, I am afraid to say, it makes indigenous people very angry that this very simple concept cannot be grasped. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make one further contribution to this question of the cuts proposed in the Aboriginal affairs budget by the coalition prior to the last election. Putting aside the fact that it is ancient history, let me again emphasise that this government has built an Aboriginal industry with a cast of thousands and $90 million could have been taken out of the administration and the bureaucracy of Aboriginal affairs without the slightest impact on services or on the delivery of better facilities and opportunities for Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an area that has been abysmally overwhelmed by expensive bureaucracy. Those sorts of things have been a part of the reason that the government's performance in this area has been so poor. I think it is really hypocritical of the government to be drawing attention to proposed cuts while it squanders so much money on needless administration, setting up corporations and getting in the way of Aboriginals advancing their own cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add one other line, and that is that the coalition Fightback package was a two-sided document. There were also very substantial cuts in taxation and other areas which would have saved ATSIC and other Aboriginal organisations considerable amounts of money. So to talk in terms of those cuts showing a lack of commitment to Aborigines is an unjust and unwarranted comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has so far opposed opposition amendments which would have allowed land funds to flow to individuals to buy land, to give genuine land rights to individuals. The government has opposed proposals to make the land council more accountable and to recover funds that had been wrongly applied. Now the government is proposing to oppose a requirement that this fund be used for such worthwhile purposes as assisting health, housing and education needs and the economic viability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities. It seems to me that this suggests that there is not much left of an Aboriginal affairs policy when you are not prepared to be supportive of those sorts of noble objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is clearly what the opposition has in mind in ensuring that the land fund is used productively and used wisely, genuinely to benefit Aborigines and not just to accumulate vacant acres that are not used for any purpose. The real intent is that the fund should be used productively so that those acquisitions can really benefit the Aboriginal people. This amendment and others that have preceded it are important in the way in which they propose to deliver responsibility, attachment and ownership to particular individuals so that people have responsibility for the land that is entrusted to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall vividly the situation in the Cherbourg Aboriginal community in my own electorate where for many years the council, which owns most of the houses, did not really bother too much about collecting rent. Rent payments became optional. So there was never any money then to spend on maintenance of the houses and, naturally, they fell into a state of disrepair. People had no responsibility for the houses because no-one ever bothered following up and collecting the rent. A new council was elected and for the first time it started to evict people who did not pay their rent. It is remarkable what a change of attitude occurred. People started feeling responsible for their homes; they knew they were theirs and that, when they paid their rent, there would be a return on that money through improvements to the housing. There was certainly a new sense of responsibility towards those homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much better that would be if those people could actually buy the houses themselves and that, instead of their being owned by the community council, the corporation, the land council or the other tiers of bureaucracy being established by the government, individuals could acquire those homes, make them their own property and care for them for themselves and for their families. That would certainly aid their health, their education needs and their prospects for the future. This ought to be encouraged. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been sitting in my room watching these proceedings on the television and I must say that I was drawn to come back down here after listening to the last two speakers from the opposition. It was astounding to hear the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) get up here and wear, with a badge of honour, the proposals for Fightback. It was also astounding to hear the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who has just spoken, say that $90 million could be cut out of Aboriginal administration and it would not be felt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, what this illustrates is the absolute paucity of understanding in the opposition about these issues. I am surprised particularly by the honourable member for Bradfield&mdash;I know he has got a bit of a reputation around the place for what he does in his spare time&mdash;that the opposition is actually saying to us that there is room for us to cut $90 million and that this was going to be a cut across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) told us in his speech on the second reading about the absolutely abysmal state of affairs with regard to Aboriginal health, housing and education. He says this on the one hand, but he and his colleagues still defend propositions which would worsen the situation. I cannot quite see that there is any credibility in that argument at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the opposition members are saying that the responsibility of the commission&mdash;the body to administer the funds&mdash;ought to be to look after improvements in the standard of Aboriginal health and housing. Can they not see that there is an ultimate contradiction in their argument? The purpose of this exercise is to purchase property&mdash;land&mdash;and it might well be that the purchase of some land might serve a productive purpose in producing fat cattle, for example. It might have a very useful social purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, the guts of this issue is Aboriginal land&mdash;the social, psychological, spiritual and cultural importance of land to Aboriginal people. This aspect seems to be totally lost on many members of the opposition. They then try to tie in the proposals in this land fund bill with improvement to the health, education and housing status of Aboriginal people, while at the same time defending propositions which would have cut the amount of money available across all portfolios and within the Aboriginal affairs portfolio to provide those services. You have to wonder about them, do you not? How can you take them seriously?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they should be doing, as I have said previously in this debate, if they have serious concern about Aboriginal housing status and health and education, is to go to the state and territory governments and ask them what the hell they have been doing. Opposition members should sheet the responsibility home to where it rests and not try to transfer it to an Aboriginal organisation, the function of which is to purchase land. </PARA>

The comments have ranged far and wide, and I do want to make reference to the comments of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that we are debating at the moment goes to the very heart of this bill. As Senator Cheryl Kernot said, the position of the opposition amounts to gutting the fund. This is not the government's assessment; this is the view of the Australian Democrats. I would have hoped that the Liberal Party and the National Party would have taken notice because, at the end of the day, the numbers in the Senate will decide this matter. What did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) say? We are not sure what he is saying at the moment&mdash;I think he has run for cover&mdash;but he said on 30 August:</PARA>

<PARA>They are carrying on about bipartisanship. They are bleating about it. If they were really taking a bipartisan approach, they would indicate their support for the bill. But, no, as a result of their own difficulties they came out and said, `If you won't do this, we won't play ball.' That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a typical example, my good colleague the member for Wide Bay, who was excellent in the chair&mdash;I must pay him that compliment&mdash;talked about Cherbourg. He did not say it was very clear in the history of Queensland that there was a total abrogation of human and civil rights of Aboriginal people. These people have been subjected to appalling conditions of dependency for the last 150 years, and therefore we should not be surprised that it is taking a little time for those people to become empowered. He gave an example that, when you do move to make a difference, you can empower Aboriginal people to make decisions and deal with their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what Aboriginal people are saying, and that is what Sol Bellear said in the Great Hall in response to these proposed amendments just after the opposition leader made his speech on the second reading of this bill. He said that Aboriginal medical services, which are particularly concerned and have been critical of the government in relation to the way we deal with health issues, support the government on this land fund bill. Land is essential for their people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition come in here, beat their breasts and try to take the high moral ground about the appalling health conditions&mdash;conditions over which there is no disagreement. This government is committed to addressing that issue, and there are other very difficult social infrastructure issues to deal with. I refer to the comment of the member for Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) in the Northern Territory that state governments have abrogated their responsibilities and have not allocated effective funding for infrastructure in Aboriginal communities for health, education and housing, even though money was provided for those purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again in the access and equity inquiry of the House of Representatives standing committee it has been made very clear that in health, education and housing, to which this amendment refers, the state governments have commented, `Oh, well, it's Aboriginal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring up another point with regard to the reasons why the government is opposed to amendment No. 4. My point comes from the experience that I and other members have had in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In one of our trips, I am pretty sure it was to Western Australia, we went to a community that had a problem with getting access to a sacred site that was in fact contained within a pastoral property. The Aboriginal people were seeking from our committee some assistance to negotiate access to that site because they had trouble with the leaseholder, who was not allowing people to move onto that sacred site because he was running cattle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this land acquisition fund that the government is setting up, that is the type of property about which the local community would say, `We would like you to purchase that for us'&mdash;not because they intend to make it an economic operation but because they want that sacred site returned to their community. That is part of the spiritual and cultural needs of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that we are seeking to address in this land acquisition fund. That part is being ignored by the opposition in its amendment where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with regard, at all times, to the need to ensure that the health, housing or educational needs or economic viability . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition has ignored one of the most fundamental reasons why we are establishing this fund; that is, to also deal with the spiritual and cultural needs of Aboriginal people. This fund will deal with the health, educational and economic needs of Aboriginal people because many of the purchases will be for those purposes. Many of the purchases will enable an improved economic position for a community. That is one of the major motivations of the fund. So to consider that we, as a government, are not taking that into account is quite false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also taking into account those other elements. If one had a complete understanding of the importance of land to Aboriginal people in a cultural and spiritual sense, one would understand that we cannot restrict the purchases to ones which address economic viability or employment, health and housing needs. The purchases have to extend to examples like I have cited where communities have lost access to their sacred sites, where they would like to have the opportunity to purchase a property for it to be theirs&mdash;not so they could make it something that they could earn an income from but so they could deal with their cultural and spiritual needs that have been lost or taken away from them because of our colonisation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the other reasons why we are opposing this amendment. It restricts too much the capacity of the fund to deal with those types of needs, which will be many across Australia.

Amendment No. 5 is a consequential amendment which depends on an amendment to proposed section 191D (1). Amendment No. 6 proposes an addition to proposed section 191E(1)(c). It ensures that any land management activities in relation to indigenous held land are carried out with the agreement of the holders of the land. I would have thought the minister would be highly in agreement with that, and I simply cannot understand why he is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 7 addresses proposed section 191E(3). This ensures that, in the performance of its functions, the ILC does not merely consider the desirability of following the criteria; it must give priority to its functions mentioned in proposed section 191E (3)(a) to (c). Amendment No. 8 addresses proposed section 191F(2). Again, this amendment strengthens the regard that the ILC must have for its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 9, which is tied in with amendment No. 10, addresses proposed section 191F(4). These two amendments ensure that the ILC, in dealing with matters that are sacred or otherwise significant to any particular group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, must not discuss any material that is sensitive to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, when such matters affect the dealing of the corporation, the corporation must provide a written report to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 11 is a consequential amendment which again depends on our first major amendment today. It widens the scope of the bill to allow not only corporations to have grants but also individuals, trusts and partnerships. Amendment No. 12 addresses proposed section 191N(2)(a). It is consequential, in that it extends preference not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations but also to individuals and trusts. </PARA>

It is our view that the corporation should be able to carry out land management activities that do not necessarily relate to a particular area of land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just give some examples of the kinds of activities that it might be very good public policy for the Indigenous Land Corporation to engage in. I think it would be very important for the corporation to instil to the greatest degree it constructively could an understanding in the wider Australian community about the very essence and purpose of the legislation: that it does not threaten the rights of non-indigenous Australians and that it seeks to address a fundamental issue of social justice. I think it would be good public policy if the Indigenous Land Corporation had a capacity to be able to carry out broader educational initiatives concerning good environmental management of land. The amendment that the coalition seeks to move would unduly restrain the corporation from that kind of activity; therefore, the governments does not support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments (7) and (8) relate to an attempt by the coalition again to unduly restrict the activities of the Indigenous Land Corporation. I ask honourable members to note that the government recognises that there are certain matters that the corporation ought to have regard to and that the board should properly consider, but we are not prepared to direct them as to these matters being the priorities in the form the coalition wants. We do not think it is an amendment that improves the legislation; we think it would adversely impact on the policy of the bill to entrust those matters of judgment, which often involve individual case judgments, to the members of the board of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments (9) and (10), as the shadow minister has told us, relate to matters of reporting of issues that may be sacred to indigenous people. We do not accept this because again we do not think it is good policy. We believe there is a potential element of cultural insensitivity to impose this requirement, especially in view of the fact that it is not included in comparable major legislation, including the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which was of course legislation of the Fraser Liberal government. That is not to deny Edward Gough Whitlam and his government the credit for the impetus of the social movement and, indeed, the legislation itself, but it was the Fraser government that brought it into existence. This provision is not in that legislation; nor is it, of course, in the Native Title Act. We do not think it should be in this one. </PARA>

<PARA>They are the very words we have added to 191E(1)(c), yet the minister says we cannot add them because they will restrict the activities of the ILC.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To carry on, or arrange for the carrying on of, land management activities in relation to indigenous-held land under agreements with the holders of the land . . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to carry on other land management activities in relation to indigenous-held land&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>other than what was mentioned in proposed paragraph (a). But it does not add that clause. So we have simply added the clause that was in the corresponding part of the bill in proposed paragraph (a)&mdash;mirroring exactly what the government intended. I would be delighted for the minister to tell me the difference. Regarding amendments Nos 7 and 8, if the minister is so unsure of the instructions given to the Indigenous Land Corporation that he is not prepared to replace the words `desirability of' with `priority to', I would suggest that the minister has very little faith in his bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation may seek to work with indigenous organisations which own land as a part of that broader campaign and the broader awareness initiative of the corporation.

We are not prepared to further restrict the scope of the board to undertake such a broader initiative. For example, it may be very important for the board members to bring in the holders and owners of various pastoral properties for some form of educational or other initiative.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We need to go through these amendments, because it needs to be understood by our fellow Australians that the coalition is proposing to strengthen the role of indigenous land owners against what could be an overpowering bureaucracy operated by the Indigenous Land Corporation. There are three small paragraphs. The first one says that the corporation will not do anything until it talks to the landowner. You will give this land away&mdash;you are spending over $1 billion giving land to Aboriginal communities&mdash;and then you will leave this outfit in charge of it. In one instance you say that it shall consult, yet two paragraphs later you say that it need not consult. The wording is identical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will give the minister an example of what could occur because it only relates to indigenously held land; it does not relate to any wide land pattern of management, any examination of what lands might be eligible for indigenous land-holders to take up or anything like that. The land must be held by indigenous people. Under this proposal, you are giving the Indigenous Land Corporation the power to make any management decisions it chooses about that land. It can put roads through it or build fences or open a tourist station on it. It could do anything there. It does not have to consult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will run through the three paragraphs in sequence. They appear to be almost identical and somewhat confused. The first one says that the Indigenous Land Council can carry out land management functions or arrange to carry out those functions after consultation and agreement with the holders of the land. The second one says that it can carry on, or arrange to carry on, land management activities in relation to land held by the Indigenous Land Corporation. That is its own land. But then there is a paragraph which says that it can carry on other land management activities in relation to indigenously held land. There is no consultation or concern for the Aboriginal people or the ones for whom this bill is supposed to be in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is putting forward an incredible proposition. It is expecting us to believe that it is not paternalism or centralised control and that it is not a group of five or six people sending their servants into Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, New South Wales or even the ACT to tell the landowners what is good for them. It could put a road through the land, start a tourist place on it or do whatever it likes. The bill is clear: the power rests centrally. The Indigenous Land Corporation has a veto over the holders of land. It is clear that it can do what it likes without consultation with the indigenous landowners who hold the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We will go through the rest of these four or five amendments. We are asking the government to do some fairly simple things.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 191E(1)(a) talks about land management activities that the corporation will undertake on specific sites of land. So, if it is going to do something to a particular site of land&mdash;and you have used all these examples of putting a road through, building a tourist development and all of that&mdash;it must negotiate with the holders of that land. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has explained that paragraph (c) refers to carrying on other land management activities in relation to indigenous-held land. It talks about general educational or promotional activities. It talks about where the ILC may want to talk to all indigenous-held land corporations and say, `Well, you should be doing this as far as your land management activities are concerned,' so it can run educational programs. It is a lunacy to suggest that, in the performance of its duties in relation to land management, the ILC has to refer every decision it makes about running an education program to every holder of the land. If it is doing something on one specifically held piece of land, it is required to negotiate with the holders of that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But proposed section 191E(1)(c) relates to other activities. It relates to general activities that the corporation will be undertaking in advancing land management activities. It is designed to ensure that the board has the capacity under the act to do those things. It will not be possible to run general educational activities if this clause does not exist. You well know that acts often have sections of a similar nature which are designed to give, firstly, a specific duty and, secondly, a more broader responsibility. It is ludicrous for the opposition to suggest that those words should be inserted in that third paragraph when it will defeat the very purpose it is meant to achieve, and that is to ensure that the corporation can undertake general educational activities to promote good land management practices by all indigenous land-holders throughout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the other amendments are consistent with the opposition's desire to try to restrict the flexibility of the board to make the appropriate decisions in relation to its activities as a corporation in purchasing land, and are consistent with the opposition's total lack of understanding about what the corporation is about or what this bill is about. That is why the opposition's amendments are rejected by the government and will not be supported. </PARA>

That will mean that employers in that sector of the economy can go to the training company which has been established by their organisation with the trade unions to take on trainees for traineeships.

In bringing McCarthyist smears to Australia yesterday, the Prime Minister suggested that members of parliament should not knowingly or unknowingly address an organisation known as the League of Rights. In answer to a question I asked just a moment ago relating to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, the Prime Minister made the point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But he is not the leader of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Prime Minister aware that Mr Ian Taylor, the Leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia, issued an invitation to members of the Australian Heritage Society to meet him and his shadow cabinet this week? Is he aware that the society's letterhead says that it was formed in 1971 and is a division of the Australian League of Rights? Will the Prime Minister now call on the Leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia to resign, or is this another case of the Prime Minister's double standards? I seek leave to table the invitation from Mr Taylor.</PARA>

Before the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is walking out and who has himself been party to the shame of the Labor Party this week, had ever seen the amendments, they rejected them saying, `We are not interested in your amendments, but we don't know what they are.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us have a look at the way the Prime Minister tries to get the racial line up. He never comes out and says that I am a racist or that members of the coalition are racists&mdash;never anything as unsubtle as that. It is always the underlying theme. So when I made that speech in Western Australia about the Native Title Act, what was the Prime Minister's reaction to that? It was that I am run by the `worst elements of conservatism', which he described as `unrestrained bigotry'. This was, you might say, clever politics because he does not say that I am a bigot. What he does is get them to write that I am a bigot. So on the front page of the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> we ended up with the headline, "`Downer is a bigot', says PM". That is what you wanted, and you got it. That is part of the subliminal campaign to cast aspersions on everybody over here as being racist. That is what your campaign is all about. And this, the first of the racist smears in my time as the Leader of the Opposition, which is only three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we came to the notorious so-called League of Rights affair. This relates to assertions about what I did seven years ago. What was the Prime Minister doing seven years ago? Do you remember what you were doing seven years ago? Do you remember what you were doing seven days ago?  Seven years ago this was a headline from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, `Keating predicts lower loan rates'. What happened then? They went up to 17 per cent, business loans went above 20 per cent and you created the worst recession in 60 years. So that is what you were saying seven years ago but what you did was put a million people out of work. Nice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How about this, the same week: `Keating move for PM denied'. I just thought I would mention it. I think you would like to be reminded of that, wouldn't you? This affair over the last few days is one of the more despicable events in Australian federal political history. In many respects it is a watershed moment in Australian political history because we as a country have to ask ourselves: are we going to continue to tolerate the underlying, underhand racial slur from the man who is supposed to be the political leader of this country or is resistance going to be put up to this type of political tactic and are all Australians eventually going to say that enough is enough? I tell you, they are going to say that enough is enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the Senate we had Senator Bolkus. First of all, we had somebody called David Epstein. He is not well-known to members on this side of the House but he is the man who runs the National Media Liaison Service. He was wandering around the press gallery shamefacedly distributing a lot of material always designed to give the impression that I was some sort of vile, far right wing racist&mdash;never saying it, but always designed to give that impression. Then we had Senate question time. In Senate question time we had Senator Bolkus. Senator Bolkus was using all the quotes of Eric Butler and these other characters from the League of Rights, anti-Semitic quotes that I think everyone here would be appalled with, and then associating me with those remarks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently, this is all right; this does not matter to the Prime Minister. But when somebody on our side of the House has anything to do with any organisation of that kind in any shape or form, it is time for the subliminal racist campaign. Australians are not impressed with those double standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the House may be interested in my third example of double standards. It is interesting to know what the Prime Minister said about his great hero in politics, Jack Lang. Do you remember Jack Lang, the man whom the Prime Minister campaigned to get brought back into the Labor Party? Jack Lang was expelled from the Labor Party. Years passed and the Prime Minister was one of those who tried to get him back into the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister once said of Jack Lang, `Lang taught me a lot about the feeling and the spirit of the Labor Party.' Jack Lang! What a hero! What did Jack Lang say? Jack Lang could only be described as anti-Semitic. If you read the biography of Jack Lang, you would learn that he was a man who attacked Jewish migration from what was then called Palestine. He thought they were people who would dabble in black market commerce when they arrived and would create Australian ghettos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing we know about the Prime Minister's hero is that he was anti-Semitic. The second thing we know about the Prime Minister's hero is that he thought the white Australia policy was a wonderful thing. He told the House of Representatives that `white Australia is the most vital plank of our national policy'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these points for a good reason. It is not to suggest that the Prime Minister is anti-Semitic or that the Prime Minister would like a return to the white Australia policy. Obviously, no-one in this House wants that. I make the simple point that the man whom he describes as his great hero in politics is a man who held those views. It would be pretty crass to draw the conclusion that the Prime Minister was therefore associated with someone who was anti-Semitic and who believed in white supremacy. Yet that is the sort of standard that the Prime Minister applies to public debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This House should censure the Prime Minister. In the office of Prime Minister, he has lowered the standards of public respectability. The Prime Minister has brought into disrepute the House of Representatives. He has brought into disrepute the institution of the parliament. He is a man who does not uphold the standards that Australians expect from a Prime Minister of this country. He uses any political opportunity he can to smear his opponents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, he has descended to the ugliest of all smears. This time the Prime Minister really has gone too far. I think the House should understand that. Even members on the other side, biased as they may be, are embarrassed by the depths to which the Prime Minister has sunk this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He started the week on the Aboriginal land fund, rejecting the coalition's amendments before he had seen them&mdash;at best a man who is insincere. He ended the week by sinking into the political gutter. Playing around in the gutter, suddenly he found Ian Taylor there. Not only is it embarrassing for the Prime Minister, it is worse than that. The Prime Minister has reduced the standards of public office in this country and it is about time the House censured him and we did something about resuming better standards in Australia. </PARA>

If you are not sure of what you stand for, it is not easy to pick your company wisely. Downer does not know who his friends should be.</PARA>
<PARA>Dead right&mdash;and dead right in 1987! Mr Oakes then goes on to talk about the debate in respect of the Tasmanian legislation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So one day Downer is with the godly; the next day the ungodly. Will the real Alexander Downer please stand up? No, he won't. He can't because he doesn't have a position.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem. And then, of course, compounding all this, the Leader of the Opposition came in the other day with the nerve&mdash;the gall&mdash;to say of the government that it was putting at risk reconciliation with Aboriginal people in this country, when he had stood up in front of rednecks and said he would repeal the native title legislation. Then he came in, disingenuously, with a set of amendments, and said, `Unless they are agreed to, we will oppose the bill.' In other words, he had no intention of supporting the land fund legislation&mdash;none whatsoever. It took until 3.30 the following day&mdash;that is, yesterday&mdash;for the government to even see the amendments. These important philosophically based amendments took 1 1/2 days to turn up!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What did we find in the amendments? That unless Aboriginal people can show subjectively that they are improved in health, education and other things, they do not get access to their land.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition came in and said, `I am supporting the land fund.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing about the intervention and comment of the Prime Minister this day is that he denied and deferred&mdash;in fact bypassed completely&mdash;the accusation in relation to Ian Taylor.

It is with sadness that we are debating this matter today.

It is not just all the words that he chooses to use at the dispatch box from time to time&mdash;words that I will not delay the House with&mdash;and it is not just his arrogance; it is his double standards. So it was that yesterday at 4.40 p.m. he decided to enter that room where Bob Hawke gave his final press conference as Prime Minister after Keating had knocked him off. Bob Hawke effectively took leave of the prime ministership in that press conference room. Yesterday Keating took leave of his senses in raising this whole question of McCarthyism of the worst kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of us come to politics with the aim of improving the lot of Australians. Some of us come to our deliberations in a parliamentary sitting week with a view to seeing what we can do for our electors as they face drought and a very patchy economic recovery, and as they battle with real life far from the cocoon of Canberra. When we go back to our electorates and see the further deterioration facing so many families in this, the International Year of the Family, people ask us, `Why is the Prime Minister of this country carrying on in his arrogant way, not even defending what he believes about Australia?' They ask, `Why is he bringing racist interventions into the public debate of this country?' They also ask, `Why doesn't he get on with the job of providing some decent parliamentary activity and governance of this country?' This Prime Minister is a man who has failed the responsibilities of his office. But he has done something worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going down this track, I think it is time to turn back to some of the exact words written about Jack Lang. I know the Leader of the Opposition made passing reference to this. Either you knew exactly what Jack Lang thought about the migration program and policies of this country or you are a fool. Either you knew what he had written about the Jewish communities of the world and the world banking interests or you are a complete fool. I want to quote from the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Big Fella</EMPHASIS> by Bede Nairn. Of Lang's policy speech during a state election in New South Wales, Nairn wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was also self-revelatory. He shared, with Anstey and other socialists, as well as the members of the boards of the Royal Sydney Golf Club and of the Melbourne Club, in the uneven but widespread anti-Semitism in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So his references to Niemeyer, whom he regarded, incorrectly, as a Jew, were always accompanied by a special twist to his snarl, an extra rapidity to his swinging hands and stabbing fingers, and a conspiratorial tone to his staccato delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably the Prime Minister has heard of Otto Niemeyer. He has probably heard of the statements named after him by the treasury department. Presumably, the Prime Minister knew, when he sat at the feet of Jack Lang, that these were the views of Jack Lang. Presumably the Prime Minister felt absolutely comfortable in associating with Jack Lang, notwithstanding Jack Lang's deeply held anti-Semitic views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are going to go down this path, would you care to explain to the House why it was all right for you to support Jack Lang at every occasion but not for the Leader of the Opposition? You have been caught out as one of the most arrogant prime ministers ever to come to the dispatch box. You have been caught bringing racism into the political agenda of this nation when it is the last thing that you should do. You have been caught out in your substandard attitude to building a proper relationship with Asia in the early days of your political career. You have been exposed time and time again. In these circumstances, there is no doubt in my mind that you should pay the price. You should allow your members to vote the way that they would vote on this motion if given half a chance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This censure motion is based on a suggestion that the Leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia knowingly, off his own bat, invited members of the Australian Heritage Society to meet with him. We have from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) a conjured up image of the serried ranks of the frontbench of the opposition in Western Australia seeking a personal meeting with the League of Rights front organisation in Western Australia so they could exchange vows and views. An invitation was sent out by the secretary of the associated campaign organisations to 980 organisations in the Helena region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition, it was augmented. Apparently the Australian Heritage Society was included with 103 names provided from Infolink in the Alexander library as an organisation that had associations in the Helena region. This invitation went out to 1,000 organisations. That is the first point I make. We now know how the invitation ended up in the hands of the League of Rights. What we do not know is how the League of Rights invitation ended up in the hands of the Liberal Party. Is that not an interesting thing to think about?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the invitation that went out to the Heritage Society was not on the letterhead of the Western Australian branch of the Heritage Society. So ask yourselves: how did the letterhead of the Western Australian branch of the Heritage Society end up in the hands of the Liberal tacticians? These are very interesting questions to think about because it says that for somebody in the Western Australian Liberal Party there is a lock-step relationship with the League of Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;unknowingly he says and unfortunately for him&mdash;has been earning money for the League of Rights for the last seven years as it has retailed his video, and just as people have benefited from that particular link in South Australia there is clearly somebody in the Western Australian Liberal Party who feels as though he or she would benefit from this particular relationship with the League of Rights in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that the Leader of the Opposition has liked to portray his troubles this week, and they have been many and varied, as a product of the devilishness of the Australian Prime Minister&mdash;the Prime Minister's sleeping and waking thought is, `How can I invent yet something else that will slip a torpedo into Alexander?' It is a feature of Alexander's self-obsession that he arrives at this conclusion but, again, his self-obsession does not relate exactly to the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pretty well-known about the place that the material that ended up in Laurie Oakes's hands came at some point from the Liberal Party. Quite clearly, he has been subject to destabilisation from that section of the Liberal Party that clearly has no truck with the League of Rights as opposed to the other section of the Liberal Party that receives correspondence from the League of Rights and passes it across to the Liberal Party frontbench team here. That is the second interesting feature of this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the Leader of the Opposition should be destabilised in this way, because what has happened to him is a reflection of the way in which he conducts himself in public life and the way in which he treats his colleagues. The most effective cartoon of him this week was not a cartoon about the Leader of the Opposition as a racist&mdash;an accusation that has never been levelled at him by people in Australian politics&mdash;it was a cartoon of the Leader of the Opposition as a cushion, representing the last backside that sat upon him that might advance his interests. That is the most effective cartoon of the Leader of the Opposition as far as the presentations this week are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing I would point out about the Leader of the Opposition's habits is this: the Leader of the Opposition is a terrific perpetrator in his party of how he gets some of the most rotten people in his show running for him without directly associating with him. How do you do that? It is your version of statesmanship. You get every ratbag element in your show, use them to destroy your opponents, get close to them, have little chats with them and occasionally rap them over the knuckles and in no circumstances repudiate them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you start running around and using it as a term of political abuse, you will run out of language to identify and condemn despicable behaviour when you see it. Nothing could be more damaging to the cause of anti-racism than to go slinking around and using this as a term of political abuse. At the end of the day, if you cry wolf too many times, you will run out of the ability to warn the Australian public when it does see a wolf coming along.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Prime Minister let himself down; he let the great office of Prime Minister down; he let the nation of Australia down; and he let the people of Australia down with the grubby politics of smear and innuendo. Yesterday he was too clever to be caught saying that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was a racist, but he was clever enough to slide around, trying to make sure that the newspapers ran it and trying to put that heavy implication on somebody who is decent and tolerant and does not deserve that kind of opprobrium, regardless of what his political views might be in opposition to the Labor Party. If you start trying to run the politics of racism and abuse on that person, you will not help the cause of tolerance in Australia. You will turn this into a political football. You will excite passions and the very things that responsible leaders would not intend to do. </PARA>

The Prime Minister could not get out there quickly enough to try to run a subliminal agenda.

The Treasurer was given the opportunity to run the subliminal text in a press conference at 1.15 p.m. A journalist asked:</PARA>

He had the tongue of a viper and the morals of a snake as he sat there and watched question time yesterday. He knew that it was time to run out the subliminal text in relation to the Leader of the Opposition. When he was asked whether he believed that the Leader of the Opposition had anti-Semitic views, the Prime Minister said, `It's hard to explain that he addressed the League of Rights meeting.'

We can all do it. I can do it against you. Tomorrow you can do it against me. But if it is done, at the end of the day no Australian politician is going to be sticking to the issues and no informed debate is going to be happening and, when you do find real racists, you are going to run out of language to describe them.

He referred to our having to run this country cooperatively between the Commonwealth and state governments `and with local government, I might say, the idea that certain things of the states and certain things of the Commonwealth . . .' .

He would not be a person who tailored his message, would he? He would not be the kind of person who got over there in Western Australia and talked about states rights in a way he would never do here, would he? Of course he would be, because he is one of the great masters of changing his language, one of the great masters of narrowcasting his messages, one of the great masters of sending out the subliminal text, one of the great masters of smear and innuendo and abuse. </PARA>

That is what has pulled the standards down in Australia. That is what has changed the rules. That is what has led to the language we hear. That is what has opened the gate to this subliminal text.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) finished by talking about the rules of this place. Any experienced member of this place knows that if he has been subject to an allegation that is not true or has been misled in a press report he has a very simple process available to him. Under the standing orders he can rise in his place and indicate that he has been misrepresented. I honestly thought yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition would refer to the press reports concerning his speaking at a League of Rights conference and say, quite frankly, as was suggested from his office right from the outset, that he had been misrepresented. At that stage, if there was any misrepresentation, it was not coming out of the office of the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition could have stood in his place and said, `It has been suggested that I spoke to the League of Rights conference. I want the House to know that when that conference took place I believed I was responding to an invitation from a religious group. I want the House to know that I deplore the League of Rights. I condemn its anti-semitism. I condemn its racism.' Then he could have sat down. I, for one, and every member of this House, would have been pleased to accept that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must ask ourselves why that statement was not made. If it had been made, the matter would have ended there. It was simple and it was appropriate. But the real problem is that if you make that sort of statement to this House and it turns out not to be true and accurate, you are in deep trouble. We, as members, are bound to accept a statement along those lines on the basis that the member making that explanation is telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did it not happen? I spent some time looking at the material in respect of this matter. Quite frankly, I represent an electorate where many people have suffered as a result of racism and the terms `racism' and `anti-semitism' are not to be used lightly. Too many people have suffered. So there was, as one would expect, a press briefing. What was said on the first occasion of that press briefing to a bevy of journalists? He confirmed he had spoken to a seminar in 1987 but believed it was organised by a Christian group to discuss the constitution and was unaware of any connection with the League of Rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have taken the words out of my mouth. The problem for him was that that was only version one. So I went and looked at some of the videoed questions to see what version two was. When asked on a Channel 9 program whether he had ever been on a League of Rights platform, he started to say, `If I have been'&mdash;the implication, of course, being that he might have been&mdash;but then he paused, stopped, changed tack and said, `Sure I've been on platforms where there have been people from the League of Rights around. I have never given any support to the league.' What is the reasonable inference from that? That he was an honest, decent fellow who had gone along to a meeting and there could have been some League of Rights people there? I do not know how he would have known. They do not actually walk around with big badges which say `I am in the League of Rights'&mdash;but it could have been the case. That was version two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have version three. At this stage, who enters the debate? Eric Butler. Let me say quite candidly and openly that, having regard to Eric Butler's record, I was hoping desperately that the Leader of the Opposition was telling the truth. Let me read out what Eric Butler said in a press interview. At this stage nothing had been said by the office of the Leader of the Opposition. He started off almost in a fatherly way:</PARA>

<PARA>This hardly fits the description of people from the League of Rights. As the videos show, Eric Butler was not just acting like a father figure, saying `nice of you to come'; he was sharing the platform with the Leader of the Opposition. Who else was on the platform with him? Jeremy Lee. Let me remind the honourable gentleman opposite&mdash;and for the benefit of those who may be uninformed&mdash;that Mr Jeremy Lee is a full-time officer of the League of Rights, and he was the sponsor of notorious revisionist historian David Irving, who would have us believe that the Holocaust did not happen.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was arranged by the late Mr Frank Bawden, who was the State Director in South Australia at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>But you could not expect a young politician to know that! He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And he arranged it and he informed me&mdash;I was National Director&mdash;that that was what we were going to do. And I said: That's fine with me. So I wasn't surprised at all because we've had, as I've said, a wide variety of people that have appeared on League platforms over the years. And sometimes there's pressure put on them.</PARA>
<PARA>This question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So how was Mr Downer approached&mdash;normally, I guess, a letter, then a follow-up telephone call?</PARA>
<PARA>Eric Butler responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relying on my memory, I would say that he was probably rung up and approached in that way.</PARA>
<PARA>Then this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, obviously when you're approaching people to speak that you would have to say where you're coming from. You have no reason to doubt . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Butler interceded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . seen tonights showing of the video which one of the stations obtained somehow. There's no argument that Mr Frank Bawden, State Director of the League, was on the platform and opened the proceedings. And Mr Downer did refer to him.</PARA>
<PARA>The next question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So he would have known who he was and where he came from?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Butler said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't speak, but I'd be amazed if he didn't. In fact, I'd be staggered.</PARA>
<PARA>To round it off, he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, for an invitation to be put to Mr Downer, it would be a matter of it coming under the name of the League of Rights, wouldn't it?</PARA>
<PARA>This was his answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh yes, definitely, I would have thought so, yes. Mr Bawden wouldn't misrepresent himself. He'd represent himself as the State Director of the League of Rights.</PARA>
<PARA>Question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you are under the impression that there's no way that Mr Downer could have not known where he was going to speak and who he was addressing?</PARA>
<PARA>Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I can only say that, without getting involved in the controversy, I can only say that I would be surprised if he didn't. But it's conceivable that, well I'd find it hard to believe that he didn't know. I don't know.</PARA>
<PARA>Question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You were there on the occasion . . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's right, I was the second speaker.</PARA>
<PARA>Question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And also Jeremy Lee . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't say whether he would or whether he wouldn't, but I presume he knew who I was.</PARA>
<PARA>Question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had you met him before that?</PARA>
<PARA>Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had not met him before that, but if you'll look at the video . . .</PARA>
<PARA>They took a video, and it was so impressive&mdash;this young politician with these two full-time officials of the League of Rights&mdash;that they sold it for a profit to make funds for the League of Rights. With the sensitivity that is now operating, of course, it has been taken off the market. I would think this discussion would cause the price to go up, but we will all be able to buy it in due course. Mr Butler, referring to the Leader of the Opposition, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had not met him before that, but if you'll look at the video and get the recording there you'll find that I followed Mr Downer's address and took the opportunity, on a personal note, referring to the fact that I had known his late father for some time, both before he went to the United Kingdom as the High Commissioner, met him on several occasions in Adelaide, primarily to discuss one of my books with him which he read, `The red pattern of world conquest'. And then, of course, when he went to the UK, after 1962 I was in the UK every year for the next 10 years lecturing on the common market issue, and Mr Downer, as anyone who checks the records will find, he was strongly opposed to the British entry. And so naturally I had something to do with him.</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't that nice? I am not going to blame the Leader of the Opposition for his father's friends. Young Alexander was probably away at boarding school and did not know. But when you look at this record, what you learn is why the Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to come in here and address this House&mdash;and he still has not&mdash;and say, `I made a mistake. I did not know that.' The record shows that he met Butler; Butler referred to him in the most generous of terms; and on the video Mr Downer is referring to `Eric'. It was not Eric the Viking, and it certainly was not Eric the Red; it might have been Eric Butler.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So they were on first name terms. I do not deduce from that that the Leader of the Opposition is an anti-Semite or a racist. I believe that the problem is the way in which he has handled this House, knowing the problems he would have if he misled the parliament. The real allegation is not that he is a racist or an anti-Semite but that he is a political dill. This performance shows the same merit he showed when he went to the Northern Territory without getting briefed on the land rights act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For the interest of those listening, I will recite the censure motion, which is what we are actually debating, not the MPI that was submitted earlier at the instruction of the tacticians within the Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The nub of what we are saying in the censure motion, and the reason why objective and reasonable members on both sides of the House, including members of the Labor Party, ought to support our censure motion is that this government, with the leadership of the Prime Minister, has set out deliberately to make an unfounded racist slur and allegation against the Leader of the Opposition and, by implication, all members of the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Prime Minister, his job is to build good policy in the interests of all Australians.

Yesterday was one of those occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that if we say anything to him, we say, `When you so demean the office of the Prime Minister, we are going to deliver it back to you, because we have an obligation, as a coalition and an opposition in this parliament, to do all that is within our power to maintain proper standards.' We do that because, ultimately, we believe that the Australian people are entitled to good government. Good government has to be based on proper standards and reasonable principles. When you descend to the depths as you did yesterday, you deserve a censure motion, which we have moved. We did not win the last election. We do not have the numbers, so we will lose the censure motion. But we will win the point morally. Ultimately, I believe that that is what really counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is running a campaign. It is the usual argy-bargy of politics. The Prime Minister's remarks yesterday were classic Keating. He was advised not to turn up to question time, because every now and then he goes completely over the top. He treats question time with absolute contempt, which is just treating the public with contempt because it is their chance to hold the government to account. Yesterday he was not in question time. He was seething about this issue. He was stung by some comments by the Leader of the Opposition, so he barged into his office and said, `I'm going to do a doorstop and get that Downer.' I have seen it so many times in his political career. He went too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just briefly recount the facts. So often, the facts are just completely dismissed. You would never know what this was all about unless you were an aficionado of politics. But it really is quite simple: let us not let the facts get in the way of a good story. It might be the government's line, but it is not ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, there was quite a debate about constitutional reform. As a general rule, I think debate is healthy and ought to be encouraged. Citizens ought to be encouraged to be informed about their constitution and to think about it. In 1987, at a time of growing constitutional discussion, which led ultimately to a full referendum being placed before the people in 1988, the Leader of the Opposition, who was then a backbencher&mdash;in fact, he had just been dumped from the front bench&mdash;had an invitation to attend some function in Adelaide or somewhere. It was not an invitation by the League of Rights but by some other crowd whose name is irrelevant for our purposes. It was at a Christian hall somewhere. He was asked, `Would you come along and speak about the constitution?' As many of us have done on many occasions&mdash;as politicians, we are paid to go out and debate and put a point of view&mdash;he fronted up to a meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was introduced by a bloke called Eric. I might just pause here. Eric Butler is, as people apparently know, a leading member of the League of Rights. He founded it and he is an activist within that organisation. On television last night we saw film clips of a video taken at the time and, on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, we saw a photo with the caption, `Mr Downer meets Mr Eric Butler'. The fact is that apparently it was not Eric Butler at all. The film clip which says `Thanks, Eric' was not referring to Eric Butler. It was Eric somebody else. It could have been Eric the butler for all we know, but it was not Eric Butler, although he might have been there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talk about a gross exaggeration. It shows you how these things snowball completely out of proportion. The Leader of the Opposition fronted up to some meeting organised by some crowd not known as the League of Rights. To my knowledge, he was not told that it was the League of Rights. He has always denounced that group in his political career. No-one in his right mind would suggest that Alexander Downer was anything other than a mainstream Australian politician with some strongly held views, with a sense of compassion and with a sense of public service. He spoke for 20 minutes, finished his speech, had a cup of coffee or something to be polite&mdash;he probably wanted to get back to his family&mdash;and then he shot through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is supposed to be a matter of appalling judgment, a matter of national controversy. In fact, the Prime Minister yesterday said that it was a crime. Talk about going over the top! This bloke has really got a screw loose, and yesterday was one of those days when he went completely over the top. But the crunch came when the Prime Minster was asked by a journalist, `Do you really think that Alexander Downer has anti-Semitic views?' The Prime Minister said, `Well, it is hard to explain why he has addressed a League of Rights meeting.' That is just outrageous. The journalist continued, `Is the crime that he addressed the meeting or that he won't own up to it?' `Both,' said the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we are told that the Leader of the Opposition went to the meeting, had his 20-minute burst, left and a few weeks later somebody from an Australian-Jewish organisation rang up and said, `Look, that crowd was actually a front for the League of Rights,' and the Leader of the Opposition immediately denounced it. For heaven's sake, we politicians are on platforms day in and day out. I do not mind saying that I believe I have been at functions to which the public has been invited and there have been members of the League of Rights there. I denounce them and, furthermore, I denounce all that they stand for. That is the standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) so succinctly pointed out, the Prime Minister yesterday was not prepared to say that the Leader of the Opposition was anti-Semitic but today he came in here with a different tactic. I would say that the backroom tactic discussion this morning was, `This has got a bit out of hand. Let's back-pedal a bit.' So the Prime Minister back-pedalled and said, `I am not saying he is anti-Semitic.' We said, `But, Prime Minister, you said that yesterday and what you said yesterday is the reason we are censuring you today.' Even the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who spoke on his matter of public importance&mdash;which was irrelevant&mdash;ought to be voting with us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say one other thing: this whole question of guilt by association is a common tactic. This is not the first time that the Labor Party has run it and it is not the last time it will run it. It is a favourite tactic of the Labor Party, as the matter of public importance itself demonstrates. In 1992 when Keating tried to run this against Dr Hewson, Gerry Hand&mdash;and you have to give him this&mdash;a member of the Labor Party and a minister at the time, publicly rejected the Prime Minister's attempts to run a racist slur. If you are a Labor voter and you try to judge this, you do not have to take what I say. Take what Gerry Hand said back in 1982 because he knew a racist slur campaign from the Labor Party. For heaven's sake, he has been part of the Labor Party and knows the tactics of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly sinister and nasty to try to attack somebody on the basis that, because they may be associated with somebody or a concept, they ought to be condemned. I will tell you why it is sinister. As members of parliament, we actually have an obligation to consider issues on their merits. Australia is a great country and, even with the disappointments of recent years under Labor, this country has a good future. But it really has a good future only if, when we sit down to make decisions about our future, we do so on the merits of those decisions. Let us take the Evatt Foundation as an example. The Evatt Foundation comprises a left wing crowd. If the Evatt Foundation puts up an idea and I dismiss it because it comes from a left winger, and if I abrogate my responsibility to consider issues on their merits, we all fail in our duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not prepared to put up with a charge of guilt by association. That is an invitation to walk away from our responsibilities as members of parliament. We have a pretty good parliamentary democracy in this country because, by and large, most people are bona fide. But, if we allow guilt by association to be a tactic that can be successfully employed against us, we walk away from our responsibility. I say this to the Labor Party: we will take you on every time. If you want five, six or 10 speakers today, we are going to stand here and fight you because we will not put up with racist slurs. We will not put up with unfounded, divisive, racist slurs from the Labor Party. Our censure motion ought to be supported. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed timely for the House to be debating this motion today, given the public controversy which has erupted in the last couple of days over a speaking appearance by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) at a public meeting in South Australia in 1987, organised apparently by the League of Rights or an association closely aligned with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us strip the rhetoric away and look at this issue for what it is. We have had the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) in this House blaming the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for putting this particular issue on the agenda today. Let me remind the House and honourable members opposite that it was the member for Mayo who appeared on the same platform as the League of Rights; it was the member for Mayo who told the Australian people that he thought it was an invitation he accepted from an elderly couple; and it was the member for Mayo who failed to stand up in this parliament yesterday and defend him himself, as was outlined by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). He had the opportunity and he backed away from it. Because he backed away from it, we have had the spectacle here today of a ragged opposition fighting a rearguard action for a leader it wants to remove but cannot for political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very compelling reasons why the member for Mayo ought to immediately&mdash;and I mean immediately&mdash;resign as Leader of the Opposition. The central issue in this debate is not the issue of free speech, and it never has been, and it is not the issue of McCarthyism or a member's right to attend a public meeting organised by the league, one of its front organisations or any other organisation in the Australian community. The central issue in this debate is whether the Leader of the Opposition knew that the meeting he so effusively spoke at in 1987 in South Australia was organised by the league or should have been aware by the personnel present at that particular meeting that the League of Rights was heavily involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mayo has told the Australian people that he thought the meeting he attended was organised by a Christian group. If anybody really believes that explanation, they really do believe that leprechauns and fairies are at the end of the garden. The member for Mayo might try to pull the hood down over the eyes of the Australian people but they know&mdash;and the people on this side of the House know&mdash;that it is inconceivable that the member for Mayo did not know who was involved in the meeting he chose to address. He must be the only parliamentarian in this place in 1987 who was able to get up on the same platform as Eric Butler and Jeremy Lee and then later say to the Australian people that he really did not believe, he really did not understand or he really was not aware that this was a front for the League of Rights or indeed a function organised by the League of Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has betrayed his fellow members in the coalition. It is not very often that I hand out bouquets to my political opponents in this House, but I take my hat off to those members of the National Party who, throughout the 1980s, waged an incessant battle against the League of Rights. How disappointing it must have been for them in 1987 to see the member for Mayo stab them in the back and turn the knife by appearing at a function that was organised by the league or by one of its front organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend to members opposite the speech Senator Boswell made to alert the Australian community to this political organisation. As members of this parliament, we may not always have the liberty of choosing the issues upon which we are called to speak. But we can choose the forum in which we debate the issues. On the occasion in 1987, the member for Mayo chose the issue and he chose the venue. In doing so he bestowed a political legitimacy on an organisation which has been roundly condemned by his coalition partners, roundly condemned by members of his own party and members of his backbench and, indeed, roundly condemned by community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do his coalition partners in the National Party have to say about the League of Rights? You would not get the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) appearing at a League of Rights function. In an article in a Sunday edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in 1990, the member for Gippsland was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My major objection is they are subverting the political system, deliberately working to wreck it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the attitude expressed on the public record by the member for Gippsland, a coalition partner of the member for Mayo. How disappointing it must have been for him to be stabbed in the back by the member for Mayo as he cavorted about the community speaking at these sorts of functions organised by one of the most racist organisations that this community has ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the honourable member for Mayo a few lessons and a few tips on how the league operates in rural and urban communities. The league selects an issue of concern to the local community&mdash;whether it be the issue of fluoridation, council amalgamations, or the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The league then organises a public meeting for the forum to discuss the selected issue. It invites prominent members of the community to speak at these gatherings. That gives the league and its front organisations the political legitimacy to operate. </PARA>
<PARA>The unsuspecting people in this equation are the public. They come along to hear a sensible debate on an issue and they leave with a kit bag of the league's most putrid racist propaganda. The Leader of the Opposition invoked Isi Leibler in his defence here this afternoon. Mr Isi Leibler, the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, put out a publication in 1985. Under the heading `The League of Rights and You', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this booklet has been to inform the public, and especially anyone who may be invited to address the League, of its history and true nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To summarise . . .</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;For thirty-eight years the League has propagated and spread hatred of the Jewish people in the manner of the Nazis.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;The League has always been an extremist group, denouncing at various times ethnic minorities, Aborigines, European and non-European migrants, and nearly all mainstream politicians in the A.L.P., the Liberal, and the National Parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion is inescapable that the League of Rights is a menace to Australian democracy. By taking part in the activities of the League of Rights, by addressing it, by sharing a platform with any of its members, concerned Australians who may otherwise oppose the League and what it stands for, run the risk of granting it the legitimacy it so desperately seeks, diminishing Australian democracy and increasing the strength of political extremism.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Mayo's propensity for making chummy appearances with the leading lights of the league is really not shared by the Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett. In 1985, as Leader of the Opposition, he banned state Liberal politicians from being on the same platform as the league. That was over an issue of Aboriginal land rights at Lake Condah in the western district of Victoria. Obviously, that exhortation by the leader of the Liberal Party in 1985 was not an exhortation that was understood or accepted by the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Mayo, in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some experience in this matter with the League of Rights. I was a councillor with the city of Colac in 1990. There was extreme public controversy over the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. People attended a public rally; they were disturbed with what they were told and with the literature they were given at the rally. On further investigation, I found that the operatives of the league in the western district of Victoria were involved in organising the meeting. I felt it was my public duty to inform the people of the western district exactly what was going on in their area. I did it not to say to them, `You should not attend this particular meeting.' I wanted to let them know the type of people who were behind the organisation of the meeting. People went to the meeting genuinely over one issue and came away with a lot of racist propaganda about another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After I had made public statements on this matter, I was threatened with a defamation suit by an operative of a front organisation of the League of Rights. A Sydney barrister named George Turner rang my home to inform me that he was prepared to sue me for defamation. He did not get me on the phone; he got my teenage son. He proceeded to intimidate my family with statements such as, `We will sue your father for every penny he has. You will not have a house to live in.' He did not do that only to me. He did it to a friend of mine who was also engaged in this debate. When he rang my friend's house, my friend's 14-year-old daughter answered the phone, and he did the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell honourable members a little about the Constitutional Heritage Protection Society, which this particular operative belongs to. This organisation is a particularly peculiar one. I will refer to the sort of literature that comes out of the fronts of the league&mdash;the front organisations that attend the sorts of meetings that the Leader of the Opposition so easily got sucked into. The Constitutional Heritage Protection Society produced a document called the `First and Last Discussion Papers'. The organisation that is involved in defending the great Australian constitution had this to say in that document:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can still say to you that it is not too late if we all work together. The trouble is that we all want to be Field Marshals and no one wants to be a soldier. We have a lot of talent. Peter Sawyer and Brian Wilshire both do great recruitment promotions; Wake-Up and LOGOS can distribute news on a wide front; The League is a mine of historic information; the CEC movement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of which the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) would have an intimate understanding&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has potential to enlist a huge army; CHPS is an armaments factory.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, and one of its chief foot soldiers and one of the big cannon firers is the current Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo. I will tell the House exactly how this organisation organises itself by outlining some of its aims and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the Constitutional Heritage Protection Society formed the Anti-Treason Coordinate. What a whacko bunch! The aim of the coordinate is:</PARA>

We propose that this Aim be directed to the Objective of regaining the full rights of self government provided for by our legitimate Australian Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>This organisation was a front for the League of Rights. The coordinate's proposed activities and ideas were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.That other groups be contacted and invited to a meeting to discuss unity and co-operation . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.That we make every effort to remove the present Federal Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Chisholm)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (5.38 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not sitting next week and because next week is National Alzheimer's Week I want to take this opportunity to say a few words. Alzheimer's is a tragic disease that most people in this House would have had some personal experience with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dementia is generally something of a taboo subject in our society. We tend to ignore it until it happens to someone we know or love, yet about one in eight adult Australians will eventually experience some form of dementia. The number of people with dementia can be expected to increase rapidly as more Australians survive into their 70s, 80s and 90s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dementia is not just a disease of the elderly. Alzheimer's disease, for example, affects about 10,000 people under 65 years of age. It is a tragic fact that a type of dementia is a common feature of the latter stages of HIV-AIDS. I understand that some unpublished studies indicate that between 20 and 30 per cent of people with HIV-AIDS can expect to be affected by dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that honourable members can relate to their own personal experiences of the effects of that dementia, whatever the clinical causes of that dementia, and those experiences that are also shared with them by their constituents. However, Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, and is a disease which attacks and destroys brain cells. While research is giving us a better understanding of how the disease process works, we as yet have no cure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, in the Main Committee of this House, I commented on the challenges faced by personal carers&mdash;spouses, partners, sons, daughters and friends&mdash;in caring for loved ones with the frailties of age, physical or mental disabilities. Those who care for people with dementia have perhaps the most difficult challenge of all&mdash;the frustration and heartbreak of watching someone who might be physically well but who is declining mentally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we mark National Alzheimer's Week, we should remember that carers are as much sufferers of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia as the people for whom they care. I think it is also appropriate to give full due to the professionals, volunteers and organisations such as the Alzheimer's Association of Australia which assists and supports people with dementia and those who care for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way of easing the burden of Alzheimer's is to promote dementia specific care facilities. Brian Burdekin and his committee on mental health looked at the great work being done by the small number of such dementia specific facilities in Australia. He spoke very highly of the Lefroy Hostel in Western Australia, which houses 36 residents with dementia. It not only provides primary care to residents but also offers respite and carer support services. I am visiting this facility next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Brian Burdekin encourages the expansion of such dementia specific facilities, the sad fact is that, in my own electorate, one of only eight dementia specific facilities in Australia is just about to close. I think it is an enormous tragedy that a facility that gives dignity and appropriate care to some of the most frail people in the community should not be able to continue. I think it is a great pity that funding is so rigid as not to allow consideration of this sort of facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Alzheimer's Association of Australia for its work. I hope next week is a success for the association. I hope it helps raise the issue of Alzheimer's disease in a positive way throughout the community. </PARA>

<TITLE>Perpetual Calendar</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TU5">Mr HAVILAND</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Macarthur)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (5.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak this evening on behalf of a constituent in my electorate of Macarthur, Mr Aristeo Fernando. Mr Fernando has a dream, an inspiration, for reform which he believes would be the beginning of the unification of the world in peace&mdash;a common bond between all nations. Mr Fernando proposes the introduction of a bill changing our official calendar from the Gregorian calendar to a perpetual calendar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed perpetual calendar is similar to the present calendar. It has 12 months in the year, the year is divided into four quarters each of three months, and the first month in each quarter would have 31 days and the second and third months of each quarter would have 30 days, that is, January, April, July and October would have 31 days and all other months would have 30 days. This gives a total of 364 days. The 365th day would fall between December and January and not be identified as a particular day of a week or a month, but would be called world peace day. There would also be a leap year day at the end of June every four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important feature of this proposed calendar is that the names of days and dates are the same year after year. For example, 1 January would always be a Monday and special occasions like Christmas and various anniversaries or, for that matter, individuals' birthdays would always fall on the same day of the week. Activities regularly held every year would become easier to plan for and remember. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fernando also points out that there are environmental benefits to be achieved from this proposal. Because the names of the days and dates would not change from year to year, there would be less demand for new calendars, thus the usage of paper for the printing of calendars would be dramatically reduced. This could see a reduction in the amount of emissions from paper production plants and a decrease in the number of trees which need to be logged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fernando understands that Australia alone cannot introduce and use a calendar which is completely different to that used by the rest of the world. However, Mr Fernando, a Filipino migrant, has immense pride in being an Australian citizen and believes that Australia has the courage to initiate and spearhead such a reform and that it can persuade the rest of the world to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fernando would like to see the Australian parliament agree, in principle, to his proposed perpetual calendar, with a view to proclaiming the calendar at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. In the meantime, Australia could raise this proposal in United Nations forums and other appropriate forums in order to achieve international agreement to the perpetual calendar. The calendar would operate from 1 January 2001, which appropriately is a Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fernando believes that this could be Australia's lasting gift to the world and an appropriate celebration of its centenary of Federation. I must admit that when Mr Fernando approached me on this issue I was rather pessimistic about his chances of success; that is, until he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we don't speak up, who will speak up? If we don't move, who will move? If not now, when will it ever be?</PARA>
<PARA>A statement like that is pretty hard to argue with. Mr Fernando is a person who had the desire and courage to speak up and share his inspiration with other Australians. He has already received some publicity for his proposal in local newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As his representative in this place, I am happy to bring his proposal to the attention of the House so that it can be considered and debated by anyone who sees merit in the idea of a perpetual calendar. Those of us in public life who commit ourselves to reform and change know only too well that the road towards change can be a rocky one. I hope that by raising this issue today I can play a small part in promoting, at least for consideration in the community and amongst honourable members, something which does appear, on the surface, to be a proposal of some merit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, during the adjournment debate, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) levelled against me a series of allegations which, I am glad to say, do not add up. He gave me the courtesy of letting me know that he would be raising these matters. I have done the same for him today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Calare drew to the attention of the House a survey I have distributed to Landcare groups throughout Australia. I thank him for highlighting this because it does underline the importance assigned to landcare by the coalition. It was alleged that this survey was sent out to every Landcare group in Australia&mdash;some 2,200 in all. Whilst that was my intention, this was not possible because the mailing lists available comprised nowhere near that number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office distributed 1,520 surveys in total. Landcare groups in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia&mdash;some 986 in all&mdash;received their surveys in envelopes supplied to me under my Parliament House stationery entitlement. Postage for the distribution of these surveys was covered by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) as a survey was prepared and jointly distributed by the leader and me. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good grief! I am in the process of explaining what happened. Distribution of the survey in New South Wales was handled differently. The honourable member for Calare will be disappointed to learn that this was because the New South Wales Department of Conservation and Land Management would not supply a list of Landcare groups. So its attitude reflected somewhat differently from those who took the more bipartisan attitude in other states. The total number of surveys distributed in New South Wales was 535.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When my office was unable to obtain a list for New South Wales, I decided to try to distribute the survey through the 29 catchment management coordinators in New South Wales, a list of whom is publicly available. I wrote to each of them individually, enclosing 10 copies of the survey complete with stamped, self-addressed envelopes, and asked them whether they would be prepared to distribute them. I am unaware of how many eventually reached Landcare groups and, if they did, how this was achieved, although it appears from the copy of the survey the honourable member for Calare brandished in this place yesterday that some apparently may have gone out in state department envelopes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not appropriate for state government resources to be used for the circulation of party political propaganda. That issue will not go away here. It will end up in ICAC. I would like to talk about another slanderous situation in New South Wales. In New South Wales I and my family and my fellow residents of Kiama have been slugged with an $80 a year environmental levy by Mr Fahey and his government. This is relevant to the last comments that were made because I happen to have been appointed by Mr Armstrong, a former National Party member, as the chairman of a Landcare group in my area. When we asked Mr Fahey through his government, through the water board, for some money to distribute some of the water, the effluent, they are pumping into the ocean and out onto the trees that we are putting on that headland, what was our answer? No.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes further, though. I have made representations on  behalf of the Kiama Golf Club, which has made an approach to the water board in New South Wales. It currently uses a rather large amount of water for which it is charged the full rate. The club asked whether it would be able to borrow the money&mdash;$268,000, I believe&mdash;to put the pipes in to take the water which is currently being pumped out into the ocean. They were told that they could borrow the money and pay for all the works to do it but that the water board, under Mr Fahey, would charge them the same rate they would get for drinking water. In other words, the New South Wales Liberal government is saying through its water board, `We do not really care about cleaning up the oceans.' An organisation like a golf club cannot get cheaper water. The water that they are throwing into the ocean for nothing now cannot pay for the pipes and provide the water at a cheaper rate. I find that absolutely amazing, when these same people are telling us that they are concerned with the environment. I will read to members an open letter to Mr John Fahey on behalf of the people of the Kiama, which I intend publishing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Fahey</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fahey your government is charging us $80 per year `Environmental Levy' on our water &amp; sewerage charges but you don't spend the money here. We want results for our money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't see any environmental improvement here and we don't see practical water saving in the middle of a crippling drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fahey, when a local Landcare group wanted wastewater for their restoration work adjacent to the treatment work it was denied by your government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now Kiamma golf club is poised to reuse treated waste water. We would like your government to provide financial help for our Golf Club to conserve `good' water and reuse `old' water and to put less wastewater into our fishing and surfing environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fahey, if carefully targeted and intelligent investments were made by the Water Conservation Ministry then our water resources would be more efficiently used. Less drinking quality water would be wasted, and less waste effluent would be dumped at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Golf courses are a case in point where it makes economic sense to help modify their usage&mdash;especially in drought conditions where water restrictions are imminent. Right now water is being pumped at great expense from the Shoalhaven to Sydney, while the golf courses in Water Board territory pour drinking quality water onto grass.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kiama Golf Club would be typical of most courses which use around $50,000 of drinking quality a year (at 65c a kilolitre) which will no doubt cost them a lot more when newer filtering equipment comes on line soon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Club is happy to pay 15c to 20c a kilolitre for pre-treated sewerage effluent that would otherwise be poured into the sea&mdash;and no doubt provide the water board with a tidy profit and save the Golf Club $30,000 a year. The problem Mr Fahey is the club has to find $280,000 for the piping and pumps&mdash;not a huge figure given that there is a ten year payback cycle, but this is a sporting club, not big business. They need grant and loan assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>They need some of the environmental levy that we are paying. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that the people of Kiamma have paid enough `Environmental Levy' by now to expect some return to our community!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to pay tribute to a fine Western Australian, a great ambassador for our nation and a sporting hero for many young Australians, Geoff Marsh, who this week announced his retirement from first-class cricket. Geoff Marsh made his first-class debut for Western Australia in 1978, at 19 years of age. His record since is a very proud and impressive one. Geoff played 184 first-class matches in which he captained the Western Australian team on 31 occasions. He played one of the greatest innings by an Australian when he scored 355 not out against South Australia in 1989, the 10th highest first-class score by an Australian. That was one of his 33 first-class centuries for his state and nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff rose to the highest level in cricket, playing for Australia in 50 test matches, 37 of them as vice-captain to Allan Border, and was instrumental in the Ashes victory of 1989. I recall many of Geoff's superb performances but one that will be remembered for a long time is his record partnership with Mark Taylor, the new Australian captain, in which the pair shared an opening stand which lasted for well over one day's play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff also excelled at the one-day level, playing 117 one-day internationals, and was one of the leading players in helping Australia win the World Cup in India and Pakistan in 1987. He also held an Australian record for the most centuries scored in one-day internationals and was often the backbone of our one-day victories after playing the sheet anchor role in magnificent style. Indeed, it is not surprising that much of Australia's success both in tests and one-day matches came with Allan Border and Geoff Marsh at the helm of our team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cricket partnerships Allan Border and Geoff Marsh combined brilliantly to lead our national team to many triumphs. He was often the backbone of both the Western Australian and Australian sides and his commitment, his gritty determination and his perseverance made him a great role model for youngsters. As captain of Western Australia, he showed true sportsmanship as a fair, competitive and honest leader of the Western Australian team and as vice-captain of the national team Geoff was a brilliant lieutenant to one of Australia's greatest cricketers, Allan Border. It was typical Geoff Marsh style to apply himself with such dedication to his state and nation, a characteristic that has been a fine example for many up and coming youngsters who look to the likes of Geoff as a role model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geoff will be sorely missed from the Western Australian team as captain and player. I commend him on his career with our state and national teams. I particularly commend him on the dedication, gritty determination and commitment with which he applied himself to the game of cricket. He was a wonderful ambassador for our state and our nation. I applaud him for a wonderful career in which he represented Western Australia and Australia with impressive aplomb, something every young person can aspire to. </PARA>

<PARA>Commonwealth funding for the vocational education and training sector for the years 1994 and 1995 has already been appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill provides for supplementation to these amounts in line with price movements. The bill also appropriates funding for 1996, in accordance with the Commonwealth's undertaking in the heads of government agreement to establish the Australian National Training Authority to provide triennial funding for the vocational education and training sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year 1996 also sees further evidence of the government's commitment to expansion of the vocational education and training sector through the provision of a further $70 million in growth funds. This brings total growth funding since 1993 to $1.1 billion. The Commonwealth, in turn, expects states and territories to honour their undertakings in the ANTA agreement, including maintaining their own effort in vocational education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also provides funding&mdash;$25.9 million from 1994, including $2.4 million for monitoring purposes&mdash;to ANTA for support for off-the-job training provider assistance under the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships, including assistance for both public and private training providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the government announced in the white paper, we are committed to the task of achieving 50,000 additional entry level training places by 1995-96. An integral part of this is achieving an additional 16,000 trainees in that time. In 1995 and 1996, an additional $12.8 million and $22.7 million respectively is available for this purpose. When this is combined with the $70 million growth funds that the government is providing in each of 1995 and 1996, as well as the transitional funding of $20.4 million in 1994 and $10 million in 1995 provided in the budget, the government expects these costs to be more than adequately met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government expects ANTA to report separately each year on progress towards achieving a target of 35,000 trainees by 1995-96, under the $2.4 million being provided to monitor these grants.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I foreshadow a minor amendment to align the government's white paper initiatives on the national training  wage and the initiative to increase funding for off-the-job training under the Australian traineeship scheme and career start traineeships. The government amendment relates to the proposed new section 9A, which deals with the Australian traineeship scheme and career start traineeships. Clause 4 of the bill proposes to insert a new section 9A to empower the minister to increase funding to a state where participation in traineeships in that state increases as a result of initiatives in the government's white paper and, as a result, the demand for off-the-job training in that state increases. The clause refers only to the Australian traineeship scheme and the career start traineeship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to amend the proposed subsection 9A(1) because the proposed national training wage award will generally subsume the Australian traineeship scheme and career start traineeships and provide for future traineeships to be under that award. Therefore, the proposed subsection 9A(1) will extend eligibility for funding for eligible off-the-job training to a state. A new subsection would be added to define eligible off-the-job training. Eligible off-the-job training would now include the national training wage traineeships as well as the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships schemes, which the minister considers should be taken into account for the purposes of determining that there has been an increase in the number of people receiving off-the-job training in a state. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994. The background to this bill is that the Commonwealth provides grants to the states and territories for the provision and support of the vocational education and training, primary and technical and further education system. Prior to 1 January 1994, grants to the states and territories were provided in accordance with the provisions of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989. These grants contributed to general operating costs and recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 January 1994, the funding arrangements under the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989 were replaced by funding arrangements under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Under the new arrangements, a single pool of funds comprising the previously separate recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants is passed to ANTA for allocation amongst the states and territories. The Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 gave effect to an agreement announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 21 July 1992. That is over 27 months ago. This was an agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories for the establishment of ANTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind the committee of the objectives of the agreement. They included the following: the establishment of a national vocational education and training system; closer interaction between industry, vocational education and training providers; an effective training market; and, improved cross-sectoral links. That is the background to this debate which I think is very important at this stage when trying to meet those objectives. I will be drawing this debate back to those objectives which have been set out and which have been agreed to, particularly the objectives of an effective training market and a national system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within this bill, the main provisions are in clause 4. It will insert new sections 9 and 9A and, I think, 9A(1)&mdash;it is the latest one which has come in&mdash;into the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Section 9 currently provides for payments to ANTA for allocation under the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 of $638.96 million in 1994 and $719.741 million in 1995. The effect of the new section will be to amend the amounts payable to ANTA in the following manner: it will increase the amount payable in 1994 from $638.96 million to $673.612 million and the amount for 1995 from $719.741 million to $755.71 million. It will set out the amount payable for 1996. It is a very substantial amount which we are putting into this part of education in Australia. That figure which we are dealing with in this discussion is $835.52 million. So we are not talking about a small amount of money; it is a substantial part of the appropriations for 1996. There is a lot of money involved. Australia is going through a tremendous amount of change in this sector of the educational area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area of administration a lot of difficulties are surfacing. The real issues that we need to face are: what are the intentions of the federal government; and what are its strategies as outlined in the white paper? Is the government really focused on increasing and improving the skills of Australians or is it more interested in trying to pull down the unemployment figures just for a gloss effect out there for public perception purposes? I raise that as a very important point: what are we about? It would appear to me, from my reading and from talking to the state ministers who are in negotiations on various aspects of training and skilling in Australia, that there are some deep concerns. I come to a report which the government at the moment does not want to provide to the public. It is a report by Vince Fitzgerald. A copy has been provided to me. One of the chapters is entitled, `Successful reform'; the heading is `Inadequate performance planning and reporting.' It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continued reliance on Frameworks, Guidelines, Policies, Procedures, Protocols, Memorandums and the other paraphernalia of government avoids the central question of what is the performance target, what is the work and business plan and where are the annual reports against reform targets for each of those agencies or organisations actually responsible for the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing with millions and millions of dollars here. As I said, in 1996 it was over $800 million. These funding proposals are in place at the moment and we support them. We could really label this debate `funding for failure' or `funding without focus'. I am not sure which one we should adopt. It certainly can be described as `funding without focus' at the moment. We are not going to skill this country and we are not going to develop a more competent work force unless this money is effectively used and unless there are administrative arrangements in place which set up clear measurable targets that are identifiable publicly and that are achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, all the evidence indicates that money is being allocated by the parliament, but the progress is not very great. There is deep concern out there by a whole range of people, organisations and industry who are involved in this area. This report says that there are `confused accountabilities and responsibilities'. We are at the very early stages of trying to re-skill and up-skill Australia. We have an in-depth report which says that it is two years since the Prime Minister announced changes in this area and that there is total confusion in regard to accountabilities. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Below the level of the Ministerial Council, it is difficult to draw clear lines of accountability for the implementation of training reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are going to make progress and if there is not to be so much red tape and bureaucracy in this field, the government has got to give some clear direction to this whole field. The report says in conclusion to this particular chapter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our assessment . . . relates to both the substance of the national training reforms themselves and to their strategic management. In both areas they have been found wanting.</PARA>
<PARA>So the very nature, the essence, of what the government says the reforms are about is found wanting in a report that the minister is too concerned to make public because the providers, business and industry are deeply concerned about the way in which this whole thing is operating, because the very nature of the program which is being envisaged is, some people would say, a sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report finds the reforms wanting with regard to strategic management. The whole direction for ANTA really comes back to the federal government. I know the state minister is also involved in the set-up of the council, but it is this government that is driving the agenda and has responsibility to make it work and, clearly, there is lack of direction from the government. It does not know which way to go now. It wants to go in a certain way. It wants a top-down approach to government. It wants to have centralised control over so many things in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again we see a dynamic tension among the goals I mentioned earlier about the establishment of ANTA. Let us consider the goal of a `closer interaction between industry and vocational education training and training providers'. The fact is that industry out there is saying that there is not this genuine interaction. There might be in a few cases, but it is not substantial and it is not right across the board. There are literally thousands of people out there in businesses who are ignored, one could say, if not locked out of the training procedures. The act also sets out the goals of an effective training market and other objectives which the government and the council have agreed to but they are simply not being realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on just to make two more key points. One is a concern that these proposed funding levels as set out are unrealistically low, and that the government is really trying to force an agenda onto the states which is going to cause problems. The agreements between the states and the federal government have not yet been made, and I suspect that at the end of the day we may be back here having to allocate more money, because what the federal government has done over the years in other areas it is now doing in this area: it is palming off certain responsibilities to the states, giving them a certain amount of money, but expecting them to do far more than that money will ever achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can relate that to education and to lots of other fields, such as health and law and order. They are state areas of responsibility that the government keeps cutting the real funding for, while still expecting the states to do something about them. It is about to do the same, I suspect, in regard to vocational education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing which I want to highlight is that this bill is also notable for giving the Commonwealth minister power to determine whether states are meeting targets for new trainees rather than leaving that task to the ANTA board. Why does it have to be the federal minister who has the power to determine whether the targets have been met? Why can it not be left to the ANTA board? Of course, this parallels the eleventh-hour amendment to the ANTA act in December 1993 which allowed the Commonwealth minister to overrule the ANTA board and the ministerial council in determining whether states have succeeded in meeting maintenance of effort requirements. It is a pure set-up&mdash;nothing more and nothing less. There is a centralising of power and control by the federal minister in this area which is totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at a few figures in this area. The white paper talks about a target of 46,000 apprentices in 1994. In 1990 there were 162,600 apprentices. People might say that we have got traineeship schemes, that we are going to have apprentices and a whole host of other schemes brought in, and that that means people are going to become diversified, they are just not going to be in apprenticeships. But when we look at that target it is still about 20,000 less than the 162,600 apprenticeships we had in 1990 in this country. What is going on in this area of training?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an area where those opposite feel extremely vulnerable and guilty because, over the decade they have been in government, they have done little in regard to TAFE education. These figures indicate their paucity of action and total lack of administrative focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They may talk about the Australian traineeship scheme&mdash;a great brainwave, a great idea. Did it work? Were the targets reached? What was the outcome? The outcome was that from 1985 to 1993 there were 80,291 students who commenced traineeship schemes, but fewer than 70 per cent finished. This government says it is about action but at the end of the day, when we have a look at whether it is meeting its targets, we will find it is usually failing. I want to go into more detail about what is in this report because it goes to the heart of where TAFE education and training is. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the Main Committee is of the view that the Government should be condemned for the lack of direction in its approach to training reform and its mismanagement of this vitally important area".</PARA>
<PARA>I want to go through some of the comments which are being made about this reform process. There are eight key elements to training reform and where this money, about $800 million for 1996, which we are allocating here today, will go. These areas cover competency based training, about which we have heard in the past, competency standards, national recognition of training, curriculum delivery and assessment, entry level training, training market, access and equity, and funding for training. Some of those words sound pretty highfalutin and that is about where they have been left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give you a few ideas of the problems we see arising in this area, the report which was done for the government by a highly professional group of people says, in regard to competency based training, that there is conceptual confusion, a lack of understanding, poor marketing and promotion, high costs, failure to integrate, failure to convert and inadequate strategy. It is interesting that, in some of these areas, even the results are very hard to identify&mdash;for example, in regard to competency based training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to the report and give you a few ideas as to the problems that are likely to arise in this area. It says that there is conceptual confusion, lack of understanding, poor marketing and promotion, high costs, failure to integrate, failure to convert and an inadequate strategy. It is interesting that in some of these areas even the results are hard to identify. For example, with regard to competency based training, the report says that the `results are difficult to define with any degree of precision.' Therefore, not only are there no results, but all of these weaknesses have been found in the processes involved in developing a new training system here in Australia. It is totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now move onto the second area of competency standards. It is pretty important in this area to have certain standards of competence for the people involved in training. What are the weaknesses in this area? ANTA says that the weaknesses are far more complicated and resource intensive than initially thought and that they will take up a lot more money and effort than ever we expected. Will this money achieve good competence levels and standards? Industry standards are being developed by bodies which are unrepresentative of the key enterprises in those industries. We are finding that some standards are being developed out there, but they are being developed on the fringe and certainly not in the heartland of the very important industries of Australia. Where are we going to end up if the standards are being set by people who are not in the mainstream of the industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to say that the eight-level ASF discourages labour flexibility. The practical relationship between the NTB endorsed standards and the Mayer competencies is unclear. And this is a report commissioned by the government. The report further says that as competency standards in their current form are conceived as a series of tasks, their translation into a flexible curriculum is difficult, if not impossible. Are we getting a more flexible training market or are we getting a more rigid market? In other words, are the users of this system going to have great difficulty in getting the types of courses that they want?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the report say about the national recognition of training? Are we making good progress in the national recognition of a nationwide system? The report says that there has been a failure to convince enterprises of a value adding capability and that there has been inadequate involvement of industry. I thought that one of the key goals of setting up ANTA was to get interaction between industry, business, training and TAFE colleges and that it would be a cooperative, collaborative partnership. It is not happening. Two years after the Prime Minister announced this, it is not happening. It is said to be inadequate: in accreditation, certification and in the recognition of processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental problems are arising with the government's strategy in this. It really opens up the question of whether the working paper strategy on training in Australia is about training or whether it is about trying to reduce the numbers of the unemployment figures. The report also says that one of the weaknesses in this area is a bias towards inputs rather than outputs. But what about the curriculum? What is the nature of the curriculum for the people who are going to be involved in this area&mdash;the delivery and the assessment? With respect to this area, the report says that `national curriculum initiatives take too long to become operational', that they get bogged down, and that they do not get out and have an effect in the areas where thousands of Australians, mainly young Australians, want to increase their skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national curriculum effort is too institutionally oriented. It fails to deal adequately with the needs of enterprises. In other words, it is a top-down approach, with centralised control by the government, and the government does not listen to Australians to find out what sort of training they want. The government does not listen to industry or enterprise. It says, `We know what to do. We are going to impose our approach on them, and they can just take what they get.' That is the approach that the government is taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has got to make a decision in regard to training in Australia as to whether it is going to continue to have a top-down approach, or whether it will have a bottom-up approach, where the users have some say about what they want to be trained in, rather than being told by bureaucrats and getting caught up in red tape. To give clarity to our administrators in this area, real responsibility must come from the government. The government is sitting on its hands. In a couple of years time, I suspect that we are going to be looking at a disaster in this area. The government is on notice to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report to the government on curriculum delivery and assessment says that no-one is clear about how far a national course can be varied in content to meet the specific needs of an enterprise, while retaining integrity as a course leading to a qualification. This leads to rigidities in training. In other words, in regard to flexibility, there is no-one at this stage who knows how to slightly modify a course and still have it accredited. That is absolutely disgraceful. Here we are today talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, and yet no-one can tell us how there can be flexibility in these courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that the take-up rates of the national curriculum are apparently poor. The government has been saying that there are lots of people out there taking it up. That is not true. The report says that they are not really taking it up. The coverage might be good, but nobody is taking it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point of weakness, according to the report, is the lack of responsiveness by TAFE providers to the needs of enterprises. Again, the problem in this area is that it is a top-down approach by the government. I could go on. There are distinct weaknesses in the area of entry level training, but time does not permit me to go into detail. There are enormous problems in the training market. With access and equity it is the same, as it is for funding for training. There is a list of areas with problems and weaknesses in managing the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a total lack of direction and focus in regard to training. We are debating the allocation of millions of dollars worth of extra funding, but the government has not put in place the due structures and processes to ensure that Australians are adequately trained and skilled. There are tens of thousands of Australians out there who want to go into vocational education and training. They do not want to go on to university. This is a very important area, and yet we are throwing money at it without putting in place the due processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report indicates that the government has to act, otherwise businesses will not have trained people, and enterprises will not be able to compete in world markets because they will not have the skills in their work force.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing that I have seen or heard in the House or in this place can convince me that the opposition has any serious thoughts about vocational education and training in this nation. The opposition, it appears, has yet to grasp the fact that a well-trained and skilled work force can more ably compete in the international trading community. Individual members of the opposition and, of course, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), referred to a number of reports. I intend to refer to a number of reports as well, so I hope that he stays and pays attention to what I am about to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of people who contribute regularly to education debate, but the number of people on the opposition side who contribute can be counted on the fingers of one hand. If you count those who contribute in a constructive manner, the number is far less. It is a exception this morning, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we have 11 speakers on this particular bill. Perhaps that shows some progress in terms of the coalition, but unfortunately&mdash;and sadly&mdash;the coalition position on education is one of indifference. The policy position of the coalition can only be described as irrelevant and out of touch with the needs of our schools and our institutions. Why do those at the cutting edge of the delivery of education and training services in this country believe that the coalition is totally extraneous and that it has lost the plot when it comes to policy matters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could argue that the level of informed debate in the House has actually dropped over the last three or four years. People would not have to look past the number of questions without notice that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the then shadow minister, put to the government about employment, education and training in the last term of government. The answer: four&mdash;a miserable number&mdash;plus two questions that he asked a few days ago. To put it in perspective, that means that the former shadow minister asked a total of four questions about education and training over a three-year period. Not a bad average for a party which claims to be serious about employment, education and training in this country! It is no wonder that we on this side consider members of the opposition beneath contempt when they come into the House or this place ranting and raving about something that they really do not understand. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) time and time again becomes confused about the policies of the coalition, so what chances do his backbenchers have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy is even more unrealistic in vocational education, in meeting the current and future expectations of business and the community. The effect of the coalition policies that are spelt out in the policy document Fightback, in comparison to our own stance on TAFE funding, would result in an overall reduction in funding of $27 million. In fact, the minister pointed out that it would actually add up to about $30 million in resources made available to the national TAFE system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just remember that that $27 million hole was on expenditure prior to the commitments that we made to this year's Working Nation document. Over the last few years this government has put TAFE and vocational education high on its priorities within the employment, education and training portfolio. Over a four-year period we have seen three major reports produced by the government on this subject. We did not produce the reports so that they would sit idly on a desk somewhere accumulating dust; indeed, we have adopted many of the principles espoused in the reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first, of course, is the report of the Deveson Training Costs Review Committee, which was released in 1990. This is a very important document because it sets the agenda for future reforms and it also makes the states acutely aware that they could not go it alone. The major recommendations are wide-ranging in terms of the way in which the whole approach to training needs to be reformed. Importantly, it stresses the need to provide a greater consistency across the state systems in respect of the development of curriculum and accreditation and in recognition of the skills already obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further recommendations are set out in the Finn report, which was released in 1991. I do not know how many members have read the report&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not history for you, because you do not know about it. The report could be described as the benchmark for reform for post-compulsory education in Australia, and it sets targets for the government to achieve in secondary, tertiary and vocational education for young people. The targets recommended in the Finn report are, admittedly, ambitious, but they are certainly highly desirable for the creation of a highly skilled and competitive work force. The final targets which it set are that, by the year 2001, there should be: a level 2 traineeship or progress towards a higher level vocational or academic qualification for almost all 20-year-olds; and at least a vocational or academic qualification above level 3, or a diploma or a degree, for at least 50 per cent of 20-year-olds. The principles of these reports have been adopted by the government. With the cooperation of the states, many of the recommendations are already in place and many more are well on the way to being achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then came the report by the Employment and Skills Foundation Council headed by Laurie Carmichael. The Carmichael report recognised that education and training should be a lifetime process, rather than a one-off process at the beginning of or before a person's working life. The principles of the Carmichael report are based on competency rather than time or process. The recommendations have, importantly, set the groundwork for the introduction of the training wage as outlined in the white paper. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) recently pointed out, the importance of the training wage cannot be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will introduce for the first time an adult wage, in line with the Carmichael principle, based on competency rather than time or process. Once the relevant skills have been acquired, a person then moves on from a training wage. The training wage will also simplify the complexity of rates which apply to youth. This would not have been possible without the involvement and agreement between the ACTU and the peak bodies of employers. Those peak bodies of employers include: the Metal Trades Industry Association, which, I might add, recognised the importance of what we are trying to achieve at a very early stage of the negotiations; the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; the Business Council of Australia; the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry; the Retail Traders Association&mdash;and, of course, we would not forget the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, according to the Liberal-National parties, our position on vocational education and training and the general thrust of the white paper on employment and growth are fundamentally wrong, why is it that they are the only odd ones out? Persons receiving training on the job will also qualify for the training wage, which, in turn, will add force to the process of enterprise bargaining. Enterprise agreements are now very much a part of everyday industrial relations, although it did take employers quite a while initially to be comfortable with the ideas of these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both employers and employees now see a benefit in enterprise agreements. More than one million workers under federal awards are now covered by workplace agreements. All of them have been finalised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission since October 1991. Half of those 2,000 agreements have been registered in the past 12 months. Almost 50 per cent of workers under federal awards are now covered by agreements, and 90 per cent of businesses with 500 or more employees in the federal system have workplace agreements. In the next 12 to 24 months, I expect there will be a steady increase in the number of enterprise agreements signed, particularly from the small and medium enterprise sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the members of the opposition do not realise is that there is a revolution going on out there in the workplace. They are still arguing about the merits of the Stone Age industrial relations document of the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), Jobsback, not realising that time has already passed them by. The policy hole left by the out-of-date and out-of-touch Jobsback policy document is yet to be addressed by the opposition, with many still adhering to the teaching of Jobsback like lemmings over the cliff. The training wage is a watershed achievement in the skills formation agenda of this county and is essential to avoid skill blockages which, in the past, have dogged Australian industry in every economic recovery. It is competency based. It will overwhelmingly provide greater assistance for the long-term unemployed to obtain gainful employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has recognised that economic growth alone will not reduce the overall number of people enduring long periods of unemployment. An active policy was needed to intervene and reduce the wasteful nature of long-term unemployment. Now the training wage is aimed directly at that very problem. In previous recoveries, six out of every seven jobs went to new entrants to the labour market and not to the long-term unemployed. The long-term unemployed are not normally jobs ready, so the training wage goes a long way to help solve this problem, along with other active employment programs administered by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TAFE in Australia has undergone a major refocusing and expansion in real terms to meet the changing needs of employers. To reach the achievement levels set by the Commonwealth, states and territories, the Australian National Training Authority was created. The objectives of the agreement included: the establishment of a national vocational education and training system; closer interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers; an effective training market; and improved cross-sectoral links. These changes were prompted in particular by the recommendations of those government reports which I have already mentioned, and the government has firmly resolved to bring excellence into the training area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As TAFE is now more relevant in providing the skills for a person to become more employable, it is a real alternative to other forms of post-secondary education. Although TAFE has expanded the number of places available, the heavy increase in demand from students is outstripping the ability to meet those needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I admit that. That is why this government is pouring large sums of money into the construction and upgrading of TAFE facilities. The Commonwealth realised that the states would not be in any position to deal with the expected increase. While some states, early in the piece, believed the Commonwealth was attempting to take over their traditional role in TAFE services, they now realise that the TAFE system which existed at the time would have buckled under the strain. As a result, the states are now quite happy to cooperate and take the money from Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is, and has always been, happy for states to have major control over TAFE, on the understanding that they act in cooperation with the Commonwealth and the other states. By 1996, the Commonwealth contribution to the states in respect of TAFE funding will have reached $858 million, which is double the funding of the early 1990s&mdash;and a considerable outlay, in anybody's language. The fact that applications to universities have fallen in recent times can be directly attributed to the increase in the number of placements offered and the number of students now applying to TAFE colleges, and to the realisation of young people themselves that the needs of the future are in fact for technical and operative skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I suspect the number of unsuccessful applicants will increase until the Commonwealth, together with the states, is able to increase the physical capacity of our TAFE colleges. The problem is that, whilst the Commonwealth is providing the funds for expansion, there is a considerable inert period after the funding is made available: that is, from the time a state government approves an individual project&mdash;with reference to all the relevant parliamentary committees&mdash;until the completion of the construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first six months of this year, in my own state of South Australia, about 6,000 people were unsuccessful in their attempt to access TAFE education and training. Although that lack of 6,000 places is unacceptable, South Australia is in fact better placed in TAFE than are most of the other states. Of course, South Australia has always been considered a leader in the provision of vocational and TAFE courses and, although we currently have an odd collection of members who make up the Liberal state government, the current state Minister for Employment and TAFE, Bob Such, has so far shown credible leadership in this area&mdash;despite the state Liberals' ambivalence in all matters educational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new arrangements, a single pool of funds&mdash;comprising the previous separate recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants&mdash;will be passed to the Australian National Training Authority and will provide for greater flexibility in the funding of the TAFE system. The functions of ANTA include allocation and remission of funds to state and territory training agencies, and the administration of any programs requiring national delivery, on the basis of guidelines determined from time to time by the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the creation of an additional 50,000 places, comprising the following: 14,000 new apprenticeship places; 15,000 ATS/CST traineeships; 1,000 Commonwealth trainees; 5,000 off-the-job training places; and 10,000 new places within the current labour market.

The only response was that they would hide the unemployed. It is a pretty shallow argument, without much thought attached to it. Members of the opposition forget about all the barriers which stop the long-term unemployed from getting a job. They forget that without the assistance of the measures contained in the white paper, the long-term unemployed would have Buckley's chance of landing a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear this government is on target to meet its commitment to vocational education and to the unemployed in this country, contrary to anything that members opposite may claim.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a wide spread belief in the community that Australia should not be prepared to live with high unemployment. The white paper responds to this belief. It is welcomed by the Business Council.</PARA>
<PARA>His rationale addressing the problem of long-term unemployment from a business point of view is quite simple, and could not be disputed by any member of this parliament. There are sound economic reasons why long-term unemployment needs to be tackled. Unemployment wastes talent and skills. I think it is time the opposition realised this. We understand that this week members of the opposition have not have a good week. Many issues that were raised in the House were confused, and strategies were confused.

The Bendigo EDGE project is intended to give Bendigo students the edge in future employment. It has been recognised by the schools in my area that there is a huge gap between vocational training and academic studies, and they have put forward an excellent submission. The schools that are involved in the Bendigo EDGE project are the Catholic College Bendigo, Bendigo Senior Secondary College and Girton Grammar School, and the training providers involved are the Central Victorian Group Training Company and the Loddon Campaspe College of TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have had several meetings, which were facilitated through the Central Victorian Group Training Company Ltd with the Bendigo Senior Secondary College and the Catholic College Bendigo Senior Campus, and they have confirmed a joint desire and a joint will to institute two pilot programs in 1995. It is intended to enable the establishment of a three-year VCE course that will incorporate a retail training scheme and career start traineeship through the Catholic College Bendigo, and a hospitality or similar training program through the Bendigo Senior Secondary College. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it has planned to combine with the introduction of these two pilot programs is the linking of vocational training with academic studies. The current thinking from the schools that are promoting this course is that each program would involve up to 20 students in the initial intake. Those schools have recognised that there is a huge gap which the government is giving insufficient and inadequate attention to and they have also enlisted the support of a number of regional organisations. Amongst those organisations supporting this vocational training are: the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Affirmative Action in Training, the Bendigo Regional Development Board, the Small Business Association, the Bendigo Tourism Board, Bendigo Central Traders, the Bendigo Chamber of Commerce, Eaglehawk Traders, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Hotels Association. </PARA>

I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, you have young people in your community who have drifted away from VCE studies because they do not think that the government is giving adequate attention to vocational training and really equipping them for employment after they have completed their studies. That has been recognised by the educational authorities in my region and it has widespread support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are looking for funding from the government because the administrative bodies who will be involved in this with the schools include the following: the Directorate of School Education, which is a Victorian state department; the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which is the federal office; the Office of Training and Further Education, which is a state body; the AVC Joint Task Force, which is a federal and state responsibility; and the Catholic Education Office. The project conveners, Central Victorian Group Training Co. Ltd, have approached me and also the government to have a pilot program which will involve a minimum of 50 students. These students will be selected from Catholic College, Bendigo Senior Secondary College and Girton Grammar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the funding they are seeking for this is unreasonable; I think it is quite reasonable. They are seeking $60,000 to implement this pilot program in 1995 over those three secondary colleges in Bendigo to enable those students to take up these traineeships and get vocational training as well as including their academic studies. I think that what we have seen here is a first-class initiative by a group of education authorities which have recognised the difficulties the government is experiencing in giving adequate attention to linking the two programs&mdash;linking vocational study with their academic studies. Too often the focus on training is restricted to one area; it is restricted either to academic studies or to vocational studies. The linkage between the two is often inferior and is not subject to a government directive and a government influence that would give adequate attention to linking vocational training with academic studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The submission objectives on which this program is based are important. Some of the objectives are: the ability to show how students and trainees can be interrelated; to confirm the sources of ongoing funding; to clearly show how competencies are to be addressed in general key competencies and to demonstrate the development of key competencies and how they will be assessed; application of the program across the many curriculum areas; clearly showing that the funding will be required for only this first year of the three-year pilot program; consideration about designing a training record book for each student participating in the pilot program; and the appointment of a project officer to manage the program, responsible to a management committee. The aim is to clearly state the guidelines for the pilot project: where we are starting from, what the pilot program will do and the changes within the objectives of the AVCTS. It must also clearly show that this project is a progression from the THRIVE feasibility study. General equality must be present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the organisation has done a thorough job of research of the local needs of the students. It has stressed the objectives which it hopes to achieve for this training program, bearing in mind what the requirements are of the participants and what the requirements are of the prospective future employers. I mentioned some of the organisations earlier. Most of those organisations, such as the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Bendigo Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Hotels Association, are major potential employers of these young people who would receive this blend of vocational training and academic studies. It is important that the support of those groups be maintained. They have given their support to the organisation and to the pilot program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), would be interested in this project to extend the VCE course to three years and include vocational training interlinked with academic studies. That has not been undertaken by the government at the moment and I wish that the member for Prospect would take this on board, because I know she is interested in education. I think this has a lot of merit. A lot of young people drop out of the VCE course because it is too narrowly focused on academic achievements rather than vocational training which will equip them for a job. I am pleased that the member for Prospect has taken note of that and obviously will be referring it to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not a great deal of money involved in this course, $60,000 as a pilot program. Those leading schools in Bendigo, Bendigo Senior Secondary College, Catholic College Bendigo and Girton Grammar School, have been leaders in Victoria in educational training for a number of years. In fact, Bendigo Senior Secondary College was the first college in Australia that had a senior level, just years 11 and 12, and that was started by my former colleague, the Honourable Lindsay Thompson, when he was Minister for Education in Victoria. It was really a pilot program for the development of senior secondary colleges throughout Australia. What I am putting to the chamber is that here is an innovative program put forward with the joint cooperation of Catholic College Bendigo, Bendigo Senior Secondary College and Girton Grammar School, with the backing of a whole range of employer organisations, to link vocational training and academic studies over three years in the VCE course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see any reason that that project could not be eminently satisfactory and give many students the opportunity to broaden their base of understanding of what happens in the real world of work and employment. They can link that understanding in with their academic studies, gain the practical experience out in the work force and therefore equip themselves to deal with a whole range of situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institutional based pilots that they are seeking approval of have tested one of the following features: firstly, a combination of time spent at work and study, including continuing education in key competencies for school leavers who have completed year 10 or year 11; secondly, vocational training and work experience provided within upper secondary schools; and, thirdly, a vocational year consisting of vocational training and work experience provided within institutions such as schools or TAFE colleges up to year 13. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment from the group is that it is breaking new ground, but it believes the concept of the three colleges working together in different industry groups with the group training company has captured the imagination and support of people who are involved in future employment opportunities for these people. What we need to do now is have the support of the government to fund this pilot program and ensure that it sees this as an exciting new pilot program for young people and as an opportunity to provide them with employment opportunities and a broader based educational program linked in with different vocations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have principally mentioned two areas. One is the hospitality industry, which is obviously one industry that is growing quite rapidly and, with the advent of the Olympic Games in the year 2000, an industry which we need to train young people in so that they gain the professional skills. The second area I have mentioned is the retail trade. There is always a constant demand for people with retail skills to participate in that work force as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the member for Prospect to take up that issue with the minister and ensure that he looks at that submission favourably.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to speak on this Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill. While acknowledging what the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) has said, I am particularly concerned at a motion before this committee from the previous speaker for the opposition, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, this bill before the House is really all about improving the skills of our Australian work force and, by doing that, it is also about training. While the bill itself contains amendments, it really is complementing what we have brought down as a government with a white paper. It is a decision that was not taken lightly; it followed extensive consultation. I really believe that such an inane type of amendment before a bill such as this coming before this Main Committee needs a lot of investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that we have here now delivers on the commitments and particularly on the promises made by our government following that Working Nation white paper. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) had already referred to the Finn report. Certainly, the Finn report's recommendations are what really this bill is all about, and I also would like to touch on some of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many words written on training during this decade. The Finn report and the Carmichael report have provided a framework for our government's actions. Indeed, this bill provides growth funding to help achieve the participation in training targets for our young people following that Finn report. By increasing the number of career style traineeships available, this bill also takes us that one step closer to the introduction of the Australian vocational certificate training system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One third of the residents of the City of Fairfield, which makes up most of my electorate of Prospect, are younger than 18 years of age. I have seen at first hand the obstacles faced by our young people in a world economy which is rapidly changing. I have also seen the benefits to my electorate of our government's training and education policies. On many occasions in the past I have enthused to the House about the massive increases in the number of young people within my electorate who are undergoing education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are making our society fairer and our economy more efficient by encouraging our young people, particularly those from low income families, to attend university and to further their education. But it certainly would not be desirable, and it would certainly would not be sustainable, for all or even most of the improvements to education to be funnelled through our university process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traineeship system has played a major role in re-skilling our Australian work force. This bill expands on the traineeship system by providing 16,000 extra places, and it helps achieve the Finn participation targets for young people. The Finn report set several targets for the participation of our young people in post-school training. That report, which was released in 1991, noted that Australia's record in training was certainly a sorry one. I cannot help wondering whether perhaps that came about because of the 40 years we were seen to have been riding on the sheep's back; and we seem to have had a lack of policy and direction from successive governments. It was undoubtedly a major structural problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 Australia ranked 14th out of the nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in the number of 17-year-olds in post-compulsory education. It was easy to see then that the more economically successful nations knew the importance of training. It is interesting to note that in that survey, the nations with the most 17-year-olds in training were, in order: Japan, West Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To rectify this, the Finn report recommended that by 1995 all 18-year-olds should have attained sufficient vocational skills to achieve at least a base level traineeship or year 12. It further recommended that by 2001 almost all people should have obtained at least a higher level traineeship or progress towards a higher level vocational qualification by the age of 20. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly pleased to note that we have come some way towards meeting those targets; but we have still got a long way to go. The Australian Bureau of Statistics report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian social trends</EMPHASIS> found that in 1983, 27 per cent of our 15- to 24-year-olds undertook full-time education. By 1993, fortunately, this had risen to 39 per cent. The committee on employment opportunities noted that in February 1993 almost half of the work force had a post-school qualification, an increase of some eight percentage points from February 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As they relate to suburbs within my electorate, the figures are particularly satisfying. A comparison of the 1986 and 1991 censuses for the City of Fairfield found a 61 per cent increase in the number of students attending a TAFE college, and a 110 per cent increase in the number of people engaged in some other educational activity. In coming up with the reasons for this increase I cannot go past the explanation given in Fairfield City Council's excellent publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fairfield City: community profile</EMPHASIS>, which, talking about the wonderful 61 per cent increase in students attending TAFE and the 110 per cent increase in the number of people engaged in some other educational activity, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increase could be explained by a number of factors including the growing national trend for all those wishing to stay in the workforce to continue to seek further education, the increase in the early 1990s of the number of federally funded employment training centres in Fairfield, the emergence of the University of Western Sydney in the region and by our population growth.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian traineeship scheme is a particularly proud achievement of this government. Since 1985 more than 63,500 people have commenced traineeships and 90 per cent of the participants in the scheme are still employed in their chosen fields two years later. This is one of the most impressive success rates for a labour market program that I have ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traineeship system is particularly important because Australia is almost alone in the world in its continued reliance on apprenticeships. Australia and the Germanic nations are the only countries where apprenticeships are still a dominant form of training. The traineeship scheme complements the apprenticeship system and ensures that we have a training regime that caters for all aspects of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traineeships cater very much for service industries, whereas apprenticeships have traditionally been for manual labour training. With the service sector employing an ever expanding percentage of the work force, the importance of the Australian traineeship system is plain for all to see. The days of large numbers of people working in a service industry with no training are, I am pleased to say, over. Computers now dominate design and information. The prevalence of computers and the achievement of multiskilling through award restructuring mean that our workers in services undertake a wide variety of tasks and must be highly skilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traineeships have also opened up formally structured training to females. Apprenticeships have, of course, traditionally been male domains. As recently as 1991, more than 90 per cent of apprenticeships accounted for half of teenage male employment. The traineeship system has formalised training in fields traditionally dominated by females, where on the job experience used to be the only training and there was no recognition of those skills obtained. Much emphasis, I am pleased to say, has been given to encouraging women in the upper echelons of business and the public sector, and this is justly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But more important for the majority of women is the opportunity for females to gain entry level training in the field of their choice. I am glad that the Australian traineeship system is assisting in this regard. The situation for females will improve even further when the Australian vocational training certificate system is up and running. The introduction of the vocational training system was a major recommendation of the Carmichael report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the additional places provided under this bill are career start traineeships. Career start traineeships are a bridge. They are a bridge between the Australian traineeship system and the vocational certificate trainee training system. The career start positions are more versatile than the normal traineeships. They allow recruitment from a very wide age group and certainly enable more industries to tailor the traineeships to their needs. Career start traineeships allow young people to enter the work force while obtaining accredited training. The trainees can spend as much as 50 per cent of their time in training in their second year. The career start program shows the potential of a vocational certificate training program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the vocational certificate will, I believe, be an improvement to the training system and certainly is of major importance. I am particularly impressed with the concept of pathways that will be introduced with the Australian vocational certificate training system. A pathway is a combination of training, education and work experience that leads to a qualification. A pathway is what we need. It gives persons about to finish compulsory education a broad choice of ways in which to reach their particular goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps more importantly, the Australian vocational certificate training system will allow trainees to switch between pathways to suit their needs and the needs of their particular employers. For example, a person who studies until year 12 and does not wish to go on to university could undergo three years of training and work experience, or could first undergo a vocational year at a TAFE or senior college. This could comprise training for about 60 per cent of the year, and structured work experience for the remainder of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone does not complete year 12, the AVC will provide vocationally oriented education, equivalent to the last two years of school. Apprenticeships and traineeships will be merged into one qualification&mdash;the Australian vocational certificate. There will be four nationally recognised levels of attainment: AVC levels 1, 2, 3 and 4. By 2001, the government hopes to have 90 per cent of our 20-year-olds completing AVC level 2 or proceeding to a higher level; and also to have 60 per cent of our 22-year-olds holding AVC level 3 or higher, or be proceeding to a higher qualification. That is not a bad goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important change from the current system is that the new certificates will be competency based, not time based. So trainees will move on to the next level when they have achieved competency at the previous level. This system is much more efficient than the current time based system. It allows trainees to work at their own pace and ensures that they do not graduate until they have proved competency in all of the fields they will need to call on in their future vocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major improvement to be introduced with the Australian vocational certificate training system is that it will be available to people of all ages. Unlike our normal traineeships and apprenticeships, people who wish to be retrained and adults re-entering the work force after some time will be eligible to become trainees. Thus, Australia will have an integrated trainee and education system to meet the demands placed on us by our ever changing world economy&mdash;a world economy that will be much more service orientated and where information will be the primary commodity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `information superhighway' has probably been overused. However, it is an undeniable fact that the ability of our work force to capitalise on high technology will be the major determinant of our national wealth over the coming decades. We will need a work force which is highly skilled in the information technology which increasingly is dominating the service industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has improved Australia's training system beyond recognition. The introduction of the Australian traineeship system itself in 1985 was a major innovation. The 16,000 new traineeship places created in this bill will be of invaluable assistance, both to our young people seeking employment and to the drive to increase the skills base of our Australian work force. The steps toward the Australian vocational certificate taken in this bill are steps in the process of making the Australian trainee system equal to the best in the world. That is not a bad thing to achieve, and that is why I commend this excellent bill to the Main Committee and to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994. The opposition has no real problems with the basic thrust of the bill. A year and a half ago, the government made a commitment to shift funding from the tertiary sector to the training sector. It made a commitment to energise the vocational training market in Australia. It made a commitment to vocational training far beyond any national commitment that had ever been made before. I support, in general, the thrust of those moves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Prime Minister's direction, the government made a fundamental decision to increase the funding to vocational education and training without establishing either a clear goal or the mechanisms to be able to accomplish it. ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, was a compromise. The concept of ANTA was that it would act as a bank. It would take the government's expanded funding and the state's funding for vocational training and send it back to the states to allow them to fund TAFE and other institutions. This concept is a difficult one to come to grips with. I must admit that I still have some problem with the concept and in coming to grips with how this really works and how the central bank concept will, in fact, encourage additional training. I will be pleasantly surprised if, in fact, it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the training market in Australia is really at a crossroads. This is a complex issue, because there are many players and there are not necessarily clear outcomes specified in my view at the moment. We have a system of technical colleges called TAFE; these have grown up across Australia over a very long time. We have some private providers of vocational education and training; in particular, the ACM facility in Richmond comes to mind as being an excellent private provider of vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have senior secondary schools or secondary schools around the country, many of which provide some degree of entry into vocational training and/or direct competing vocational education courses. Also we have industry itself. There are not only industry bodies like ACM who supply vocational training but also other companies&mdash;generally larger companies and some medium sized companies&mdash;who have their own training facilities, their own training personnel and run their own training agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there is no consistency within the system. The honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) spoke in the debate before me about the apprenticeship system and how it had fallen out of favour around the world, but that it was still in general use in Australia. One of the reasons it is in use in Australia is that employers value it. It is valued not only by employers but also by apprentices themselves. These are the people who wish to work in trades: they value the apprenticeship and they value the certificate that they get as a result of their apprenticeship which generally takes four years but sometimes less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of competing interests. As well there are the industry training advisory boards. There is a Department of Employment, Education and Training in Canberra; there are training departments of one form or another in the states; and there are other bureaucratic organisations that impinge on how all this operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Theoretically, ANTA is supposed to bring it all together and make it work under the new Australian vocational certificate system. In concept, that system itself is rather simple. There are four levels of certification. But once we get beyond that simple level of certification, the system, as it exists today, is really quite complex. In reviewing the system, the so-called Fitzgerald report of the Allen Consulting Group has said that it is so complex it is not going to work. Rather than being driven by the market&mdash;that is, by the people who want the training, by the institutions who are there to provide it and by the industry which will use it&mdash;it is so bureaucratic and so top-driven that the system is in danger of not even getting off the ground. It is like trying to load a Boeing 707 with five elephants and expecting it to make it off the ground at Mascot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, I refer to a portion of the summary of Dr Fitzgerald's report and his letter to Mr Brian Finn. It says:</PARA>

We agree with the recent statement by the Honourable Ross Free that, without decisive action by all parties to rectify the difficulties, the reform process is in danger of stalling.</PARA>
<PARA>From my contacts in the training market around the country&mdash;indeed, as I have participated in inquiries with the Deputy Speaker in the chair today, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), into group training in various states around the country&mdash;it seems to me that what is said in that letter I have quoted is inevitably true: everyone seems confused abut the great range of initiatives that are available and how they should work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you think about it in simple terms, it seems to me that we need a relatively simple system that will allow young people in secondary school to decide on some general career path and to be able to take courses that will direct them in a technical or a vocational direction rather than for 100 per cent of those students to be directing their energies at a totally general academic education designed as an entry point to university.

But that system has not worked well because the industry has not provided the vocational education and training that it might have.

It would be highly desirable if we could offer a broad range of technical and vocational courses across the country in our secondary schools. Those courses, the skills that are gained and the qualifications gained should be certified and transferable. People could continue their education at a TAFE or at a private training institution, or go on to a university, or whatever.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the system that we have now set up is so highly bureaucratised and so difficult to manage that it is not going to work. That, essentially, is what Dr Fitzgerald has told Brian Finn, the Chairman of ANTA. I will continue quoting from Dr Fitzgerald's letter to Brian Finn. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of strong commitment to the reforms by business&mdash;many enterprises of all sizes and many business organisations&mdash;is a key concern. At the core of this concern is what we feel is the key problem: that the reforms to date have lacked any strong focus on the demand side&mdash;that is, on what is actually needed to deliver to Australian enterprises, especially small and medium sized enterprises, the skills they need in order to compete in the new more open market environment. The reforms cannot succeed unless business values them. engages with them and leads them.</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental point is that there is no sense in adopting the attitude that we, as trainers, know better than industry what skills we need to teach trainees now and in the future. It is a nonsense; it has always been a nonsense. However, there is still that ingrained attitude in some of the training bureaucracies that the bureaucracy itself knows better than industry what industry needs. Unless industry is given a strong voice in the development of a simple system, the system will fail. There is no way that the system can operate properly. We cannot just abandon apprenticeships or the emerging traineeship system. They are well accepted throughout the business community. If we abandon them in favour of a certification system, which business has not accepted and does not understand, we will likely destroy the training market altogether. That will be of no use to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These industry training advisory boards are a real mixed bag. Some of them are very good&mdash;they have good industry people who understand the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, and they try to work on simple solutions in terms of course structure, curriculum and certification&mdash;but some of them are just an absolute nonsense. They are driven totally by bureaucrats and/or a union agenda, or whatever, to the point that they are failing their constituency. Dr Fitzgerald's letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view, the key to successful reform is to re-configure the reforms <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">starting from the demand side, </EMPHASIS>and to re-design them around a richer concept of the training market (than has so far been in use), centred on direct client relationships between enterprises and individuals and trainee providers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the key and it is what I have said. Dr Fitzgerald's next sentence is very interesting. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introducing `User Buys'&mdash;allowing enterprises and individuals investing in recognised, contractual training to direct public funds for off-the-job training to a provider of their choice&mdash;is, we believe, a critical step to shift the drive to the demand side and to lift the performance and responsiveness of trainee providers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very simple concept. We can call it a voucher system. Basically, if we empower those who are going to be trained to take their Commonwealth-state contribution&mdash;the money that they receive from ANTA&mdash;to a training institution of their choice, we will find that the institutions develop courses that are wanted by the clients. And why do the clients want those courses? Because industry says, `This is what we need to be able to give you a job.' It seems to me that we have to move in that direction, regardless of the ideological difficulties of, say, the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not consider funding the student, we are unlikely to get the best mix of course structuring curriculum that the student needs for real certified training that means something to employers. Dr Fitzgerald goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the same demand side perspective, we feel that a new national competency standards framework is needed, which is less detailed and prescriptive and gives considerably more flexibility to enterprises and individuals to meet the skill formation needs they require to compete, but within a nationally consistent system in which skills can be widely recognised and portable. This is especially important at entry level.</PARA>
<PARA>Boy, is it ever! During our tours around the country, we spoke to group training companies, employers, trainees and apprentices employed by group training companies. Everywhere we went, they told us about the importance of pre-vocational training. People in small business&mdash;be it a hairdresser, a motor mechanic, a car wrecker or whatever&mdash;told us that if a person comes to them as a first-year apprentice with pre-vocational training they are ready to go to work and they are useful to the small business. The small businesses can then afford to hire apprentices and help train the people that their industry will need in the future. It is important that our system is nationally consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year I used study leave money to go to Scotland and Austria to examine their vocational education and training systems. Some might say that Scotland and Austria are a strange mix. I went to Scotland because my understanding was that in the English-speaking world the Scottish have developed a system supervised by Scotvec&mdash;the Scottish Vocational Education Council&mdash;which is possibly the model that Australia might use to fabricate a simple system.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scotvec is the certifying authority: it says that the course structure is satisfactory and the curriculum is all right. Then it certifies the certifiers. It says that this individual is now qualified to certify people who come and say, `I have had this kind of training.' So Scotvec certifies high schools, the national training institutes like our TAFEs, industries which train themselves and private providers. It also certifies the course structure or curriculum. It is made up in modules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people in Scotland who have been through the system in the last few years want to tell a prospective new employer what skills they have, they simply ring Scotvec and ask for a fax. The computer then prints the sheet that says, `John Jones who lives at this address has had these courses. He has passed them all.' There is no A, B, C, D. It is, `You are competent in this or you are not. You can weld mild steel or you cannot.' People can get a complete print-out. One assumes that in the future it will be cradle to grave so everything will keep adding to it. It is a simple system; there is one piece of paper to tell every employer what the person has been through, what qualifications they have, what range of skills they have and what mix of skills they have. It seems to me that we should look very closely at the Scottish system. I think it might offer us some advantage. Mr Deputy Speaker, I could speak on this bill and on this topic for hours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak on this bill before the committee, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994. Might I commend some of the previous speakers who have spoken in this debate on their contribution to the committee and the debate on this topic. I think it is one where we can genuinely have a bipartisan debate about the training needs of the Australian work force. There may well at times be some controversy about the means by which we go about training our work force and educating our work force but the baseline is that all members of this committee have a very strong interest in providing the structures, the institutions and the systems that will provide their electors with the maximum opportunity to participate in the economic system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested in some of the comments that were made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the contribution that he has made to this debate. As he said himself, it is an area of particular concern. He does come from a business background and he is very well qualified to speak from a business perspective on these sorts of issues. I will take up some of those matters that the honourable member raised a little bit later in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to basics, economic growth is simply about the production of goods and services and the employment of human beings in the process. To be a productive unit in a modern industrial society requires a great degree of skill and, to acquire the required skills in that economy, one must undertake substantial education and training. In the society that we have at the moment, you can acquire those skills yourself, undertake a discrete training course which sets out in a programmed way the paths to the acquisition of those skills, or do on-the-job training within an enterprise and develop some specialised skills within that enterprise. Indeed, you can have a combination of all of those methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The massive investment that Australia has made in education and training over the past two decades is absolutely necessary if this country is to maintain its competitive advantage in the international marketplace. It is up to every individual to develop skills in an ongoing sense. I came into this parliament in 1993 and, once I had got over the initial shock wave of being in the national parliament, I had to sit down and make an inventory of the skills that I had and the skills that I would require to merely survive in this job, let alone to be an effective representative of my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the honourable member for La Trobe was on the speed reading course that many members undertook to try to get through the volume of paper that was coming across our desks. I have had to look at my organisational skills. Being a global thinker, as is the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), I find that sometimes the itsy-bitsy details of things require some organisation and attention, and I have had to look at my own organisational skills. I have certainly had to pay some attention to my public speaking skills and, of course, my people handling skills have had to be worked on, as well. So even in the job of parliamentarian&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I handle people, but not with an iron bar! Whatever occupation we are in, be it as a member of the national parliament or as a young person entering the work force, we really do have to assess the skills that we require to perform the tasks that we are asked to do, and we have to set about acquiring and improving those skills. Therefore, I am very pleased that the federal government is putting resources into vocational education and training. We have made a substantial commitment over the past decade in the resources that we have provided to up-skill the Australian population and to give all Australians an adequate opportunity to be educated and trained and to participate in the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I must express some disappointment with the Victorian government for the way that they have handled the education issue in that state. There may be elements of what I am about to say that the honourable member for La Trobe might disagree with. But, in essence, Victoria's competitive advantage has always been in the high quality of its educational and training institutions. What we are seeing today in the state of Victoria is a very dangerous running-down in the educational assets of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The numbers of very experienced teachers who have left the education system, and the loads that are now being carried by teachers in those institutions&mdash;and, indeed, the way in which the government has gone about its rationalisation process&mdash;have all left me with some deep concerns about the future of education in the state of Victoria. I am not saying that the educational system, from time to time, does not need reform. I am not saying that it ought not be examined by the government of the day, nor that measures should not be taken by that government to achieve its expressed, legitimate objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say this to the Kennett government: `Think very carefully about the way in which you institute your rationalisation of this particular sector because, if you do not, you may well destroy the economic advantage that the state of Victoria currently enjoys.' We are, if I might be so arrogant to say this, the intellectual powerhouse of the Commonwealth. Indeed I have, sitting beside me, one of the nation's priceless intellectual assets who I hope will participate in this debate&mdash;and, of course, the honourable member for La Trobe is doing his apprenticeship in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at Australia in the 1990s and beyond the year 2000, it is very clear what sort of work force Australia will need to maintain that competitive position that I alluded to before.

These people say that we do need a highly skilled work force; we do need a flexible work force; we do need an adaptive work force. Now they are very fine words, but what do they mean in practice? We do need a stock of human capital that is very comfortable with the new technologies that are emerging in industry. We need a work force that is capable of developing the new workplace attitudes and the workplace relationships that are absolutely critical and vital to progress the economic future of the enterprises in which people work. So we know the sort of work force that we need, and we have some very strong educational and training assets in this country that position us well for achieving those sorts of qualities and skills for our work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular bill before the committee today, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994, really sets the level of Commonwealth vocational and educational training funding over the years 1994 to 1996. It provides payment to ANTA for additional trainees under the Australian traineeship system and under the career start traineeships. The Commonwealth provides grants to the states and territories for vocational education. Prior to 1 January 1994, that funding was provided under the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act, the act which was replaced by the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act that we are debating here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This act directs all funds to ANTA, which was established by the Australian National Training Authority Act. The functions of ANTA are, quite simply, the allocation of this funding and the administering of national training programs. The object of the Australian National Training Authority Act is to establish the national vocational educational and training system and to develop closer interactions between industry, vocational education and training providers. I will take up that particular point in a minute, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the act also has other objectives of developing effective training markets and improving cross-sectoral links in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the member for La Trobe, who preceded me in this debate, made some reference to and comment on the need for industry to participate to a greater degree in identifying training needs and communicating these to training institutions. I do not think anybody would disagree with the basic premise that he articulated here before the committee. But, in saying that, he ought not confuse short-term and long-term considerations. The education system&mdash;indeed, education itself&mdash;has whole-of-life goals. Industry tends to concentrate on the here and now. We need to encourage flexibility in providing training and education to our work force. I think, though, that the honourable member for La Trobe makes a very valid point. I was in Western Australia recently, and I had the good fortune to visit Oceanfast, one of the premier boat builders in this country at the moment. In talking to the proprietor, John Farrell, about how the company has developed a young and very skilled work force, there is a very interesting story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Farrell made some very interesting comments about youth in the work force. As we travel out through our electorates and speak to employers, we often hear people saying that young people today are lazy, that they talk back and give a bit of lip, and that really they do not want to work. That is a common view which is often expressed by employers when they are talking about the young people who are coming out of the educational institutions into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Farrell said that he employs a lot of prima donnas in his enterprise&mdash;long-haired prima donnas, with rings through their noses and bells in their ears, and all sorts of things. However, he then went on to say that he produces an exotic product and so he needs exotic workers. He said that the problem that he faced in developing the skills over time of the young people that he now employs in his enterprise was the fact that they did not want to undertake apprenticeship training. They preferred to be in his enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those young people loathed going to the TAFE institution in Perth because the curriculum that they were encouraged to undertake at the TAFE had them learning how to plane wood when the enterprise itself was working with rather exotic metals. So the training that the apprentices were undertaking in these institutions did not match the demands and the needs of the enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oceanfast is an enterprise that is going to double its productive capacity over the next three years. The exports from that particular industry will, according to Mr Farrell, be worth a billion dollars by the turn of the century. This is the sort of niche productive area of manufacturing that we need to be in, but it took a rather long time for Oceanfast and the TAFE in question in Perth to negotiate an appropriate training set-up for the young people who are employed in that enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That highlights the point that the honourable member for La Trobe was alluding to when he talked about a bureaucratised and difficult to manage training system that will not work. It is very important that industries' needs are correctly identified by the training institutions and the training providers. It is very important that that communication occurs between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Working Nation statement makes quite clear the objectives of the government's training reforms. The bill before this committee and the House provides for extra payments to ANTA. Clause 4 of the bill inserts a new section, section 9A, which provides for additional funding in 1995-96. In 1994 there will be an increase from $639 million to $673.6. In 1995 there will be an increase from $719 million to $755 million. In 1996 a set amount payable will be made at $835.5 million. This funding will be made available to ensure that the Working Nation promise of 50,000 new training places is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Geelong, a very interesting training experiment is being undertaken by both Alcoa and the Gordon Technical College. The Australian vocational certificate is being developed there in partnership between Alcoa and the Gordon Technical College. That is in keeping once again with the problem that the honourable member for La Trobe raised about the need to provide alternative pathways for young people to get into the work force, and those should really begin at years 11 and 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Alcoa-Gordon TAFE partnership in the Australian vocational certificate program provides that VCE students get on-the-job engineering training. Some 16 students from James Harrison Secondary College in Geelong are currently participating in the program. The students complete a two-year traineeship at Alcoa's Point Henry plant. The program is, indeed, a first. Teenagers earn industry qualifications during their VCE and they also earn award based wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme is subsidised by the federal government and it greatly enhances the work prospects of the young people who are engaged in it. When completed, the students have two-thirds of an engineering production certificate and their VCE. They can then choose their future paths, either university or apprenticeships, with a degree of confidence in the skills that they have acquired. The benefits are quite clear for the students. When I visited Alcoa quite recently, I was greatly encouraged by the enlightened management at Alcoa. I was also greatly encouraged by the attitude among the young people who were undertaking that vocational training certificate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I close, I would like to pick up on some of the training issues that were raised in a speech given by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) on 25 August 1994. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite occupies the electorate on the other side of the Barwon River. He made some very interesting comments. I was very surprised at the comments that the honourable member made. In his speech, which generally dealt with training issues and the case management system, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiatives dealt with by this bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to the Employment Services Bill here, but it relates to training&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are simply more costly and bureaucratic attempts to diffuse the political issue of unemployment in time for the 1996 federal election.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that that is not the government's intention in that bill or this bill. Our intentions in the education and training area are quite clearly stated in the white paper and have been articulated by ministers in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, indeed, unemployment was an issue at the last election, one would have expected that I would have suffered a decrease in my vote and that he would have experienced an increase in his, but the opposite was the case: I got an increase and he suffered a decrease. The reason that the honourable member for Corangamite suffered a decrease in his vote was that he went to that particular election articulating policies that would have created more unemployment in the Geelong region. He certainly is a disciple of Fightback. He is really into the sort of backwards industrial relations policy that we do not need in this country. He was also into massive cuts to government expenditure. On the issue of the case management system, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The case management strategy represents a total misunderstanding of what is required to create new employment opportunities and reduce the impact of long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>Jobs are created when the government provides an environment in which businesses want to invest, expand and employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that we have a very good economic environment here in Australia today that will encourage firms to invest and to provide employment opportunities. The case management system is not simply a focus on the long-term unemployed to the detriment of the short-term unemployed. It is an attempt to come to grips with the human needs of those who find themselves in unemployment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

However, I still cannot overcome that nostalgia I feel for that three per cent figure&mdash;that full employment figure. That is where I am coming from and I offer those remarks as a preface to the main body of the issues I want to discuss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition supports the amendments contained in the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994, it does not support this government's attitude towards training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that this government does not live up to its rhetoric on the importance of training and education. I refer, for example, to my speech earlier this week, outlining the financial differences between Austudy and the jobsearch allowance. People on Austudy are clearly worse off in the short term than are their counterparts on unemployment benefits. If the government really wanted to match its claim to support training and education, it would make Austudy match the jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the government is more concerned with public perception. Of course, all governments and oppositions have to be concerned about that, but it is that emphasis on public perception which sometimes distracts all of us away from the real job that we should be doing&mdash;that is, getting this unemployment rate down, particularly the rate of unemployment amongst young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take another example: the government proposes to abolish the jobsearch allowance for 15- to 17-year-olds, from January next year, and replace it with a youth training allowance. What will be the difference? Unfortunately, not that much difference at all. It is just a name change, and part of this government's continual marketing campaign. I can just imagine the government press release in the middle of next year: `So many thousands of young people are receiving the youth training wage. Training in this country is really taking off.' Of course, it is all smoke and mirrors. These will still be young people without jobs on the training treadmill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the funding of ANTA to enable it to carry out its roles and responsibilities. We also support increased funding to provide further places for traineeships. However, we are disappointed with the Labor government's record on vocational education, particularly apprenticeships. Here, we must look at the figures. I am sure they have been much quoted, but they bear quoting again. I had to get them checked to satisfy myself that they were right. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 1990 we had 162,600 apprentices. What is our target for 1994? It is only 46,000 apprenticeships. It sounds a lot, but when we look at the needs of Australia it is nowhere near enough. While the 1995-96 target of 60,000 new apprenticeships is an improvement, it will still not meet the level seen in 1990. We believe that ANTA needs to be given more direction from this government, as does training in this country in general. ANTA, itself, has requested more direction and re-examination of government training policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fitzgerald report, commissioned by ANTA, is extremely critical of government training reform policies. The report concluded that the current approach to reform will not bring about the fundamental outcomes desired. However, the government does not seem to want to listen. It has, of course, sought to bury this report. The government has had this report for some time, but whereas the government can respond to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article immediately, it takes time to respond to matters of urgency such as training for our million unemployed. ANTA's criticism does not sit well with the government's rhetoric on Working Nation and the training initiatives which Working Nation supposedly contains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some Labor ministers are quite fond of quoting from the press, so I might follow this trend myself for a moment. Here are some newspaper headlines which followed the release of Working Nation, headlines which are undoubtedly echoed in the ANTA report which the government is trying to hide: `Working Nation: a crutch or a cure?', `Grand plan: but how sound is the planning?', `Results unlikely to match the claims,' `Jobs, for how long?' and `White Paper draws a costly blank on new jobs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have another look at the rhetoric of Working Nation. It introduced a youth training initiative, another program to crow about. And what does the youth training initiative offer? It will offer intensive case management so that people under 18 will have the assistance of a case manager in the search for suitable work. My question is: what has the CES been doing for the past couple of years? Correct me if I am wrong, but is it not the role of the CES to assist people to find suitable jobs? This is just more smoke and mirrors, more potential publicity for the government next year to announce that it is taking action on training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been in power for 11 years. It has been there so long that it does not seem to think that it needs to implement policy any more. This government believes it can fool the Australian people if it continues its relentless publicity campaign. The government thinks that all it has to do to keep the Australian people happy on the unemployment issue is change the names of its training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the constant theme that I hear around the country. Are we just going to be recycled? When are we going to see those real jobs? Personally, I wonder when Australians will have the employment security that my country gave to me. I guess I took it for granted then and I have to feel for those young people now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that Australian people are so silly that they cannot see the lack of effect that government policies are having on their own lives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are examining today the Vocational Education and Training Amendment Bill of 1994, which sets the level of vocational education and training from the years 1994 to 1996. As several members have stated, this bill in essence takes over from the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act of 1989 and supplements the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act of 1992. The bill appropriates funding to 1996 in accordance with the Commonwealth's undertakings to the heads of government agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem with the general thrust of the bill, but I have several reservations about implementation and the government's real commitment to the vocational training outcomes. There have been massive changes in training in Australia over the last two decades, which have been influenced by technological change and mistakes made in block training and apprenticeships. Block training became a turn-off to employers, and the states that had seven-week block training will know just what I mean. Employers just got to the point where they would not take these kids but, strangely, the system persisted with it. Rather than adapting to needs of industry, it persisted with it and, to my way of thinking, that became the point from which apprenticeships started to drop off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Balanced with this has been the need for competency based training and the need for training in areas not necessarily associated with the formally recognised trades.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) has said, training needs to be demand driven, and that does not happen in many areas. Some of the apprenticeships are driven&mdash;this might be a bit of an outrageous statement, but I will make it nonetheless&mdash;by some of the politically correct agenda setters, especially in the fields of conservation programs. I am not knocking conservation programs and I think traineeships in this field can be quite appropriate, but I think some of them have become an end in themselves rather than being the basis of some real training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other traineeships are driven by pressure groups and by those pressure groups' expectations rather than the outcomes for the students or the clients in the programs. A great deal of development still needs to go into traineeships if they are to be relevant to business and to industry. It says something about the program that only 70 per cent of traineeships, which are generally only one year in length, come to fruition. Without in any way disparaging them, there is not a hard intellectual edge to traineeships; and if kids and even mature adults who take on traineeships are pulling out before they get to the end of their programs I think we have to say there is a lack of expectation in their minds and perhaps a feeling that they are on Mickey Mouse courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That then begs the question as to who is the most appropriate deliverer of traineeship schemes. I have had a lot of experience in this field over 10 or more years, and during that time I have seen TAFE almost lose direction in most of its fields. I know there are some very highly focused TAFE colleges around Australia, but I know there are others that seem to have totally lost focus. I can cite the fact, for example, that in Queensland the state government now tends to put all the diesel courses in one TAFE college, the plumbing courses in another and the automotive courses in another. While there may be some short-term financial gains in that, we are seeing the slow erosion of the idea of a TAFE college being a repository of the skills of the particular community or region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of TAFE training there are some excellent courses in secretarial studies, computer technology and management in general. Sadly, I think that has possessed some of the TAFE colleges to want to become what the CAEs were. They want to become de facto colleges of advanced education. I have even heard senior personnel of those TAFE colleges speak disparagingly about vocational training. That is part of the crisis. If the recognised deliverer, the TAFE college, is now starting to move away from its prime role as the deliverer of the technical side of vocational training, then indeed we have a crisis. I notice, too, that, because of this void in some areas of Australia, skillshare has picked up the role in many traineeship areas that a decade ago one might reasonably have expected would have been carried out by TAFE. This is not said with any criticism of skillshare. I think it is a marvellous program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) outlined the government's expectation of this program. I cite the 50,000 places that she spoke about: 14,000 apprenticeship places, 15,000 for the ATS and CST traineeships, 1,000 Commonwealth trainees, 5,000 off-the-job training places, 5,000 new pre-vocational places and 10,000 new places within the current labour market programs. I think that is quite a worthy objective, but again it is all a bit soft. It requires the Commonwealth itself to pick up 1,000 of these traineeships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A chart that is available to coalition members in an additional explanatory paper shows that between 1990 and 1994, apprenticeships in Australia had dropped from 162,600 to an anticipated 46,000. The thing that really staggers me, Mr Deputy Speaker, is to think that in just five years apprenticeships have gone down to less than a third of what they were. To me that says there is a crisis in vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask ourselves: what organisations around Australia have done something about arresting that problem? Group Training Australia, which has some official and unofficial affiliates, has done a great deal to consolidate the position of apprenticeships. At present, Group Training Australia delivers 32 per cent of all the apprenticeships in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might ask: why has it been successful? It has increased its apprenticeships by 21 per cent whereas other apprenticeships are going down at a rate of 21 per cent. As I have said, perhaps technology, block training problems and the economic downturn of the last four or five years have all played a part. I think group training is more successful because it offers its clients a greater depth of experience. A person is not saddled with one builder, one plumber or one automotive workshop for the whole of his or her three or four years of training. In group training, the apprentices have the experience of moving from one employer to another, so their breadth of experience is increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this comes the responsibility that someone has to oversee the clients and make sure that they are not just moved physically from one employer to another employer. Their general wellbeing and their focus as a student, as well as the fact that they are an employee, all have to be nurtured. To do that, group training is required to have quite a few employees; it has to have appropriate staff. It requires apprenticeship masters and a basic administration structure if it is responsible for their salaries. It is responsible to government to see that salaries, tax, workers compensation, tool allowances, and a whole raft of things, are properly paid. One of the reasons employers find the group apprenticeship scheme attractive is that they can take over a group apprentice and know that all that sort of work is being handled by the scheme. The scheme bills the employer on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis and it takes the responsibility and worry away from the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that the group apprenticeship scheme offers is pastoral care. I think that is another reason that it has such a great strike rate in getting its apprentices through. Finally, there is another feature, and those of us who have been on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, and who have been interested in the field, will know that the group apprenticeship scheme is now at the forefront of delivering meaningful&mdash;and I stress the word `meaningful'&mdash;competency based training, to the point now where it has a form of accelerated training that is delivered on site by TAFE teachers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they are now doing is on the site with TAFE and other teachers. Take building, for example: they are learning the whole minutiae of the trade in their first year. All those blocks of six and seven weeks that bedevilled employers in the past are being done under the supervision of the group apprenticeship scheme. There are apprentice masters and contracted TAFE teachers, all in the first year. In the second, third and fourth years, all that work is behind them and they become a very valuable commodity to the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that that is the field where the government should be directing its funding. That is the proven field. It is proven for a number of reasons. Firstly, the clients are better cared for. Secondly, they are being better trained. Thirdly, they are receiving a variety in their training. Fourthly, they are getting their block training and their general academic work condensed into one year's intensive training. As I said, it is on-the-job training. If a problem crops up in the classroom, the young people can be taken immediately from that classroom on to the site and shown the problem first hand. They can look at it, understand it, come back into the classroom and move on. At the end of a year of doing that, that particular student is very valuable to an employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that it means that the employer knows that, for the second, third and fourth year, not only are clients or students better trained but they will have no distractions in carrying out their duties. Because of this accelerated form of training, it is possible now for an apprentice, say, in the building industry&mdash;and I am talking about a bright apprentice; I am not just talking about run of the mill&mdash;who wants to commit himself or herself to some pretty hard work to get through the course in 2 3/4years. That is a huge saving to government and a huge input into the vocational skills profile of Australia. I would recommend to the minister or to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon), who is here today representing him, that that might be the way we should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without being a killjoy, I will bet pounds to peanuts the government will not get 14,000 new apprentices up this year unless it accesses something like a group apprenticeship scheme. In fact, I think it might be hard pressed to get more than a couple of thousand on. It is going to be no easier for it to get those apprentices into the system than it has been for individual kids to get themselves into the system over the last two decades unless there is another carrot, unless there is another conduit that makes life easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that&mdash;and this is where we start coming back to traineeships&mdash;there was a move two years ago to withdraw funding from group apprenticeship schemes. I am sure honourable members know that those schemes were set up jointly with Lend Lease in conjunction with the ACTU and called ACTU Lend Lease. It was a great combination of union and business in a very highly focused program. They would set up each scheme, get the mechanisms in place and, from that, the actual individual schemes around Australia merged. As honourable members are probably also aware, as well as delivering apprenticeships, these have also become the vehicle for traineeships. I must say it will be an outrage if the government withdraws funding from the core activity of those organisations, namely, the group apprenticeship program. There is a body of thought in DEET and in government that that should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will again predict what will happen if that course of action is taken. I have been on one of these schemes through the recession. I know what it is like for a group of directors to be jointly and severally responsible for debts of $300,000 to keep a whole group of apprentices in jobs. That is a very stressful time for voluntary workers. If the government wants men and women of high profile in business to run these schemes, to be the white knights for the government, to deliver its programs because they cannot all be delivered through TAFE and through skillshare, it is going to have to rely on organisations like ACTU Lend Lease. It is going to have to fund their core activities properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far too often we see the work of the group apprenticeship schemes being diluted. This is because the schemes are spending more time trying to access the government traineeship programs, for which they receive fees and with which they subsidise their core activity of delivering apprenticeships.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation is back to front, Mr Deputy Speaker. I accept that the employment, education and training committee is examining this problem&mdash;and I do not want to anticipate its report&mdash;but the core activities of group apprenticeship schemes, and apprenticeships in general, must be corralled from the other activities of traineeship schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that agenda has been achieved it is not to say that the group apprenticeship scheme should not deliver traineeships. Once we secure the core activities, core focus and core outcomes of group apprenticeship schemes, it is quite appropriate that people should then bid on a performance and outcomes basis for government programs. I am quite in favour of that. However, I think it is a travesty to waste the skills and intelligence of those very committed people, and the focus of apprenticeship schemes, so that we can earn a few bob out of a traineeship scheme to prop up our other activities. That would mean that we were doing the whole thing back to front. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major amendments proposed by the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill will set the level of Commonwealth vocational education and training funding for 1994-96. The bill will provide for payments to the Australian National Training Authority and it will also provide for additional traineeships under the Australian traineeship scheme and career start traineeships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth provides grants to the states and territories for the provision and support of vocational education and training. The grants are primarily in the technical and further education scheme through the TAFE system. Prior to 1 January 1994, grants to the states and the territories contributed to general operating costs and infrastructure. With effect from 1 January, the funding arrangements were replaced by a single pool of funds comprising those that were previously separated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants are passed to ANTA for allocation among the states and the territories. The main provision is to enable the new section to be inserted in the act. There is currently provision for payments to ANTA for an allocation under the act of $638.960 million in 1994, and that figure will increase to $719.741 million in 1995. The new section will increase the amount payable for 1994 from $638.960 million to $673.612 million. In 1995 the amount payable to ANTA will increase from $719.741 million to $755.711 million, which sets the 1996 figure at well over $800 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second section provides for payments to ANTA for additional trainees. The payments are conditional on the minister being satisfied that there is an increase in the number of people receiving training in the states and territories. We have a performance condition operating there in order that the states and the territories ensure that they pick up some of the extra apprenticeships that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), may have been mentioning. In fact, the act is allowing for an increase in funds to be allocated to this very important area of education, but increased conditional to the states performing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of this money $20 million was provided to the states' adult literacy funds. All ministers agreed to split $13 million from the Commonwealth to use for language and literacy through the DEET labour market programs for people who needed or wanted to improve their literacy skills before seeking work in the marketplace. The remaining $7 million of that money went to ANTA on a population share basis, of which Tasmania received $182,336. A training profile was to be provided to address the use of this sum, and added to that was a sum of $50,000 in growth funds, making the total proportion of Commonwealth funds $232,000. Another allocation of growth funds is expected next financial year, taking the figure up to  approximately $292,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, ANTA Tasmania is receiving $9,976,000 in 1994 for recurrent funding to the TAFE system. Of that, $5.25 million is for building and equipment. There is some major building construction work going on in the Launceston TAFE area. Further, the states are being given $1,688,000 for performance based training that can be allocated as they see fit, which is where the growth in funds fits in. So if the states are performing and going ahead, they should be able to increase their funds. Next year there will be a similar allocation along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the voluntary adult literacy program in Tasmania is being told that the Commonwealth has cut funds to adult literacy. This is simply not true. It is a furphy and a reflection on the political operations of the Tasmanian state government. Allocations to specific parts of vocational education and training have changed. Some $535,000 was formerly allocated to workplace programs and general community literacy. They appeared to share administration and capital costs. Since the funding situation has changed, the state is saying that it has to put on specific labour market programs that are larger and require additional funds to run. It believes it has to spend more money to cover these costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tendering process requires it to be more open and transparent in what it is doing. The trouble is that this has caused the community literacy program to suffer. People were told that they had lost funding, and that is not so. Funds have been reallocated to cover the costs of those expanded labour market programs. However, these funds are now being built up again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Literacy is vital for people of any age to participate in today's world. In these times, without basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills, we are denied access to computers, televisions and all the electronic gadgetry that we have, with more to come in the future. Many people in our community have been passed by in the learning of these skills and realise that they need some help. Many adults who are not in a working situation, who are self-employed or who work on the land or in isolated situations have not been picked up by, or do not have access to, any training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where the voluntary adult literacy program comes in. It is a one to one program where people in the community take on one student and take him or her through to a stage where he or she can join a class or take on workplace training.

<PARA>The Tasmanian government puts $250,000 to $300,000 to cover the administration, wages, buildings and equipment in the area  but, to cover the changes it has had to make, it is pretending it is not receiving the additional money and saying that the Commonwealth has cut back on the funds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax (WST) does not operate by exhaustively listing the goods to which it applies. Rather, the WST legislation operates on the basis that all goods sold under assessable transactions are subject to WST at the standard rate (currently 21 per cent), unless there is a specific exemption or unless the goods are specifically assigned to a rate class other than 21 per cent. Thus while there are schedules of the broad types of goods that are exempt or taxed at other than 21 per cent, there is no comprehensive list of all the goods subject to WST. The majority of revenue raised by the WST in fact arises from goods taxed at the 21 per cent rate, and there is no schedule of even the broad types of goods taxed at that rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office collects statistics on the revenue raised by the WST, but those statistics are compiled on the basis of the broad industry class of the taxpayer, not the particular goods on which the tax has been collected.
