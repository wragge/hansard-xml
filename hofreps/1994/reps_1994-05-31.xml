<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to participate in this debate which deals with the budget and, indirectly, with the white paper, Working Nation, presented by the government. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), was not present in the House yesterday and is not present thus far today, although he may turn up later in the day. He has been hauled into the Northern Territory campaign to help bail out the opposition Labor Party in the territory, as it desperately garners votes for next Saturday's election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point in passing that he should be here during the sitting of the federal parliament. But he is carrying to the territory the directions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the federal Labor Party in a way which is offensive to territorians who have the chance next Saturday of re-electing the Marshall Perron CLP government. I wish that territory administration well. It has done much to build our links with Asia. It has done much to provide real jobs in the territory to withstand the recession and point the way to the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper and the budget will, in my view, have the tragic effect of squandering our great nation's chance for a sustainable recovery. That is the great tragedy of these documents. They represent a government which is taking decisions in its own narrow interests rather than looking to the medium- or long-term national interest. Both the white paper and the budget represent a typically big taxing, big spending Whitlamesque approach in the worst tradition of Labor. Taken together, they rely on forecasts which are beyond the wildest dreams of a deluded optimist. The government simply will not get its 4.5 per cent growth rate if it does not get the forecasted 14.5 per cent growth in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inside story about the budget is that Treasury itself simply does not believe the 14.5 per cent figure, which has already been placed in jeopardy by the events and surveys of last week. It does not want to be associated with it. Indeed, in the budget papers, Treasury says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central feature of the economic outlook is a substantial pickup in business investment. Forecasting business investment is, however, difficult since the timing of investment decisions is flexible and heavily influenced by changes in sentiment. While an increase in business investment in 1994-95 is certainly in prospect, the strength and timing of the pickup are less certain.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it, Mr Speaker. That is simply the Treasury saying that the 14.5 per cent business investment figure&mdash;the crux of the budget and the white paper and, in essence, the recovery&mdash;is unreliable and wildly optimistic. More recent surveys have shown for the most recent quarter a plunge in the supporting criteria associated with business investment. So without the 14.5 per cent growth in business investment the government will not get the real growth that it aims for. If that happens, the deficit goes up even further; unemployment goes up on its forecasts; interest rates go up as both Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and the Prime Minister have warned, and the whole package falls apart like a pack of cards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am talking about unemployment, I highlight to the House that under this Labor government the unemployment figures are becoming almost meaningless. I say that because Labor's strategy revolves around getting people into training schemes or into the mature age allowance so they do not actually show up on the unemployment figures. It is dodging the problem; it is skirting the issue; it is fiddling the books because it is totally embarrassed that in 11 years hard labour it has built an underclass in Australia of permanent unemployed in a disgraceful way. This Prime Minister has betrayed Labor. He has betrayed traditional Labor and the working class by creating this permanent underemployed class. Indeed, he has betrayed the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor continues to reinvent schemes for the unemployed, but what it cannot do is give them real jobs. Since Labor came to government it has introduced some 45 new labour market schemes over 11 years, and unemployment still is higher than 10 per cent as I speak. All have been accompanied by massive government hype and advertising; all were going to solve the problems of the unemployed, but the fact is that none of them have really delivered. I say they have not delivered, and I would be backed up by the 200,000 Australians who now, sadly, have been unemployed for two years or more. I would be backed up by the 350,000 people who have been unemployed for one year or more. I would be backed up by the 360,000 women who are unemployed. I would be backed up by the nearly one million Australians overall who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a moment I would like to concentrate on the regional strategy contained in the government's white paper, the Working Nation document, and relate it to the budget. It simply confirms that this Keating Labor government has about as much understanding of regional Australia as a rabbit has about a jet airliner. It can hear it and it can see it, but it has no idea why it is there. The government knows about as much about what drives regional Australia as a rabbit knows about the theory of flight. Sadly, it has absolutely no idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the government gets stuck into me for wanting to spend money in regional Australia, may I&mdash;as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has also pointed out&mdash;nominate some areas where the government could save masses of public money. The white paper allocates $14.2 million for a communications strategy. We all know what that means: it means government propaganda specifically designed to prop up the Labor Party at the taxpayers' expense. The budget papers, more tellingly, reveal that public service running costs, estimated to be $11 billion, have been upwardly revised to a whopping $12 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has allocated $1.5 billion to the Aboriginal land acquisition fund, and I make no apology for standing here at the dispatch box saying that the coalition will oppose the Aboriginal land acquisition fund at the national level because it is not the real solution it is suggested it might be. It is a matter for the states. Yes, we want outcomes to health and education programs for our indigenous people who have a right to be dissatisfied with their circumstances in that regard, but that will not be resolved by a national Aboriginal land acquisition fund of half a billion dollars, $1 billion or in fact $1.5 billion provided over a period of 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what the government should have been doing in regional Australia. The government's approach can only be described as miserable in every way, shape and form&mdash;crumbs thrown to the poor by the emperor as he sweeps past regional Australia. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) has reminded us that the action is in places like Bundaberg and Gladstone; it is a long way from Canberra and the settings of the bureaucrats. An amount of $10 million next year for the whole of regional Australia is not a strategy; it is in more ways than one a tragedy in terms of the attitude of this federal Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House what $10 million would buy in the infrastructure marketplace. It would buy one-quarter of the Friendship Bridge which spans the Mekong River between Thailand and Laos. This is a project that I support. It would buy about 10 kilometres of a four-lane highway stretching from Seymour to Shepparton. It would seal the Kidman Way or the north-south link between Broken Hill and Mount Isa, which is of very great importance to the area. It could provide a road north of the Nappamerry Bridge which spans Coopers Creek. To the government's credit, the bridge has been built with some government funding, but it has failed to build a road on the northern side of bridge, so there is a missing link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a huge task of regional road construction alone which the government has walked away from by effectively halving federal road funding over two years. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has spelt out the tragedy associated with the abolition of the black spot program. That program was abolished last year by this government. The reduction in funding from $1.6 billion to around $800 million has meant that funding for roads is falling away, with the exception of key sections of the Hume Highway, such as the Yass bypass, which is nearing completion. I believe in acknowledging progress when it is actually being made. This is off a very narrow base. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Albury bypass is still the subject of fierce debate. Bureaucratic endeavour is required to resolve the route once and for all in favour of the internal route and bring that project forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kelty report specified that there should be an expansion of the National Highway system to encompass the Pacific Highway, ring roads around our cities and port link roads. Kelty talked about a dual highway&mdash;that is pretty ambitious&mdash;from Adelaide to Cairns, improved linked roads from regional areas to major highways, fast train connections from Melbourne to Brisbane; and I could go on. All the government has done with regard to Kelty is give him a flick along his way and $10 million. In fact, with the white paper and the budget, the Prime Minister jeopardised his much vaunted personal friendship with Kelty by turning his back on the famed Kelty report lock, stock and barrel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the trade area in the Working Nation document and look at the financial incentive schemes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that Kelty is very unhappy about the way the government dismissed his report on regional Australia at the first opportunity it had to address it. In my view, the white paper provided the opportunity for the government to address the proliferation of export incentive programs. We have the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, the Asia-Pacific fellowship program, Austrade, the Australia and Asia program, the export access program, the international trade enhancement scheme, the innovative agricultural marketing scheme, the passenger motor vehicle export facilitation scheme, the TCF imports credit scheme. I could go on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why the government has not rationalised financial assistance escapes me. Has the government thought of using the Commonwealth Development Bank to consolidate all aspects of financial assistance within one body or at least to tailor make these programs on a more coordinated basis? I concede that the EMDG scheme is now the subject of some review. But the export market development scheme raises a number of questions. How does the government measure the effectiveness of the scheme? What mechanisms are in place that would lead the government to conclude that the scheme is critically important to our overall trade strategy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Australian National Audit Office recently determined, there are no measures in place that would permit an objective assessment of the effectiveness of the EMDG scheme. The fact is that the majority of firms who export are doing it effectively without the assistance of the EMDG scheme. The challenge for the government is to ensure that the scheme does not become part of a handout mentality whereby firms gear their operations to the receipt of EMDG grants rather than using the scheme to boost their export strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of trade, the budget makes it clear that the current account deficit will worsen. That is nothing less than the failure of the government's trade policy. The whole point of the high interest rates of the late 1980s and early 1990s was to bring down the current account deficit by, amongst other things, strangling imports. The moment there is a recovery up go the imports again, or when we go to a softer period, as indicated by the balance of payment figures released yesterday, exports come down faster than imports. Labor has learnt nothing from its own mistakes. Whilst our exports are expanding in gross terms, close examination of the budget shows that the government expects exports to deteriorate in net terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the phenomenal growth rates of our regional trading partners, we are losing market share. Sure, in one sense our exports are going up, but that is not the point. We are losing market share in key nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia. In fact, we are being knocked off by many competing nations, not the least of which is New Zealand. New Zealand is providing competition in the air&mdash;with the operation of Air New Zealand, albeit 20 per cent owned by Qantas, providing very effective competition on some routes&mdash;but more particularly on the ground. With its dairy industry and fat lamb and other meat exports into Asia it is really taking the fight up to Australia and achieving great progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are doing our best in these limited settings and in the framework provided by this government, but we can do a whole lot better. We must set a framework wherein the whole approach of Canberra to our economic circumstances is far more pro-export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper and the budget fail regional Australia because their approach is miserable and they simply have no understanding of or empathy with rural and regional Australia and the fast re-emergence of a savage and severe drought which is impacting very heavily on farmers&mdash;even in the electorate of Calare. I would have thought that the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), who, I concede, travels actively, would be well aware of the crying need for rain because of the very sharp and savage deterioration in conditions across much of southern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Australian people increasingly focus on the government's efforts, as detailed in the Working Nation document and the 1994 budget, they will carefully weigh up the rhetoric against the actual outcomes. The rhetoric sounds great but it means nothing; it is typical Keating. If I may paraphrase Shakespeare, to avoid using unparliamentary language, `It is a tale told by Keating, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.' Working Nation and the 1994 budget will be fairly assessed by the Australian people with an F&mdash;not F for fear but F for fail; one big F for fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has cast a deficit figure which, in more ways than one, leaves a lot to be desired. It is a deficit figure which will be impacted upon by the drought. It is a deficit figure cast artificially low by the privatisation program of the government, counting aspects of that privatisation in arriving at the actual deficit figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an $11.7 billion deficit figure which in real terms is closer to an $18 billion figure. That in turn will add to the interest rate difficulties, increasing the interest rates faced by farmers, families and small business operators&mdash;that is, if small business operators can persuade a bank to lend to them. According to the surveys, and notwithstanding the rhetoric of this government, the great difficulty they face on that score is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of an exciting, challenging, visionary set of documents with this budget and with this Working Nation statement, we get more of the same from this federal Labor government. Worse still, we get the prospect that the recovery that may have been building is going to be jeopardised. We are again heading towards a boom and bust cycle. The rich will continue to get richer and the poor will get poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence of that is demonstrated by no less than the government's Australian Bureau of Statistics, which released some very embarrassing figures showing that, under Labor, the top decile of the population was richer and the lowest decile of the population was poorer. You have added to the gap between rich and poor. You have added to the huge growth in the number of permanent unemployed in Australia. You have created an underclass of permanently unemployed for which you should be ashamed. With this budget and with the Working Nation statement you had the opportunity to correct it, and you have failed to do so. You will not be forgiven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March last year, you were able to scrape through&mdash;never again. People will realise that Labor has failed Australia in economic management. It has failed to take the opportunity of recovery to build a truly balanced and better Australia. For that reason Labor stands condemned for its budget and for its Working Nation statement. Those documents do nothing to address the fundamental problems facing many people right across Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, those of us who have the honour to represent our fellow Australians in this, the national parliament, have a singular duty to ensure we are representatives of all the people and that we collectively govern this country for future generations as well as for the present time. While our respective ideas on how this should best be done might vary, we are each given a great opportunity to share in guiding the growth of Australia and in handing our children a nation in better condition than we came to it. I would certainly like to take this opportunity to thank those who have supported me over the years of local, state and now federal elections, and who have given so generously of their time in the elections that I have contested during that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My predecessor in Bonython was a very distinguished member of this place for some 17 years. I was privileged to work with Neal Blewett from the time in which he first won the seat back in 1977 and I have also worked closely with him over many of the years in which he represented the area. His role in the establishment of Medicare alone would ensure his place in history as a compassionate and dedicated architect of a health care system which guarantees Australians health care appropriate to their medical condition and not their financial circumstances. While debate may continue at the margins about the relative share of the public and private sectors, almost everyone acknowledges Medicare as the most successful health system in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his long ministerial career, Neal also served this parliament in several other portfolio areas, including a very significant period in trade in which he was able to bring his diplomatic skills to bear on what must surely be one of the most important but frustrating areas of policy management, that is, international trade and the GATT round. It is very fitting that he should continue to serve his country in this context as the High Commissioner in London. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bonython, the electorate that we have both represented, is a rapidly growing area to the north of Adelaide. It contains a mix of new housing and older established areas which were first settled soon after the state of South Australia was founded. The industrial base varies from the substantial manufacturing plant of General Motors Holden to the high-tech start-up companies to be found in Technology Park at the Levels, as well as the Defence Science and Technology Organisation based around the RAAF base at Edinburgh. Together the motor vehicle manufacturing and defence industries are the major employers in the region and their health is critical to that of the local regional economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The General Motors plant at Elizabeth, which is but a short distance from my own home, has never seen better times; indeed, production is at record levels and demand remains very strong. A good mix of massive investment and capital equipment, including in excess of $150 million on a world class paint complex, combined with an investment in the people who work at the plant, have given our area a significant boost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last decade has seen major changes to the motor vehicle industry. No longer is it an inefficient relic of a bygone age of manufacturing industry typified by low capital investment and restrictive work practices fostered by disinterested management and sheltered by government imposed tariff barriers. Slowly the industry has been turned around to the point where it can compete on the world stage. Major investment has been ploughed into technology and people are better trained and encouraged to take a pride in their work and allowed to participate in the manufacturing process, rather than being part of the production line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservative policies of the 1950s and the 1960s left Australia with an economy based on outdated manufacturing technology and isolated from the dramatic changes that were occurring throughout the emerging economies of Asia. The artificial barriers of that day gave our industry, and those who managed and worked within it, a false sense of security which defied economic reality and ensured that we would not benefit as a nation from the growth in productivity which exposure to the real world has since brought about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently joined with General Motors Holden in Melbourne in celebrating the production of the two millionth Holden engine. The plant at Elizabeth, which is one of the major manufacturing plants and a major employer within the electorate, is also enjoying significant levels of employment. Demand exceeds production and there is a waiting list for new vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been brought about in a climate of significant challenge for both management and the work force. Management has adapted to the needs of our times and an historical surge in Japanese production by greater investment in new capital equipment and in the people who operate that equipment. This twin rejuvenation of capital and management style has saved our traditional industrial base in the vehicle manufacturing industry from a slow but inexorable decline, something which would have been inevitable but for the innovative and, at the time, courageous plan of former Senator John Button back in 1984. That plan set the industry on track for a more productive future with an outward looking philosophy and a capacity to take on the world and to compete. That they did, and the evidence of the success of that strategy in the long term is symbolised in Bonython by that massive new paint factory which I am sure the Prime Minister will open shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we also live in an information age where access to information and scientific intellectual property is increasingly vital. Developed nations are in a state of transition from the smokestack industries of old to an information culture based on innovation and the manipulation of scientific knowledge about ourselves and our world. This is an era where the production of physical goods will be secondary to the knowledge that produces them and runs in parallel with the shift to a stronger emphasis for service based industries including tourism, communications, education and health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next decade will see a remarkable shift in the very nature of our society and the way in which we accumulate wealth and enhance the productivity of our country. The world as we know it will also change in ways which are quite fundamental to the very structure of our civilisation. However, these changes will not occur in a radical or dramatic fashion; they will be gradual as they are inexorable. They will not be applied uniformly as between nations or, indeed, within nations, and most certainly they will not occur on a just and equitable basis as between individuals unless we are particularly vigilant and pro-active. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is thus imperative that technological change be set in a social justice context, which I would like to discuss further, Mr Speaker, since I believe that it is one of the most significant issues of our generation. My electorate contains some of the most important high technology enterprises in South Australia and, indeed, in the nation. DSTO at Salisbury and Technology Park at the Levels are focal points for the kinds of changes to our society about which I have spoken. They are at the cutting edge of the new technologies, in the physical sense, in the equipment they develop and manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has enjoyed considerable success as a nation in developing and using high technology. However, we have not enjoyed the same success in ensuring that these devices are brought to market and that it is Australia and Australians who benefit from the innovation and the profits which flow from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent science and technology budget statement presented to this House a few weeks ago identifies the significant advances in spending on research by government and the commitment of the government to research, both for the immediate needs of industry and on a long-term basis through the universities and other cooperative research centres. However, what is also clear from that statement is the failure of industry in this country to so rapidly understand the benefits of research for long-term growth and the need to invest for our collective future through research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of business investment in R&amp;D as a percentage of our gross domestic product is still relatively low compared to other OECD countries. However, it is encouraging to note that we have one of the highest growth rates in this category and, if this trend continues, we can expect to significantly improve our relative position in that league table. That would certainly be essential to our long-term viability as an economy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation concessions of this government, designed as they were to encourage investment and research, have worked well, but they have a cost to the public purse as well and it is essential that industry also does its share in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One further positive note was the very high level of growth in external patent applications by Australians, one of the highest levels of growth in that category in the world. It is vital that the spark of innovation which a patent represents is then translated into profitable applications for the real world. This will be achieved by a combination of appropriate policy settings and a commitment by business to invest and have confidence in our future as an innovative nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our high standards of education and the relevant infrastructure for this development are all critical, as is the information age transition of which I have spoken. We need to ensure that the system of incentives which government provides are relevant and appropriate. Governments find it hard to pick winners in a technological race when we do not even know all of the technological rules as yet. Therefore, it is better to create an appropriate taxation regime along with micro-economic reform to allow the winners to pick themselves. Where we do provide assistance, we should ensure that it does not favour one type of investment, since the important industries of the future may have yet to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is particularly true of the states where many of these assistance packages are developed. The computer software industry, for example, is a major growth area and one with much more potential for Australia than that of the computer hardware on which those programs run. However, it is relatively easy to obtain assistance for a new factory to produce hardware but a very difficult proposition to obtain assistance for a software house which may have little in the way of plant and equipment but require a massive investment in people. This is yet another example of how the information age requires a change in our normal mode of thinking about industry, investment and incentives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same can be said for the software which we will play on our new pay TV system when it is operational later this year. While to date all the public attention has been focused on the physical infrastructure which transmits and receives the pay TV signal, be it satellite, microwave or cable, the most critical issue in the long haul will be the control and development of programming. It is the programs which will determine the profitability and success of pay TV, not so much the hardware, and it is in the production and the worldwide distribution of that programming that the real money will be made. Far more of our attention should be focused on that area and that part of the debate, although at the present time I certainly understand the interest in the delivery mechanisms and who owns them because they are certainly the topic of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our telecommunications system is second to none. The changes which are occurring in that area are the same, in essence, as have taken place in the motor vehicle industry. Exposing telecommunications to competition, as this government has done, will ensure that consumers benefit and that our technological base is kept at or near the leading edge. That blending of telecommunications with media, information and entertainment will surely be part of our future. The issue is how that will be regulated and who will profit from it. These issues will revolve around programming once again. The initial technical details have yet to be resolved and the market will pick the winners, just as it did with video recorders&mdash;after all, who remembers the beta format any longer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The examination of broadband services by the broadband expert services group, which is now under way and which will report at the end of the year, is very timely, and I certainly look forward to that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadband service technology allows the delivery of a large number of voice, digital or television type signals simultaneously down the one cable or phone line to every home. In addition, these services can be interactive, allowing unprecedented user response such as the selection of a movie or the selection of a camera angle at a sporting event. The use of broadband services is bound to increase at an unpredictable rate and having a good understanding of the industry prior to its full emergence is much better than having to react after the event. It is this kind of forward looking policy development which will be vital to the sound regulatory and commercial environment as we make the transition to a more information based society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those countries that benefit the most from these changes will be those with the best education standards, the best developed telecommunications infrastructure and those with the most innovative management and work force. However, what of the downside of this brave new world of which we have heard so much? The information super highway will definitely be a toll road. There will be toll booths every so often and one will certainly need to buy a car and put fuel in the tank, to continue the analogy to a rather extreme level. There will be those who cannot afford the means to access the technology and those who are not able to maintain their involvement year after year. There will be those who are excluded by the very nature of the technological change we face and those who never become part of that information elite. This is already evident with pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capital cost of a satellite dish and the decoder will not be insignificant, nor will the bills that come through the credit card every month or so. Estimates are that by the end of the decade some 80 per cent of Australians will still rely on free to air television as their primary source of entertainment. It is for this reason that the government has set in place rules against siphoning or the exclusive use of certain major events, usually sporting, by pay TV, given their potentially superior buying power.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regulatory decisions are not easy but they are just an example of the kind of issue we will have to face in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crime will also be part of the new technology. We will have our information super highwaymen. Whether it is the use of counterfeit decoders to obtain free use of a satellite signal or the fraudulent use of a telecommunications circuit or the manipulation of data to obtain funds or change records, the implications for our society are the same. Crime will take on new forms and have the benefit of much increased anonymity. One can steal far more from a bank with a computer than one ever can with a gun, and the average domestic consumer will be the loser of that in the end. The Secret Service in the United States alone estimates that the total volume of telecommunications fraud is about $2.5 billion. Some industry sources have put the figure as high as $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other threat is to privacy. Computers can be the best way to disseminate information and, indeed, it is the ease with which individuals can communicate their ideas without the help of the mass media that is one of the benefits of this technology. But until people know just how these systems will work and just what their limitations are, a whole new range of crimes will be committed against people in institutions. Our laws will certainly need revision if we are to deal with offences which can be committed without the victim and the criminal ever meeting and across national borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications of the telecommunications revolution will be repeated even more so in the biotechnological area, as with genetic manipulation, presenting us with even more serious moral and legislative dilemmas. The potential of a single company to patent life forms&mdash;and I would draw the attention of the House to a company in the United States which last year was given a patent over all forms of genetically manipulated cotton no matter how that manipulation took place&mdash;will have significant implications for all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these potential issues include our access to new forms of plant and animal stock with much greater productivity or other desirable traits. Whereas we have always been free to breed a better wheat, for example, the use of patents over the gene code will seriously restrict this on an international level and deny those who are not able to afford new stock access to that technology. The same will be true of advances in medical technology involving genetic engineering. Those countries who are not in the race will find themselves with nothing to trade. The international community will need to take a very active role in the regulation of these issues since they so quickly assume transnational proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The start-up costs of the new technology are high. But, just as the initial cost has prevented a small but significant group of Australians from gaining a telephone connection even now, the initial costs of gaining access to many new forms of information distribution will also be high. The same will be true for drugs and medical interventions which we have yet to even understand. The price of exclusion will be even higher, though, for the individual who is not part of that system. Social isolation and exclusion from wealth and intellectual property, which will be part of the information age, are a definite social cost which we should ensure is limited to the extent that we have the capacity to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government cannot undertake to give every person a high paying job, but we can and must undertake, through such mechanisms as the white paper released a few weeks ago, to ensure that everyone has a fair opportunity. The same social justice considerations must be part of the changes which are now taking place in the scientific and telecommunications areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of exclusion goes well beyond those financial matters. Individuals can be denied employment or insurance on the basis of a genetic assay that predicts they will be susceptible to alcoholism or heart disease.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He will be battling shortly&mdash;very badly&mdash;let me tell the House. Amidst all of the self-admiration that is going on among members of the Labor Party backbench, they should bear in mind the utter failure of their budget strategy. The bottom line of this budget is that the government is going to tax more, spend more and, at the end of the day, owe more. It takes more from taxpayers, spends more than it has and ends up leaving Australia with a bigger debt. It will owe more at a time when, according to the government, we are supposed to be entering a new golden age of growth unsurpassed since the 1960s. In the midst of this huge golden age of growth, what happens? The government is running up debt. It is putting Australians further behind the eight ball. It is putting the future of young Australians further into hock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget was a wasted opportunity. The government squibbed the hard decisions&mdash;absolutely squibbed them&mdash;and it squandered an opportunity to really do something for Australia. The most damning indictment that came in relation to this budget recently was the statement of Mr Don Mercer, the chief executive of the ANZ Banking Group. He said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to seize the opportunity of strong economic growth to cut the Budget deficit more rapidly is going to leave Australia with higher domestic and external debt than is necessary or desirable.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Mercer went on to say that the federal government's budgetary settings had put Australia `back on the path to boom and bust'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we woke up the day after the budget, just about every headline in Australia read, `Gamble, gamble, gamble, gamble'. It was a gamble that this government took with the future of all of those who need a better go in Australia. All of those who have been cut out and left behind; the people of Australia who have had to suffer the mass Keating unemployment of the recession we had to have; those in the widening gap between the rich and the poor; people in the development, as the noted social scientist Hugh Mackay says, of an underclass in Australian society&mdash;all of those people who really deserved a better opportunity and a better response from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear: the reason why the government is building debt is not that it is winding back tax revenue. It is not winding back tax revenue at all. The government is taking more in the forthcoming year than it took in the last year. It has not broken faith with the electorate with the perfidy that was shown in last year's budget where, after being elected on a no new taxes policy, it introduced taxes across the board, but it has new tax increases still coming on stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax on wine, which was 20 per cent and which went to 22 per cent in 1993, will go to 24 per cent on 1 July this year and then to 26 per cent on 1 July 1995. The price of leaded petrol increased by 3c per litre in August of 1993. In February 1994 it went up another 2c. In August of this year it will go up another 2c. This government cannot say it is not increasing taxes; it is. Its argument is that it is not in this year legislating tax increases. It is not in this year legislating tax increases because it legislated them last year. It would be like the government putting down a tax program of increases over a whole decade and then saying, `You have not increased taxes in any of the remaining nine years.' It is a question of legislating down the future track so that the tax increases come on stream and then trying to pull a confidence trick over the Australian electorate and saying, `We are not increasing taxes.' This government is increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total revenue that the government will be collecting is increasing by 7.9 per cent. Tax revenue to the government will be higher as a percentage of the economy, of GDP, next year than it has this year. There is a 7.7 per cent increase in the take from sales tax, a 12.6 per cent increase in the take from petrol excise and a 130.7 per cent increase in the take from fringe benefits. Does anybody in Australia know how fringe benefits tax works with its complexity? Is there anybody on the other side of the House, or on this side of the House for that matter, who with complete confidence can sit down and work out when the tax applies and when it does not? It must be one of the most complicated taxes ever invented. When people are in an argument with the Taxation Office, are they able in a complex situation to insist on their rights? Of course they are not. They are in a situation where, in order to assert their rights, they have to go through the legal process or pay money; and so many people just pay up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is extending the fringe benefits tax bit by bit, with more increased complexity and regulation, making it a burden on the back of small business and using it as a cash milch cow to take revenue out of business and to increase the revenue take that it will be getting from this budget. Make no mistake about it: this budget increases taxes and it increases the government's revenue take. Then what does the government do with that? Is it a question of the government taking people's taxes and trying to do something to alleviate its debt? Is it a question of the government prudently trying to save the resources of the Australian people? Of course it is not, because the government then turns around and increases outlays as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In real terms, allowing for inflation, that is a 2.9 per cent increase in outlays in the forthcoming year excluding asset sales. Outlays are 20 per cent of the Australian economy, GDP. Five years ago it was 16.8 per cent. There has been an increase in the amount of take of GDP directed to outlays of about three percentage points over the last five years. That is where the deficit comes from&mdash;from the creep in take in percentage terms of the Commonwealth in relation to its outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point clear: it is the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays. The Commonwealth cannot say that the states bear any responsibility in this. It is the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays that have been increasing. Whilst the Commonwealth has been screwing down the states, winding them back and preaching restraint to them, it has been wantonly increasing its own purpose outlays. One can see that from Budget Paper No. 1, page 6.24, chart 13, general government and purpose outlays. The Commonwealth's own purpose outlays increase in its take of GDP at the same time as the states' is decreasing. The difference is the wanton gap&mdash;the wanton expenditure on the government's own purposes while preaching restraint to the states. Make no mistake about it: if this government were serious about taxpayers' money, it could engage in savings. The overseas travel budget for federal government ministers increased by about 32 per cent over two years. </PARA>

There is also the matter of retired MPs' gold travel passes. </PARA>

It wants to spend $86 million unnecessarily in charging rent to the Australian National Audit Office for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party.

There is $23 million for the fitout of the new building for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year's budget forward estimates in relation to Public Service costs show that they were to be $1 billion less than this year's budget&mdash;just the running costs of the Public Service. The government cannot manage. People cannot trust this government with money and people cannot trust this government with money in relation to its own purpose outlays. It is very hairy chested and very strong when it comes to lecturing the states, but in relation to its own running costs of the Public Service we see these break-outs in expenditure. We see the break-outs in running costs and staff salaries and all of the industrial relations proposals that the government has introduced. So, at the end of the day, although this government takes more, it spends more and it owes more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The headline figure in relation to the deficit is $11.7 billion, but it is no such thing at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government sells off assets and treats it as revenue, as a negative outlay. It is getting rid of a capital asset and effectively treats it as recurrent expenditure. It is this idea of selling off the family silver to pay the champagne bills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people want to get a much clearer idea of the bottom line, they should look at the Commonwealth's financing task. The Commonwealth has a financing task of $20.4 billion in the forthcoming year. At the end of the year, Commonwealth debt will hit $95 billion; four years ago it was $30 billion&mdash;a threefold increase. All of this is at a time when we are supposed to be in a golden age of recovery. As a result, public debt interest increases and the servicing cost of that debt becomes a dead weight around future budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a time of economic recovery the government should be putting grain into the storehouse. It should be reducing debt and saving up against the next downturn, but this government lives as if there is no tomorrow. In a time of recovery it is still winding up debt.

There will be the establishment of a national centre for war related post-traumatic stress disorder. This money will be set aside for the management of social, psychological and medical problems. There will be coordination of in-patient and out-patient support services for the assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of these veterans.

I would like to connect that with what Jeffrey Kennett is doing in Victoria with tobacco advertising. Some people may not be aware of this special day. It has also been a week for confessing. The new shadow health minister, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), was confessing that she used to smoke. She has now given it up. I must do a bit of confessing myself. I had about three cigarettes behind the shelter sheds at Moorabbin tech when I was a kid. I am afraid that I am in the age group to have missed out on all the marijuana and things like that&mdash;I have not had any of that. I am a little too old.

I think the French bought out the grand prix some years ago at a cost of $100 million to make it a cigarette-free event. That is a huge amount of money. That is how much the cigarette companies put into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Victorian Anti-Cancer Council, the Australian Medical Association will not need to raise the $12 million required to keep the Australian Grand Prix from being sponsored by a tobacco company, as it stated some time ago in a press release.

One has to look only at the cars and at the hats and clothes the drivers wear to see the logos of the tobacco companies spread over them as they are being interviewed.

The broadcast comes from the television station and would go through a computer. The computer would automatically blank out or turn into some sort of coloured pattern the advertising for the cigarette companies. This would stop the advertising to countries such as Australia and France that do not want it. However, those countries that allow advertising could send it out without the computer enhancement. I believe if a significant prize or incentive were given to a computer company to come up with this it could be done. We could do it in real time these days with the massive amount of power that some of these computers have. The computer would probably cost millions of dollars.

As soon as it got in, it changed its mind and things happened that it said would not happen. The shadow minister is saying, `Tobacco advertising is okay. However, it is not part of Liberal policy, so we will not allow it.' What would happen if it ever got into government? I can tell honourable members what would happen. It would get a great grant from the Philip Morrises of this world, and within a short period advertising would be up and going again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe all cigarette advertising, either overt or covert, should be banned immediately.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another budget, another wasted opportunity. It seems to be the theme song of this government. Of all the budgets which this government has presented to the parliament so far, I cannot recall one which tackled the fundamental problems facing business, the community and the country in general. In presenting their budgets, successive Treasurers have tried to convince us that this is the one. This is the budget that will in fact save Australia, is their normal theme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all recall former Treasurer Keating's 1989 budget as the one which would `bring home the bacon'. What a monumental failure that was. We finished the financial year with an inflation rate of eight per cent, falling manufacturing production and record high interest rates. In the 1990 budget, the then Treasurer assured us that economic policy was working. It definitely worked. It plunged Australia into the worst recession in 60 years. The 1991 budget promised to create `a sound climate for investor confidence in the coming recovery'. In the months that followed, that so-called sound climate saw investment fall to an all time historic low. The 1992 budget saw the government telling us that Australia was once again on the move. The unemployment figure certainly moved after that budget; it moved to almost one million Australians without work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about last year's budget? Its primary objective was, to quote the Treasurer, `Jobs, jobs, jobs.' In the last financial year we did not see any jobs. We saw a green paper, a white paper, a budget and lots of fudging on the issue, but no jobs. In selling that budget, the Treasurer described the economy as being `like a jumbo jet rumbling down the runway and poised for take-off'. I have to say that this is probably the longest flight in history. His budget is still sitting on the tarmac. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Treasurer (Mr Willis) appears to be much more moderate in his language, but the grandiose claims are still the same as those of his predecessors. I will quote to the House the Treasurer's budget address:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduce the budget deficit, without increasing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer said all that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a budget that seeks to consolidate and improve our economic performance whilst ensuring that all Australians share in the benefits of that progress.</PARA>
<PARA>These are very big statements, yet in reality they mean little. Indeed, they mean so little that they amount to nothing more than an attempt to defraud and mislead the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is no different from all the rest. It makes some big claims, but it cannot deliver because it does not tackle the key issues or problems facing this country. This budget does not tackle the issue confronting families and the breakdown in our family nucleus. It tackles neither the problem of structural unemployment created by rigid labour markets nor the problem facing small business or rural or regional Australia. It makes no effort to curb the burgeoning government bureaucracy. Because of this, the community will suffer from this government's failure. The people of Australia who cannot find jobs will have to pay higher taxes to fund the inefficient bureaucracy and will have to cope with higher mortgage repayments. When interest rates rise&mdash;and they will&mdash;they will have to suffer the results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While the government has failed the community in this budget, it has at the same time embarked upon a massive spending spree to implement the measures announced in the Working Nation statement. The bill before the House appropriates funding for the 1994-95 financial year to a number of programs and other measures announced in the budget. In addition, it appropriates funding to Commonwealth departments for salaries and running costs. Thirty per cent of outlays worth $29.8 billion are appropriated by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total Commonwealth outlays for this financial year are up. An amount of $120.6 billion will be expended by the government in 1994-95, which is an increase of 5.3 per cent on the 1993-94 budget. A quick look at the budget documents shows that this increase is not unusual. Indeed, the rising cost of government seems to characterise this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984-85, for example, total government outlays were $64.7 billion. Successive yearly increases of between four and 10 per cent have seen expenditure leap to its present high level. This represents a 46.4 per cent increase in 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increases in government expenditure in the next financial year are across the board. However, expenditure in some areas will grow at a much faster rate than others. For example, in housing and community amenities, expenditure is forecast to grow by a massive 20 per cent over the course of this financial year. Expenditure on labour market and employment programs will leap by 17.5 per cent, transport and communications by 13.4 per cent and industry assistance by 12.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To some extent, this ballooning expenditure is the consequence of an inefficient bureaucracy, a wasteful government and wasteful government expenditure. However, a continually increasing number of public servants are also responsible for gobbling up much of the taxpayers' money. The number of bureaucrats has increased from around 375,000 to 381,100. Given the government's new approach to assisting the unemployed and its commitment to collecting more taxes, these figures will swell by at least another 4,000 in the next few months. It all leads one to rather cynically remark that in the last few years the government is the only business in this country that has taken on new labour. The rest of business has been shedding labour to pay for government taxes and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is scope to cut government expenditure without compromising the role of government or cutting back on programs. The business community has cut back over the last four or five years without compromising its levels of service. If the business community can do it, there is no reason why government should not and could not do the same. The scope of some restraint is certainly there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me outline to the House some recent examples of wasteful expenditure which should be addressed. It costs the Department of Industry, Science and Technology around $70 to respond to each letter written by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). Multiply that by 15,000 letters and we are looking at a significant amount of money. The bureaucracy as a whole dished out $170 million in consultancy fees in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security spent some $800,000 on staff conferences and workshops in locations such as Cairns and Magnetic Island. Another $50 million has been allocated to a program to change the Australian flag. Fraud in the Department of Employment, Education and Training is of major concern. Stamping down on this would yield significant savings. The use of government credit cards should be brought under control and fraud eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there is considerable duplication between federal government departments and between the federal and state governments. Housing, health and education, for example, are three areas where such duplication exists. The House would be aware of the rather cumbersome process that sees similar functions performed by over 10 departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, for example, allocates the funds, sets the guidelines to determine how they will be spent, and then monitors how, where and why the money was spent. Each state and territory, for its part, runs its own health, school and public housing systems within the Commonwealth guidelines. States and territories put in bids for funding and make frequent reports justifying how they spend their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will illustrate the cost of this procedure. The federal department of education spends around $160 million a year monitoring the programs of the state departments of education&mdash;that is $160 million without even employing a teacher. Surely a better, more efficient system can be found; one which gives taxpayers better value for their money. With Commonwealth outlays rising, the critical question to be asked is how it will all be paid for. In pondering the answer to that question, we must also consider the massive $6.5 billion which the Working Nation statement will eventually cost. This is where the government's claims become even more outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members tell us that increased expenditure will be funded by economic growth and that the improved growth will then be reflected in higher tax receipts. This is a cop-out. When this government cannot find the money and wants to duck the hard decisions, it trots out its old stand-by:  `It will be funded by economic growth.' We have heard it time and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the revenue estimates, it appears that economic growth will work budgetary miracles. It will fund new levels of expenditure generated by Working Nation. It will fund some of the sops given to interest groups. It will reduce the size of the budget deficit. Revenue from taxation is forecast to rise by 7.4 per cent, from $94 billion to $103 billion. Income tax from individuals will account for some 49.9 per cent of total revenue collected and will increase from $50 billion last year to an estimated $54 billion in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Company tax and fringe benefits tax will account for a further 15.7 per cent of tax collected. Sixty-seven billion dollars will be collected in taxes on business in 1993-94, rising by a whopping eight per cent to $75 billion in the next financial year. Fringe benefits tax in particular will deliver a massive windfall to this government. Over the 1993-94 financial year, $1.4 billion is expected to be collected. This rises by 126 per cent to $3.2 billion in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax will generate 10.2 per cent of total revenue, rising from $10.3 billion to $11.5 billion in 1994-95. Excise accounts for 11.3 per cent and customs duty for three per cent of total revenue. Collectively, they will contribute $15.4 billion to revenue, up from $14.2 billion in the previous year. Interest and dividends make up the remaining 5.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the increased income, the government is still faced with a huge budget deficit. The deficit is listed in the budget documents as coming in at $11.7 billion. But, like many other aspects of the budget, this figure is a furphy. If we take out asset sales, payments from the Reserve Bank and the transfer of state deficit payments, the budget deficit is closer to $18 billion. If we add this to the $96 billion which the government already owes, we are looking at some pretty horrific debt levels. Interest on public debt will rise to $7.5 billion in 1994-95 alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth is forecast to increase by 4.5 per cent over the course of this financial year. This is a rather high figure which has been viewed with scepticism by business and economic commentators alike. At this point, I would like to quote from some of those reports. In regard to this matter, Alan Wood of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental issue is whether we can sustain this growth performance over the medium term, as the Budget assumes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A careful reading of Treasury's lengthy discussion of this issue in Statement Two of the Budget papers suggests that the odds are we won't.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too many things have to go the Government's way and its own policy performance in key areas is not good enough to guarantee they will.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By choosing to do nothing, the Government has produced a Budget based on faith, hope and charity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They must also ignore the fact that it is using the bulk of its Budget "growth dividend", the higher revenues and lower outlays flowing from a stronger economy, to fund new spending rather than cutting the deficit faster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy is economically risky, the more so because it may undermine the very business investment growth which it is predicated.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central risk in the Budget strategy is that it relies on achieving an era of consistent high growth and low inflation not seen since the 1960s, rather than making structural changes in the Budget, to achieve better outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>The quotes go on and on. An article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't plan your future on the basis of the Budget "projections" for the years thereafter. It's not a bad thing for a Government to set itself goals but, given the recent record of failed budget forecasts even for the year ahead, the forward projections should be seen for what they are: expressions of hope based on guesstimates, good intentions and an assessment of what the electorate wants to hear.</PARA>
<PARA>Even if the figure comes in at 4 1/2 per cent, which is doubtful, it is still a far cry from the rates of growth in many of the dynamic Asian countries. Countries such as Singapore, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand have had growth figures of between eight and 10 per cent. The government is continually peddling the line that our growth rate is at the top end of the OECD countries. The government has failed to realise that we are competing against the Asian countries whose markets are growing faster than ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 4.5 per cent growth rate is irrelevant, given that we need to grow at least 4 3/4 per cent every year over the balance of the decade to get unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000. But there is some doubt about our ever reaching this growth level. Let us look at some of the factors underlying the government's gamble on growth in this budget strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most ambitious of these is the business investment target. According to the budget papers, business investment is expected to increase by a massive 14.5 per cent. In contemplating this mammoth target that has been set, the House should consider that business investment is currently hovering around a 20-year low. It increased by one per cent in this financial year and 0.8 per cent in the previous financial year. Business investment actually fell 13.2 per cent in 1991-92. This forecast has been treated with extreme scepticism by the business community. I wish to quote from some reports on business investment. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is banking on a dramatic surge in business investment to underpin 1994-95 economic growth of 4.5 per cent at the same time as maintaining recent gains in inflation and the current account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the most striking and contentious prediction is that the long-awaited surge in business investment&mdash;the missing element of the recovery so far&mdash;will finally occur.</PARA>
<PARA>Other organisations, such as the Chamber of Commerce, and individuals have commented on this matter. The Chairman of the Institute of Company Directors tax policy committee, Mr Simon Marks-Isaacs, expressed grave concern about the budget's predictions for growth in business investment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It's going to be very hard to fund the level of private sector investment the Government has projected over the next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gary Brack, the Executive Director of the Australian Employers Federation, expressed concerns about investment projections in the budget. There are a number of very good reasons for all of us to be very sceptical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capacity utilisation is still hovering around the high 70 per cent level. Until businesses use up their excess capacity they will not invest in new plant and equipment which will enable them to increase output. This situation will be exacerbated by very sluggish consumer demand. That demand is expected to remain low and is witnessed by the forecast of only a 0.25 per cent rise in business stocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business will also be discouraged from undertaking additional investment by the threat of increased interest rates. To this end, I noted with interest on the weekend the comments of the Governor of the Reserve Bank who suggested that interest rates would rise by the end of the year. His warning that borrowers should factor the extra costs into their borrowings will weigh heavily on the minds of business owners currently contemplating new investment. The government's decision to discontinue the investment allowance will do nothing to encourage investment either. Businesses may also be discouraged from expanding their operations and employing additional staff as a result of the current industrial relations laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget figures are phoney. They do not cover the real problem of investment in this country. They ignore the fact that there was a five per cent reduction in business investment in the March quarter and that business expects investment to fall by 7.2 per cent in 1994-95. Government borrowings and the budget deficit will skyrocket, the current account deficit will increase and, without doubt, interest rates will rise. Australia simply cannot afford that risk. The ramifications of those things happening in this budget are very grave. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May last year, I established a local employment advisory group to assist in ways which could help the government's employment task force&mdash;jointly chaired by my colleagues the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford)&mdash;to help the unemployed. The members of my local advisory group met with local employers, training providers, officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and members of the trade union movement to gauge the effectiveness of current government employment policies in my region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The No. 1 priority of this government remains assisting those unemployed back into the work force. Along with my colleagues on this side of the House, I have a very strong commitment to that initiative. My electorate&mdash;with its well-established training network, including the Regional Development Corporation, three skillshare programs, group training schemes and private trainers&mdash;is well placed to pick up on the initiatives outlined in the budget and in the Working Nation statement. I will certainly be encouraging the pick-up of those initiatives as much as I can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on all Australians to look at the positive things in this budget. When we look at the budget we ought to look at the whole budget, the whole picture. The problem is that those opposite look at its bits and pieces and home in on negatives instead of looking at the big picture, which is absolutely important. They know that but they will not admit it, and that is nothing unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to say that the period of jobless growth that marked the first year and three-quarters of the recovery is now behind us. More than 230,000 extra jobs have been created since April last year and the unemployment rate has fallen from 11 per cent to 10.3 per cent and will go lower with the plans outlined in the budget and Working Nation. Real GDP is forecast to grow by 4.5 per cent and another quarter of a million jobs are expected to be created, resulting in an unemployment rate of 9.5 per cent or thereabouts by the middle of next year. It is true that the latest business investment figures did not show the immediate increase, but the government's forecast of 14.5 per cent growth is not overly optimistic, contrary to what was stated by the opposition last week. Particularly with the added incentive of favourable tax regimes for business over coming years, the benefits of increased profit margins and productivity will show up in higher investment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among these added incentives, the budget includes the provision of accelerated depreciation allowances, the development allowance for large projects, the general investment allowance, a 150 per cent write-off for research and development expenditure, and the reduction of company tax to an internationally competitive rate of 33 per cent. All these incentives will reduce the government's tax revenue by nearly $3 billion for 1994-95, resulting in a substantial benefit for business. This further reduction in the tax rate will allow business to expand and take on more workers, as will the generous incentives offered under the employment and training initiatives in Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While labour market programs play an important role in assisting the unemployed to get back to work, it will only be through private sector investment that sustained employment growth of the level required to substantially reduce the unemployment rate will occur. The reduction of the company tax rate to 33 per cent, along with the development allowance and a package to encourage export development by small and medium sized firms will provide further incentives for business to invest and will provide further job opportunities. With inflation at its lowest level for 30 years and interest rates at their lowest level for 20 years, these measures will be of great assistance to business. I encourage business to take full advantage of them and to give the people who desperately need jobs a chance of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the most important of the government's aims is to reduce unemployment. Members need not be reminded of the urgency with which we must address this issue. I am pleased and proud to say that Working Nation has confirmed our faith in the determination of this government to devote all its effort to getting Australians back to work. As a nation, we have to provide real hope to the unemployed, and Working Nation does that. In reforming the labour market assistance programs it will focus on an area where problems have been perceived in the past and will make the delivery of labour market assistance much more effective and more relevant. Indeed, the reforms of labour market assistance in Working Nation could justifiably be called a revolution in training methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example of this brave new world was exhibited in my electorate last week. Last Tuesday morning the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was good enough to include a visit to Ipswich in his busy schedule. He announced funding for an innovative new project in Ipswich. He announced that the Ipswich Regional Development Corporation, the IRDC, would receive $213,300 towards the establishment of a pilot project which is sure to provide a boost to community efforts to improve local job opportunities throughout the region. This funding will support an innovative project, developed by the IRDC and called a transition centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of honourable members who may be unfamiliar with the concept of a transition centre, I will just enlighten them a little. The aim of the transition centre is to provide long-term employment by creating new industries. The aims of the concept are to identify potentially commercially viable products for process development as import replacements; identify firms willing to produce and market proven products; undertake product and process development work using teams of long-term unemployed; and, finally, to transfer proven, successful products to industry, providing full-time employment for the former long-term unemployed. So I certainly welcome the minister's visit and his announcement of this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this emphasis on long-term planning and creating new opportunities that distinguishes the transition centre from former labour market programs which, despite the undoubted best intentions and efforts of those running them, often focused on short-term employment goals. Unlike these schemes, the transition centre aims to create sustainable employment for the long-term unemployed in the Ipswich region by establishing industries that will focus on import replacement. Following the successful completion of the pilot project, it is estimated that a fully operational centre will assist up to 200 local long-term unemployed people every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exciting aspect of this project is how it will integrate the entire local community. With private sector support and patronage, local employment opportunities and markets can be identified and explored as potential income-generating options for the region. The centre will provide a facility to develop and manufacture goods and provide training and work experience for the long-term unemployed. The goods and services produced at the centre will be aimed at replacing imports, rather than competing with Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this project cannot be overstated. It has huge potential and will hopefully represent a change in Ipswich's place in the national scheme of things. The region will be well placed to be at the leading edge of the employment and training initiatives outlined in the white paper. If this project proves to be successful, as I am sure it will, the concept will be transferred to other areas around Australia, radically transforming the way employment measures are implemented. Import replacement on a sustainable basis will create much needed new jobs, because many products formerly manufactured in Australia have been replaced by imports, with the strongest period of this trend being in the 1970s and 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the transition centre funding, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training also announced that the project will receive an additional $164,000 under the jobskills program to provide training and work experience support to help the long-term unemployed make the transition into the work force. I would like to continue in this vein, concentrating on the employment and training initiatives in Working Nation which will be funded by the 1994-95 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job compact, for example, will guarantee long-term unemployed people training or employment or both. Fundamentally, it will provide a job to those who have been out of work for 18 months or more. The white paper also outlines the government's plans to identify those at risk of becoming chronically unemployed and to give them prompt assistance. Individual case management of these people, and those who have been out of work for between 12 and 18 months, will help them overcome barriers and be given access to labour market programs that will provide them with vocationally relevant, transportable skills. As opposed to leaving people out in the cold on their own in the labour market, the job compact will directly assist nearly half a million Australians through individual case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the job compact, of course, people who have been on an unemployment allowance for 18 months or more will be assisted in a whole range of areas such as individual case management, training and support to ensure they are job ready, a job for six to 12 months, primarily in the private sector, and, for eligible people, a training wage to make them more attractive to employers and to ensure that the job is combined with training, leading to recognised and transferable skills. New work opportunities will encourage local proposals for employment generation, especially in regions where employment opportunities are limited. Intensive job search assistance and referral to suitable vacancies at the end of the job compact placement are also included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this form of assistance, the government will help the unemployed by making changes to the way labour market assistance is delivered&mdash;and that is an important area&mdash;as well in assisting our unemployed. There will be a better tailoring of the assistance provided to the needs of each individual job seeker. There will be a competitive market in the field of labour market assistance, with public and private sector agencies competing to provide labour market assistance with other services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new body will be established separate from the CES to be known as the Employment Service Regulatory Agency to promote the development of community and private sector case managers and to ensure fair competition between the CES and the other agencies. The CES will be strengthened so that it is more responsive and effective in a strengthening labour market and so that it can play a key role in the delivery of the job compact and the youth training initiatives. There will be greater responsiveness to the needs of local employers and closer integration into regional development plans. The Department of Employment, Education and Training will develop direct links with regional organisations to tailor programs to the needs of regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people are the future of this nation. The current levels of youth unemployment are far too high. As I am sure honourable members all know, two of the major reasons for this is their lack of experience and qualifications and the relatively high costs to employers in training young workers. The white paper will address these problems with the innovative youth training initiatives. Under this scheme, young people will receive intensive case management to assist them on their way. The number of entry level training places will be increased by 50,000 by 1995-96, with a long-term aim of this rising to 65,000 thereafter. Young people will also receive intensive job search assistance and new income support arrangements to encourage young people to stay in education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the greater numbers of married women in the work force and the greater proportion of part-time work today, several changes to the social security system will be made in the proposals contained in the white paper. At the moment married couples are treated as a single income unit under social security provisions. This has created disincentives to work because when one person earns an income any income earned by the other partner is largely offset by reductions in social security payments. I welcome those changes in the white paper and the budget, particularly in relation to the parenting allowance. I think that will be of great assistance to families, particularly in this the International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly fair to say that the Working Nation white paper on employment and growth is indeed the most original, innovative and comprehensive document this country has seen. It will attack the problem of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, on a very wide front covering various sectors of the economy and policy. It aims to address the most crucial issue facing not only Australia but most of the developed world&mdash;the issue of unemployment. To do this is to ensure a brighter future for the disadvantaged in our society and to encourage harmony and prosperity for the greater proportion of Australians. It provides answers to the questions this nation is asking itself. But, more importantly, it provides a genuine sense of hope and encouragement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. After 12 years of Labor government, why are we falling further and further behind the rest of the developed world? Why do our workers have to work harder and harder for smaller and smaller reward? Why do our householders find it continuously more and more difficult to make ends meet? Why is our crime rate reaching extraordinary proportions? Why are we becoming tenants in our own country? There are hundreds of these questions which are now concerning the majority of individuals that make up this great, or formerly great, country of ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Labor Party has set out to destroy our nation; nor do I believe that the current Labor Party is made up of people who are of below average intelligence. I actually believe that they genuinely wish for a better lifestyle for the future of this nation. But I also know that under their philosophy this cannot be done. There are only two basic philosophies on which political principles can be based: the philosophy of individualism where every individual is entitled to reach their maximum potential, where every individual matters; and collectivism where government is for groups and where the individual can be sacrificed to the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the total failure of collectivism and the growing success of individualism that determines the success or otherwise of a country's destiny. Every remedy employed by the Labor collectivist government is based on two assumptions: first, that the Australian people will accept a further restriction on their liberties in order that negative trends might be averted; and, second, that every solution requires an increase in the centralisation of power and more control by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our economy, for example, every attempt at a solution has required more power and control by bureaucracy or government at the expense of the individual. The continuous rise in tax of every sort imaginable, government plans and controls restrict individual decision making. All result in the inability of small, new enterprises to establish themselves. Yet we know that it is only through these enterprises, through these new employers willing to risk their time and their money, that future productive employment is possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, collective interventionism, even with the greatest of goodwill, cannot solve this problem because it is the problem. Solutions lie in a philosophy structured around the individual, a theory for the individual and not enforcing the individual to adopt to a collective theory. With the best will possible, I invite the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government to look at the results of how these philosophies affect various countries and how their living standards are affected. In fact, I would implore the Prime Minister, `Learn from these collectivist mistakes because you simply cannot be allowed to make them all yourself. As an honest Australian, which I believe you are, if you cannot carry out all the nation demands of you, then resign.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Implicit in a collectivist government is the idea that the government must plan our future as we are either too dumb or too irresponsible to plan it for ourselves. In an individualistic economy, mediocrity bankrupts itself. Under</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does all this mean? It means that the government is now totally lost and is grasping at the discredited spending our way out of trouble theories of Keynes. Our Prime Minister has now decided to outspend Goldberg, Bond, Connell and Skase altogether. Mr Keating will deliberately run a multibillion deficit, the largest planned deficit in our history. The fact is, if the Keynes theories worked at all, even partially, our deficit spending would be enough not only to employ every man, woman and child in Australia but also to meet our international responsibilities. But the government, bound by its collectivist philosophy, increasingly interferes with business through more demands, rules and regulations affecting every aspect of production and the market. And all this is regarded as recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long as we continue to run a huge current account deficit, we will have to pay for it by further foreign borrowings or foreign equity&mdash;that is, we will be forced to accept increased foreign control of our business and our country. The living standard of our workers will continue to fall. Yes, the lower costs achieved by a lower standard of living allow us to reconstruct some industries but on a lower standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we celebrate a recovery, we continue to fall further behind the rest of the developed world. We can learn a good lesson from the comparisons that are available to us. Let us have a look at those comparisons between Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The OECD indicators of living standards&mdash;namely, GDP per capita and private consumption per capita&mdash;are used to assess Australia's performance relative to that of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While New Zealand's position in the top GDP per capita countries improved between the early 1970s and the early 1990s and Britain's remained unchanged, Australia's position fell by five places, from 12th to 17th. The average increase in OECD countries in GDP per capita in this same period was 505 per cent. Britain and New Zealand both exceeded this average by scoring an increase of 515 per cent and 615 per cent respectively. Australia, on the other hand, managed only 377 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia had a substantially higher living standard in the late 1960s relative to the UK and New Zealand, this comparative advantage has all but disappeared. In 1972 New Zealand's GDP per capita was half that of Australia's; in 1990 it was three-quarters. Similarly, Britain's GDP per capita was 76 per cent of that of Australia, but in 1990 it increased to 99 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has scored even worse using the consumption per capita as an indicator of living standards. The OECD average increase in consumption per capita, again between 1972 and 1990, was 390 per cent. Britain and New Zealand both exceeded the average, achieving increases of 437 per cent and 740 per cent respectively. Australia, on the other hand, achieved a below average growth of 342 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, in 1972 New Zealand's consumption per capita was 49 per cent of that of Australia, while in 1990 the percentage increased to 90 per cent. In 1972 Britain's consumption per capita was 82 per cent of that of Australia; in 1990 Britain surpassed Australia with a 106 per cent increase. The Australian people, very simply, deserve better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Collectivism is a victory for dogma over sound reasoning and the resulting social planning is a continuous disturbance of business. Thus the essence of collectivism endows a selected group with rights superior to the rights of the individual. Ownership remains private, but the state regulates. This means that the private owners are still held responsible for economic difficulties caused by government regulations. We can no longer simply apply reforms. It is not possible to reform that which is intrinsically wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individualism is about freedom&mdash;freedom to achieve, but always with respect for other individuals, for their intrinsic worth, irrespective of status.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles of free enterprise are as immutable as the laws of gravity. First, nothing in our material world can come from nowhere, nor can it be provided free. Second, everything produced is produced by the people and everything that government gives to the people it first must take from the people. Third, the only valuable money that government has to spend is that taxed or borrowed out of people's earnings and savings. Fourth, all productivity is based on three factors: natural resources, human energy&mdash;both physical and mental&mdash;and tools. The tools factor is the only one of these three factors that can increase without limit, and tools and a free society are only created when people channel part of their earnings and profit into new tools of production. Fifth, the duty of a free enterprise government is two-fold: it is to provide those things which the private sector cannot or will not provide; and, secondly, to provide those things for people who cannot provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a government oversteps these limited duties it does so at the expense of the individual freedom.

<PARA>The answer for us must be to stop trying to control and change the Australian individual and instead change the system to suit the individual&mdash;serve him and her&mdash;for the administration of government must be conducted for the benefit of those that it is to serve, and not vice versa.

Labor in the 1990s has embraced an ethos of continuous reform&mdash;and so we must. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After World War II, Australia joined a small group of nations, including Canada, New Zealand and Norway, which bridged the factor and wealth-driven stages of development. National wealth was generated from rich natural resources, avoiding the need to upgrade productive capacity. Without industry upgrading, economic policy gambled on favourable terms of commodity trade. The national focus turned inwards, with public policy geared to preserving the status quo. The telltale signs were diminishing competition, adversarial labour relations and industry protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty years of coalition government primed Australia for high consumption, low savings, high debt and low competitiveness. This was the politics of a complacent country. This remains the true meaning of the legacy of Menzies and Fraser.

Since 1983, it shifted policy from a closed and sheltered economy to the model of an open and competitive trading nation. This has meant making available the tools by which Australian industry and commerce can compete successfully on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, that policy has involved removing fixed exchange rates, financial regulation and industry protection as artificial constraints to competitive advantage; introducing labour market flexibility through award restructuring, enterprise bargaining and the training wage; increasing the national commitment to a skilled and competitive work force through education and training; establishing an internationally competitive taxation system; and increasing economic efficiency through reform of the waterfront, coastal shipping, rail freight, aviation, telecommunications and government business enterprises.

Across the four quarters to June 1995&mdash;each opposition member should check the statistics in Budget Paper No. 1&mdash;business investment is forecast to grow by 20 per cent while home building activity will decline by five per cent.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">East Asians are highly competitive peoples training themselves to win life's marathons. To compete in the same marathon Australians must be weaned from welfare dependency and become self-reliant and competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>Lee spoke of a relaxed society, too reliant on its resource wealth and restricted by inefficient work practices and attitudes. While representative of the postwar decades, the decades that the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and other opposition members left behind in 1983, it is not true of Australia in the 1990s. In recent years Australia has shown itself to be no less adaptive to, and certainly more tolerant of, change than any other nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While crediting the intense work ethic and sense of obligation in East Asian culture for its capacity to adapt to market competition, we should not sell short Australian culture and experience. The adventure and achievement of Australian history has been downplayed because it lacks the great upheavals, the domestic wars and the national saviours of European and North American history. Our history and national development have been a story of collective achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Which other people or nation coming from the despised origins of convict settlement could have developed such vast and harsh terrain to emerge at the turn of this century as the world's most affluent nation?

Which other people or nation overcoming the insecurity of isolation could have emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as the world's best example of multiculturalism and social tolerance? This was the work of a culture living out its ethos of a fair go. Which other people or nation for so long locked into a closed economy could open up to international competition without unravelling its commitment to the welfare state and decent work standards? This is the work of an adaptive and egalitarian culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a test of modern civilisation, through nation building, social tolerance and economic change, no other culture can match the Australian achievement&mdash;not European, not American, not East Asian.

<PARA>Only Labor can provide this style of national leadership. Our values and policies are set in the mainstream of society. The Liberal Party's values, forged in Toorak, Vaucluse and on the hills of Adelaide&mdash;and never knowing the meaning of struggle&mdash;are set in an Australia long past. Liberal Party members are clinging to moribund symbols of the monarchy and the Union Jack, uncomfortable with migrants and multiculturalism, wanting to deny Aboriginal Australians access to native title, and more interested in states rights than human rights. Far from fostering individual choices, they want to impose their preferred institutions, such as the nuclear family, on all individuals, and hoping, if they ever get the chance, to turn the welfare state and labour relations over to the free market forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On questions of constitutional rights&mdash;that is, the republic&mdash;land rights and human rights, the Liberal Party and its policies are anything but liberal in the classical sense. This is an outfit whose members see social work not as a means of working with and helping the poor but as a chance to send their wives to society lunches dressed up as charity. In this parliament, only Labor looks and sounds modern, with an agenda for modern social democracy. Only Labor has embraced the ethos of continuous reform for economic performance and social justice. This makes an important point about how to best judge the success of economic policy and these appropriation bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition of any kind is never static&mdash;not between firms and not between nations. In an isolated and closed economy, international comparison counts for little. In an open and competitive economy, it is the only test of national success. International competition demands continuous reform at a rate faster than that of competitor nations. Australia cannot afford to lower its expectations or outcomes for micro-economic policy. The government needs to keep alive all options for micro reform, including those which challenge the conventional wisdom of Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the government's achievements in the past decade would have been regarded as outside the expectations of a Labor government in 1983. These policies for financial deregulation, tariff reduction, labour market flexibility, lower taxes and privatisation have revealed Labor as a party more interested in outcomes than methods; that is, taking any means to the correct end. We are all pragmatists now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983, for instance, Bill Kelty forecast how `a decentralised approach to wage fixation would destroy the fabric of the trade union movement'. Today he promotes workplace bargaining as a means by which unions can extend their relevance and coverage. In the spirit of pragmatism and continuous economic reform, it is both rewarding and necessary for the parliament and the party to set an agenda for the remainder of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not allow me to deal with all aspects of policy, such as outlays, taxation, industrial relations and infrastructure reform. I will focus, however, on aspects of education and training and management reform. Governments have their greatest impact on the economy when they lift the quality of human resources. The education system should stimulate competition between students, producing new standards of excellence. Nations which relaxed their standards and grades in the 1970s, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, are yet to recover their advantage in skill development. This government has lifted our national commitment to education and training as a key source of competitive advantage, yet in Australia we still have too much education for education's sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All parts of the education and training system, even universities, should take a vocational focus linked closely to the needs of their regional economy. The role of government is to provide a close connection between firms and quality education institutions. The German and Swiss apprenticeship schemes are an outstanding example of a system in which millions of young people combine applied education with on-the-job training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an internationalised economy, the rapid pace of technological change and capital movement requires greater responsiveness to the skill development needs of industry. In the old and closed Australian economy, manufacturing jobs were mostly unskilled, with skilled employment in the commercial and service sectors. In the open and competitive economy, the internationally traded goods sector will increasingly employ skilled labour. Factory workers are already starting to wear lab coats instead of overalls. Most unskilled workers will find employment in sectors not exposed to international competition, such as retailing and basic services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's training agenda can be advanced in two significant ways. First, the school education system needs to play a stronger role in making young people jobs ready. The introduction for years 11 and 12 of traineeships and extensive work experience announced in the white paper should be extended to years 9 and 10. There is a strong correlation between students not suited to a formal and academic school curriculum and long-term unemployment. The government's substantial investment in DEET training programs is, in many cases, correcting problems which arose at a much younger age in the school education system. The cost-effectiveness of government outlays, federal and state, would be substantially improved by placing these students at years 9 or 10 into a curriculum and style of intensely vocational education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the training agenda in Australia and a substantial increase in government investment may lapse into a form of new protectionism; that is, failing to provide incentives for firms motivated by market competition to lift their investment in work force skills. Too many small businesses in Australia regard training as something governments fund and provide. Tax concessions for training would offer better incentives and outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments cannot control the competitive advantage of nations; they can only influence it. There is too little focus in Australia on the quality of private sector management. Many of the benefits of high profitability in the late 1980s were wasted on wild speculation, unrealistic salaries and pumping up dividends. Australian management lacked the hunger and judgment to stake out quality investment returns for the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reports by the Australian Manufacturing Council show that only 10 to 15 per cent of the manufacturing enterprises that could be exporting are actually doing so. McKinsey has identified how the success of regional Australia relies heavily on a dynamic and outward looking business culture. The 1993 world competitiveness report ranked Australian management 17th out of 22 countries in an assessment of the means by which companies are managed in an innovative, profitable and responsible manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this measure we ranked ahead of just Italy, Turkey, Spain, Greece and Portugal. I am pleased to report that Australia's highest ranking of fourth was for the stability, quality and effectiveness of government&mdash;led of course by the national government. Clearly, if Australia's business leadership upgraded its own performance as strongly as it expects governments to change policy, economic conditions would be substantially improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Management skills in Australia have lagged behind the pace of economic change. The old closed economy denied Australia new generations of international business management. This is also an issue of cultural conditions. Australians, while gregarious, confident and for all of our qualities, have not been risk takers. This is what Robert Hughes in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Fatal Shore</EMPHASIS> called our `defensive optimism'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Australia's origins, innovation and rebellion, while not always punished, have too infrequently been rewarded. Australia has a sound record of product innovation, having led the world in medical research, biotechnology, marine research, radio astronomy and aspects of engineering. Too often, however, invention has not been supported by risk capital and marketing. In an open and competitive economy, risk taking must be seen not just as necessary but normal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's reform program will inevitably lift the standard of Australian management. Quite simply, only dynamic managers that are capable, innovative and outward looking will emerge from an intensely competitive business environment. It is important to use government programs and educational institutions to accelerate this adjustment process and continue the drive to quality assured management. The Industry Commission's inquiry on strategies for improving business management may develop further reforms next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor and only Labor is upgrading the Australian economy with continuous reform. The Liberal Party can change leaders every day of the week if it so wishes, but it cannot solve the structural problems in the party.

The fundamental thrust of the 1994 budget is based upon faith, hope and some charity: faith that heroic economic indicators will turn into reality over the next 12 months; hope that the recession that we had to have is now moving towards a sustained recovery; and considerable charity to those 900,000 unemployed people around Australia who will be receiving further government largess in an endeavour to take them off the dole queues. Some $6.1 billion will be allocated to this scheme to reduce the unemployment numbers and relocate them somewhere else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you understand it. Let me get this quite clear. What the Prime Minister was saying was that at some stage of the economic recovery, there could be expected to be some movement in monetary policy which would mean there would be, presumably, a tightening of interest rates.

What it is doing is picking up on the comments of the Reserve Bank governor who quite properly and responsibly is saying to the banks and to their customers, `Bear in mind that at some stage of the recovery it will be appropriate for us to move monetary policy, which will mean that some higher interest rates will apply because that will be necessary to control inflation.'

At the moment, in case you have not noticed, we have an inflation rate of 1.4 per cent, one of the lowest rates in the Western world and the lowest rate for about 30 years. So we are looking at inflation rates which are historically low, and in 1994-95 we are looking at an outcome of some slight increase in inflation, but still to be no greater than the level of our major trading partners&mdash;a little over two per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Treasurer seen media comment with respect to the new taxation arrangements for employee share acquisition plans that were announced in the budget? Can he provide any further information to the House on the new arrangements?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1049" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can advise the honourable member that there have been important announcements in the budget about employee share ownership schemes. The changes that have been made are important ones because they address two problems we had with pre-existing arrangements. Previously we had a tax deferral scheme which goes back to the 1970s. We also had a tax exemption scheme which was brought in in 1988. Neither of those schemes was satisfactory&mdash;the tax deferral scheme because it was wide open in its capacity for tax deferral, it was unlimited as to amount, unlimited as to time for tax deferral and, most importantly, it could be utilised not for buying shares or giving employees shares in their own company but as a general tax preferred instrument for investment in all sorts of other companies, including overseas companies, real estate, et cetera. That seemed to us to be a total misuse of the concept of a tax concession for employee share ownership. The other scheme, the tax exemption scheme, provided for a $200 tax exemption but on such a restricted basis that it was virtually unused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in the budget is that we have sought to tighten the tax deferral arrangements so that their misuse in acquisition of shares outside the employee's own company would cease. The open-ended nature of them&mdash;in terms of the period of tax deferral and the amount of money involved per annum&mdash;would be restricted so that they would be more confined to their appropriate purpose and be somewhat limited as to the extent which could be made of them. We had people making inquiries about taking the whole of their salary by way of such tax deferral arrangements, so that had to be stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we were concerned to make sure that there was an appropriate encouragement to increased employee share ownership in this country&mdash;not just for senior executives but for all of the work force in companies. We therefore moved to increase the generosity considerably of the tax exemption scheme so that the $200 limit becomes a $500 limit for the tax exemption. The 10 per cent discount limit, which was there before and which required employees to spend $1,800 to get the benefit of the $200 tax exemption, has now been changed to a 100 per cent discount possibility. This means that employees can get $500 worth of shares in their employer's company each year, if there is such a scheme and the employer is prepared to engage in it, without their outlaying anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if the employer sets up a scheme of that kind, there is $500 worth of tax free shares in the employer's company. That possibility now exists as a result of this change. Also, the capital gains tax arrangements which previously clawed back some of the discount will be changed so that there is no clawing back of that discount when the capital gains tax comes into operation on the sale of the shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an absolutely major change in the way in which employee share acquisition schemes can be utilised in this country. There is now very considerable encouragement to non-discriminatory schemes across the work force providing very substantial benefits to wage earners in terms of tax exempt rights for shares in their companies. The benefits of this have been remarked on by a number of observers. I will just mention a couple of them. Mr Geoffrey Lehmann, who is a partner in Price Waterhouse and writes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I put out a list of events which, I believe, should be protected for free to air television. It is a list of events for which pay television will not be able to secure the rights before free to air television has in fact secured those rights. The list reflects the fact that the government is strongly committed to ensuring that Australians continue to have free access to important events which have traditionally been shown on free to air television. It will ensure that major events such as the AFL grand final, AFL matches, the Melbourne Cup and others will continue to be protected for free to air television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one should be surprised by this list because as far back as 1991 the then Minister for  Transport  and  Communications,  Mr Beazley, made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strict siphoning rules would ensure that important programs, including national and international sporting and cultural events, will continue to be available on free to air.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the then minister said back in 1991. In the explanatory memorandum of the bill he made it clear that `the siphoning process should ensure on equity grounds that Australians will continue to have free access to important events'. Today the government has honoured that promise. Today the government has ensured that the promises made in 1991 when decisions were made on pay TV have now been kept. The challenge for pay TV has always been to increase the diversity of programming. Pay TV has not been about forcing Australians to pay for events that they can now watch on free to air television.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to clear up one misunderstanding. This list is not a list of events that cannot be shown on pay television. This is a list of events that cannot be exclusively on pay. That means that if events are on this list, such as football matches, from Aussie rules to rugby league, they can be shown on free to air and they can also be shown on pay. The fact that I have listed these events for the next 10 years simply reflects the current commercial realities. Channel 7 already has the pay TV rights for the AFL through to 1998 and Channel 9 has the rugby league rights through to 2001. By setting a period of 10 years we have ensured that we are going to influence the next round of negotiations for the AFL and for the rugby league.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted with the progress that has been made in fact in the last few days with the government's asset sale program. On Sunday we concluded a very successful float of CSL, with gross proceeds of some $299 million and an issue price to shareholders of $2.30. The sale attracted a broad level of support from all investor groups, particularly the smaller investors who will be very important players in floats such as Qantas in the next financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That float has achieved the government's objectives, which were to ensure a broad, independent and largely Australian ownership base. It was a good result for CSL, the shareholders and Australian taxpayers. Today I have been able to announce important progress in another asset sales area, that of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline. Novacorp International of Canada, together with Petronas of Malaysia, has been selected as the preferred purchaser of the remaining 49 per cent of the pipeline. The government has also reached agreement with the Cooper Basin gas producers on the resolution of their rights in the context of the sale, subject, of course, to the approval of their boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two developments mean the government is confident of achieving the 30 June sale date for the pipeline despite many predictions to the contrary. That is not to say there are not a few potential glitches along the way. I have participated in the progress of this pipeline sale for some time now, and the way in which the whole operation is hedged about is that there are about 1,000 gremlins running at it all the time. Most of them have been beaten off to this point. Of course, a lot hangs on the successful passage of the legislation through the Senate, but we have reasonable confidence in the assurances that we have been given in that regard as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gross proceeds from the pipeline are expected to be in the range of $520 million to $540 million. Net proceeds will be a little below $500 million after allowing for compensation to be paid to AGL and the producers. The Commonwealth will assume a debt of around $190 million. With those two asset sales, combined with those undertaken earlier in the financial year, we will achieve the budgeted target of some $2.4 billion in asset sales for this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constantly there has been criticism in the media by the opposition that the government's asset sales objective is a moveable feast, that it is capable of appearing in each successive budget but no achievement is realised, and therefore is capable of being declared for the next year as well. In fact, the government has a proud record of successful privatisations, privatisations which have not only incorporated a substantial return to the taxpayer but also have incorporated a whole series of other objectives in terms of strengthening the companies concerned, giving them a very substantial ownership base and improving the efficiency of the enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are good developments which give us confidence that the government's asset sales objectives for the forthcoming year and the subsequent years will be capable of achievement. I conclude by giving my thanks to the long suffering and much abused&mdash;and now all deeply affected with the flu&mdash;task force of the Department of Finance, which has successfully negotiated through these arrangements.</PARA>

We do not put a half-nelson on employers around this country and force them to give fringe benefits to their employees. We do not; it is a choice they have. They can remunerate their employees with cash or they can do it through cash and fringe benefits. But if they choose the fringe benefits route, they pay the tax on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition, so far as advancing this agenda, I should notify the House that today the advancement of the training wage is occurring. The Industrial Relations Commission has the matter listed today. Discussions with employers have been very productive. I remind the House that the training wage is a significant breakthrough because, for the first time, it introduces traineeships for adults to link the training to an enterprise focus so that businesses can identify their particular needs. Most importantly, it ensures that, where this wage is accessed, it is linked to genuine and accredited training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also announced the establishment of the NETTFORCE, the national employment and training task force, which is chaired by Mr Lindsay Fox. It is built upon the success of the Kelty-Fox discussions with regional Australia. I attended the first meeting of NETTFORCE. Two important initiatives that it has undertaken to advance entry level training are, firstly, the rationalisation and, secondly, the extension of traineeships. Importantly, it will find a means for fast-tracking the accreditation of these traineeships. If a traineeship is approved in one state, that will be sufficient for the NETTFORCE to approve its application in other states to enable entry level traineeships to be taken up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On the question of the extension of the traineeships, I can also indicate that we are working together with NETTFORCE and employer groups to develop traineeships in areas where they have not existed in the past, in particular areas associated with environmental care and restoration; in rural Australia and, importantly, land degradation; in the development of a new traineeship for domestic services; and, importantly, in the area of sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I confirm what is contained in the sports pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> today. I have had high-level discussions with the Australian Football League to develop a means by which it can also access these programs if it is committed to developing traineeships that combine sport, administration, umpiring and other activities. I hope that this at least gets bipartisan support in this House, because a number of clubs have already indicated their commitment to it. One is Essendon, which I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong and my colleague the honourable member for Holt would be very pleased about. Of course, the North Melbourne Football Club is very keen to support this, and six other clubs are also participating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If successful, this can provide a model by which the traineeships in sports can be extended to the other codes, whereby we can tap into real opportunities in the community to give young people the opportunity to play the game they want and to gain invaluable training whilst they are at it. It summarises the steps to date. We have not stopped with the policy announcement. We are about implementation and we are about getting outcomes. The commitments that have been made by regional community-based organisations suggest that they at least do understand the benefits, even if those on the other side of the House are not prepared to acknowledge them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it very clear at the outset that I have not yet actually received a request for an exemption from the ban on tobacco advertising under the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. There has been significant media speculation, fed by the Premier of Victoria and, to a lesser extent, the Premier of South Australia. The media has speculated&mdash;and it has been fuelled by this information&mdash;that naming rights, for instance, for the Australian Grand Prix could in future years be held by a tobacco company. That would result in national year-round promotion for that tobacco company similar to that received by Fosters when it had naming rights for the grand prix. Clearly that was not what the parliament intended when it passed the act in 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making any decision under the tobacco advertising act, however, I have to have regard to the purpose of the legislation. I want to make it very clear that, in my view, and clearly in the view of the parliament, the act was designed to limit the exposure of the public to messages, particularly those that linked glamorous images with smoking. The aim of the act is clearly to improve public health. That will be achieved not by expanding advertising but by phasing it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear, particularly to Mr Kennett and Mr Brown, that I will not allow a significant level of tobacco advertising at future grand prix events. I do not anticipate that I would be inclined to exercise my discretion under the act to grant such an exemption, and I underline those words: I am not inclined to exercise my discretion to allow such an exemption because an exemption it would be. Should I exempt any event, I am currently disposed to apply very strict conditions to those events to curtail the extent and impact of any advertising; otherwise the act would become a farce, and I do not think that is what the parliament intended.</PARA>

I am sure he appreciates that the parliament would not want to have its views challenged. After 1995, as honourable members will be aware, all of this sponsorship will be phased out. The only exemptions will be those where it is genuinely the case that removal of tobacco sponsorship would result in the loss of the event.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I recognise his long-term interest in the southern bluefin tuna. When we came into parliament together, he was raising issues about the southern bluefin tuna then. It is correct that last week in Wellington, New Zealand, the first meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna took place. It was an Australian initiative to get the convention off the ground. The convention gives a binding legal basis to the management of the southern bluefin tuna. The delegation included representatives from both Australian industry and conservation groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems of trying to manage this resource is the scope of the tuna's migration. As honourable members would know, it spawns in the sea south of Java and migrates to areas as far afield as the coast of Africa and the honourable member's electorate. This is an extraordinarily valuable resource. Because of its commercial nature, particularly to the Japanese market, it is prone to overfishing. A fresh southern bluefin tuna can bring around $100 a kilogram, which means that a fish can range in price between $15,000 and $20,000 a fish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times there have been scientific reports into southern bluefin tuna. It still remains severely depleted. The spawning stock is at its lowest level but there are good signs that, from the cutbacks we made in 1988 and 1989, there will be some flow-on effects in reversing the parent stock decline. In view of the scientific report, we have agreed to keep quotas at last year's level: Australia at 5,265 tonnes, Japan at 6,065 tonnes and New Zealand at about 420 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our major priority is to get all southern bluefin tuna nations to agree to these limits on catches so that the stock can recover. In recent times other nations, including Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan, have extensively fished for bluefin tuna. I will be having discussions later this year with the Korean and Indonesian governments to ensure that they come into the fold. I will be talking to Japanese government officials about a method for determining where the fish have been caught so that we can ensure that stocks are not overfished.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for his question. I am aware that there was a speech given after the budget at the National Press Club by the then shadow Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition, in which he made some quite extraordinary claims, one of which was that there was nothing in the budget to provide for increased living standards or for higher wages, and another that there was nothing in the budget for small business. Let me say inferentially that, in relation to real wages, the budget is based on an assumption of real wage increases of 1 1/4 per cent in 1994-95 following a real wage increase in this current year, and that real household disposable income&mdash;that is real, after inflation&mdash;will rise by 3 3/4per cent. Yet the opposition leader, as he now is, was trying to tell the nation that there was nothing in the budget about improving living standards or increased real wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim he made that there was nothing in the budget for small business is just as outrageous as his first claim, if not more so. There is an enormous amount in the budget for small business. The budget contains a package of industry policy expenditures which will cost around $500 million over four years. Much of that expenditure is relevant to small and medium enterprises. There are also some important tax changes. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important area for small business has been access to finance. Prior to the budget, we had taken important steps to assist in that direction. In relation to the non-callable deposits with the Reserve Bank, which the banks have to have, we made them pay a full market rate, so that the banks received an additional $140 million. A condition of that was that it was additional lending for small business. We also gave a $30 million capital injection to the Commonwealth Development Bank, which was paid yesterday. There was a $20 million per annum subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank so that it could lend on a more concessional basis. We also had the Reserve Bank undertake a lot more activity on small business. These measures were introduced prior to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to access to finance we introduced in the budget measures to improve the finance skills and knowledge of small business operatives and capital providers. There was an extension of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation facilities to improve the availability of working capital and finance to small and medium sized exporters. We funded an advertising campaign to increase small business awareness of the Commonwealth Development Bank. That is important because when small businessmen come to the major banks for a loan and the banks do not accept them, only the Commonwealth Bank is referring them on to the Commonwealth Development Bank. The other private banks are essentially not doing that. We are trying to advertise the existence of the Commonwealth Development Bank so that small businesses will be aware of this facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We facilitated discussion between banks and small business representatives to address the concerns of small business. We supported a pilot business angels scheme designed to match potential investors with small businesses requiring equity finance, as distinct from loan capital&mdash;debt finance. We also changed the conditions relating to the pool development funds. These were announced a couple of years ago. They have not been made great use of. They are a means of providing tax concessioned equity finance to small business. The tax rate on those has been reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, and other changes have been made to liberalise their use. Those measures were just in relation to access to finance for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to research and development, the budget introduced a new support scheme totalling $48 million over four years for specific early commercialisation in small, high technology firms which are able to demonstrate that they have the capacity to manage such a process successfully. Also, the threshold for the full 150 per cent concessional deduction for research and development has been reduced from $50,000 to $20,000 so that it is more accessible by small business. The threshold for participation in research and development syndication, which enables small businesses to get together for research and development purposes and to access the tax concession, has been lowered from $1 million to half a million dollars.

One must say, after all of this, that it is absolutely remarkable that the now Leader of the Opposition could say in a speech to the National Press Club that there was nothing in the budget for small business. It obviously takes a long time to skate briefly over all the items which are in the budget in relation to small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only a fool, or somebody who has no real commitment to the future of the Australian community or the Australian economy, would deny the fact that the modernisation of the Australian economy is far from complete. But this country still has a long way to go before it has a world-class competitive economy. This country still has a long way to go before it can produce levels of competitiveness and a productivity performance which will enable it to effectively compete in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, it is quite remarkable that, at a time when everybody&mdash;when people can get above the hurly-burly of political debate&mdash;acknowledges the fact that further modernisation of the Australian economy is necessary, this government should take a number of steps which actually work against the modernisation of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, in particular, to the Industrial Relations Reform Act which came into operation only eight weeks ago. Let us be absolutely clear. This was not an industrial relations reform act; this was an ACTU pay back the obligation act. This piece of legislation elevated to an art form the winner takes all theory of Australian politics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What did they say? Jennie George, the Vice-President of the ACTU, in that famous interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> radio program a few months ago, was told about employer objections to the legislation. Do you know what Jennie George had to say? She said, `What they have to understand'&mdash;`they' being the employers&mdash;`is that we won the election and they lost the election.' That is the measure of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. This act was not a nice balancing act between the interests of employers and the interests of workers agonisingly worked out by honest broker Brereton. This was a piece of cheap political payback to the unions because they bankrolled the government's dishonest re-election in March of last year. That is what this was all about. It was not about anything else. That is why this legislation has been flawed from the very beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In parliament yesterday, despite what he has told us day after day, week after week, in the eight weeks that have gone by since the legislation came into force, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) got up and said, `In response to the representations of the employers, we are  going to make a few changes to the unfair dismissal provisions.' You should have heard Stan Sharkey on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS> at 12 o'clock. Stan Sharkey runs the Combined Forestry, Mining and Energy Union of Australia. In Victoria last week, the principal spokesman in that state for Stan Sharkey's union, the CFMEU, had this to say about a small business that was trying to negotiate a deal with its work force outside the reach of the union&mdash;what he said encapsulates what he thinks of the alleged freedom under the act&mdash;`If any company thinks it can do a deal without us, we are going to come down on them like a tonne of bricks.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were plenty of tonnes of bricks and concrete shoes flying around the building industry, particularly in Victoria over the last couple of years&mdash;indeed over the last 10 years. What we have is a piece of legislation that was not conceived in the national interest. I can accept that we lost the election last year and that the Labor Party won the election. I can accept that the Labor Party was hardly going to embrace Jobsback, the industrial relations policy of the coalition. Why on earth, in the name of commonsense and the national interest, did the government decide to introduce an act that made the situation worse at a time when it needed to make the Australian economy more flexible and more productive?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members of the OECD report on the Australian economy that was released a few weeks ago&mdash;the one that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) impetuously described as `Eurocentric' when he was in Thailand. He called it Eurocentric because it said a few nasty things about his economic programs. That report had a number of interesting findings about the Australian economy. The most interesting finding was that the productivity growth of the Australian economy in the five-year period between 1987 and 1992&mdash;when yours truly, who normally sits there, was the Treasurer for four and Prime Minister for one of those five years&mdash;was only 70 per cent of the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate exam paper that any national economic manager sits for in this game is that of productivity growth, because without productivity growth we are dead in the long run. The government can borrow from overseas until its creditors extort it with interest rates that are too high. The government can send the country broke by going into debt but, at the end of the day, if it does not lift productivity it is dead. Under this bloke, first as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, our average productivity growth over the five-year period has been only 70 per cent of the OECD average. The major reason why our productivity growth is low is that we have a highly regulated, rigid, inflexible labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do those people opposite do in response? They get re-elected on a scare campaign and then, having wrecked productivity with their rigid industrial relations system through the 1980s and having as a consequence forced this country into enormous overseas debt, they deliver this country into the hands of the foreign bankers and the foreign bureaucrats of Geneva so far as the industrial relations laws of this country are concerned&mdash;and I will come to industrial relations in a moment. They then make the situation worse by deciding to bring in an industrial relations act which actually imposes penalties on small businessmen who want to take on more staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what your Industrial Relations Act does. Even with the changes that the minister announced yesterday to the unfair dismissal provisions, which undoubtedly improve them somewhat, you have still left the onus of proof on the employer to establish that he or she has not unfairly dismissed an employee. You still leave hanging the Damoclean sword of very heavy liabilities on small businessmen if they get rid of incompetent staff. How on earth do you believe&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let him rabbit on. I do not mind. How on earth can small employers in this country be expected to take on more staff if disincentives are being built into the system? That is the first thing you did. The second thing you did was to completely wreck the protection that small business has under the secondary boycott laws. Once again the unions have been placed above small businesses. What is wrong with a law which says, `If I wreck your business with a boycott I can be sued, and if a union wrecks your business with the same boycott it can also be sued'? What is wrong with both of us being liable? That, of course, is too much for you. What you have said is, `If I wreck your business you can be sued, but if a union wrecks your business it cannot be sued.' That is what you have done. That is justice Keating style in Australia in 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have done nothing about the cancer of compulsory unionism in Australia. You carry on in your demented politically correct fashion about all other forms of discrimination, but when it comes to discriminating against somebody in the workplace you say, `That is different; you can't touch that because that involves the unions' monopoly power over the industrial relations system of this country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has taken as a base the low productivity of the Keating treasuryship years between 1987 and 1992&mdash;and people can shake their heads as much as they like; the fact is that it is here in black and white&mdash;when Australia's productivity growth was 70 per cent of that of the OECD average. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) get up and carry on about how terrible things are in America, how dreadful things are in the United Kingdom with all those homeless people, but the simple fact of the matter is that in the main exam paper of economic management they have at very best a C-plus in productivity. Australia is a very long way behind the rest of the world so far as productivity growth is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make matters worse, we have a Minister for Industrial Relations who, when this act was proclaimed, said that all of the complaints being made by small businessmen were absolute scaremongering. Eight or nine weeks ago he said that any employer who behaved fairly and decently had nothing to fear, but yesterday he got up&mdash;do you know why he got up yesterday?&mdash;because two of his major business mates from the Business Council said to him, `Look, Laurie, this act is going to stop the employment of people by small business. We have a white paper which is going to spend $6 1/2 billion of taxpayers' money to try to cajole and subsidise small businessmen into employing unemployed Australians, and as fast as you are spending our money to do that, in the same breath, you are passing a law which actually imposes disincentives on small businessmen who want to take on more staff.' I cannot think of anything more crazy. </PARA>
<PARA>My suspicion is that when the minister went on the Laws program a couple of weeks ago he got such a bollocking from small businessmen who were complaining about the impact of this piece of legislation that he decided at the last minute that he had to do something about it. What we end up with is the anguished cry of Stan Sharkey on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>. Stan said, `They didn't tell us about the changes. We thought we had it all wrapped up. They didn't tell us about it. We gave a half a million to their election campaign and he did not consult me about the changes.' Stan was really saying, `We thought we had 100 per cent of this act tied up. We paid $500,000 to get what we wanted and they had the temerity to change five per cent of it. We are now left with only 95 per cent.' So it is only a 95 per cent payback. That is Laurie's commission, is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind this is a vivid demonstration of what a payback this piece of legislation was. To add insult to injury for the Australian people, the main legislative pillar of this act is the illicit use of the external affairs power by the Keating government. I say to the minister at the table, the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns), and I say to all of those opposite, that there is one issue that is a real sleeper, particularly in provincial Australia: the growing awareness by Australians that this government has handed over the sovereignty of this country to foreign bankers and foreign bureaucrats. There is a growing number of Australians who are starting to recognise the hypocrisy of a Prime Minister who belly-aches about our alleged lack of independence because we are a constitutional monarchy, who wants to denigrate our Australian flag, and who wants to wreck a constitution which has given this country 100 years of stability, cohesion and tolerance&mdash;all in the name of producing a proudly independent Australian nation.

If the government says, `That is the forum you must shop in,' they have to go off to that forum. It is an affront to the national independence of Australia that we are in the hands of foreign bankers and foreign bureaucrats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Laurie is running the transport portfolio, and I will look after IR for today. I can agree with one element of the argument of the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;that the modernisation of the Australian economy will depend on our performance in productivity. But we and the conservative state governments agree on one thing: that enterprise bargaining is the tool that will drive productivity in the Australian economy. New South Wales has a conservative government; Victoria has a conservative government, although an inadequate one; and there is South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. They all agree that enterprise bargaining is the mechanism that we will all use to produce greater productivity in the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of years we, the Commonwealth, who have an impact over federal awards in Australia, have got on with the business of developing an enterprise bargaining system that is producing productivity. State governments, which handle state awards, have tried to get on with the business of developing enterprise bargains in order to produce productivity but have patently failed. So how is it that the member for Bennelong's own colleagues in conservative state governments, who would love dearly, I am sure, to follow their own rhetoric about the production of good businesses in Australia, have failed to develop an industrial relations system that is producing productivity in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is his problem. He is angry that when he was Treasurer he did not understand the industrial relations system in this country; that he developed an enormous rate of inflation without productivity to cover it. He hated the award system and he hated the inflexibility of the award system at that time. We recognised that the award system, which covers the working conditions of Australian workers, was so inflexible as to inhibit productivity in Australia. It killed him as Treasurer. When we came to government we not only freed up the award system but also sought to place industrial relations and bargaining between workers and bosses at the heart of enterprises and to develop productive enterprises in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the scoreboard which shows the results of the Commonwealth and its ability to drive the system to productivity and those of the conservatives in the states. These figures were produced just two weeks ago and were presented to a council of labour ministers around Australia. In the Commonwealth sector, over one million workers who are covered by federal awards are covered by enterprise agreements; 48 per cent of all workers under federal awards are covered by enterprise agreements. So, to the extent that Labor and conservatives agree that enterprise bargaining is the way to produce better and more productive enterprises in this country, we have 48 per cent of the game sown up&mdash;48 per cent of workers covered by federal awards. Our conservative opponents, who are supposed to be mouthing the rhetoric of the honourable member for Bennelong, have done very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the scoreboard of the conservative states. In New South Wales the number of workers covered by enterprise agreements under state awards, which is the area it would cover, is not 48 per cent but five per cent. Five per cent of workers in New South Wales under state awards are covered by enterprise agreements. That is a pathetic record for a conservative government that is supposed to be concerned with productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia the coverage is six per cent. The Western Australian Minister for Labour Relations, Mr Kierath, was unhappy when the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) suggested that it was only six per cent. He said, `You're wrong, it is seven per cent.' There you go: seven per cent of workers in Western Australia are covered by enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania, where there is a conservative government, just one per cent of workers are covered. In South Australia the system is so new that virtually no-one is covered by enterprise agreements under the state award system under the new South Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria no-one is covered by enterprise bargains because they have individual contracts, and individual contracts have remained secret contracts and compacts between an individual employer and an individual employee. There is no way we know not only whether there is any decent productivity in the bargain but also what rights and privileges have been taken away from individual workers in Victoria. So the conservative Victorian government has, if you like, destroyed enterprise bargaining in that state. Workers have jumped out of the Victorian system, which is now all but destroyed, and jumped into the federal award system so they could get into a system like ours that can produce enterprise bargains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the scoreboard of those who are running industrial relations systems that can provide a productive workplace in the country is clear: 48 per cent coverage under federal awards governable by the Commonwealth's IR system and an average of less than five per cent under state awards governable by, in the main, conservative state governments. That is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales labour minister came to us last week and said, `It remains the case that there are seven different industrial relations systems operating in Australia which differ and impose conflicting requirements in some important areas.' I agree. There are seven different systems: the Commonwealth and the Queensland state system are developing enterprise agreements which are good for productivity, and another five are not developing systems that are good for enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the conservative states would have an argument if they had a single alternative system which was better or worse than ours&mdash;we could argue the toss&mdash;but they do not. There are at least five different state IR systems around this country at the moment. The Commonwealth and Queensland have a single system with a single set of rules, but the conservatives have five different systems. That is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have we been so successful in getting enterprise bargains up in this country? Because we have a single rule that says that, if people go into an enterprise bargain with their boss, the boss cannot pay them less than their award previously stated. It is called a no disadvantage test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not understand. Bargaining means two sets of people have to agree. If you want to get millions of workers into enterprise bargaining, they need to feel safe about the bargain. The no disadvantage test provides the safety to enter the agreement but does not stop the productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The no disadvantage test operates in the Commonwealth system and in Queensland where, of course, we have had the greatest success under enterprise bargaining and the greatest impact on productivity. The no disadvantage test does not apply in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. South Australia has a weakened no disadvantage test. I suspect it is wide enough to drive a truck through, but at least the term `no substantial disadvantage' is used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservatives do not understand why an employee would enter a bargain where patently they are likely to lose current terms and conditions. If there are a set of rules and a no disadvantage test that allows people to enter the bargain, get a pay rise and produce for the employer a greater output, both sides win. Win-win situations are being achieved in over a million cases in the Commonwealth system. Over a million employees have been covered in the Commonwealth system; 48 per cent of all workers under federal awards are covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the states have a whole different set of rules. Let me illustrate how some of the criteria in state systems are just so different. I would love to have a single unified IR system in this country, as would the conservative minister for IR in New South Wales. But she cannot achieve it because four of her own mates cannot agree on similar rules. Each state's rules are different on the duration of bargains. The Commonwealth and Queensland rules are the same. We all agree that enterprise bargaining per se is a good method, except for Victoria, which concentrates on individual non-published bargains or contracts&mdash;which are a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of union involvement varies enormously, but by and large the Commonwealth prefers and encourages the trade union movement to become involved in enterprise bargains. Why would we not? The trade union movement has over 90 years experience in bargaining. If you were going to bargain with your boss about your future working conditions and wages, you should buy yourself some experience in bargaining. Go to your trade union and seek that 90 years of experience so that you will get yourself a reasonable deal. You would be bonkers not to do it. We encourage trade unions and the trade union system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty for the trade union system with the Industrial Relations Reform Act is enterprise flexibility agreements. These are agreements, which are now being written, where trade unions do not have substantial coverage in the enterprise or have no coverage. In that circumstance the trade union cannot veto an agreement. It can have an input, it can have a say, it can attempt to sign up members in that enterprise&mdash;and good on them&mdash;in order to say, `We will do the job for you, we will help you bargain this situation,' but at the end of the day they have no veto whatsoever on EFAs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of Able Demolitions and Excavations in Victoria, the CFMEU&mdash;the union that might otherwise cover workers in that enterprise&mdash;is putting the weights on to ensure that the 10 employers in that company get a decent deal. I will bet that at the end of the day Able will come up with an agreement and make sure that the CFMEU is either party to the agreement or has a great input on behalf of the workers in the drawing up of the agreement. But it has no veto over the agreement. That was an enormous step and challenge for the trade union movement. It was imperative that the Commonwealth deliver the ability to spread enterprise bargaining to non-union workshops. We have done it and we have succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other things that are enormously different between the states include the question of union involvement. We are relaxed about it. The states, by and large, have no requirement or role whatsoever for trade unions throughout their systems, except that they are a bit gentler in New South Wales. South Australia has a limited role for unionists. Queensland's system is the same as the Commonwealth's system. In the Commonwealth, groups are required to register agreements, apart from private ones&mdash;and that is their business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria there is no requirement to register individual agreements, so no-one would know if someone was ripped off or poorly done by. No-one would know. That is no way to run industrial relations. It is better to have these agreements published or publicly available so people can understand and can compare what the other mob is getting. Why would we not have a law that says these agreements ought to be registered with the commission, published and made available? The states, by and large, do not even agree amongst themselves as to whether the agreements ought to be published, but the Victorian case is the worse. It says, `No, it does not matter. It is between you and the boss, and no-one need know any different.' That is the sad part of IR in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules about establishing an agreement, the variation for review, the publication of agreements and the question of consultation between the parties are different in the states. Only the Commonwealth and Queensland have a simple, single set of rules in order to run IR at the Commonwealth sector. For instance, there is a public interest test which operates in the Commonwealth which is a similar concept to the no disadvantage test. Only the Commonwealth and the Queensland systems have that public interest test. New South Wales will not have it. Victoria will not have it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I stay for speakers who follow me. I will even stay for the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). If our productivity improvements under this marvellous new arrangement that the government has put in place are so wonderful, why is it that productivity improvements in Australia are lagging so badly behind OECD averages of improvement? Even worse, why are they falling behind the Asian improvements even more than OECD averages? Secondly, if we are doing so well, why is it that the government is proposing alterations to its legislation just eight weeks after it was introduced?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the government has jettisoned real enterprise bargaining agreements not by just heavy-handing the states but by structuring the process in this country to make enterprise agreements basically useless and very unattractive to employers. The government could have everyone in the work force in this country covered by workplace agreements. It could have 100 per cent coverage, yet we still would not have an efficient and productive work force, because essentially what we are getting is not a real enterprise agreement, not a real spirit of mutuality, not a real boost in productivity arising out of more sensible relationships in the workplace.

The sooner the better, because keeping dino alive is quite simply counter to the overwhelming need to boost productivity in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank warned last year that business and jobs would be lost if we lost our productivity. He might have added the obvious point that prosperity and living standards would also continue to decline if we do not make those reforms and tackle the tough issues. Without reforms, we will all lose&mdash;those in jobs, those lucky enough to have them; those who are looking for jobs; and those who will look for jobs in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest irony of all is that the Labor Party keeps crowing about the way it protects its constituents and the way it looks after the workers. Who are the great losers out of the policy approaches and prescriptions that we see under this mob&mdash;the very people the government says it is most concerned to look after and protect. When it comes to talking about Labor's objectives and its understanding of boosting productivity and the linkages between that, more jobs and prosperity, I make this observation: do not listen to what Labor says; look at what it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While, on the one hand, we get recognition of the importance of the business sector's role, on the other hand we get a vindictive attitude towards business. It has copped it non-stop for supporting us in the last election and for calling out for decent reforms. We get diatribes of the sort that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) talked about&mdash;this really mature attitude, `We won and you lost, so hang the interests of Australians; we will just pursue the interests of the mates, the privileged and the entrenched.' It is class warfare language. The government, from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) down, derides business and belts it around the room.  It then turns round and says, `But of course we are relying on you to provide the restoration and prosperity to turn the economy round, to give people jobs and to provide us with a tax base for our big spending policies.' There is a vindictiveness against employers on the one hand and on the other hand a submissiveness to the union movement&mdash;both ignore the real interests of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember the shock and the horror that we all felt after the last election when the Prime Minister said with absolute conviction, as did the previous speaker, that enterprise bargaining and agreements are the way ahead for the nation, critical for jobs and prosperity and for our place in the world. He said that the primary objective of this government in this term would be to put real enterprise bargaining into place. He saw the need; he knew the truth, and he spoke it bravely until the ACTU howled. Then the government rolled over. It hesitated only long enough to ask which way it should roll and whether it should roll once, twice or three times. The token resistance was just that&mdash;very token. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, just eight weeks after the resulting frightful legislation was introduced, having been essentially drafted and announced not by the government but by the ACTU, we find that it has to be altered because it is not working. It was always doomed to failure. At a time when Australians need jobs, it provides disincentives for people to employ others. At a time when Australia needs a more flexible workplace, it gets in the way of effective enterprise bargaining. At a time when Australia needs to be more productive, it places absurdities like the no disadvantage test in the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the honourable member for Brisbane says, `You are all about driving down wages and conditions,' I simply reiterate the point that workers in this country only have to consider their lot over the last 11 years. They have gone backwards and lost jobs under the current system. The poor have become poorer while the wealthy have become wealthier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is very interesting that one group I am sure the government never expected would desert it, but which has, is the MTIA. The government has put this ridiculous unfair dismissal arrangement in the way. Bert Evans had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main perception by employers, therefore, of the new termination code is that it imposes excessive regulation on the employer. It requires close adherence to a procedure involving counselling, written warnings, detailed records of interview and generally becoming bogged down in a time-wasting exercise for the purpose of being able to demonstrate to a tribunal that the employer has bent over backwards to ensure fairness in the treatment of an employee in circumstances which might lead to termination of employment. Moreover if the employer makes one small mistake in that process, there is the prospect of compensation being awarded which may run into thousands, perhaps millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the point of view of encouraging the employment of more people this is, to say the least, bad psychology, and sends the wrong kind of message to firms contemplating taking on more people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to the starting date when we took office in 1983. The legacy we were left with when the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer in charge of the economic growth of this nation was a growth in GDP of 0.7 per cent. In that year, when the honourable member for Bennelong was the Treasurer with direct responsibility for these matters, the OECD average was 2.9 per cent. We were a fraction of the OECD average when he had personal responsibility for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He conveniently excluded from the calculations he presented to the parliament today those early years when we were in office. In 1984, our first year in office as a Labor government, we produced economic growth of 7 1/2 per cent. The OECD average was 5.2 per cent. In 1985, not a year selected by the honourable member for Bennelong, we recorded economic growth of 4.9 per cent against an OECD average of 3.6 per cent. Let us turn to more recent years. In 1992, we had economic growth of 2.1 per cent against an OECD average of 1.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps more important are the forecasts for the future; in other words, the assessment the OECD has made of the impact of these new reforms that we have put in place. What will be the impact of those reforms as we move forward? How does that compare with our OECD partners?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projections for 1993 show that the assessment of the OECD was for 3.4 per cent economic growth against an OECD average of 1.2 per cent. Since this publication which I have printed, the figures have been revised upwards. The publication I have shows an expected growth in our economy in 1994 of 3.4 per cent against an OECD average of four per cent. So the OECD's assessment of our performance in recent years and the future shows us very much on a par with the average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to make productivity the test, the other interesting comparison is to look at those countries where the sort of fundamentalist, right-wing policies that those opposite espouse have been implemented. For example, if we look at the record in the United Kingdom, where the Thatcherite policies in industrial relations are akin to those proposed here by the Liberal and National parties, we find a very interesting outcome. The United Kingdom's economic growth has been markedly below Australia's economic growth, virtually throughout that entire period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its future is not looking any better. In 1992, while we were recording a substantial increase in our GDP of about two per cent, the United Kingdom was still going backwards with a negative figure of minus one per cent. It was expected to come out of that recession in 1993 with a growth of 1.3 per cent compared with the Australian performance of about three per cent. In 1994, when its economy starts to pick up, it is expected to grow at 2.4 per cent. I remind the House that in the same year the OECD expects us to grow at 3.4 per cent. So the country which has most closely adopted those policies has ended up with an economic growth rate that is much worse than ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will quickly turn to the question of the ILO conventions and the concern about sovereignty. Last year, we enacted legislation to adopt a number of the provisions of ILO conventions which we as a nation had ratified. These things which appear to be the cause of great heartburn to the Liberal and National parties touched on such radical proposals as equal pay for equal work. In other words, it does not matter whether people are male or female; those who do the same job get paid the same money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people think that has been the case in Australia for a long time. It has not, and the statistics show that it has not. Despite the fact that it was put into awards in most cases in the late 1970s, it has not been the practice because it has not been adequately addressed through the industrial relations system. So we legislated for it. We said that men and women performing equal work should get equal pay. That is one of those terrible international conventions that the opposition is riling about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another one was maternity leave. We put in a legislative entitlement for women to take leave from their employment when having a child. Again, it is not a radical position. But there are still cases where women in employment who fall pregnant are sacked, with the reason for their dismissal being that they are having a child. We have legislated to put an end to that. The other thing we legislated for was a minimum wage. Again, it is an area we would expect to be already covered by the industrial relations system. By my estimations, it probably will not have a great impact on many shopfloors; nevertheless, we have ensured there is now a legal minimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final one was fair dismissal. In federal law we gave the right to employees to have recourse against an employer for unfair dismissal. This has existed in state industrial commissions throughout the country for as long as I can recall&mdash;certainly for many decades. That provision for reinstatement and for appeal against unfair dismissal is not a new right in Australia. It was a new provision in federal law, but it was not a new right for workers in this country. Unfortunately, it has been used as a beat-up by the opposition and by some employers in an effort to rally some support around an industrial relations agenda which it has on at least two occasions put to the Australian people and had rebuffed. I have spoken to a number of small business people in my electorate who have had concerns about this matter. They have read some of the propaganda that has been put out and not understood what the legislation provided for&mdash;or, for that matter, what the state awards already provided for. When they understand the arrangements that are in place, they do not have a problem with the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the quote that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) read from the MTIA pamphlet. The introduction to it referred to perceptions. I agree; I think there is a perception out there that these things occur. But that perception is not matched by the reality. That perception is fostered, cultivated and fuelled by the inaccurate and inflammatory rhetoric which those opposite have pursued throughout this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn now to the question of conflict in industrial relations. It has been painted in this debate as a situation in which there is a class war which the government has been cultivating. Anybody who has been involved in industrial relations for more than a decade knows what nonsense that is. As someone who was involved in industrial relations under a National-Liberal government in Queensland and under a Liberal Party government here federally, I can tell the House that there was a time in the 1970s when it was confrontationist. It was all knee-jerk stuff. That has gone. The litmus test, the statistical test, is the number of days lost in strike. I do not have time to go into a whole lot of the examples that I could cite of where it has been working extremely well in companies all around the country. </PARA>

The fact of life is that industrial disputes now are about one-third of what they were. That is a two-thirds cut. That is not a sign of a confrontationist system; that is a sign of a mature system that this government, together with employers and the ACTU, has negotiated and has had in operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal government preaches financial prudence yet continues to raise taxes, often by surreptitious means, and spends more on its special projects close to Labor heartland. The optimistic prediction that investment will increase by 14 per cent over the next 12 months is not supported by the data that is now emerging. Business leaders remain unconvinced that it is time to reinvest and create jobs. Likewise, world investors looking at Australia question the capacity of Australia's economy to grow at 4 1/2 per cent when other Western nations are growing at 2 1/2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key Western economies which have had a major influence in Australia's trading pattern are showing varying degrees of growth, which supports the proposition that the sustained world recovery is yet to come to reality. The American economy grew by three per cent in the last 12 months. Likewise, the Japanese economy had almost no growth. Germany, with all its abundance of resources and skills, could only record a growth rate of 1.9 per cent. China is emerging from the straitjacket of socialist control and growing at the phenomenal rate of 13 per cent. But it faces considerable inflationary pressures of 13 per cent, which could bring about some major dislocations in the next two to three years. Singapore has a solidly based economy, with remarkable and sustainable growth rates of between six and 10 per cent over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">India could be the quiet achiever of the Asian subcontinent. With a new financial regime directed by the erudite finance minister, Mr Manon Singh, India is moving towards a more open and competitive Western style capitalist economy. Its population of almost 900 million people provides a springboard for manufacturing and consumption that has often been overlooked by Western investors. The shackles of central bureaucratic government and the doctrine of socialism have been cast aside in favour of a more free enterprise and open wealth-creating attitude to running India's national affairs. The Labor government could well take heed of India's direction in developing policy initiatives for Australia to improve its living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thrust of the white paper on unemployment was to spend more money on training programs to camouflage and relocate the unemployment numbers. The white paper is a blatant attempt to make the unemployment figures look good for the next election. What the 900,000 unemployed Australians want is long-term sustainable jobs, not short-term mickey mouse training programs from which there are no real jobs. Added to the white paper is the huge dilemma facing employers with the Brereton industrial relations legislation which has just been debated in the matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only now are the employers waking up to the horrendous implications of the union-dominated complex industrial relations package which discriminates against employers' ability to stand-down employees. Government incompetence in running the Australian economy is often the major factor in job losses, not employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A case in point is that the Keating-led recession forced employers to sack people. At least the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has been forced to amend the unfair dismissal section of the legislation to enable employers to have some confidence that if they give a job opportunity to young people then they also have the right to change the job opportunity in reasonable circumstances and changed financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the investment climate in Australia, which the government has placed so much emphasis upon. Investment has no firm basis for improvement. At a time when profits are rising, interest rates are lower, demand is increasing and business confidence has improved, the investment climate remains static. Unless there is a breakthrough from this investment drought, a growth rate of 4.5 per cent is most unlikely. If the past five years growth in investment were used as a guide, investment would only increase at 8.5 per cent in the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the evidence would suggest that there is a lot of faith and hope in the assumptions of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that investment will be the key to a recovery in job prospects. In world terms, Australia's living standards are not rising at a comparable rate with other Western nations. The fundamental question that needs to be asked is: why not? How come Australia is slipping down the standard of living ladder when the less well-endowed Asian nations are rapidly climbing the ladder of economic progress and prosperity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the observations of a conference convened by the Treasury in November 1993 to discuss the World Bank's report entitled the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">East Asia miracle, economic growth and public policy</EMPHASIS>. This seminar focused on the eight economies of Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to draw out some policy lessons for other economies and, of course, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">East Asian economies have enjoyed high and sustained rates of growth since the 1960s. Real growth average has been about 5.5 per cent since 1965. This growth has been underpinned by three key factors: firstly, high rates of investment, particularly by the private sector; secondly, high and rising endowments of human capital; and, thirdly, improved productivity. Obviously, these nations started from a very low standard of living where poverty was rife and the basic essentials were of a most primitive kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing a public policy to ensure continued growth, the World Bank noted that in this region the economic fundamentals of providing a stable macro-economic environment, along with a reliable legal framework to promote free enterprise activity, were very important. Obviously, in Australia, the Mabo High Court decision and the consequent parliamentary legislation have raised a major question over the stability of the legal environment for Australian and overseas investors. In terms of the public policy direction, the World Bank noted that the government intervened only when market forces had obviously failed; otherwise public policy encouraged market forces to allocate resources in the most efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Asian nations were driven by a clear government philosophy that it was important to export competitively. No real growth for the internal economy could be sustained unless export income provided the basis of this expansion. The seminar highlighted the role of central governments in cooperating with the private sector to bring about growth rather than developing the heavy hand of bureaucratic control and authority from a central government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education in Asia is the springboard to improving living standards in the 21st century. Whilst the current Labor government pays lip-service to education and training in Australia, there has not been a basic cultural shift of the Australian people towards recognising the intrinsic importance of education and training as the vital cog in advancing Australia's standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike Australia, the Asian nations place great emphasis on using their own savings to improve their productive capacity. Investment policies in East Asia relate to encouraging private investment in public infrastructure. Asian nations try to ensure that interest rates are at the lower end of the scale to encourage genuine business opportunities. The World Bank noted that some governments introduced mandatory pension schemes and restrictions on consumption, especially the use of credit for purely consumption purposes. The current Australian Labor government could well heed this lesson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, the former state Labor administrations of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria are worked examples of mind-boggling mismanagement of using credit for political and consumption purposes. These governments have no regard for the simple economic logic that, if governments spend more, people pay more taxes and there is less money left for private investment. The World Bank understood that the Asian tigers were not led by such mirages of instant prosperity at the hands of borrowings approved by the gnomes of Zurich based on Australia's fabulous and as yet untapped resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of labour markets, Australia is constrained by a centralised wage fixing system dominated by the union movement. One hundred years of a regulated and fixed labour market has done nothing to create jobs. However, in Asia the unregulated flexible labour market has seen a high level of job creation and a much more flexible wage structure. Changes to economic conditions have generally been more flexible in the Asian nations because of the labour market arrangements. In summary, the World Bank report estimates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high rates of investment and the rapidly growing human capital accounted for some 60 per cent of East Asian growth. Efficiency gains accounted for most of the rest. Interventionist policies had limited impact.</PARA>
<PARA>The present government should be aware of that particular policy position. The federal Treasurer could well heed this advice: the expenditure of over $6.1 billion over the next four years in an attempt to solve the unemployment problem will be a fruitless exercise if the success of Asian nations is any guide to what should be done in Australia's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Helen Hughes, who is the director of the full employment project sponsored by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University and the Institute of Public Affairs, has some very supportive comments to make on the World Bank report. In my view, Helen Hughes is a very sensible and respected commentator on employment and investment matters. She makes the observation that Singapore, which she has studied since 1965, has managed to solve its major unemployment problem. Its living standards have been transformed in one generation. Urban areas have full employment. Unemployment is below three per cent of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Hughes says that strong fiscal policies have been the foundation of East Asian stability and Singapore's success. Money supply was kept under control. Private borrowers were not crowded out of capital markets. As financial institutions and markets were established, low interest rate policies were pursued. Access to foreign funds was for highly productive public and private investment and not for consumption. This last view is a very key assessment of the success of the Asian nations. They did not borrow money from foreigners for consumption purposes which other Western nations, such as America and Australia, have done to their great disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Hughes also noted that the social welfare has not suffered by being kept out of the workplace. Emphasis on individual responsibility for welfare has contributed to high savings rates. While individual savings are the basis for social insurance, safety nets are being built for the poor but they are not associated with the workplace so that they do not impede economic flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 federal budget is in stark contrast to this position, in that 36 per cent of the budget expenditure relates to social security and welfare. As Helen Hughes so rightly points out, the green and white papers on jobs should have pointed the way by being about full employment&mdash;not about the preservation of unemployment. The thrust of the budget and the white paper is a stark reminder of the difference between the Australian Labor government and the more dynamic Asian governments which are seeking positive and constructive methods of creating jobs for their people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Singaporian Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Koh, summarised the attitude and policy position of the Asian nations in a succinct article to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News Weekly</EMPHASIS> on 15 January 1994. He espoused the 10 values that east Asia represented. The first was that east Asians believe in the extended family, community and nation&mdash;not individualism as practised in the west. The second was that east Asians believe in strong families. The third was that east Asians revere education. The fourth was that east Asians believe in the virtues of savings and frugality. The fifth was that east Asians consider work a virtue. The sixth was that east Asians practise national teamwork, and unions and employers view each other as partners&mdash;not as class enemies. The seventh was that there is an Asian version of a social contract between the people and the state. The eighth point made was that Asian governments attempt to make every citizen a stakeholder of the country; for instance, 50 per cent of Singapore citizens own shares. The ninth was that east Asians want their governments to maintain a morally wholesome environment in which to bring up their children. The final point was that good government in east Asia wants a free press but does not believe that such freedom is an absolute right. I ask the House: can Australia learn some lessons from its successful Asian neighbours?</PARA>

I think I heard him say that state Labor governments increased expenditure which caused an increase in taxes. The honourable member for Corangamite comes from the state of Victoria and he lives in a rural area. He should well know what is happening in Victoria. Under a state Liberal government which is applying the policies outlined in Fightback, expenditure has been drastically cut in Victoria, but taxes have gone up. Under the state Liberal government, the average family in Victoria is now paying in excess of $1,500 in additional taxes as a result of the state Liberal government's, whilst the educational services, ambulance services, kindergarten services, health services, et cetera are being slashed to bits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member said that Asia is the source of all our problems and that we should follow Asia. That is fascinating because Asia has massive tariffs. The average tariff regime in Asia is 50 per cent. Obviously, those on his side of politics support the increase in tariffs in Australia. He obviously supports wages of $3 an hour and he obviously supports massive cuts in education. That is where he is coming from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take Thailand as an example. Because of increased prosperity in Thailand and because the base wage is starting to rise, multinational firms are leaving because their wage levels are too high. It is $5 an hour. God help us! The other problem facing the Thai economy is that it lacks education. The highly skilled industries in South-East Asia can no longer operate because they do not have an educational base sufficient to train enough people. They do not have enough engineers, enough technologically trained people. So those opposite should not come in here and give us this nonsense about the magic pudding that is Asia. Asian countries still have major problems. We will not find any solutions to our problems by forcing people into poverty as many Third World countries do. That is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also listened with great interest to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). Into the debate he dragged roads&mdash;the bete noire of the National Party. He said that we have to spend more money on roads. That is fascinating. I could not help but hear what he was saying, and as I came into the chamber I thought that I must talk about roads in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government actually increased the amount of road funding granted to Victoria. What did Victoria do with it? Some $90 million went to the public transport system; it did not go into road building at all. Victoria picked up a bit of a bonus because of the changing relationship and had an excess $3 1/2 million for road funding in rural areas in Victoria. What did the government do with this extra money? It put it into consolidated revenue. I am happy to talk about roads and the approach of the National and Liberal parties towards road funding. Those opposite have a real problem because the Liberal state governments are applying the Fightback philosophy of the Australian Liberal and National parties in the states, and Victoria is the classic example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) talked about debt, taxes and the deficit&mdash;exactly the policies of Mr Jeffrey Kennett and Mr Stockdale in Victoria. When in opposition in 1992 the current Victorian government campaigned strongly and attacked the level of debt in Victoria. That is exactly what those opposite are doing. It said that it was going to cut debt. Since being in government, it has added $2.5 billion to the Victorian debt level. Why? It did this to sack people. In effect, it borrowed $2.5 billion and put 50,000 people in the public sector out of work. That is what those opposite support. It is all in Fightback. The Victorian government has borrowed money to sack people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened to the $2.5 billion worth of redundancies? A billion dollars has gone to Queensland. At no cost Queensland picked up the skilled management people that have been sacked by Kennett and Stockdale. As well it will have the benefit of their redundancy packages. Victoria is now faced with the additional debt of $2.5 billion. These are marvellous economics&mdash;really brilliant!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite speak a lot of nonsense when it comes to debt. They can read. They are not illiterate. They know that Australia has the lowest public sector debt in the OECD. Why can they not stand in this House and admit that public sector debt in Australia is low in any comparative sense. We have a high non-public sector debt, but who is responsible for that? It is the mates of those opposite who are responsible. The private sector does the borrowing, not the government. The high debt level is not government debt. It is the opposition's mates who borrow the money, not the government. Those opposite should not talk about public sector debt when they know it is the lowest in the OECD. In fact, if we take the gold reserves into account, the Commonwealth is in credit. Those opposite should talk commonsense in this place, not nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deficit is very important. Those opposite want a lower deficit, but they will not tell the Australian public what they are going to cut. They know and I know that if we want to lower the deficit we have to reduce services. We have to sack people, as the Victorians do, or we have to reduce education, health standards or benefits to the unemployed. That is what they are on about. That is what happens when the deficit is reduced. That is what has happened in Victoria. They have ripped into all of those areas.

We can expect cuts in education and cuts in health services. Will anyone in the opposition tell us what they will cut? No, but I live in hope. Then they say that they are going to cut debt.

We have lost jobs in rural schools. We have lost jobs in rural public administration, in the department of conservation and in the area of lands and forests. There have been massive job cuts in those areas in all rural parts of Victoria. For what purpose is this done? Already the Victorian budget is running in surplus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the corner of Castlereagh and Hunter streets in Sydney stands a monument to mark the site of the first Christian service in Australia. The preacher, the Reverend Richard Johnson, took as his text: `What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?' It is just a small stone obelisk hardly noticed by the thousands of passers-by and dwarfed by skyscrapers, yet its message of faith and hope is fundamental to our nation's success and the key to Australia's future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The congregation at that first service was poorer, sicker, and less trained than any conceivable group of modern Australians, yet there was nothing small about what they were to achieve. Our challenge, 200 years later, is to have hearts that are just as big. So at this opening of my time in parliament, I place on record my deep conviction that, nourished by the past and inspired by our great ideals, there is no limit to what Australia can achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I want to record my deep conviction that our Australian story should fill our hearts with pride and our eyes with tears. It is a story of the dispossessed and the outcast, redeemed through the innate goodness of humanity&mdash;a society challenged by nature, tested by war, enlarged by other cultures and blessed by such peace, prosperity and tolerance that we are now the envy of the earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost 100 years ago, the founders of our constitution echoed Richard Johnson's sense of gratitude when they instituted this mighty Commonwealth, yet they declared themselves, in the words of our constitution, to be` humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God'. We have so much, yet almost everything we have we owe to someone else. If I can achieve anything at all in this place, I will owe it to the people of Warringah who have sent me here. If I can amount to anything at all in our national life, I will be indebted to my great predecessors whose shoes I struggle to fill: Michael MacKellar, who stood for the humane and the decent; Edward St John, who never shirked a fight in a good cause; and Sir Percy Spender, one of our greatest statesmen and international public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bounded by water on three sides, boasting some of Sydney's largest tracts of urban bushland, containing a significant concentration of high technology industries, often set in green and open parks, Warringah is almost a Garden of Eden. Mackellar might be God's own country but Warringah is God's own garden. So it is my job to make more perfect what is already one of the best places in the world to live. In particular, it is my job first to help Warringah's 13,000 families with children who are heavily burdened by government policies and, second, to help find a solution to our transport problems which mean that Warringah is indeed the best place in the world to live, but only until you need to go somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When authority first came to the Warringah district, the inhabitants showed what they thought of government policies by spearing Governor Phillip in the shoulder. I hope I can be a similar goad to government, at least until such time as government serves my electorate better. One of the depressing features of modern Australia is the low esteem in which governments and politicians are generally held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after the by-election, some kind supporter gave me polling data which ranked the ethics and honesty of various occupations. Lawyers rated 30 per cent for ethics and honesty; stockbrokers ranked 15 per cent; and I was terrified to see that federal parliamentarians ranked just 10 per cent. Notwithstanding this, I feel very honoured to be here because newspaper journalists&mdash;my previous trade&mdash;scored just eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we politicians have mostly ourselves to blame because we have neglected what government does well to indulge in what government does badly. The best way to restore politicians' standing is to have governments which meddle less and lead more; to have governments which stick to their traditional job of providing transfer payments and sponsoring national development but which stop playing the busybody in every nook and cranny of society. Above all, we need governments which believe in Australia and Australians as much as in the trappings of office, the dictates of ideology or the minutiae of policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Loss of faith is a social problem extending far beyond politics and far beyond Australia. Throughout the Western world we are living through a pandemic of doubt and introspection in which people are questioning their God, their country and even themselves. Nothing is safe from the corrosive cynicism of modern times: neither political goodwill nor institutional benevolence nor even parental love. Our challenge is to answer uncertainty with conviction and to refute doubt with faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a matter of logical argument. No-one can be persuaded to believe. People must be inspired to believe; they must be picked up and carried along by other people&mdash;people who believe with heart and soul that no defeat is final, no unhappiness permanent and no evil invincible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modern Australia is rightly concerned about unemployment, crime, family breakdown and social disintegration. But we are becoming preoccupied with problems and not answers. We must see each problem in its true setting: unemployment together with the new opportunities of a better trained work force; crime against the background of the greater complexity of modern life; family pressure against the higher expectations of people living longer; and social alienation against greater individual rights. It is absolutely vital that we Australians keep seeking solutions to all the difficulties in our homes, workplaces and neighbourhoods. But the real antidote to fear is hope, and the difference between despair and confidence is often just the very decision to try to make a difference&mdash;a decision based on a balanced appreciation of our true position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first 180 years or so of our national life, Australian government was an exercise in nation building. Government directed work gangs, encouraged settlers and rewarded explorers. In more modern times, government has launched the immigration program, which has helped to make our society so diverse and exciting; it has established the Snowy Mountains Scheme, which powers our cities and waters our farms; it has funded the universities, which are the basis of our technological edge; and it has sponsored much of the national development, which is the foundation of our prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet some time in the recent past Australian government developed a strange affliction. Since Labor came to power in 1983, government has become a means for applying bandaids to social problems rather than an instrument for giving cohesion and purpose to our national life. Our government has policies to bring peace to Cambodia and to keep Antarctica clean. It has policies for unemployment and for making the sick well and the lame walk. But it has only bits and pieces of a policy to ensure that our nation will enter the next century in better shape than it is now. The government is like a householder who keeps fixing walls and mending floors, in a medley of styles often entirely at odds with the original design, plastering up the cracks without working out how the foundations are constantly shifting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the quest to solve social problems, government reaches into our schools, our workplaces and even our bedrooms. Government tells us what we should think, whom we should like and how we should feel. But it has by and large given up trying to touch our hearts and make us realise that we Australians are a great people with a great destiny. The best that this government can do to lift people's gaze above the humdrum is tear a corner off the flag, undermine the Crown and attack the very constitution itself. This is the opposite, the absolute opposite of nation building, because it is guaranteed to tear Australians apart rather than bring us together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet there is no mystery in Australia's needs or voters' wants. There is no secret about what governments should do. As Edmund Burke said, governments are human contrivances to satisfy human wants. People expect governments to work&mdash;and I hope honourable members opposite recognise these lines&mdash;`for the betterment of mankind, not just here but wherever we can lend a helping hand', as Ben Chifley said in his `light on the hill' speech. There are some things which only individuals can do; there are other things which only governments can do; and there are many things which people can do better, provided governments help. So let people run their own lives and let government do what individuals cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand for active government, not big government. I stand for government which gets off people's backs, not government which opts out of the future because it cannot face hard decisions. I stand for government which backs Australia's families with real policies and not just platitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government says that it is in favour of the family, all the time pursuing policies which make family life harder to sustain. At present, for instance, a single taxpayer on $30,000 a year after tax has about $445 a week to live on. A taxpayer on the same $30,000 a year but with a dependent spouse and two dependent children has just $495 a week to live on&mdash;and that is after tax, after the dependent spouse rebate and after family allowance. In other words, three extra people to clothe, feed, house, educate and transport and just $50 a week extra with which to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family policy needs to begin with a recognition that our existing tax and welfare system turns middle income families with children into Australia's new poor. Families are best helped not by argument over definitions but by policies which help the children&mdash;the children who are this country's greatest asset and our most golden hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way to help families with children is to change the tax system to take account of taxpayers' responsibilities as well as their income. A family-friendly tax system stresses self-help and individual responsibility. But the problem with income splitting, at least in its simplest form between husband and wife, is that it helps high income earners more than low income earners and couples without dependants as much as those with the responsibility for children. While voters have shown an innate mistrust of radical change to the tax system, everyone understands and hardly anyone objects to a cash payment. So one alternative to income splitting is to raise the current level of family allowances to such an extent that they become, in reality, a family wage; in other words, to pay the principal carers of children a substantial sum far in excess of current family allowance, a sum which acknowledges the real cost of raising children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paying the principal carer a family wage of, for argument's sake, $100 a week for the first child would virtually cover the cost of child care, if the principal carer wanted to continue in the paid work force. Alternatively, if the principal carer preferred to be a full-time mother or father, $100 a week would make a big difference to the family budget and quite possibly eliminate the need for both parents to work just to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many have a philosophical preference for tax splitting rather than a cash payment. But a family wage is quite different from welfare. It is a recognition of responsibilities, not need. It is a payment for services, not a handout. It means that personal choice could replace economic necessity as a rationale for family decisions. One beauty of a family wage system, unlike a tax rebate, is that it would take one public servant, just one, and a computer to administer. Payments would start the moment a birth is recorded on the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages database and finish 16 years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budgetary cost of introducing a family wage of $100 a week for the first child and $30 a week for each subsequent child would be about $7.5 billion a year. It is worth remembering that this was the approximate size of Labor's One Nation personal income tax cuts, which were to be funded entirely out of economic growth. The cost of not providing more help for families is more family breakdown, greater call on the welfare system, increased crime and further social instability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of families would be much better off under a family wage policy. For instance, a family with three children on $30,000 a year now receives just $30 a week in family allowance. Under a family wage policy, this family would receive $160 a week. The vast majority of families, those with two or fewer children, would be more than $90 a week better off. It is possible to help families in ways which involve no radical surgery to our system, ways which are financially responsible and ways which avoid debilitating debate about definitions. But it takes a government that is committed to the long-term welfare of society to do so rather than a government which is preoccupied with the short-term management of pressure groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments which live in fear of tomorrow's headline are incapable of any change&mdash;even change which gives the overwhelming majority of Australians exactly what they want. It is abundantly clear, for instance, that the people of Warringah are heartily sick of clogged roads. So I congratulate the New South Wales transport minister, Bruce Baird, for establishing a committee to investigate alternatives and to recommend a solution. It seems that a road tunnel under Military Road with a better crossing at The Spit can be built with just $30 million of taxpayers' money. By contrast, the most publicised mass transit system is estimated to require a taxpayer subsidy of some $600 million and is predicated on higher population densities in the peninsula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a tragedy for the people of Warringah if an anti-car mentality stopped development which would help all Warringah commuters, including those who travel on public transport, especially if that development does not require any extension of medium or high density housing to be financially viable and does not preclude the construction of a mass transit system. The government's job is not to lay rails, shift earth and pour concrete. The government's job is to make necessary development happen. Say the word and private enterprise will do the job and very possibly build and operate huge infrastructure projects at no cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians rightly object to higher taxes because they observe that most government spending disappears down a bottomless well. Government often seems like an evening out&mdash;it costs a fortune and in the morning there is little to show for all the expense. But it is my hunch that people would be less hostile to paying tax if they were more confident they were investing in lasting assets rather than $200,000 carports, $170,000 barbecues and $63,000 bicycle accidents. For most of Labor's decade, we have enjoyed the day by mortgaging the morrow. The $6.5 billion currently spent servicing the Commonwealth government's own debt could pay for a host of national development projects, including a Warringah mass transit system. </PARA>

The budget and the white paper are good for Australia, are good for my electorate of Leichhardt, are certainly good for the Far North Queensland region of Australia and are certainly good for the future generations of Australians and world visitors who will visit my electorate because the budget contained a Daintree rescue package which provided something of a sustainable future for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to the Daintree rescue package in the budget I take the opportunity to congratulate the new Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, who has done an excellent job in bringing this package to fruition. It is something that not only Senator Faulkner is concerned about but also I know the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself has a great deal of commitment to. He has visited the region and the particular area that is under threat. I know that the Prime Minister has a particular commitment to save this region of my electorate. I must also pay tribute to the cooperation of Mr Mike Berwick, the mayor of the Douglas shire, for his work in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But why did we have to rescue the Daintree in this budget anyway? The reason is that a vital area of the wet tropics region was not listed and included in the wet tropics. The National Party government, the notorious Bjelke-Petersen government, in the 1980s allowed subdivisions in the Cow Bay and Alexandra Bay area. After that, parts of the area were advertised&mdash;and are still advertised today&mdash;to `Buy your own piece of rainforest'. Many well-meaning people actually did that. Subsequent events meant that the Commonwealth government has had to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government is totally committed to the preservation of the wet tropics region of Far North Queensland. The Daintree region can be considered as the birthplace of the world's flowering plants. It was from this region that the world's flowering plants evolved and then spread to the rest of the planet. I think the people in this House have seen posters and films of the natural beauty of the wet tropics of Far North Queensland, if they have not already visited it themselves, and I know that many honourable members have visited it. Everyone is aware that this is where the rainforest meets the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rainforests are very significant, not just for all these reasons. In addition, the biodiversity of rainforests is also important to preserve the world's gene pool. The Labor government has been committed to preserving the Far North Queensland wet tropics rainforest. Most importantly, in 1988 the whole region was nominated for World Heritage listing. That again was opposed by the National Party. Subsequently, the Commonwealth with the Queensland government set up the World Heritage Management Authority. The Commonwealth has previously given $1.5 million to the authority for the purchase of seven properties and the redevelopment of the Alexandra range lookout. So we had previously made these commitments before this budget. We also funded the reconstruction of the Cape Tribulation road in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Heritage listing was so successful that it now can be said that the wet tropics, in particular the area north of the Daintree to Cape Tribulation, is being loved to death. The road, which had to be sealed for environmental reasons as much as anything else, will obviously increase visitor traffic. Infrastructure&mdash;such as roads, walking tracks, toilets and interpreting facilities&mdash;has not kept up with the rapid visitor growth in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the World Heritage listing it has been increasingly clear that there is a hole in the heart of the wet tropics&mdash;that is, the Cow Bay and Alexandra Bay area that I referred to&mdash;where small pockets of enormous ecological significance are vulnerable. Visitors to the wet tropics&mdash;visitors from overseas and other parts of Australia&mdash;are horrified by the `For sale' signs right along the Cape Tribulation road and especially in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the people who moved into that area in the 1980s are generally committed environmentalists. They did not move into that area to destroy it. Nevertheless, we do need a rescue package in that area, and I congratulate the government on its initiative in the budget. But, importantly, the rescue package will not only have money for infrastructure and buyback&mdash;it is not just a buyback scheme&mdash;but also look towards cooperative agreements involving the Douglas Shire Council, the wet tropics and land-holders. Suggestions have been made that there may be a possible rebate given on rates in relation to preserving the area. Currently, the reverse occurs: you can reduce your rates by clearing the land. That is not a situation which ought to continue. I think that the chairman of the Douglas shire, Mr Mike Berwick, is aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package is of enormous significance. It is important that the rescue package and the fine detail of it be finally determined with community consultation. The Commonwealth has provided $20,000 to the Douglas Shire Council to develop strategies for this region. The package has the overwhelming support of the people in the region. It was totally supported by the Daintree Rainforest Chamber of Commerce. It is worth quoting a letter that was written to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> by Dr Hugh Spencer, which appeared in last Saturday's edition. Dr Spencer is a tireless worker for the preservation of the rainforest and is the Director of the Australian Tropical Research Foundation at Cape Tribulation. It is worth reading his response into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because it is very significant:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only hope springing from this most welcome development&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he means the rescue package&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the next major change in the new and improved Daintree will be a heightened sense of community, which will give strength to those fearing the proposed tourist onslaught, and perhaps bring out the enormous wealth of skills and knowledge that lies hidden in the region. In this regard, the efforts of Ross Craig, headmaster of the Alexandra school, should get wide support.</PARA>
<PARA>I would endorse that notion. It can be seen that the decision to fund the rescue package in the budget was a most significant one. It is one that has obtained praise for the government from the conservation movement right throughout Australia. It is one that has obtained praise for the government right throughout my electorate because there is a general consensus in my electorate on the importance that the preservation of the wet tropics region, and in particular that region north of the Daintree River, has for the tourism industry. There is an enormous amount of tourist interest in that area. People come to Far North Queensland to visit the Great Barrier Reef, but increasingly they are also coming to visit the wet tropics region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget, not only because of the rescue package but also because of the general thrust of the white paper, is very good for my electorate in terms of regional development. The white paper, as I said, provides an excellent blueprint for future regional development in Australia. The recent McKinsey report and the Kelty report referred to the growth that has occurred in Far North Queensland. There is no doubt about that, and I think that the government ought to take credit for it. It is interesting that people are very quick to blame the federal government for the regional decline in some areas of Australia. The converse of that, of course, is that the government should be congratulated on encouraging development in Far North Queensland through the Daintree rescue package, which has encouraged sustainable development in Far North Queensland. The prospects are that the white paper will continue that sustainable development. Both the McKinsey and the Kelty reports highlight the need for future infrastructure development in Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compared to other regions, in some ways we are very well served. Everyone knows about the Cairns airport. The McKinsey report highlights the reason why Cairns has such a progressive and vigorous international airport. It is because of the work that took place between all sectors of the community: the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau, the local councils, and the chamber of commerce. In the 1980s the whole community got behind getting an airport for Cairns. There was public sector involvement; the airport is still run by the port authority. Some people say it is a privatised airport; I am not sure whether that is a proper description of it but it is certainly not run by the FAC. It may provide a model in the future for other airport development in Australia. As I say, I am not sure whether it is a privatised airport, because the public sector has been a vital part of its development. The McKinsey report highlights the good things we have, but it also highlights the need for future infrastructure development in Far North Queensland, as did the Kelty report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the roads in my electorate are not good. There is still need for development of the Bruce Highway to Cairns and in the north of my electorate, in the Cape York Peninsula. Only a couple of weeks ago I was in the Torres Strait islands, where the roads are appalling, so there is still need for road development. We have good port facilities but they constantly need to be kept up to date with the rest of Australia. That is also important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Kelty and McKinsey&mdash;remember that the McKinsey report is not just some sort of academic subjective report by some pie-in-the-sky academic; it was formed by talking to business people&mdash;highlighted the need in Far North Queensland for educational facilities and cultural facilities. I am very pleased to note that today there was an announcement about the plans for the new convention centre in Cairns. A convention centre is very important not only for the future development of the tourism industry in Far North Queensland but also for the cultural development of Far North Queensland. The other point that I usually try to include in every speech I make in this House is the importance of the development of the Smithfield campus of James Cook University in Cairns. It is very important that Cairns develop its own university campus for the reasons I have said&mdash;not just for educational reasons but for the cultural spin-off that is brought to a region by a university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these things make the future for the region that I represent look very rosy indeed. Those doomsayers in the opposition who keep on saying that Australia is going down a path towards economic decline ought to look at Far North Queensland, ought to look at the cooperation that is highlighted by the McKinsey report between the private sector and the public sector, and ought to look at the growth and optimism that is shown by business in the region. In conclusion, I totally support the bill before the House because not only the budget but also the white paper will provide a foundation for Australia's continued growth into the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess when we all heard the Treasurer (Mr Willis) deliver his first budget this year we filed out of the House thinking it was a well politically crafted budget that handed around a lot of money and did not upset any people. When we got back to our rooms and started to analyse what the budget meant, we got a totally different picture. To me, this year's budget is the most dishonest and deceptive budget I have ever seen. I would like to illustrate that point. In the opening paragraph of the budget the Treasurer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget that I present tonight will . . . reduce the budget deficit, without increasing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 2 he again talked about not increasing taxes when he said that in achieving the budget deficit outcome `we have not increased general taxation'.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bruce Scott" NAMEID="YT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr Bruce Scott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He misled the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think we could get anything plainer than that. In the next sentence he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Budget contains no new taxes and no increases in tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA>In the following sentence he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only measures which add to revenue are those which improve tax compliance, or are directly related to cost recovery for government services.</PARA>
<PARA>In that sentence we can see that he is already starting to shift ground. We got back to our rooms and we read that PAYE tax collections this coming year will increase by a very substantial 8.1 per cent, that sales tax collections will increase by eight or 10 per cent and that fringe benefits tax will increase this year by an absolutely massive $1,830 million&mdash;an increase of 131 per cent. If that is not a tax increase, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is riddled with tax increases. In fact, the increased tax collections this year will be the greatest in a decade or more. It is quite staggering that the Treasurer, who we thought was a person of some integrity, can fall so short on his promises in the first couple of pages. I can point to numerous tax increases. On page 13 of the budget statement the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this Budget increases cost recovery by $25.3 million, via an increase in the excise on avgas and avtur . . .</PARA>
<PARA>These fuels are used particularly in country areas of Australia. That increase will put upward pressure on airline ticket prices for airlines such as Hazelton that fly into my electorate, and it will put upward pressure on freight increases where goods are transported by air&mdash;a clear increase in a tax, if ever there was one. The Treasurer on page 12 of his speech said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 January 1995 the departure tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is on people flying out of Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be replaced by a $27 charge for international passengers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The charge is presently $25 and it is going up to $27&mdash;a clear increase in tax. I guess that is a fairly minor increase. After the performance of the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) in question time today, where he clearly misled the House, I went back to see what he said about this. Would honourable members believe&mdash;I have his press release here&mdash;that on the very same day the budget was brought down, 10 May 1994, he put out a press release? Guess how the press release is headed&mdash;`Abolition of departure tax'. We had just heard from the Treasurer in the budget that the departure tax was to be increased from $25 to $27 and the minister issued a press release, on the very same day, headed `Abolition of departure tax'. I will read the first two paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Minister for Tourism, Michael Lee, today welcomed the Budget decision to abolish the departure tax.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bruce Scott" NAMEID="YT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr Bruce Scott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He increased it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For heaven's sake, he has increased it. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be replaced by a new international passenger movement charge which will be more convenient for travellers.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps it will be more convenient for travellers, but to head his press release `Abolition of departure tax' is nothing more nor less than dishonest and deceptive. There is a classic example of where the Treasurer and the Minister for Tourism, I believe, have misled the House. In the area of health, the Treasurer, on page 9 of his speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a further&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is not ongoing expenditure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$500 million will be provided over five years to expand and extend Aboriginal health programs.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us be quite clear about this: a further $500 million will be provided to expand and extend Aboriginal health programs. What is the clear impression left in the minds of members of this chamber and the Australian people after a statement like that? Access Economics has done an analysis of this supposed extra $500 million for the Australian Medical Association and others have done their own analysis. One estimate by Access Economics is that about $415 million of that is just ongoing expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we take out this little fiddly trick of announcing the figure over five years and reducing it down to one year, the $85.5 million extra comes down to $17.1 million in one year. I even read another analysis that $12 million out of the $17 million had been pinched from the health budget. We had Senator Richardson, as he then was, on TV night after night travelling northern Australia to find out for the first time what conditions were like in Aboriginal camps around Australia, all but weeping tears of blood saying that this is a disgrace for Australia. After 10 years in government, he was saying that this was a disgrace. There is no doubt it is. He promised $1,087 million over five years. Of course, when he stepped out of the job and handed over to the present Minister for Health (Dr Lawrence), it was to be $800 million over five years. That was soon watered down by the Expenditure Review Committee to $300 million. Then the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stepped in because it was becoming so embarrassing and it was artificially lifted to this level of $500 million, which turns out to be about $85 million over five years or $17 million extra a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think after all this hoo-ha and fanfare that something would be done properly for Aboriginal health. Not only has this government ditched the original proposal that it received all the credit for but it has created a very cruel illusion amongst Aboriginal people that there is going to be extra money spent. The first National Indigenous Conference on Alcohol and Drug Abuse to be held in Australia cried out for assistance and asked the government what it could do. What did the government come up with? It came up with absolutely no support whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the crux of Aboriginal health in this country compared with the health of the rest of us? A figure that highlights it more than any other is the fact that young Aboriginal males have a death rate 10 times higher than the comparable group in society. Why is this? If we had to pull out one cause, I guess everybody in this chamber would turn to alcohol and substance abuse. Here we have the first National Indigenous Conference on Alcohol and Drug Abuse being given no support when it was asked for. I think the government falls down there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another cruel illusion in the Treasurer's speech was in the area of medical research and breast cancer. In many ways, this was the cruellest hoax of all. Again, most of us filed out of the chamber with the impression that many more millions of dollars&mdash;if not hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;would be spent on a major attack on breast cancer with increased funding for research. One figure mentioned was $209 million over four years for a national breast cancer program. Again, when we look at the figures, we see that it is a cruel deception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1994 the National Health and Medical Research Council will receive $117.11 million. Next year that will be boosted to $127 million once the ongoing funding component is taken out. So it is barely getting another $9 million or $10 million. When inflation is taken into account and the fact that it cannot even keep up with the administration costs, virtually not one more real dollar will be spent in this area. The people of Australia have been deceived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present we are spending $1.4 million on breast cancer research. That is about one per cent of the total health research budget. Despite newspaper articles that were written in Australia about increases on breast cancer research, I cannot see one extra real dollar being spent in this critically needed area unless the priorities are rejigged by those who determine them. There was an announcement that a national breast cancer centre would be set up&mdash;or, as the minister describes it, `a national breast cancer clinic'. A total of $16.4 million over four years will be put aside to develop this area. As the Minister for Human Services and Health says, `This year's federal budget features a major attack on breast cancer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we start to look at this centre, clinic, or whatever it is, nobody can give us any answers. This has come totally out of the blue. None of the experts in this area know anything about it whatsoever. They have already been quizzed by the parliamentary committee that is looking into the treatment of breast cancer and not one expert knows anything about it. For example, Professor Judith Whitworth, who heads the medical research committee, has grave concerns about how this money will be spent. There are no patients for this centre, no research has been done by the centre, and we do not even have a venue for the centre. The centre will apparently have no connection with any hospital in Australia where research is being done. So the question has to be asked: what will the centre do? So far we have been told that it will collect and distribute the research that has already been done. The mind absolutely boggles&mdash;$16.4 million, money that is desperately needed for breast cancer research, will be spent in this fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this, a breast cancer fundraising foundation will be set up. Again, none of the hundreds of experts on breast cancer research around Australia has been consulted about this or seems to know about it. An amount of $3 million over three years is to be put aside for this. We are told that it will be headed up by the Prime Minister's wife, Annita Keating. Perhaps that is a good idea. I do not know. When I first heard about it, I thought that it had all the hallmarks of a political exercise a la Hillary Clinton. The government is spending only $1.4 million on research. Suddenly it plucks $16.4 million out of the air for a breast cancer centre or clinic, to do nobody knows what, and $3 million out of the air for a foundation. I hope the government is more forthcoming on details, because I would not like to see desperately needed funds in this area frittered away for improper reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on the matter of health, let us cast our minds back to the period before the last election of March 1993. The government won by telling the people a lot of fibs or by not telling them what it was going to do. The Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, as he then was, promised $25 million for each year over four years to reduce the number on hospital waiting lists. There are between 100,000 and 120,000 people in this country waiting to get into hospitals for operations such as hip replacements. What happened after the election? Senator Richardson, as he then was, was called before Estimates Committee C two months after the election and asked when this money would be forthcoming. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I do propose to make sure it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the $100 million&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is efficiently spent in reducing waiting lists.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know what happened to that promise. It is another one that has gone by the board&mdash;yet another broken promise by this government. It is very sad to see this sort of thing happen, particularly when it involves people's health. If the government has no intention of doing these things, I say to it, `For goodness sake, don't make the promises in the first place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It particularly concerns me and my electorate that the government cut federal road funding in the budget. In the budget brought down in August last year, federal road funding was cut from $1,600 million to $1,000 million, which was a big enough cut. But what has happened in this year's budget?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has gone down again by another $200 million to $800 million. In effect, the money that will be spent on federal roads in this country will be halved within a two-year period or less. This will continue forever. As I go around the countryside, people are telling me that they are concerned about the land acquisition fund for which $1,500 million will be given to the Aboriginal population. Is this another cruel hoax? We cannot find too much in the budget about it. People ask me how the government will pay for this $1,500 million which has been plucked out of the air. I can point to an area where it will be paid for quite easily. Within two years it will be paid for by the reduction in road funding. In the next two years, five years or 10 years there will be hundreds of millions, if not thousands of millions, of dollars saved in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money could be spent on roads in my area such as Kidman Way, between Hillston, Cobar and Bourke, where there are nearly 200 kilometres of unsealed roads; the north-south highway that travels through Broken Hill to Tibooburra and on into Queensland is desperately in need of sealing; and we need crossings at the Georgina River in Queensland. The east-west highway, which is now sealed between Bourke and Brewarrina, needs at least another $3 1/2 million for sealing east of Brewarrina. Another road needs upgrading urgently between Dubbo and Newcastle&mdash;a vital road link from inland New South Wales to the eastern seaboard. I ask: how can state governments, whose budgets are being cut back on a yearly basis, afford to pay for these things when the federal government will not pay for them? It is an absolute disgrace that the federal road budget has been cut by half. It should be headlines right across Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said `Mr Deputy Speaker'. How could I dare speak without addressing you, sir. Mr Deputy Speaker, to suggest that federal roads funds have been cut by half in this current budget is a patent untruth, and those opposite know it to be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the overall budget. When I speak about the budget this evening, I am referring to the budget and the white paper that was presented to this chamber on 4 May 1994. The budget before us is a sound and solid budget. It is a budget that builds on the progress and past pain of industry restructuring and recession. Many Australian families have shared in that pain and difficulty, as have many that have been involved in the process of restructuring our industry, seeking out new markets with more competitive products and looking at ways of improving our productivity and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget has been well received by employees and employers alike. I do not think I can recall a budget that has been better received than the current budget. The general feeling in the community is that it is a positive budget that builds upon the progress made in recent times. It can see the major thrusts of the budget and the measures to maintain and accelerate growth in the economy. There is recognition of the needs of regions, and it provides incentives to small and medium businesses to become more efficient and expand and to seek out new markets for imports as well as exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a determination in the thrust of the budget to provide employment opportunity and independence to the long-term unemployed. There is the provision of the national land fund and Aboriginal health programs. Overall, these items will involve new expenditure of $1.2 billion in 1994-95 and $7.1 billion over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If one looks quickly across the main features of the budget, one sees that this is the first budget in the history of this nation that has been introduced prior to the commencement of the financial year to which it relates. That is an excellent move. It brings the national public accounts into line with the major industrial countries and with normal private sector practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget deficit of $11.7 billion is a decrease from the budget of the year expiring, which is expected to be $13.6 billion. The rate of economic growth is forecast at 4 1/2 per cent, which compares with the anticipated and known four per cent that is occurring in the current financial year. The budget deficit will fall to 0.9 per cent, or less than one per cent of gross domestic product, by 1996-97 compared with previous estimates of 1.2 per cent. Unemployment will reach 9.5 per cent by June 1995 compared with 10.3 per cent, which is the existing level. The Working Nation policies that are referred to&mdash;the white paper that was presented to this parliament on 4 May&mdash;provide for expenditure of $6.5 billion over four years, partially funded by a real drop in social security spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The white paper provides $169 million over four years in the area of mental health; $209 over the next four years for the national breast cancer campaign; $63 million over the next four years to help the homeless find accommodation; and $135 million over the next six years for athlete preparation for the 2000 Olympics. An important measure in the transport area is the reduction in the level of excise by almost 2c per litre. A drop in the level of excise on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene will considerably ease and relieve the shipping and mining industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The budget reflects that this nation and the economy are strongly into recovery and experiencing a rate of economic growth that is faster than almost any other industrial country. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) summarised it very well in presenting the budget when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget that I present tonight will:</PARA>

<PARA>We have noticed since the night the budget was presented that there has been some argument, particularly from the opposition, about the rate of increasing business investment in the coming year. We expect it to increase by 14.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to see what other major spokespersons in the private sector are saying. The National Australia Bank is predicting an increase in business investment of 17 per cent; Bankers Trust predicts an increase of 15 1/2 per cent; and CS First Boston predicts an increase of 14 per cent. If anything, the 14 1/2 per cent appears to be a very safe estimate for an increase in business investment in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Similarly, the 4 1/2 per cent growth rate in the economy is based on the government's expectation that business will start investing. I believe that business has opportunities in the growing economy, where there is increasing demand, a stable set of interest rates and a stable inflation rate. Industrial disputes are at their lowest level in 20 and 30 years. This is an ideal climate for an increase in the level of business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The special measures that encourage and assist small to medium businesses to improve their performance have been long overdue. We in the Hunter region, which links to the central coast region of New South Wales, have long wanted to see these measures implemented. The major cry that comes from small businesses is their difficulty in getting finance and equity through people investing in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help repeating what I hear so much from small businesses in our region: banks really are about lending to safe risks; banks are about large businesses, not about small businesses. If you are a small business person and you have any level of risk, the bank does not want to know you. I have seen such cases in recent times. I noticed that the National Australia Bank had an enormous increase in profit. I am also aware of the National Australia Bank's ruthless treatment of some of my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business people have been through a very tough period. Any business getting through this tough period of recession has proven that it has the resource, the capacity and the level of management to get through. The ruthless treatment of small business people by some banks underlines the need to ensure that we give special recognition to the financial needs of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included in the measures mentioned in the white paper is the liberalisation arrangements for infrastructure bonds, extending them to new industry sectors and picking up matters relating to sewerage and the provision of water related services. That is in addition to aviation and the other measures mentioned previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure that should be able to help small to medium businesses considerably is the improvement of the conditions attaching to pooled development funds. Pooled development funds must invest in small and medium sized companies that have total assets of not more than $50 million. The main constraints on a pooled development fund's investments are that the pooled investment fund must invest by way of newly issued ordinary shares; invest in companies that will establish a new business, substantially expand production or supply capacity or expand and develop markets; and not invest in retail operations or property development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attractions to investors to lodge or deposit moneys in those pooled development funds are that the pooled development funds are taxed at 15 per cent on profits derived from investment in small and medium sized businesses and 25 per cent on profits derived elsewhere. One has to underline the point that income derived by investors from selling shares in pooled development funds is exempt from income tax. Unfranked pooled development fund dividends in the hands of shareholders in a pooled development fund are exempt from tax. Franked pooled development dividends are also exempt unless shareholders elect to be taxed on the dividends through the imputation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those financial measures will go a long way to helping funds to be available to small to medium businesses. There is an easing of the administrative and compliance costs faced by industry, helping small firms to gain access to finance. There is up to a $5,000 grant to help exporters seek expert advice in organising finance for exports. There is better provision of information to business about government services available to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Hunter region we are well ahead of the game with the establishment of the Industry Development Centre as a single contact point for all the advice that one needs about growing one's business, access to government programs and where one gets information on best practice, work change training, quality assurance and all of the matters related to improving the efficiency and performance of one's business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also provide specific measures to assist employers to take up other white paper initiatives relating to the services provided to businesses by the Commonwealth Employment Service by providing targeted assistance to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the area of long-term unemployed and making sure that people get access to employment. In the little time that is available to me because of the limited time for debate on the budget I want to express my very strong support for the preference being given to long-term unemployed and to the introduction of the job compact and the enhanced wage subsidies to employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very little reason now for many public authorities and many major and medium employers not to take on people who have been long-term unemployed. There is very little reason for them not to be embracing the youth training allowance initiative or the national training wage. The level of assistance is from $120 per week up to $260 per week to assist in the employment of people under that national training scheme. They ought to be assisting those people and employing more staff. There is very little reason for them not to be indulging and engaging in the employment of additional staff and giving people who have not had the chance to work a chance to get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter I mention is the provision in respect of regional development. Both the best practice program and the regional infrastructure program provide an opportunity for regions to get in there and improve the performance of local government and to share and participate in regional projects that will enhance the performance of the region as a whole and not be simply a matter of pulling out the bottom drawer and dragging out one's best projects or one's pet projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the government on providing access to the Veterans' Entitlements Act for wartime merchant mariners. This has been almost a 50-year struggle. There are only about 3 1/2 thousand of them left, but at last, after that long time, we are righting the wrong. I commend the government for it. I look forward to making my remarks in respect of that legislation when it comes before the chamber. I commend the budget to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) leaves the chamber, I thought we might have a quick discussion on the impassioned remarks about road funding that he made at the beginning of his speech. For the record, for a reason that I think he tried to explain, the budget figure for expenditure on roads, which the Commonwealth now limits to its own expenditures on national highways, is of the order of $800 million. Of course, as he points out, there is now also an allocation of funding to the states in their general purpose grant&mdash;identified for their road expenditures&mdash;of approximately $350 million. If we stop the equation there, the arguments of the honourable member for Shortland are basically correct. Notwithstanding the huge increases in government tax on fuel, expenditure on roads is about the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the honourable member for Shortland failed to tell the House is that when we get down to the final overall funding by the Commonwealth of state governments we find that it has been reduced by about $300 million. Overall, the states have got less. They are now faced with the dilemma of having less money and are asking themselves where they must spend that $350 million. It is in general purpose funding. They have no obligation to actually spend it on roads, although the Commonwealth said, `That's what we gave it to you for.' That is what he is carrying on about. He is blaming the states&mdash;when the government is starving them to death! With less money, they have to answer the parents who want schooling and the people who want health care and hospitals. The simple fact is that it is an exercise with mirrors. The simple fact is that the road system will suffer because of the overall reduction in funding to the states. That is the truth of the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my contribution tonight I want to look at the 1980s and the early 1990s. Fundamentally, that 10 years from the early 1980s to now was the period of the Labor administration throughout Australia in state and federal government. The one common factor between all of those areas is financial mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Dobie, the voters in your state of New South Wales were the first to realise what was going on. They sacked that government and installed a Liberal state government, which immediately found itself highly unpopular as it commenced to sort out the mess in public transport, the mess on the wharves&mdash;the mess wherever people looked&mdash;and the financial mismanagement which had more to do with putting people's photographs up around the place telling them how much of the public's money they were spending. It is fundamental to these administrations that they measure excellence by expenditure. The simple fact is that New South Wales was the first group to recognise this financial mismanagement. Of course, it sacked that government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, the people of Victoria have eventually recognised the outrageous fiscal mismanagement of successive Labor governments under Cain and Kirner. Today the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) railed against Jeff Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, saying that he has killed off 70,000 jobs. But it was the previous Labor administration that killed off those 70,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the honourable member for Dunkley from time to time that the Victorian government did not adopt appropriate financial measures with respect to the public transport area. It sold its trams rather than reorganising its work force. It also sold all the rolling stock on its railways. Today the people of Victoria pay rent of about $800 million a year to Japanese financial institutions in order to rent rolling stock which their parents paid for through their taxes. That is just what happened in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia had another approach called the WA Inc. An estimated $1,000 million was paid out to entrepreneurs and crooks by successive Labor governments. They encouraged their union friends to bank with them, but they then had to spend hundreds of millions of dollars bailing that bank out so that the church, the unions and others could recover their money. Who paid for that? It was the taxpayers. Who waited for schools, roads and all these other things while that exercise went on? It was the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the situation in South Australia. What a mess that was! Politicians with no business background simply wanted to be bank managers and amongst the high-fliers, but they blew the state's economy to shreds. While these successive Labor administrations in all those states conducted their affairs so badly, they were never remonstrated with by this federal government. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was Treasurer, we asked him about corruption with respect to WA Inc. But he did not want to know about it, even though he knew all about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While all of these things have been going on in the states, there has been this charade that somehow or other things are better here in the Commonwealth. Let us have a look at the fundamentals. I have a business background and I quite frequently find myself having to convince those bank managers who are so frequently criticised in this place that I am worthy of a loan. I appreciate their questions because they know whether or not the proposed amount can be repaid. They know that I cannot rely on the hard work of 17 million Australians. I have to do it on my own. These bank managers are very interested in my bottom line. They are interested in how things will look at the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a quick look at the bottom line of this budget. The government will have to be a lot more honest with the bank manager than it has been with the Australian public. The bottom line is minus $11,700 million. Business would consider this form of borrowing a loss. The accumulated losses are $95,000 million. There is an interest bill of close to $7,000 million, which is outrageous when one considers how much that money could do for the needy of this country instead of being paid to the bankers and the money lenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at that bottom line of $11.7 billion. That is achieved after selling $2.5 billion of the family silver and knocking off substantial assets which will probably be substantially owned by foreign investors. The Leader of the House, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), was boasting about his sale of CSL. But what did we read in this morning's paper? The maximum allocated, which was 20 per cent, has gone to foreign institutions. The recipients of all the compulsory superannuation that the government rips off small business did not bother to buy. Obviously, a few mums and dads got in there, but the simple fact is that CSL has been sold to foreign investors and our other assets will also end up in the hands of foreign investors. That will contribute to our current account deficit, as Ross Gittins pointed out today. For decades we have been balancing our trade account&mdash;exports of goods and services versus imports of goods and services. But every month we spend between $1,000 million and $2,000 million in order to pay our existing interest bill to the rest of the world and to pay the dividends on their investments in us. So the bottom line has added to it $2 1/2 billion due to the sale of the family silver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another sleight of hand. We are going to bring forward into this budget an extra quarterly payment of $3 billion in company tax. In future years, unless the government brings forward another quarterly payment in the next year, that tax will fall away. The government can only go so far with that particular proposal. That in itself is probably the greatest attack on the other fundamental of this budget, which is industry investment. If the government rips an extra $3 billion off the corporate sector, where will it find the money to invest? Clearly, it is a contradiction. More importantly, another $1 billion is being grabbed out of the fringe benefits tax system. We heard some pretty funny explanations from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) today. We all know that people can be volunteer workers but, if they are given free rent in a house, that is subject to FBT. But he did not even know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are some pretty optimistic growth expectations. There is nothing wrong with growth; I welcome growth. The budget tells us that it will be 4 1/2 per cent. What is driving it? It is not business investment because we have just learnt that that is dreadful. It was negative in the last quarter. It is being driven by government expenditure. The figure of $11.7 billion in borrowings and spending is about three per cent of GDP. The sale of those government assets is another 0.5 per cent of GDP. So 3 1/2 per cent of the government's growth is coming out of its own expenditure. It is like a businessman going down the road, borrowing $100,000, banking it and then going to his bank manager and saying, `I am travelling pretty well; my turnover is up by 90,000 grand.' But it is down by 100,000 grand because he has injected borrowed money. There is no difference between the way the government is run and the way a business is run in that regard. It is an outrageous situation to argue that we are travelling so well when 75 per cent of the growth is coming from money borrowed by government at the cost of future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the selfish approach being supported in this parliament. The honourable member for Shortland said that the people of Australia like this budget. Of course they do. They do not understand that their kids have to pay for the generosity of the Prime Minister and his Treasurer (Mr Willis). These people pat themselves on the back and say, `We're into social justice. We're putting a couple of hundred million dollars away for land for Aboriginals. It makes you feel good.' But what they are not saying is that kids who do not even vote yet will have to pay the money off. That is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is outrageous that politicians are prepared to do that to future generations. It is outrageous that this generation has become so selfish that it is happy to let its children pay for the $60,000 million additional debt that this government has incurred since it came to office and got into the business of borrowing money to buy votes. It is a shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the next speaker in this debate is prepared to admit that it is a shame. I doubt it. The honourable member will get up and stick her chest out and say, `We have performed a miracle. We have kept taxes where they were.' That is a fib. She will say, `We have given all these things. We have got this wonderful process of natural justice. We have proposed this wonderful process of looking after the unemployed with $6 billion over the next few years.' It will all be funded by the kids of Australia. If you are proud of that, stand up and say so. I am not. It is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the situation is worse than that, because we are not going anywhere. We talk about growth and taking the entire growth dividend in taxes; we forget that growth itself puts demands on government. We cannot have growth and not build new roads. We cannot have growth and not build new powerhouses. Where does that money come from? The government is paying off the debts of the past. There is no proper commitment in this budget to infrastructure. It is about buying votes and I do not know whether there is an absolute commitment to the end result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It gets worse than that. Where does the government expect the growth to come from? It keeps telling us that small business is going to get it out of trouble. Today we heard the Treasurer explain all the wonderful initiatives in the budget. It is a load of rubbish! He read the list of initiatives and the honourable member for Shortland repeated it. They are all attempts to fix the problem at the margin. None of them do anything to fix the fundamental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House some examples. We will have the situation of pooled development funds which have to invest in small and medium enterprises. About half of those small and medium enterprises are not even incorporated, so how can a pooled development fund buy shares in them? How can the business angels become partners? How can the Commonwealth  Development  Bank  take equity in a partnership and have the total responsibility for all the debts, the joint and several liability that comes from being in a partnership? It cannot do it. The government has not fixed that yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1989 the government has been trying to put a small business corporation together that little businesses can use. It has never achieved that. It introduced a closed corporation bill in the Senate and a bipartisan committee laughed it out of the room. It was more complex than what we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the government do in the budget? The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has said he is going to lower the cost of entry for people getting into small business corporate structures. What happened? This budget put those costs up by 20 per cent. The government has not yet created a vehicle whereby very small businesses can attract equity but it has two theories as to where the money will come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the medium sized enterprises? They have problems too. They are corporations but they have not got a market. With the way the regulatory structures have been created for the Stock Exchange, these enterprises need hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, just to be listed. Where can a small to medium sized enterprise attract equity capital when a market is required but the entry cost is probably more than it has ever had in cash. Why has the government not done something about that so that these other processes can work on their own with no help from government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) make that point. The role of government is to create the structures and finance will find a way in. The same applies to small business. Let it get out there and multiply. It is a bit like the AIDS debate. The government says, `Go out and multiply but do not forget your condom.' The condom, of course, is increasing taxes and increasing regulation. The government has doubled them in the last five years. It has hit small business with the most outrageous arrangements in terms of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest insult this parliament has ever thrown at the small business community, the people the government is imploring to get it out of its financial mismanagement, was to say that they had to have unfair dismissal provisions in the law. Why insult small business people? Nobody values their workers more than small business people. They seldom sack anybody unless, of course, they are totally inadequate in the workplace. They are desperate to get good people and they do everything in their power to keep them. So why put them in a situation where the hopeless and the malingerers cannot be sacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of honourable members run businesses. Some 90 per cent of people who leave my business come and say they are leaving.

We as a government have recognised the need for clear information about personal health issues supported by research; that women want to participate in decision making and have ownership of their own personal health; and that health services must acknowledge women's emotional, social and physical needs and, above all, take them seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have announced a rapid expansion of the national breast screening program. We have committed $236.6 million over the next five years to that program. The states and territories will be asked to add a further $205 million to create a holistic approach to breast cancer on a two-tiered governmental basis. Most of that money will be spent on direct service delivery to women. A network of screening and assessment services is being established across the country to provide free mammography and follow-up services through to diagnosis of breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major women's health screening program is the organised approach for preventing cancer of the cervix. It is a four-year program that has been jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states to the tune of $32 million. This year alone in Tasmania, the Commonwealth has committed more than a quarter of a million dollars to the program. That will fund screening and other vital services, such as an education strategy, and the registry which I unveiled last week. But the sad fact still is that, each year in Tasmania, 10 women die of cervical cancer and another 30 are diagnosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is vital. We must improve understanding about cancer of the cervix and we must dispel many of the myths surrounding it. The campaign will be able to target particular groupings of women in Tasmania who may have special needs, such as women from non-English speaking backgrounds. The campaign will encourage them to screen regularly and so reduce their risk of cancer of the cervix by early detection and treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The registry will be vital in following through the work of this campaign. It will be an invaluable service that reminds women when their pap smear is overdue and will improve follow-up and management of women with detected abnormalities. The fact that women are going to have regular reminders is a very important component of that registry, as I heard when talking to the various women at the launch last week. Another crucial part of the program will be aimed at improving the reliability of pap smears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite recent media attention suggesting otherwise, the fact remains that the pap smear is the only effective test available as yet to detect pre-cancerous changes in the cells of the cervix. It annually identifies a quarter of a million abnormalities&mdash;that is no mean feat&mdash;and prevents over 700 cases of cervical cancer from developing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality assurance is an integral part of the organised approach. The program is committed to implementing the recommendations of the quality assurance report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Making the pap smear better</EMPHASIS>, which was released in April 1993. The recommendations of that report are aimed at improving the quality and the reliability of smear taking, testing, reporting and supporting services. They address the need for adequate undergraduate and continued training in cytopathology, and the need for comprehensive and continuous monitoring of outputs, together with feedback to operators which, of course, is the essence of quality control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women should draw much comfort and reassurance from the comprehensive measures planned to ensure the reliability of pap smears. While no diagnostic test can be perfect, women rightly expect the highest duty of care. The measures that we are introducing through this appropriation bill will go a long way to reducing avoidable deaths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most pleasing aspects of this appropriation bill are the measures which it incorporates for veterans. My electorate of Bass has a very large and very active veteran population. Some of my most enjoyable nights have been spent at the Vietnam veterans' annual dinner in Launceston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inconsistencies in the determination of disability pension claims will be removed. The sum of $20.6 million over four years will be directed at problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, which includes funding for treatment centres. There will be increased counselling and there will be direct research into the needs of our younger veterans&mdash;a group that has been left aside for so long. The money from this appropriation bill will be directed to the areas of the veteran community that truly need increased support. This bill appropriates funds for the programs of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, programs which will lead this country out of economic recession and into economic resurgence with a motivated, relevant and skilled work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My background lies in the field of direct training as a preparation for people to enter the work force. For five years I ran a jobclub. Jobclub was a federal government program aimed directly at the unemployed. In my five years with jobclub 600-odd people came through my program. To date, I am still meeting up with many of those students in the street. They are saying, `Silvia, thank you very much for the jobclub, for what it did for me; I am still in work.' It is still working. I took the first jobclub to Tasmania. It has been of such benefit and such need that more have got going. In Launceston alone we now run three jobclubs. They are all finding a good percentage of positive outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also ran many skills based programs that were direct tenders from DEET. There were youth training programs and specific individual courses and programs on things such as industrial cleaning. We had a computer bank and we taught office skills and computer operating skills&mdash;all much needed skills to ensure a very skilled work force. That is what these programs are all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government intends to train people with the relevant skills to make them ready for work. The work is out there for those people who have the skills. We will develop a highly skilled and flexible work force. The emphasis needs to be on the word `flexible'. This will be done through a better national training effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional funding for this purpose will bring the total Commonwealth contribution to over $1.5 billion for the period 1993-97, thus reflecting the government's determination to ensure that this nation has an accessible, high quality vocational education and training system. We need it. Our youth needs it. Our long-term unemployed need it. This nation needs it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North-eastern Tasmania is also particularly excited by provisions in this bill for the development of a national regional development strategy. Northern Tasmania is one of Australia's most dynamic regions in terms of regional development. We have one of this country's most active and energetic regional development boards in the Northern Tasmanian Regional Development Board. It is innovative, it is active and it looks far into the future. I pay particular attention in this instant to the efforts of the executive officer, Mr Tom Black, and the chairman, Mr Michael Courney, for the special, ongoing and positive work they have done and are still doing in this area and wish to do in this area in the future for the future benefit of all northern Tasmanians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government will spend $150 million over four years towards the national regional development strategy. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that northern Tasmania will be capitalising on every opportunity that this strategy presents. The factors I have outlined here this evening are the aspects of this appropriation bill which stand out. They are good for northern Tasmania and they are good for the nation. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted tonight to have the opportunity to comment on the government's budget for 1994-95. Australia today finds itself at a crossroads. We have come through two decades of modernisation of the Australian economy, two decades of change, two decades of supposed reform which suddenly, with this budget, has ground to a halt. This, it has been said frequently, is an election budget. I suspect that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got a bit of a shock at the beginning of last week and, as a result of that shock, he is now rethinking his plans for a Christmas election this year. Notwithstanding that, the budget is a cop-out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was for a very long time a very wealthy but very isolationist country. We lived behind high tariff walls and we sold to the world that which it needed from us, being our metals, minerals and agricultural products, and we sold them at good prices. Following World War II when Australia got its act together and started to manufacture and diversify its industrial base, we had what is now known as the golden age of full employment. There was employment for everyone, a job for every household. For every Australian who wanted to work there was employment and a high standard of living. During that golden age, the time of the 1950s and 1960s, it was said that Australia enjoyed one of the highest, if not the highest, standards of living in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those days are well and truly gone. We find ourselves today, in terms of the developed world, down near the bottom of the ladder on almost all of the economic and social indicators. We are no longer one of the wealthiest nations in the world. We now fight to survive. During the last decade, the last 11 years of Labor in power, we have seen a diversification of income spread in this country which has meant that the wealthy are wealthier and the poor are poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that isolationism and protection cost this country dearly. We developed, behind that high tariff wall, many of the attitudes and problems that we still live with today. Industry is unresponsive to the need for change because it was protected and lacks innovation in terms of development of new products that both this nation and the rest of the world might well consume. We were slow to take up the results of research. Although we spend a reasonable amount of our national income on research, the majority of that spending is government spending. It comes from taxpayers' funds invested on the public's behalf in primary research. Far too little of that research winds up in new, innovative products which go into applied research and, finally, into commercialisation of products which are sold and consumed in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We developed poor attitudes to quality. I think the automotive industry is highly descriptive of the kinds of problems that developed in Australia through the era of protectionism. The automotive industry would go to government and say, `Look, our costs are up. We're having a very difficult time competing. Please would you increase the tariff?' The government would say, `Yes, you've definitely got a problem. We'll hike the tariff up so that Australians pay more for imported motor cars; therefore you can raise your prices and get more for the cars you produce.' The union would go along to the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and say, `For heaven's sake, the prices of motor cars have gone up, so we had best have a pay rise.' The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would say, `You're right. We'll give you a pay rise.' Then the automobile manufacturers would go back to the government and say, `Look, the commission just gave our workers a pay rise. Our costs have gone up again. We'll have to have an increase in tariffs.' So it went on and on and on. Behind that tariff wall, we developed some horrible attitudes and terrible quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have to note with some pride that I am the proprietor of a new Australian motor vehicle, manufactured by Holden. It now has 11,000 kilometres on the clock and it does not yet have one fault, not one, which I could report to the manufacturer. That is a massive turnaround in quality in a very short number of years. The industry is to be congratulated in that respect. I think the industry thanks John Button. I have to say that his plan has worked reasonably well. Behind that high tariff wall we developed poor service attitudes and a terrible response to public requests for service. We developed no international marketing skills to help us when we finally had to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this government decided to eliminate protection, but it started to eliminate protection from the tariff end. It forgot about the labour market. It left the labour market protected but removed protection from industry without giving it the compensating offsets and reductions in costs of compliance from government agencies, in costs of services supplied by government instrumentalities, in costs of regulations, in costs from taxes. It forgot to give industry half a break. It simply said, `We'll remove your tariffs. Now you have to compete. Go out and compete and survive the best way you can'&mdash;under a still regulated labour market and with still all the constraints imposed by governments. It has not worked very well because what has happened is that we have lost one hell of a lot of good Australian companies that are no longer in Australia. They now are in other countries or have disappeared altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So our problems, which we face when we examine this budget, are severe. Our problems start with debt. We are a highly indebted country now. Our current account deficit is driven by the fact that we have to pay interest on the money this nation has borrowed far in excess of our ability to service it. So we continue to spend tomorrow's money today on today's social policies. That is really what this budget is all about. This budget says that we will continue to run a high budget deficit; we will bring in new programs to try to deal responsibly, in a social manner, with the long-term unemployed. And how will we pay for it? We will not pay for it with any self-sacrifice by government or the bureaucracy or government departments or government agencies in reducing their costs or their spending. No, we will spend our grandchildren's money for these desirable social programs to try to bring the long-term unemployed back in touch with real jobs in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the wrong way to go about it. We need permanent jobs if those people are going to do any more than come into touch with the workplace. What they want is real jobs. The job market has changed dramatically in the last 20 years. We no longer have many jobs for unskilled people. The most disadvantaged in the job market are those who have poor literacy skills, those who have no English or very poor English skills, those who have little or no vocational training or those whose training suited them for one occupation which is no longer required as industry has restructured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government gave support to the automotive industry, in terms of its restructuring as tariffs have fallen, it has given almost no support to the manufacturing industry. My state of Victoria has particularly copped it as a result of those government policies. The government has also given some support to the textile, clothing and footwear industry, but that is obviously not enough. That industry is absolutely decimated all over this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's budget still props up government spending on government programs and servicing of government through the bureaucracy. The government is not going to reduce the number of bureaucrats as a result of this budget. It will increase them because more people will now be needed to deal with the new programs to deal with the long-term unemployed. As I said, I support some of those programs. I think they may be positive, but they will only be positive if we build real jobs in a real economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest problems we face in Australia is that we do not save; we spend. Since the 1980s, under this Labor government, we have been on a spending binge. We have spent on ourselves. We have not just spent our money and our earnings and what we have worked for but we have spent our children's money and our grandchildren's money. That is causing us terrific problems today because we do not have the savings to use to invest in new productive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If industry is to grow, as it moves out in the world, learns how to compete in other countries and how to export&mdash;the problem is to get them to invest in new productive capacity in Australia&mdash;several things need take place. First of all, we need to generate some savings, because if we need to borrow all of the money for all of that new investment, we will only rapidly increase our debt. We are seeing that at the moment. The government talks about a huge recovery&mdash;massive economic growth figures of about 4 1/2 per cent on average not only this year but also next year and the year after&mdash;and about Australia being the fastest growing nation in the OECD. It seems to me that that growth is coming to a screeching halt very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anecdotal evidence in my electorate tells me that about 12 months ago small and medium sized business owners were talking about investing, building, making new plans and exporting new products. All that new activity&mdash;and some of it did take place&mdash;is now slowing dramatically. That frightens me because that means that the unemployment statistics in my area are going to stay rather static. We may hide some of those figures with some mickey mouse accounting techniques by putting some of the older or long-term unemployed beyond the reach of normal unemployment statistics by putting them on special benefits. We may hide some others through some of the job programs and some of the training programs, which would mean that they would not be counted anymore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What frightens me is that industry is not investing. If industry started to invest in a real hurry, which would be desirable, we do not have the savings to be able to invest with equity. We will invest, once again, by going into debt. So we will build more debt and next year we will need more dollars to service the debt, which will feed into the current account deficit, and so the spiral goes on. Interest rates will go up to try to contain any explosion. The costs of industry will go up. Industry's construction and new purchasing will contract and then we will be back into the same old boom-bust cycle because we have not built a sustainable platform from which to go forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had really been fair dinkum when it first started to reform the banks and open up the money market, it also would have reformed the labour market to get rid of protectionism in the labour market. Every time the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) comes into this place and has cause to talk about his miraculous Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 he talks about protecting the workers, protecting the work force, protecting everyone who has a job, at the expense of those who do not have jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he does not understand is that all the complications of his legislation and all the negatives implicit in his unfair dismissals court mean that industry does not have the incentive to invest, hire, develop new products, be innovative, teach itself new marketing skills and go out and build new markets. Australia has a lack of savings. Our debt is too high and government spending is continuing. The government's budget is without imagination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are indeed at the crossroads. We are sort of halfway in modernising the Australian economy from being isolated to fully competitive&mdash;halfway out of the dark ages into the new enlightened era. But this government has chickened out. The Prime Minister has gotten cold feet. He reckons he wants to win another election and the way to do it is to try to make everyone happy&mdash;let us not have an unhappy budget; let us not tell people that we cannot afford to spend what we are spending; let us just spend it and let the debt be worried about tomorrow. It looks to me as if this tired, worn out, discredited Labor government is about to give over to the coalition to let us try to fix up its now 11 years worth of mess. That is fine with me, but it is going to take a lot of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing we are going to have to do is reform our unique industrial relations system. We are going to have to free up the labour market and get rid of protectionism in the labour market as we are trying to get rid of protectionism in the industry market. We are going to have to use tax vehicles to encourage savings. We are going to have to simplify the taxation system in order to let individuals plan a little better. Along the way it might be nice, too, if we could have a real increase in real wages so that people had more earnings they could use to devote to savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be a good idea if we encouraged industry, through the taxation system, to invest in new productive capacity. That is really what we need. We need new industry. We have lots of bright, innovative, dynamic people out there in the Australian marketplace. We need to have them developing new products that they can sell here and export overseas to get us out of this debt crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need education for management. I was thinking the other day that we need a bit of lateral thinking. We have the Trade Union Training Authority, TUTA. Why do we not have a management training authority, an MTA? Maybe we need one of those. I hear Labor members on the other side of House talk from time to time about the fact that all our problems in the labour market are due to managers who have no managing skills, who would not know how to negotiate an enterprise agreement if it ran over them. Maybe they would not because they have not had a chance to learn how. Why? It is because we have so many fixed rules and regulations about how that market works that they have no experience. Maybe we need a management training authority. We will think about that one. That would be a bit of lateral thinking, would it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to teach Australians and Australian industry how to market effectively and internationally. It is important that as we develop new products we learn how to take those all over the world&mdash;into Europe, Asia and the developing countries. We have to help develop a real industrial base again because we need market diversification in Australia. We still rely too much, too heavily, on our mines and agriculture. Australia lived off the sheep's back and off coal, iron ore, copper, tin, lead, zinc and alumina for far too long. We need a solid manufacturing base built on quality, reliability, innovation and service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need training for our people so that Australians can effectively work in the developing marketplace so that there will be good, permanent jobs for them and so that they can live a satisfactory lifestyle. The government could do a better job of helping Australian industry by buying Australian and encouraging its 40,000 purchasing officers to buy Australian at whatever price and when other indicators are equal to overseas supply. The government's budget stands condemned. </PARA>

The committee is called KOPO, which stands for `Keep our post office'. Last year I brought to the attention of the House that the committee had got up and running to save the Launceston post office. That committee is still fighting an enormous battle and is slowly, I do feel, winning ground. It certainly has not been easy. It is a bipartisan committee.

The people that came before us helped build part of that post office, so we claim some sort of ownership.' Therefore, the committee is trying to save it one way or another. That determination has been enhanced by the fact that one of the heritage buildings in Launceston has been sold in recent years and has become a shop front, to the detriment of the heritage value of the building.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this occasion to indicate to the House that we in the seat of Gilmore have been successful in obtaining a grant for a feasibility study of farm forestry. Mr Speaker, as you are a resident of the south coast of New South Wales, you would be aware that from Sydney's south there has been a swelling up in the support of those who are against ocean outfalls. During a launch by the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), last year of the coastal policies of this government, you are on the public record as showing your support for clean waters and for the movement towards using effluent and effluent management in a manner conducive to the long-term benefits of the environment and the people in the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that you will be very pleased with the work I have been involved in with Shoalhaven Employment and Training Incorporated. We envisage a third corporate entity. We envisage using effluent management services in such a way that we can create a new industry. Most people know that there is little venture capital in this country and that in many instances the entrepreneurs of this country have let it down because they are not prepared to put money into investments that will take 20 or 30 years to mature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach we have taken with farm forestry and efficient effluent management in the Gilmore area is to look at the three major components of the process. First, capital infrastructure is required to deal with the sewage and turn it into the major by-product, which is water&mdash;the solids are a very small part of it; the problem we have is getting rid of the water. The traditional method on the south coast, as you, Mr Speaker, would be aware, has been to pour it into the ocean. That is unacceptable. A recent survey by the Wollongong University of the Shoalhaven people showed that 76 per cent were against that, 72 per cent were prepared to pay more to avoid it, and 52 per cent were prepared to pay up to $5 a week to stop it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of that, we are looking to have a third entity created which would involve three players&mdash;the Shoalhaven City Council, the land owners, and the corporate sector. It is my vision that these three players will be able to forestall the necessity for venture capital. As long as the effluent management services are running in the black&mdash;in other words, the charges that are levelled on Shoalhaven city residents cover the costs of pumping that water out and the capital infrastructure that has been put in&mdash;then we are in a position where the capital from growing trees which will accrue to that community will provide in the long term a massive capital gain for that entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now in the process of having a feasibility study to see whether technically trees can be grown using effluent. While that may seem strange, because it has been studied to death all around the world, there is some need to do it on a local basis to test the compatibility of the Shoalhaven City Council area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that you, Mr Speaker, will be very pleased to follow this through. I know you will be interested in seeing whether the same sorts of approaches can be taken in your area&mdash;I know you are a keen swimmer, I know you are keenly involved in the surf lifesaving movement, I know you are a surfer, and I know you are concerned about the environment and the quality of water. The fishing industry based in Wollongong and all down the south coast will be in a much better position when we have clean seas in which fish can be caught and exported to Japan, Korea, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the program being introduced. I thank DEET and the government for having so many wonderful programs. The reason this got up was that it had ticks across all of those policy areas. </PARA>

The technology exists; it is on the shelves at CSIRO. The honourable member might want to ask them about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what I wanted to speak about in the adjournment debate tonight. I wanted to highlight to the House a number of anomalies that are being exposed through the application of labour market programs mainly because of the inflexibility of a lot of the programs the government has running at the moment. These have been brought to my attention recently by a number of constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the relocation allowance, which is fairly widely advertised by the CES and involves unemployed people who may have prospects of finding employment outside their area. If that employment is found and established by the CES, then there is a grant available for the relocation of that person and their family. But it is not available to people that go and find a job for themselves. I have had two constituents in this situation. One fellow left Taree and moved to Tumbarumba, where he had got a job as a car salesman. He came back to the local CES office to apply for the relocation allowance and was told that it was not available because there was one person listed at the Wagga Wagga office of the CES as being an unemployed car salesman. It did not matter that the car dealer in Tumbarumba had already employed this other person a couple of years before and would not even seriously consider employing him again. The fact remained that that family had to relocate themselves from Taree to Tumbarumba because the man found the employment himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had another case just last week where a young fellow had been unemployed for some time and found himself some work as a station hand doing farm work and fruit picking in the Orange area. He had been told by the CES that there were funds available for relocation if he found work outside of the area but they did not tell him that if he found the work himself, not through the CES, he would not get the funding. So he went ahead and got the job; he is at Orange working and his family is back in Taree because they cannot afford to move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did not get the relocation allowance because a number of people were registered on the lists in the Orange office of the CES, which maintained that they could be taking that job rather than bringing someone from outside. The question that should be asked is: why were those people not put onto that work in the first place? So there is a fairly large anomaly there that really needs to be addressed by the government. We frequently see that people are finding employment for themselves, because the CES is not finding it for them, yet what the government puts forward as a good assistance scheme for relocation is not available for people who find work for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third case arose only last week. A constituent of mine, Mr Rod Scott-Young, through his own ingenuity went and found himself permanent employment with a local jeweller and jewellery manufacturer. Because of the jeweller's concerns as far as the current IR legislation on unfair dismissal is concerned&mdash;which we have seen the minister turn around on to a certain extent this week&mdash;he wanted to have this chap work for a couple of weeks in a voluntary capacity to see that his work was going to be up to standard and he would then put him on full time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not acceptable to the CES. He was not able to retain his benefit while he was working in a voluntary capacity because it was maintained that he would not be available for other job applications or interviews with other employers elsewhere. Again there is not enough flexibility within the system. Provided he measured up during those two weeks, he would have had permanent employment. The employer was only safeguarding himself against being locked into a situation where he may have been liable under the new federal industrial relations act as far as unfair dismissal is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employee was quite happy to go along with that provided he could maintain or keep receiving his benefits for that fortnight while he proved to that employer that he would be a worthwhile employee. He would have ultimately been given permanent employment, been taken off the unemployment benefit, and thus made a saving to the Commonwealth. Because of the rigidity of the rules and regulations, he was not able to do that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that in Australia drug related crime abounds. We spend large sums of money policing this, one might say with very little effect. There is quite clearly a very simple remedy. If we were to decriminalise the use of these drugs and make them available from chemists on prescription at a nominal charge&mdash;it would be at no cost to the taxpayer because the nominal charge would cover the cost of production&mdash;and simultaneously erase the penalties for using these drugs, we would attack crime at both ends: we would remove the high rewards that exist and increase the penalties. It is self-evident that this would work. It is amazing to me in our society that we do not try this. One has to ask why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that ever-rising penalties for people who supply drugs simply raise the profit margin of the shadowy people in the background who are never caught. The only way to deal with those people is to destroy their markets. There would also be the advantage of supplying, in the case of the opiates, a very pure heroin or morphine. At the moment, this is cut with all sorts of noxious substances, many of which are very dangerous to health. The realities about heroin are that the main by-product is constipation, which can be remedied by taking another drug&mdash;caffeine in black coffee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense to say that people on heroin are unable to fulfil their jobs in the work force. There is no doubt that many people are able to take this drug recreationally and perform quite well&mdash;much more effectively than they can on alcohol. I am told that we spend in the vicinity of $450 million a year on policing these hard drugs. Something like 290 people a year die from overdoses. Quite frankly, I have no sympathy for the people who die from overdoses of these drugs. I am certainly not prepared to spend that money to save their lives, particularly when for every one who dies&mdash;voluntarily, in my view&mdash;from heroin overdose probably two or three women die screaming silently in boredom or frustration in the community from overuse of analgesics. No-one cares about them, because they do not go out and rob shops to fund their habit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, if we are serious about this problem, we have to take another whole fresh look at it and return some responsibility to people. For years now we have had this nonsense of marijuana. Marijuana was freely available in this country until 1959; it was prescribed in chemist shops. I have never had any effect from marijuana. I have had much more effect from a strong cigar, which I have also now forsworn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to also look at tobacco and the nonsense that is talked about tobacco smoking. I believe tobacco is injurious to health, but I believe that people who take the decision to smoke tobacco know what they are doing and they recognise those risks. It should also be recognised that if people smoke cigarettes and die before the age of 60 they actually save the taxpayers money. </PARA>

I never had any ill effects in aeroplanes when people used to smoke cigarettes in them. Since the airlines have stopped cigarette smoking in their planes, I suspect they simply do not clean the filters out as often as they used to because they do not have to and, therefore, the germs build up continuously. Every time I go on an aeroplane now on any lengthy flight I am plagued with sinuses which affect my quality of life. I do not know whether it is the lack of cleaning of filters or whether tobacco killed the bugs in the filters, but clearly this is a side effect of smoking which is detrimental to the health and welfare of a good number of people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to present to the House the comments of this year's winner of the Qantas/Cowan essay competition. Honourable members will remember that last year I initiated an essay writing competition for secondary school students, who were invited to write a 2,000-word essay on a set topic. As a side comment, it is interesting to note some of the comments of last year's winner, Nathan Barnes of Morley, who identified a number of initiatives the government could employ to reduce youth unemployment. Last year Nathan wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The very high level of youth unemployment can be put down partly to the lack of skills and experience, but the main reason is the relatively small differential between youth and adult wage rates. In the guise of preventing `exploitation' of young people the trade union movement has been able to keep wage rates higher than the market rate. This has the effect of making adult workers a more attractive employment proposition, and maintaining high youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>The foresight and understanding of Australia's present economic malaise by this young Australian is to be commended and congratulated. The Cowan essay competition is a unique and valuable work experience for young people in my own electorate to participate in our parliamentary process and to gain a valuable insight into the day-to-day workings of the parliament and their local federal politician. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate Monica Muski of Alexander Heights, a year 11 student from Morley Senior High School, on her winning entry. As part of her prize for winning the competition, Monica travelled to Parliament House to witness the budget proceedings. This year's essay topic was `What should Australian politicians be doing to help Australian families?' It is a topic particularly relevant for this year, the International Year of the Family. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues some of Monica's comments about what Australia's parliamentarians can be doing for Australian families. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The family unit is the fundamental building block of our society . . . Politicians as the leaders of the country have the power to change public facilities for the better and to distribute funds to areas where they are needed most in order to help improve the standing of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social Security and other financial assistance to families is just such an issue. There are many loopholes in the system and large amounts of money are misdirected to individuals who have no real need for it. On the other hand, there are others for whom this assistance would be greatly beneficial, however they either have no idea that such money exists, or they do not know where and how to apply to obtain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health is another issue that many families have to deal with. Medicare, although providing a reasonable service for those not privately insured, proves to be an extra payment for services not necessarily needed for those who are insured. Providing those who have private insurance with large discounts from the Medicare Levy could encourage many to take up private insurance and ease the strain on Medicare payouts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Womens health is also a very important factor. Many women's illnesses, if detected early, can be cured with minimum trauma and financial pain to the patient. However if found later, the illness costs a huge amount in both financial and emotional terms to the entire family, not to mention the drain of government services such as Medicare. The answer to this is simply to remember that prevention is better than cure, and that with regular checkups many women would not have to face the trauma of major illness. More womens heath care facilities which are especially catered for female clientele could be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These health care units would not only provide people with a valuable resource but would also be a reminder and actual physical proof that the politicians of Australia care about Australian families and that they are willing to do something to assist the families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many things that the Government can do to help the families of today. Let us hope that in this year&mdash;the year of the family&mdash;most of these projects will be fulfilled to ensure the healthy growth of our nation's families.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I think you will agree that the comments of Monica Muski, a young Australian who obviously cares deeply about her country and its future, deserves attention as do the hopes and fears of all young Australians. I would like to thank the secondary schools in my electorate for their continued support for this initiative, the local newspapers&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wanneroo Times</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Eastern Suburbs Reporter</EMPHASIS>&mdash;for their continued publicity of the event, the Parliamentary Education Office, and especially Qantas Airways, for their very generous support and sponsorship of the competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows, based in part on information provided by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The manual merely sets out recommended level of scheduled surveillance for flying operations. Scheduled surveillance is often replaced by supplementary surveillance which is in response to particular situations. Both types of surveillance were carried out by the Flying Operations section of the Bankstown District office on several occasions prior to 11 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The CAA's understanding is that at the time of the crash VH-NDU was operating with the autopilot amplifier and controller removed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The CAA advised that the only requirement contained in the Permissible Unserviceability for the second pilot was that the pilot had to hold an instrument rating, which the second pilot did in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) BASI have advised that the pilot was endorsed for the Piper Navajo aircraft in November 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) BASI have advised that available evidence indicates that the co-pilot was employed on the basis that he would receive remuneration for the duties he performed during the flight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) BASI have advised that the co-pilot was on a list, held by the airline, of pilots available for casual employment as co-pilots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The CAA advised that its Airworthiness Instruction Number 5-26 provides guidelines for granting approval of Permissible Unserviceabilities under Civil Aviation Regulation 37.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Authority advises that measures taken with respect to the aircraft VH-NDU were in accordance with the Civil Aviation Regulations. Guidelines for the issue of Permissible Unserviceabilities were available for the information of Authority staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The CAA advises there is no "usual" period. Depending upon the item which is inoperative and the nature of the conditions imposed the period can be quite long. There was nothing unusual about the length of operation of the Permissible Unserviceabilities applying to VH-NDU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The CAA have provided the following answer. No. The Permissible Unserviceability applying to VH-NDU at the time of the crash was for a month expiring on 16 June 1993 or until the required components were available whichever occurred first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The CAA have advised that at the time of the crash the autopilot of VH-NDU was unable to operate. It is not a requirement for a privately operated Piper Navajo to have an operational autopilot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) As the Monarch Airlines accident occurred while the aircraft involved was on an intrastate flight between Sydney and Young, NSW, such matters as the airline's liability for the carriage of passengers and insurance fall within the jurisidiction of the NSW Government. In conformity with Commonwealth legislation covering aircraft operators engaged in interstate Regular Public Transport (RPT), NSW law establishes a carriers' liability limit of $180,000 per passenger for intrastate RPT operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) The Commonwealth does not require compulsory passenger insurance for airlines engaged in RPT operations. However, as noted in my response to part (13) above, the NSW Government requires compulsory passenger insurance for intrastate RPT operations.</PARA>

In contributing to this goal the project will enhance the capacity of Indonesian institutions to design and implement effective multi-sectoral STD and HIV prevention and care strategies at national level and in three identified provinces (East Nusa Tenggara, Bali and South Sulawesi).

The main emphasis of Australia's development cooperation program, which is administered by AIDAB, has been to promote the ability of communities and people vulnerable to HIV to identify, understand and respond to the many and varied implications of the virus. AIDAB has also supported strategies to mobilise and assist support groups for the care of those persons already infected.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr Beddall</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) At this stage the Government has no plans to aggregate energy consumption for electricity users. The reasons for this are as follows. Heads of Government made a commitment in July 1993 to introduce a competitive electricity market in south eastern Australia from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that such a market would enable individual customers to purchase their electricity directly from producers (generators) as well as from distributors. At the present time, it has been suggested that a 10 MW load should define the eligibility of customers to purchase electricity directly from the market;  consumers having a load less than 10 MW would continue to purchase electricity from their local distributor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the February 1994 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, Heads of Government requested that the National Grid Management Council (NGMC) report on `options and desirability for reducing the initial threshold level of customers permitted to participate in the competitive electricity market (noting that Victoria has considered lowering this threshold to 50kW by 1988)'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood that the issue of aggregation is essentially one of access by customers to a competitive market. I support the general principle that the market will operate with greater efficiency the larger the number of participants and therefore support a reduction in the threshold limit for access. I also support the general principle that a group of customers should be able to aggregate demand so as to purchase bulk amounts of electricity in the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would expect that the NGMC would be providing advice to governments on the technical issues associated with the reduction in the threshold and the aggregation of demand, and that such technical advice would form the basis of decisions by Heads of Government. In particular, the feasibility of aggregating demand will depend on metering requirements and associated metering costs. A further practical issue to be considered is the financial effect of aggregation on state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) If local government authorities means electricity distribution councils then such councils will be able to aggregate demand and purchase directly from the market. If local government authorities means other, non-electricity, local government agencies then such agencies will be treated on an equivalent basis to any other customers.</PARA>
