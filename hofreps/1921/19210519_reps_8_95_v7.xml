                        <para>- Our note issue is less now than it was at the time of the Armistice, and Australia is almost the only country in which the note issue has not increased in that period. In almost every other country it has increased. In Great Britain the increase amounted to 22 per cent., and even in America there has been an increase. Here there has been a decrease in the issue. </para>

                        <para>- It is not possible to give the whole of the information asked for by the honorable member, as all woollen goods imported are not recorded separately. The following statement shows the annual value of such woollen goods as are recorded separately in the Statistical Classification which were imported into the Commonwealth from 1909 to1919-1920,also the gross Customs duty collected on such goods for the same years. The goods concerned are flannels, woollens n.e.i, wool yarns, and wool-felt hats. Woollen socks and stockings imported since 1918-19 are also included, prior to which date they were not recorded separately. </para>

I have made inquiries and find that the basic wage which is applicable to permanent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service has been granted to semi-official postmasters and postmistresses and to full time employees at semi-official post-offices. The increase operates as from 1st November, 1920, the date from which the increase was granted to permanent officers. </para>

                    <para>The breeding establishment at Maribyrnong was formed in October, 1917, and was discontinued in February, 1920. The mares used were selected from those on hand, none being purchased for the purpose. These have now boon returned to their usual work. The stallions were purchased for 800 guineas, one of which was sold, on disbandment of the stud, for 2,100 guineas, the other being retained for the use of public mares at a fee of 3 guineas. The other two stallions used were presented to the Department, and are now located in Kew South Wales and South Australia for the use of public mares at 3 guineas. The cost of maintaining the stallions whilst the stud was in operation was &#163;338. The cost of maintaining the mares over the same period was &#163;3,570. The cost of maintenance of the progeny to date is &#163;676. The only revenue received from the stud has been 2,100 guineas for the stallion Piastre, and &#163;272 from the service of privately-owned mares last season; but it may be added that the stallions are valued at &#163;1,000, and the young stock at &#163;2,000, and it is estimated that the stallions will earn in fees next season 400 guineas, and their maintenance for the year will not exceed &#163;100. No additional men were employed in connexion with the stud, all work being done by the Remount Section. The stud was worked from the Remount Depot, Maribyrnong, and mares on being stinted were placed on agistment. </para>

                    <para>- Yesterday, the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> asked me what the <inline font-style="italic">Shandon</inline> cost to buy, what was paid for refitting her after purchase, and what she was sold for. The facts, so far as I remember them, are these: The vessel was bought for &#163;7,000 at a time when we were laying hold of anything we could get about the coast to meet the exigencies of the moment, and cost about &#163;26,000 to refit. The vessel was eventually sold as a coal hulk for about &#163;4,000,, but in the meantime she had earned &#163;39,000 profit. We got out of the whole transaction with &#163;3,000 or &#163;4,000 to the good, and considering that she was purchased in a time of stress when we had to secure whatever was available, I think it will be admitted that the vessel has served her purpose. </para>

                        <para>.- Under this item infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods are to be admitted free, and I think that is very wise, because every one will admit that it should be our endeavour to allow these commodities to be sold at a reasonable price in the interests of the invalids and infants in our community. But I desire to place before the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> the position in regard to groats and barley which, I presume, would be classified  under this heading as infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods. I have been informed that groats and barley are not so classified under State Acts, which provide that these commodities shall not be used for infants&#39; food until a child is at least six months of age. It seems hardly fair that groats and barley should be admitted into the Commonwealth free, in view of the fact that they are manufactured in Australia., and cannot be used as food for infants of all ages. If the Minister makes inquiries he will find that groats and barley are manufactured here in a form that makes them suitable for breakfast foods, and therefore importations should be dutiable. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. But barley and groats cannot be used for infants until they reach a certain age. Barley may be used in the preparation of barley water or something of that nature for the use of weaklings; but the Pure Foods Acts passed by State Legislatures practically debarred the use of barley and groats for infants. </para>

                        <para>.- I discussed the question of infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods in the course of the general debate, and on this item - but perhaps not so much as on item 174 - I would like the Committee to determine whether the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> shall have power to allow goods to be admitted free or not. I want to know whether the Committee will limit the power of the Minister, or whether he is to be the determining factor in deciding whether goods shall be admitted free or not? I think we should also determine if the Minister is to have the power to impose a duty if Parliament has said that such articles as infants&#39; foods shall be admitted free. When previously discussing this matter I referred to Horlick&#39;s malted milk. I do not know anything concerning the firm handling this product, but I received a circular letter, and after reading it I came to the conclusion that as Horlick&#39;s malted milk had been used in and around Melbourne and elsewhere as a beverage, the Minister had decided that it should be removed from the list of infants&#39; foods. On page 56 of the Customs by-laws honorable members will find a list of articles which have been allowed to come into this country as infants&#39; or invalids&#39; foods, and I think I am voicing the opinion of every honorable member in this House when I say that as far as infant life is concerned special foods required for invalids and infants and recommended by the medical profession should be admitted free. This item is connected with the milk industry, but I want to go further than support the imposition of a duty simply because it might be the means of benefiting an industry. We have to consider the community as a whole, and not the profit that would be derived by one section of the community. For its area New Zealand may be considered quite as great a milk producing country as Australia, and I find that in the New Zealand Tariff there is set out a list of the various foods admitted duty free. I am a little doubtful of the wisdom of adopting that course, because new foods may be imported. </para>

The Minister may question the accuracy of the statements made in the circular to which I have referred, but I suggest that it may be assumed that they are correct when I inform honorable members that the circular was sent from the office of the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best).</inline> He was the solicitor for these people in trying to keep the article placed on the free list. I do not know how the honorable member will argue on the question in this Chamber, but I suppose he will be quite justified personally in giving effect to the fiscal principles he has always expressed. </para>

                            <para>- That is&#39; not so. I have explained that. Horlick&#39;s malted milk was placed, with forty or fifty other foods examined by the Government Analyst, and pronounced to be invalid or infants&#39; foods on a list coming under item 55 of the Tariff, and being, therefore, duty free; but owing to certain representations made to the Department Horlick&#39;s malted milk has been taken off the list of invalids&#39; and infants&#39; foods, and a duty is now charged upon it. The reason given for this, according to the circular to which I have referred, &#34;is that the article is being sold in shops as a beverage. The statement is made in the circular that of the imports of this article only 8.31 per cent, goes into consumption as a beverage, leaving 91.69 per cent, to be consumed by invalids and infants. </para>

I point out that it is very much dearer than locally manufactured foods. We are all agreed that infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods should be .allowed to come into the country duty free. I want, to raise the question whether, when the Trade and Customs Department has admitted that certain foods are infants&#39; or invalids&#39; foods, the Minister should have the right to remove them from the free list, because, in his opinion, they interfere with a certain industry in this country. </para>

I believe that he has acted outside the law, and in ways that are most unjustifiable. If the Committee decides that the Minister should  have this power he will be justified in exercising it, but I do not think that it is wise to place him in the position of being able to say that certain goods shall be admitted duty free, and certain other goods shall not, without the matter being considered by this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - Whenever an attempt is made to introduce a reform there is always some objection urged against it. When the effort was made to secure better hours for shopkeepers, the case of the poor old widow who lived by keeping a shop was put forward as an objection. Now, when an attempt is made to levy a duty on an article which can, and should, be manufactured in Australia, the poor infants are used as a plea against it. Horlick&#39;s malted milk is used to-day by twenty adults for every one infant using it. In Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane it is drunk &#39; wholesale in the milk and soda shops. In Pitt-street, Sydney, there must be seven or eight shops selling Horlick&#39;s malted milk, though customers do not always get that brand when they ask for it. It is not a question of the poor infants at all. They are merely dragged out for a special purpose.

According to the circular quoted by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> less than 9 per cent, of the imports of this article is used as a beverage by adults. It is one of the most expensive infants&#39; foods, that can be bought, and it does not come into competition with Australian foods, because they are very much cheaper. It is often ordered in special cases by medical men, and I hope that it will be retained on the free list. </para>

                        <para>.- The Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton.)</inline> made an inquiry with respect to certain oat and barley preparations. They will fall under item 5S, &#34; Grain and pulse, prepared&#39; or manufactured,&#34; and it is my intention to submit an amendment to paragraph e of that item which will further strengthen the existing position. With regard to the point raised by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> Parliament defined this item as &#34; Infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods as prescribed by departmental by-laws.&#34; la doing so, Parliament gave power to the Minister for Trade and Customs to prescribe certain things as infants&#39; and in.valids&#39; foods,, and it gave him power also not to do so. The position is that if the Minister does not prescribe any particular food as an infants&#39; or invalids&#39; food, it automatically becomes dutiable under one or other of the existing items of the Tariff. Speaking generally, Parliament agreed that all these articles should be dutiable, and then gave to the Minister for Trade and Customs power to prescribe certain articles in such a way as to bring them within the free list. That is the principle upon which the Tariff is drawn. </para>

                            <para>- No, what Parliament has done up to the the present has been to make all these .articles subject to duty, but to leave with the Minister for Trade and Customs a discretionary power to include any of them in the free list. I admit that that is wide power to give the Minister, but it has been given designedly by Parliament. In regard to malted milk, the position was that we found that this food was being used very extensively as a drink, and not merely as an invalids&#39; or infants&#39; food. Further, we found also that the Bacchus Marsh Company were turning out a malted milk which, on analysis, was found to be identical with Horlick&#39;s malted milk. In the circumstances it appeared to the Minister then in control of the Trade and Customs Department that it was right that the power which Parliament designedly gave him should be exercised. As a result of the action taken by the Department in this regard we have Mellin&#39;s and other manufacturers of these foods coming here. I cannot say anything as to their prices, but they are using the raw material of our own country, employing our own people, and turning out what  I  believe is an excellent .article. As to Horlick&#39;3 malted milk being an infant&#39;s food, the latest information I have is that the Victorian Health Department is taking action against the proprietors for so describing it. </para>

                            <para>- The position in regard to all these tilings is that they fall under one or other of the items of the Tariff as dutiable articles unless we by Ministerial act take them out. Parliament gave us this power for the express purpose of enabling us as far as possible to protect our own people. We have simply exercised the power which Parliament has given us. I admit that the question is surrounded with many difficulties. It presents difficulties of administration, but the power was designedly given us by Parliament, and we hav&#171; exercised it in what I believe to be the interests of this country. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the principle of allowing infant&#39;s and invalid foods to come in free of duty, and join with others who have advocated the free admission of Horlick&#39;s malted milk. I do not know whether the State Government of Victoria or the Government of New1 South Wales has taken action against the proprietors of Horlick&#39;s malted milk for describing it as an invalid&#39;s food, but I do know that it is used very extensively as such. Those who have reared a family know very well that there are some infant&#39;s foods which do not agree with children as well as do others. My eldest girl, for instance, when an infant, refused to take Lactogen, but she thrived on Horlick&#39;s malted milk, which was the only artificial food that she would take. We all know that Hor-  lick&#39;s malted milk is used extensively and recommended by doctors an an .invalid&#39;s food, and it is within my own experience that infants have been successfully reared on it. For these reasons, I agree with those&#39; who urge that Horlick&#39;s malted milk should be admitted free of duty. There is no danger that it will undersell the local product or swamp the market, because at the present time its price is higher than any Australian-made infant&#39;s or invalid&#39;s food. That being so, the locally-made article must have the market preference. It seems to me that in this matter the Government are simply proposing to take a little more revenue out of the pockets of invalids and the parents of infants. A duty is being levied in this case solely for revenue purposes. I therefore hope that the Minister will agree that Horlick&#39;s malted milk shall come in free. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in sympathy with the view advanced by&#39; the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> and the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden).</inline> The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> knows very well that Horlick&#39;s malted milk is almost twice as expensive as any locally manufactured invalid&#39;s or infant&#39;s food which, he is so anxious to protect, and that it is one of the most valuable foods, not only for infants, but for invalids. If the Government are going to drive Protection to these outrageous lengths they will meet with a good deal of opposition which they would not otherwise encounter. I shall certainly divide the Committee on this question. </para>

                        <para>.- The only thing that is more pathetic than the imposition of this duty is, perhaps, the puerile and feeble reason advanced by the Minister for imposing it. I gather from what has been said that Horlick&#39;s malted milk, which is a recognised infant&#39;s food, has so far won popularity in this country that persons who can no longer lay claim to the happy state of infancy have been persuaded to use it in large quantities. It appears that one other duty has been added to the numerous and exacting duties of the Minister in that he is, constituted a public analyst to declare from time to time what may or may not be properly described as an infant&#39;s food. The truth is that this is a tax on the babies of Australia., and, at the same time, a tax upon public health. The absurdity of the position is well illustrated by the Minister&#39;s public declaration that he understands that legal proceedings are actually pending in this State against the proprietors of Horlick&#39;s malted milk for describing it as an infant&#39;s food. The Minister, having in his august person, the right to declare that it is not an infant&#39;s food, certain other people institute proceedings against the people who manufacture it for saying that it is an infant&#39;s food. I do not say that this is the most absurd of the absurd positions in which the Minister is placed, but it certainly should be added to his album of eccentricities. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite immaterial who for the time being exercised the power or enjoyed the honour. It is evident to all. who have heard the Minister that he would delight in exercising the power, and that the honour would sit very gracefully upon him. The Minister&#39;s statement that an industry has been established in this State in respect of which it was found that this new milk product possessed all the attributes that could be claimed for Horlick&#39;s milk was very interesting and important, but it lacked weight when the Minister had to tell the Committee that he was not in a position to give honorable members any information as to the price. I suggested, of course, facetiously, by interjection, that, after all, the price did not matter, the cost of living was nothing, and the needs of the babies were apparently nothing. We must take Horlick&#39;s milk immediately out of. the list of babies&#39; foods, if some one claims, rightly or not, that we can establish a great Australian industry, even at the expense of the babies, and by way of keeping up the cost of living. In this case, the price of Horlick&#39;s is higher than that of the local article, so we compete on exceptionally favorable terms. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not so much concerned as to whether malted milk is an infants&#39; food or a food for others. What I am concerned about is the fact that the Minister is seeking to protect what is clearly an Australian industry. We have all the raw material in this country - we have the milk, the barley, the wheat, and the labour ; we make the bottles ; we produce the labels; and we employ our own people in building up an Australian industry. During the war, the supply of all infants&#39; foods which we imported was cut off. We cannot see what the future has in store for us, but surely a country like this cannot permit itself to be cut off from its essential requirements. There . is now in this State a company making malted milk. </para>

                            <para>- I have seen the analysis, which shows that the local product is quite equal to the imported article. The imported article is selling at a very much higher rate, because its manufacturers are a very rich and influential company, who have advertised largely throughout Australia, with the result that people who want malted milk naturally ask for Horlick&#39;s. Every one has seen those black and white cows painted up all over the fields-throughout Australia. We are importing milk from other countries in the shape of manufactured articles which we could easily produce ourselves. I have no doubt that before the Minister took the step he has taken he consulted the Government Analyst regarding the product in question. The local company have already had plans prepared for a very largely increased output. If we can establish our own industries, using our own raw material, I hope honorable members will see the great advantage of doing so, as against importing manufactured milk products from other countries. </para>

                        <para>.. - I hope the Minister will adhere to his determination. If ever there was an item on which the Committee should be united, from the point of view both of primary production and of&#39; manufacture, it is this. The honorable . member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> spoke of the virtues of Horlick&#39;s milk. From my own family experience, I swear by Mellin&#39;s Food. The Minister informs me that Mellin&#39;s Food is practically on the same list as Horlick&#39;s now, so much so that, instead of being imported, it is actually being manufactured in Australia. We have an opportunity here of standing by our own people, who are not on this occasion fleecing the public. The analysis shows that the local article is exactly, or almost exactly, the same as Horlick&#39;s malted milk, and that it is selling much below the price of the imported article. The &#34;poor, unfortunate babies and widows&#34; that we heard about from the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> are being fleeced, not by the local manufacturer, but by the producer of the imported article. They are paying very much more for Horlick&#39;s milk than for the local product. Then we are told that the fact that the local manufacturers are selling at a lower price is a reason why no protection should be accorded to them. I am surprised at those who advocate that kind of thing. Let us stand by the Australian article, which, made out of Australian material, the best in the world, is the best for Australian babies, and we can raise the best Australians on it. We have now a splendid opportunity to help the primary producer. I am surprised to find the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party, refusing to listen to the practical men who sit alongside him. Let him take the advice of the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay).</inline> I hope the primary producers will take note of those people who are trying to oppose the advancement of their interests in connexion with the Tariff. I trust the Committee will be solid on this point, and will give the Minister the discretionary power that is required. If the time arrives when the Minister finds that a fair deal is not being given to the people by the local manufacturers, and that an article is being placed on the market which is not as good as it should be, he will have in his own hands the discretionary power to place the local manufacturers at a disadvantage. He will not be constituting himself an analyst who will issue an edict that this, or that, shall be done, as the honorable member for Batman suggests. The officer who has made the analysis in this case is one of the finest analysts in Australia - in fact, I question whether he has any peer in the world as an analyst - and I am prepared to take his word in regard to it. If he says that the component parts of the article which is being made by the Bacchus Marsh Company are practically the same as those of Horlick&#39;s milk, I am  prepared to accept his assurance. He is a responsible officer, and has to discharge his duties faithfully, both from a professional and departmental stand-point. He is not influenced by politics. He is there, with his reputation at stake, to say whether the articles submitted to him are suitable or not. I intend to stand by the Australian article for all I am worth. </para>

                        <para>.- I am prepared, as I said previously, to give the fullest assistance to our local industries where proof can be given that it is warranted. This industry is already established in Australia, and, although it has not had any great aid, it has expanded very rapidly. Comparative analysis of Bacchus Marsh and Horlick&#39;s malted milk give the following figures - </para>

                    <para class="block">Thus we see that we have in Australia an industry which produces an article equal in every way to that supplied by the Horlick&#39;s Proprietary. This local industry is not only of advantage to the dairymen, but to primary producers generally. If our banana friends are entitled to the duty that has been fixed on that fruit, and if other sections of the House are entitled to the duties they desire in other directions, then this food industry is surely entitled to substantial Protection. If I felt that it was necessary in all cases to admit infants&#39; foods free, I should certainly vote for any proposal with that object, but seeing that the local product is equal in every way to the imported, we ought to encourage local manufacturers. </para>

No one will deny, I think, that I have always given genuine support to Australian industries; but in the case of infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods, no matter what the analysis may be, we cannot find &#39; two stomachs for which the analyzed food is equally suitable. </para>

                            <para>- I do not deny that; but that official does not analyze stomachs. I have known infants reared successfully on foods that were an absolute surprise to medical authorities. Indeed, I had a case in one of my own children, who is now, perhaps the healthiest of the family. There was a deficiency of mother&#39;s milk, and our medical adviser . tried various foods, including milk from our own cow. Nothing seemed to be suitable, and, finally, the doctor suggested that the child&#39;s bottle should be made up of unsweetened condensed milk. On this the child thrived, and, as - I say, is a healthy girl to-day. What analysis could cover a case like that? As to invalids&#39; foods, when I was near death a while ago, I had the greatest difficulty in getting any food to suit me ; and it was not any elaborate medical arrangement that brought me round, but a simple plan of feeding devised by the matron of the hospital. In endeavouring to develop our industries by Protection, we must be very careful, at any rate so far as infant life and the care of invalids are concerned, to provide the widest possible choice of foods. That is the principle that is guiding me in my attitude to-day. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> used an argument from a Protectionist stand-point that is altogether new to me. I was always under the impression that our industries required Protection because of dumping, or because they could not compete with commodities sent from overseas. In the present case, however, there is not only Horlick&#39;s milk, but other children&#39;s imparted foods, being sold at a higher rate than that at which the local article can be supplied. The difference in price, plus the duties, are shown in the following figures: - A comparison of wholesale prices in Melbourne, of Horlick&#39;s malted milk, imported, with local foods, on 1st January this year, shows that the present average commercial protection to Glaxo is 97.76 per cent., to Lactogen 89.96 per cent., and to Bacchus Marsh 95:81 per cent. This, it will be admitted, is fairly high Protection. I have here the price list of Messrs. Rooke, </para>
                    <para class="block">Tompsitt and Company, from which, it appears that Horlick&#39;s, No. 3 size, dutiable at 20 per cent., is sold at 216s. per dozen of  4¾  lbs. each; Mellin&#39;s, free, is sold, No. 2 size, at 25s. per dozen of 9&#189; ozs. each; Benger&#39;s, free, is sold, No. 2 size, at 47s. per dozen of 16 oz. each; Carnrick&#39;s, free, is sold, No. 3 size, at 46s. 6d. per dozen of 16oz. each; Glaxo, Australian, is sold at 15s. per dozen of <inline font-style="italic">7 oz.</inline> each, and 62s. per dozen of 2¾ lbs. each; Nestle&#39;s milk food, dutiable at 20 per cent., is sold at 25s. per dozen of 12 oz. each; and Lactogen, Australian, is sold, No. 3 size, at 62s. per dozen of 3 lbs. each. Nestle&#39;s milk food is an imported article, which has been brought under the duties, though I remember the time when it was regarded as the one invalid food for this country. Why should this food be penalized with a heavy duty at this stage ? </para>

                            <para>- That,  110  doubt, is the reason for the difference in the duty. This is really not a Protective duty, but a revenue tax on invalids and children. Never, as a Protectionist, have I favoured revenue duties through the Customs, because they do not fall on the rich, but on the parents of the largest families in Australia. I stand for Protection with the object of creating industries, and I cannot support a duty which is merely imposed for revenue purposes, and has not the industrial object in view. Even if Horlick&#39;s milk is more largely used as a beverage, that does not make it the less an infant&#39;s food. My information is that not more than 8 per cent, of it is sold for consumption as a beverage. But I am not very much concerned about this aspect of the case at all. My desire is to give the invalid and the child the best foods obtainable, no matter whence they come. In the case of medicines, duties are prescribed according to departmental by-laws, and only the other day I brought under the notice of the Minister the case of a man, a sufferer from asthma, who had read of an American cure and had obtained the preparation only to be held -up at the Customs because of the duty, </para>

I have been waiting ever since for a reply. I think that it is asking too much to expect honorable members to agree to a charge of 80 per cent, upon certain infants&#39; foods. It is about time we endeavoured to establish such industries in some other way. I am prepared to go almost to any length to protect an industry that will employ thousands of people, and I am ready to give assistance to these particular industries, but I protest against this discrimination by means of regulations, because, in my judgment, it is impossible to rear children by any Act of Parliament or regulations made under any Act. </para>

                        <para>.- I trust the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will adhere to his suggestion. At present he has discretionary power. Let us look at  this  matter quite fairly. During the whole of&#39; my thirty years&#39; experience, when I was in active practice, I never prescribed patent food for. any child. If a mother was unable to nurse her child, and unable also to obtain the best substitute - another mother - to give the child the  breast,  I recommended her to get a goat and suckle the child in that way directly. Failing that, I advised the use of pure cow&#39;s milk. I feel disposed to urge that the formula be printed upon the label of every imported patent food and every bottle of medicine, as well as every packet of patent food manufactured and sold in  the Commonwealth for child consumption. </para>

                            <para>- That argument has been used on many occasions. Any analyst of standing can determine the component parts of the average dried-milk product. I have the highest opinion of the departmental analytical chemist. He is a man of great experience and high attainments. I would vote for this item simply because any advance in protective duty will have my support. No honorable member will say that the milk produced in Australia is not as good - indeed, it is better - than milk produced, in the United Kingdom. And no one will say that the Australian workers engaged in such industries are not as intelligent as those in England. A gentleman with experience of workers in Germany, France, Great Britain, and Australia, states definitely that he has never employed more intelligent workers than he has in his factory here. I cannot imagine, any one representing a farming constituency voting against the Minister&#39;s suggestion. No one who claims to be a Protectionist can be a moderate Protectionist. Would we approve of a moderate drunkard., or of a woman who is moderately virtuous? The honorable member whose purpose is to secure revenue from the imposition of Customs duties should proclaim himself, not as a Protectionist, but as a revenue Tariffist. There is no halting-place. A Protectionist must be an absolute Protectionist. My vote shall be given to permit the Minister to have the discretionary power set out in the schedule. No doubt, he will always be guided by the advice of his departmental officers. If they can give him the assurance that the formula of what is described as an infant&#39;s food is consistent with the ingredients of such a commodity, it should remove from the minds of all any suspicion that the article is otherwise. </para>

                            <para>- -In New Zealand, the preparations permitted to be imported free as infants&#39; foods are set out in the Tariff schedule. There is an. enormous  number of foods imported into Australia. Our Trade and Customs Department has published a list of 180 approved infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods. This afternoon special attention has been drawn to what we are able to produce ourselves in this direction, and honorable members would be more consistent if they moved to strike out the item which permits the free importation of these foods at the discretion of the Minister. At any rate, if their wishes are to be carried into effect; and protection is to be afforded to local manufacturers of invalids&#39; and infants&#39; foods, it is only a fraud to retain the item. When I rose to speak a little while ago, my purpose was misconstrued. I object to power being given to the Minister which will enable him to take one article of invalids&#39; or infants&#39; food out of the free list and replace it by another simply for the purpose of affording protection to the local maker of any particular line of foods. I would be perfectly satisfied if the Minister were to do this on the ground that the article was not an invalid&#39;s or infant&#39;s food; but certain papers I have in my possession indicate that he has taken action in the past, not upon that ground, but because the free importation of an article was interfering with a local industry. Is the Minister to be given the power to destroy one. industry for the sake of giving; protection to another? The present Minister has accepted the full responsibility of having done so in regard to sheep-dip. When  ho imposed an embargo on the importation of sheep-dip, it was one of the most disgraceful things that ever happened in Australia. If/ in future, the Minister, without the consent of Parliament, can say that firms which have been established in this country for sixty or seventy  years, and have built up agencies throughout the Commonwealth, as Coopers have done, are no longer to be allowed to trade here, a system will grow up which will be worse than anything that occurred under the Tammany system of America. Of course, I am making no attack upon the integrity of the present Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> That is beyond doubt. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely pointing out that I do not doubt the present Minister&#39;s integrity in regard to the exercise of the discretion given to him by this item. In any case, he has told us that, prior to his taking office as Minister, a promise had been given in regard to sheep-dip, and I realize that, although he gave the actual instructions in that regard, he was not entirely responsible for what was done. We know the injury it occasioned. I hope that the honorable member will withdraw his amendment, and allow me to move to insert the words &#34;approved by the Analytical Department - or the Health Department, if the Minister wishes - as infants&#39; or invalids&#39; foods.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- It would overcome my objection to the item. It would require any invalids&#39; or infants&#39; food to be approved by the Government Analyst before being admitted free. I do not know Horlick&#39;s malted milk. I believe that it has been stated that it is not accepted as an infant&#39;s food in New South Wales, and I understand that there have been complaints in Victoria. The initiative should be taken by the Trade and Customs Department. If the Analytical Department will not classify Horlick&#39;s malted milk as an infant&#39;s food, it should not be allowed to come in free of duty. I am not fighting for any particular line of food. I am fighting for a principle. </para>

                        <para>.- The argument&#34; used by the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. ^Bowden)</inline> and others is that. Protection should be afforded to the local makers of infants&#39; foods; but the principle in the item is opposed to their object. The principle has been definitely laid down in the schedule that &#34; infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods as prescribed by departmental by-laws&#34; shall be admitted free. I claim, although I have had no communication from those who are directly interested in its manufacture, that Horlick&#39;s malted milk is used extensively as an infants&#39; and invalids&#39; food. I know that from experience in my own home and from what I have learned from my friends and associates in New South Wales. As a matter of fact, my own child refused to take any form of artificial food other than Horlick&#39;s malted milk. The principle having been laid down that infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods shall be admitted free, I hope that it is going to be preserved. </para>

                        <para>. -  I think that I ought to be perfectly frank with the Committee. I have said that I am willing to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> but I wish to point out that its adoption will not make the slightest difference to the position. If that amendment be carried, the words &#34; as prescribed by departmental by-laws &#34; will still be retained, so that the Minister will continue to wield exactly the powers with which he is clothed to-day. In regard to the 180 foods to which the honorable member has referred, I would remind him that only twenty-eight are now admitted free. All the others have been removed from the free list. Horlick&#39;s malted milk and Glaxo are the only artificial foods in regard to which we have  had any complaints. The manufacturers of Horlick&#39;s malted milk are a very wealthy company. </para>

It has made all artificial foods dutiable commodities, and has vested the Minister with power to exempt some of them from the payment of duty. This power has been exercised in certain instances. Similar power is vested in the Minister under every Tariff in the world. </para>

                            <para>- I do not mean my remark to apply particularly to Horlick&#39;s malted milk. But either the Customs Act itself or the Tariff confers a discretionary power upon Ministers in every country in the world. Parliament has vested the Minister with discretionary power in regard to this particular item, and it is for the Committee to say whether the existing state of things shall continue. I hope that it will. </para>

                            <para>- It represents both the letter and the spirit of it. It gives effect to the intention of this Parliament. The real issue under consideration is, &#34; Should the words &#39; as prescribed by departmental by-laws &#39; be retained ? &#34; I say that they should be, and I ask the Committee to agree to the item in the form in which it now stands. The amendment of the honorable member for Dampier, if carried, will merely add another duty to those which already devolve upon departmental officers. It will necessitate the issue . of a certificate that any particular article is an infants&#39; and invalids&#39;, food, but it will really not affect the existing position so long as the words &#34; as prescribed by departmental by-laws &#34; are retained. </para>

                        <para>. - This is merely a repetition of the fight we had upon Glaxo when the last Tariff was under consideration. Upon tha&#39;t occasion we had half-a-dozen persons assuring us that we would ruin the children if we did not admit Glaxo from New Zealand free of duty. We were solemnly told that the children must have Glaxo or they would die. Now we are informed that they must have Horlick&#39;s malted milk or they will die. What arrant humbug it is ! When we began the consideration of this schedule by imposing a duty upon alcoholic liquors we robbed the children of every man in this country, who drinks. Yet not a word was said then about the poor children. Now, however, we hear a howl about the injustice which will be done them if a duty be imposed &#39;upon Horlick&#39;s malted milk.

                    <para class="block">I can quite understand: Free Traders using such an argument, but I cannot understand it being used by Protectionists. As to the reformed drunkards who are said to want Horlick&#39;s malted mills, all I have to say is that, independent of their requirements, I have tried it myself, and found that it is not bad. But if any one cannot get Horlick&#39;s malted milk, I advise him to take a spoonful of &#34;Worcestershire sauce in the morning, and he will find that it will do him good. If enough persistence is shown, Horlicks will manufacture here, the same as in the case of the Glaxo Company. I assure honorable members that if we tax Horlicks, they will soon have an establishment in Australia. It is the same old cry. We were told that chocolates could not be manufactured in Australia ; that they would not have the same taste or appearance or general appeal to the palate as the English-made  cholocate.  But we know the position in regard to the manufacture of chocolates in Australia to-day. There was the same argument concerning imported soaps; but to-day we have Sunlight soap and other products of Lever Brothers turned out in Australia. Similar remarks could be applied to numbers of other commodities. All I would say, in conclusion, is that the Free Traders should stick to their old arguments, and that the (Protectionists should cut out cant and humbug. </para>

                        <para>.- I regretted to hear the interpretation which the Minister has placed upon the powers given to him by the similar section in the old Act to the one we are now considering. In plain English, that section means that the Department is to determine whether certain articles are infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods, and to do that only. The Minister states that the section gives him power to make certain articles dutiable or not dutiable at his discretion. I maintain that if he were to follow that&#39; course he would be guilty of a misuse of the powers given him under the section. If it is a fact that, of 184 articles which were regarded as infants&#39; and invalids&#39; foods, nearly the whole of them have been taken off the list, and now have to pay duty, such action amounts undoubtedly to a misuse of the Minister&#39;s powers. The section reads plainly enough, and the only discretionary power that should lie with the Minister is in respect of the determination whether or not a certain article comes under the head of infants&#39; and invalids&#39; food. And, if it does, it should be admitted free. The use of this power by the Minister in order to make some of these foods dutiable because certain manufacturers may have made representations to him is establishing a very dangerous precedent. </para>

                        <para>. - I have in my hand a copy of the first Tariff introduced in the history of the Commonwealth. I would like the Minister to show me a single indication that he has been given the power which he is claiming under the new Tariff. I have gone through the greater portion of the 1907 schedule as submitted to Parliament, and can find- no indication of any such power. I want to impress the Committee with the serious fact that a practice has developed which amounts to autocratic control by the Department in respect of almost every item. Either by way of regulation or by the Minister&#39;s decision, a system has. been evolved whereby an exceedingly heavy embargo is being placed upon trade. It should be for this Parliament, and Parliament alone, to fix duties; and the Tariff schedule should be as simple as it can possibly be made. Every person interested in the importation of anything into the Commonwealth should know exactly what he must pay by way of duty. There should be no log-rolling through the medium of a member of Parliament, or by way of departmental officials. During the past few days I have been reading through the particulars of the Tariffs of four or five different countries. They are all very simple, and traders generally are under no difficulty in ascertaining their exact position with respect to any and every item. To-day, the Australian importer has to battle with an enormous accumulation of difficulties emanating from constant streams of departmental instructions. In order to place the sole responsibility for fixing a duty upon the proper shoulders, namely, those of the Parliament, I move - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may see for himself. I know that the Minister is in a difficult position. He is differently situated from any of his colleagues. He has to compete with unscrupulous persons who are out to fleece the public by any and every means, including, the wrong description of their articles upon labels. At the time of discussing the 1908 Tariff, it was deemed advisable that the Minister for Customs should be given power to deal with unscrupulous people, and I consider that it was wise to give him such power. We have to place confidence in the Minister for Customs and  his departmental officials. I&#39; defy any Parliament to frame a Tariff so simply that it will not require the tact and wisdom of the Customs officials to insure smooth working. During my Federal parliamentary career, I have had much to do with Customs officials, and have always found them very capable and trustworthy. When I was a child, there were none of these patent infant foods, and the mother who could not give her offspring milk had to obtain it from the nearest dairy. It is only of late years that these patent nostrums have been considered necessary, and if half of them were done away with the children would be better off. At the present time, infants&#39; foods are admitted free of duty, but a commodity that can be used for other purposes than the feeding of infants, although described as an infants&#39; food, is dutiable. Most of the patent foods, we are told, have milk as their basis. I am one of those who, when passing a cow, are inclined to lift their hats, because of the value of that animal to the human race. Our dairy products are the equal of any in the world, and why should we not make here the infant foods required by the community ? Malted milk is now for sale in every refreshment room in Sydney, many persons being forced to drink it because they cannot get a glass of beer after 6 o&#39;clock at night. Personally,&#34; I do not like it, and would prefer to drink beer, which cannot be said to have done me much harm, for I have been a beer drinker throughout my long life. </para>

Without a provision such as that to which he objects, a Tariff becomes an absolutely rigid instrument. There may be no doubt as to the duties  imposed by Parliament, though difficulty of interpretation nevertheless arises from time to time, but all sorts of hardship occurs if there is not provision for give and take, and this was recognised from the very beginning, the Minister being given a discretionary power in regard to many items. The exercise of this power throws on him a grave responsibility, and requires due caution; but I have not heard of any case of abuse. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister, hy the exercise of his discretionary power, saved an important industry in my electorate. During the war, two enterprising men from New Zealand established works at Botany for the manufacture of gelatine, using a byproduct which was previously a nuisance to the community. The Japanese were making gelatine from seaweed, and it was being admitted free. Had not the Minister exercised &#39;his discretionary power, the Japanese gelatine would have swamped the market, and those who had put their capital into the works at Botany - one of the largest gelatine works in the Empire - would have lost it. By his action the Minister preserved their occupation for 500 or 600 persons, who were employed under the best conditions. </para>

                            <para>- Parliament was not sitting, and the local firm would have been ruined if Protection had not been given to it before Parliament could be summoned. An ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory. The action taken by the Minister did no injury to the community, and put an important industry on a. sound footing. It would be a mistake to take from the Minister discretionary power. Any misuse of that power must be accounted for to Parliament. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> has given an instance which affords the strongest reason for taking this discretionary power from the Minister for Trade and Customs. During the war, Parliament was sitting almost &#39;constantly, and, had the Minister wished action to-be taken for the preservation of any industry, he had only to propose an amendment of the Tariff schedule. That would have taken effect immediately, and would have remained operative until Parliament had otherwise determined. What members now have to consider is whether Parliament shall be supreme in regard to the Tariff, or whether the Minister is to be allowed to alter the Tariff in compliance with the requests of individuals. In the interests of the Minister himself I hope the amendment may be carried. </para>

                <para class="block">The increase I propose is equivalent to 9d. per bushel, and the reason for my amendment will be apparent to most honorable members. Maize-growing, in many parts of Australia, is of as much importance to people on the land as the wheat industry is in other districts. We have by the imposition of protective duties for some years past been trying to build up industries for the manufacture of maize into several products utilized in the Commonwealth.. The farmers engaged in the cultivation of maize desire that the industry should be stabilized, by the prevention of dumping from foreign countries which might lead to their crops being held over until they would be destroyed by weevil. America, South Africa, and India are large producers of maize; and if maize from those countries were dumped into Australia at a time when the local yield was high, the imported article might be used in the secondary industries and the local crop left to stand over, and so be destroyed by weevil, because, as honorable members are aware, maize will not keep for any length of time. Arrangements were made with South Africa by which South African maize may be permitted into Australia under more favorable conditions than maize grown in other parts of the world. I understand from the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has gone into this matter, that after the Tariff now under consideration is passed that privilege will be withdrawn. Maize-growing is already a big industry in. Australia, and will extend. It is an industry which immigrants or returned soldiers may take up, because the cultivation of maize does not involve the same amount of expenditure as the cultivation of many other products of the soil. Plenty of land suitable for the growth of maize is available, and all that is necessary to greatly encourage the industry is that it should be stabilized in such a way that there will be an assured local market tor it, and that it will not have to compete with maize dumped here from other parts of the world. I understand that those engaged in the secondary industries, of which maize is a raw material, have no objection to the increase of duty I propose, as they are .satisfied that they will be able to depend on production in Australia for all the maize they require. </para>

                        <para>- That has been necessary in the past, because the maize-growing, industry has not been stabilized. On that account, a number who were growing maize gave up growing it. I have had many years&#39; experience of the industry, and I may say &#91; have never known a time when things looked brighter for the maize-grower than they do at present. We have by protective duties encouraged the establishment of industries for products of maize such as that of the company established at Footscray, by imposing a  duty  of 3d. per lb. on rice to be manufactured into starch. The result of the imposition of that duty was to make it practically compulsory that starch used in Austral&#39;a should be manufactured from maize instead of from rice, which is produced by black labour. In America 98 per cent, of the starch <inline font-style="italic">wed</inline> is .made from maize. Another product manufactured from maize is glucose, and we recently increased the Protection on that art: ck from &#163;8 to &#163;12 per ton. The protective duties already imposed on manufactures of maize have induced people to invest large sums in their manufacture. 1 understand that the factory at Footscray to which I have referred could not be built to-day for under about &#163;90,000. There were factor es in Victoria and in the other States, such as Harper Bros, and others, engaged in manufacturing starch from rice; and I understand that they are now altering their plants to enable them to manufacture the article from maize. To make this industry safe for the grower and the manufacturer wo require an assurance that the grower will be able to secure a market for his crop which will not be suddenly interfered with by the dumping of maize grown in other parts of the world, and an assurance for the manufacturer that sufficient maize will be grown here to meet his  requrements.  To show that we run no risk in this respect, I may say that manufacturers are making contracts twelve months ahead with maize-growers to buy from them the maize they require. We have any amount of good land in Australia suitable for the product on of  maize;  but our cost of labour in the industry is higher than it is in the countries growing the maize that comes into competition with what is grown in Australia. I hope that honorable members will be prepared to assist the primary and secondary industries dealing w t,11 maize by agreeing to the increased duty I propose to prevent dumping. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member said that returned soldiers could go in for maize cultivation because of the small expenditure necessary. It is one of the cheapest crops to grow, and is, perhaps, most frequently grown with pumpkins in the same field, lt is a crop, also, which give3 very good returns. There is a considerable area in Australia of suitable land, with a good  rainfall,  for the production of maize, and under existing conditions the maize-growers are doing well. Since we have had Protection for the secondary industries using maize as a raw material the growers of maize have had a good market for their product in Au&#39;tralia. I am glad that that has been so, but I do net des re that the production of maize should be extended at the expense of what is undoubtedly the greatest industry in Australia, and that is stock-raising. There are times when stock, and particularly sheep, are dependent absolutely on the importation of maize and other grain. Any man who has had anything to do with stock in drought time&#39; is aware that the cheapest and most effective way of feeding stock is with grain. The old method of feeding stock with chaff has gone out, and, while lucerne hay is good feed, it is rather hard to place it in the right way. </para>

                            <para>- Stock-owners want to be able to import maize for their stock whenever it is necessary to do so. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> has appealed to the Country party, as representing the primary producers, to support the proposed increase, but primary producers who take a general view of the position of primary production in Australia must vote against it, since, while it might put a few pounds into the pockets of a few hundred people, it would take thousands of pounds out of the pockets of hundreds of others and go a long way  towards damaging the greatest producing industry in Australia. In time of drought, hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent&#39; on the feeding of stock. 1 could take honorable members to one station in New South Wales, where during a drought over &#163;70,000 was spent - to a large extent on maize - in. trying to keep the stock alive. During the Inst drought in New South Wales the majority of stock-owners, after trying various forms of feeding, came to the conclusion that Indian corn or maize was the best of all foods for their stock. If you feed with the smaller grain, trailing it along the ground, which is the most effective method, a great deal of it is lost; but Indian corn is so large that it is easy for the stock to pick it up, and they do well on it. I would urge the Minister not to be led away by this appeal on the part of the honorable member for Wide Bay for an increased duty, which, 1 repeat, would benefit a few hundred people, but do very grave injury to what is the greatest of all industries in Australia at the present time. </para>

                        <para>.- If the honorable member for Wide  Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> succeeded in carrying his proposal for an increased duty, he would find in the long run that the benefits which he predicts would  be derived from it were purely illusory. In time of drought, when the duty would have a protective incidence, a demand would be made for its removal,- and there can be no doubt- that it would be suspended or removed. As the grower of another cereal for over twenty years, I. can say that the only time within my experience when the duty on corn would have been of any service, it was removed in the interests of the consuming public. The honorable member must recognise that the duty  would  be of sen-ice to the maize-growing industry only in time of drought, and with a drought upon us the odds are ten to one that it would be removed. The  primary  producer it  seems  must always &#34; knuckle down &#34; to the interests of other people, whether it be in the matter of a duty on machinery or anything else. The primary producer is not to be helped in this &#34;In v. He can ho helped, however, under other items of this schedule, and also in connexion with the taxation of the Commonwealth. During recent years  most farmers have had to pay, by way of taxation, just about three times as much as that paid by citizens who receive their income regularly by way of salary or fees. That is a scandal. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> need press his amendment. The present duty on maize appears to be adequate. I find that, during the year 1912-13, we imported 634,903 bushels; in 1913-14, 152,949 bushels; in 1914-15, 816,290 bushels; and in 1915-16, a year of drought, when we had to make special arrangements for the hand-feeding of our stock in order to save them, 1,922,240 bushels. After the -drought had broken and .We returned to normal times, the importations of maize fell away enormously. In 1916-17 only 53,493 bushels were imported; and in 1917-38, 1,807 bushels. The value of our imports of this commodity in 1916-17 - the year after the drought - was only &#163;8,162, while in 1317-18 our importations were valued at only &#163;770. </para>

                            <para>- Freights may have had something to do with the reduction in our imports, but taking these official figures as a guide, it seems to me that the existing duty will fully protect our maize-growers. We do not want to impose unnecessary duties. </para>

                        <para>.- Whilst sympathizing with the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> I cannot vote for his amendment, knowing as I do that such a duty as he proposes would become effective only when we were practically starved out. It is not many years since I and other honorable members - particularly from Queensland - urged the Minister for Trade and Customs to remit the duty, and to allow maize to come in free, in order that our starving stock might be saved. That request was granted, with the result that ship-loads of maize from the Argentine were brought into New South Wales and Queensland, and helped us to save our stock. </para>

                            <para>- I know the farmers down here want the most up-to-date machinery, but many of the best farmers in Queensland have had to do without the latest ma&#187;chinery. Relying on pure Scotch navigation - pig-headedness and a long hoe - they have grown maize to perfection, . planting it by hand. If drought overtook the country, the Minister would at once be asked to remove or suspend the duty. That has been done before. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope the honorable member will not press the amendment. I considered . this matter - very carefully when framing the Tariff. This is the first time that maize, as an item, appears on the Tariff at all. I recognise, as the honorable member does, that the maize industry is very useful to small settlers in suitable areas. I thought the  best  means to protect the industry, although I did raise the duty slightly, was to give a generous measure of protection to those secondary industries which have been built up in this country, and which will take the surplus maize off the market at periods that come along from time to time when more maize is produced than the country can consume. My experience of maize-growing was that there were seasons when the grower could&#39; get a decent price, and other seasons when he could not get a good price at all, particularly for the softer corn grown in the coastal areas. That corn will not keep indefinitely, or as well as that grown in areas further inland, and it was a question&#39; of either getting rid of it at what one&#34; could get for it or letting the weevils take it. It is a fact that maize is very largely used in periods of stress in this country. The figures which have already been quoted show that there is no material import of maize except at those periods. . If the honorable member succeeded in imposing a relatively high duty - I do not say that he is asking for an; exorbitant one - on maize under normal conditions, the cry that would be raised for the removal of the duty at crucial periods would be a far stronger one, and would more probably be listened to, than if we retained the comparatively moderate duty now contained in this Tariff. It is 100 per cent, higher than it was on the South African product, and it is from that country -that the greater part of the imported maize comes. The duty on maize in the South African Tariff was1s. We have now made it 2s., and there we propose to leave it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If the honorable member succeeded in making the duty 3s. 6d., and a period of drought arrived, I am certain that the Government of the day would say to those who asked for the removal of the duty, &#34; We cannot refuse your request,&#34; whereas with the present moderate duty it would be a fair thing to say, if maize grown by black labour was being brought in, that the people here should get the import parity, plus the duty. The honorable member would therefore be serving his people best by allowing this item to stand, and supporting, as he has done, those duties which, by benefiting the secondary industries, form the best protection for the primary industry itself. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry the Minister does not see his way to accept the amendment, or that I have not had support from the Country party which I felt sure I would get. I know that those members have been asked -by  the-  people in their districts  to  support  my  proposal. The growers there are in  a  different position from those in Victoria, who have  all  the land cleared. Hundreds of men had  to  fell the scrub, and then, after burning it  off,  had to  go  out with  a hoe,  and put the corn in  by  hand. They also had to take the crop off without any machine;, in fact,  all  the work is done  by  hand. . My idea was  to  encourage men of  that  class  to go  on  to  the land, and make a start,  by  giving them some security that when the maize was harvested they would not have  to  take  an  inadequate price for it. If, however, those who ought  to  support the primary producers will not support  my  amendment, 1 have no alternative but  to  ask leave  to  withdraw it. </para>

                        <para>.- I  Understood  the Minister  to  say,, on the previous item, that he would make provision in this item for patent&#39; groats and barley. I wish  to  direct his attention also to corn flour, on which we are putting  a duty  of 2d.  all  round. It is claimed  by  those concerned that  a  little heavier duty is required in order  to  prevent the American article from coming here in competition with our own. We grow here  all  the cereals necessary for the manufacture  of  corn flour, and yet America is sending in  a  good quantity  at a  fair value. It is suggested that the duty should  be  increased to 2&#189;d. British preferential Tariff, 3d. intermediate Tariff, and &#39;4d. general Tariff. It is suggested also that there is no reason why Semolina should  be  listed as free under the British preferential Tariff, and that we should omit the line &#34;Semolina,&#34;  and  substitute in its- place &#34; Cereal Breakfast Foods, in packets, 2&#189;d. British preferential Tariff,&#39; 3d&#39;. . intermediate Tariff,  and  4d. . general Tariff.&#34; Several lines- of cereal breakfast foods are imported, such as Quaker Oats, which are classified for duty under sub-item e, n.e.i, and carry a duty of only 1&#189;d. per lb. Many large factories in Australia are manufacturing oatmeal, flaked oats, rolled oats,, and various . other kinds of cereal breakfast foods. It is urged that the industry should be effectively protected from American competition by inserting the new sub-item I have indicated. In that way primary products will be prepared and used in Australia on the breakfast table, instead of foreign-grown and foreign-prepared cereals taking their place here to the value of something over &#163;10,000 per annum in normal times. I make these suggestions to the Minister so that he may consider them before he speaks. </para>

                        <para>. - I propose to submit two amendments, which, to a great extent, will meet the desires of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> So far as corn flour is concerned, I have received no request from the manufacturers, and I understand that they are satisfied with the duty of 2d., which is, in my opinion, a fairly high one. I see that the average price of imported corn flour before the war was 3¾d. per lb., and this duty represents nearly 50 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member will look down the Tariff memorandum, he will see that this duty was carried up from the provisions which came into force on and after10th August., 1917, but that was not noticed at the time. This duty was a special war condition which no longer exists; and an amendment I propose to submit will have the effect of placing semolina where it always was as a dutiable article. That is not said in so many words,, but that will be the effect of the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to know the revenue that comes into the exchequer from this item. As a matter of fact, its importation, as a rule, does infinitely more harm than good. Many of the pests with which we have to contend, and which have done millions of pounds&#39; worth of harm, were imported in hay, chaff, and seed. There is no real protection, or even assistance, given by this duty, which, in my opinion, only cumbers the Tariff. This is not the way in which the grower of hay and chaff can be assisted. I would not be one to impose this duty when there was starving stock in Australia. If any one wished to import chaff in competition with the Australian grower, this duty will not prevent him. </para>

The local Government seized it at 6s. 8d., and imported Argentine stuff at 12s. 4d., and the Federal Government removed the duty that was in my favour in order to favour the general public. In the face of these experiences, one looks on these duties with a certain feeling of amusement. </para>

                        <para>.- This  small duty is not going to benefit the industry. Personally, I would welcome absolute prohibition, of the importation of hay and chaff. We know what happened during the 1914 drought, when many weeds were brought in which we have been unable to exterminate. Very great care should be taken to see that hay and chaff imported are free from these pests. In my own district, where small quantities of fodder came in during the drought, we can see traces of the weeds all over the countryside. </para>

                        <para>.- A little while ago I was speaking strongly in favour of as low a Tariff as possible for corn, and now I wish to support the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> in his contention that the importation of hay and chaff should be prohibited. I do this for the same reason which actuated me in proposing to keep down the duty on corn. The introduction of corn brings in no pests, whereas any practical man knows that hay and chaff bring in innumerable specimens. There are such weeds in Australia that have cost, and will cost, hundreds of thousands to destroy - the consequence of careless importation. The point is, however, that, no matter how careful we are, by no method of analysis can we detect all those dangers. For instance, dodder in lucerne has defied any method of inspection, and there are other pests, which do not occur to me at the moment, but which are quite a3  dangerous. When  chaff  is introduced, as in New South </para>

                    <para>Wale3 during the drought a few years ago, it is found in nearly every case to be more or less useless, not worth putting out to feed stock. Then, further, such importations are certainly dangerous from the producers&#39; point of view; and the Government would be well advised, despite the fact that it is necessary to introduce corn in times of drought, to prohibit the importation of hay and chaff, which at best are only used as a substitute for the more concrete, if I may so term it, forms of feeding. </para>

I promise honorable members, however, to give consideration to the matter, and see whether we should not go the whole length of entire prohibition. For feeding stock, imported hay and chaff are precious little  good;  and I thoroughly agree that the most economical feed we can import is probably grain or cake of some kind., </para>

Our industries should not be subjected to unfair competition. These commodities are the product of hard wheat, and as we can produce the raw material in unlimited quantities, and equal in quality to the hard wheats from any other. part of the world, except, perhaps, some of the provinces of Canada, we&#39; ought to do what we can to encourage our own manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- I have already increased the duty 100 per cent, for the purpose of accomplishing what the honorable members have in view, as I believe the imported macaroni is manufactured elsewhere under conditions that would not be countenanced in Australia. It is difficult to get the exact figures, but we used to import over 500,000 lbs. of these commodities yearly, though in 1918-19 the figure dropped to 81,000 lbs. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I understand there was some slight advance in importations in 1919-20 ; but, on the other hand, the Australian production has risen to 2.240,000 lbs. I think it likely  that if we put a little higher duty on the general Tariff, the position would be met. </para>

                            <para>- No. The intermediate rate is inserted for bargaining purposes, but we do not propose to enter into any reciprocal Tariff arrangements without the approval of Parliament. If we see a chance of doing trade with any other country with some of our primary products upon which, say, there is a high Tariff, we can negotiate, using this intermediate Tariff as a basis upon which to bargain. If such negotiations are satisfactory, the arrangement will be embodied in a Bill, and presented to Parliament. In regard to this item, if it is the wish of the Committee, I am prepared to increase also the intermediate Tariff, and I therefore move - </para>

We took the Tariff exactly as it stood, but no manufacturer packs 100 matches in a box.. They are packed in either larger or smaller quantities, and so we propose now to bring the wording of the Tariff into conformity with the usual trade practice, because there is reason to believe that, hitherto, the duty has been evaded to some extent. This amendment will not, except in regard to the larger boxes, increase the rates. I move - </para>

                        <para>.- I ask the Minister . to consent to the substitution of- the . word kernels&#34; for &#34; unshelled &#39;.&#39;. in . paragraph <inline font-style="italic">v,</inline> and . the word &#34; unshelled &#34; for kernels &#34;&#39; in paragraphe. The effect of the alteration would be to make the duty on kernels 2d., 2d., and 3d., and on unshelled nuts, 4d., 4d. and 6d. in the respective columns. The. reasons for these, alterations are - As to paragraph d, nut kernels- are imported mostly for manufacturing &#39; purposes, being used extensively by confectioners, pastrycooks, and biscuit and cake manufacturers. Although almonds are grown in various parts :.of Australia, yet the total crop at no time has approached within 50 per cent, of the consumption. Owing to the high cost of labour and the difficulty of removing the kernel in a sound condition, only a small proportion are offered unshelled. - A large manufacturer has repeatedly tried to purchase his requirements without success; in fact, twelve months&#39; purchases are not equal to one-twelfth of his consumption. As to paragraph e, nuts in shells are mostly used for dessert purposes. The bulk of the Australian crop is sold for this trade owing to the reluctance of the grower to undertake the removal of the nut from the shell. Pastes and meals are made locally from the kernel, and, therefore, should be protected. The alteration asked&#39; for would not make much difference to the Tariff, but would certainly make it more acceptable to&#39; those in teres ted in the confectionery and kindred trades.- </para>

                        <para>.- The peanut-growing industry is becoming somewhat important in the&#39;  north.  A friend of mine, who has 25 acres under peanuts, expects before long to have at least 100 acres under the same crop. He tells me that the nuts come&#39; out of the ground perfectly white, and ready to go on the market, and that the tops form the best food cattle could have. I am told that cattle fattened on peanut tops are fit to go into any show in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">The Peanut Promoter,</inline> a journal which is devoted entirely to the peanut industry of America,- givesIlustrations of the various classes of machinery employed in handling the nuts, and contains a photograph of a convention of peanut-growers called for the purpose of promoting the industry. In the United -States of America there are 1,250,000 acres under peanuts, and the estimated yield in 1920 was 450,000 tons. In addition, a large area is. hogged down. That is&#39; to say, pigs are turned into the crops to be fattened. The United States of America also imports 70,000,000 lbs. of peanuts, principally from Japan and Manchuria. At Marrickville, in Sydney, a large factory has been built for treating peanuts and extracting peanut oil. lt produces milk, butter, and an oil which, when refined, is equal for salad-making purposes to the best olive oil. It is significant that the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Y ear-Book</inline> makes no mention of this splendid edible product. But it is not merely an edible product. Only the best nuts go into the market for edible purposes. The others are used for the purpose of extracting oil. Even in America, where the industry is so well established, the growers are asking for protection against imported peanuts and last week Australian growers asked me to put in a plea for a duty of &#39; 6d. per lb. on . nuts used for the extraction of oil. The nuts treated at the Marrickville factory are mainly imported ; but the factory can readily take all that can be produced in Australia. However, the growers are asking for an increased duty of1d. per lb. The bulletin of the United States of America Bureau of Agriculture shows that from November, 1919, to August, 1920, the importation of peanuts into the States amounted to- shelled, 66,021,965 lbs.; unshelled, 13,291,017 lbs. These figures indicate what a big industry it is. An increase of1d. per lb. on the duty imposed here would considerably help to promote the peanut-growing industry in Australia. We import nuts from Japan and Manchuria, where wages are 6d. to 9d. per day, whereas labour in Queensland costs 14s. to 16s. per day. The request of the growers is a very reasonable one, and I hope the Minister will grant it. </para>

                            <para>-  The latest figures in iny possession relate to production for the year 1917, but I know that there has been&#39; a considerable increase since then. In the last year for which statistics are available, 239,306 lbs. of peanuts were produced in Queensland. There is also a considerable production . in New South Wales, but I do not know exactly what it amounts to. I. do know, however,&#39; that large areas have been put under peanuts since these figures were compiled. One may safely say that the production to-day is quite double what it was in 1917. I have no special figures relating to imports. </para>

                        <para>.- I know that Captain Baird has recently formed a company which is about to undertake the cultivation of peanuts at Cooktown upon a large scale. I understand that the Minister is willing to increase the duty upon unshelled nuts by1d. per lb. under the general Tariff, and to increase the duty under the intermediate Tariff by. an equal amount. If that be so, his proposal -will meet with general approval. </para>

The words to which the honorable member has directed attention would be so much surplusage in the schedule which we are now considering, because the Customs Act provides that under the Tariff the highest duty which can be charged upon any  goods  shall be charged.

I am sorry that I have no film with which to entertain honorable members during the dinner adjournment. Had I been able to present a moving picture of the onion-growing industry, honorable members would be struck with the fact that, whereas men employed in banana-growing were seen travelling about the country in motor cars, onion-growers would be depicted crawling along on their knees weeding their holdings. The industry is suffering perhaps more than any other primary industry in Australia. In my desire to secure increased duties, I feel certain that </para>

At present the price of onions is &#163;3 per ton. That is an unprofitable figure; it is impossible to grow onions and market them for such a return. The industry is not one which is carried on upon any large scale. Generally, only a few acres are sown, probably in conjunction with dairying and mixed farming. Present prices for onions are having the effect of driving growers into a strong association. They have had to combine for their own protection. </para>

The production cost is about &#163;30 per acre, which is approximately the same as in the case of bananas. But the return from the latter amounts to about &#163;180 per acre, while for onions the return varies from nothing to &#163;100.

                            <para>- They are not. I shall furnish honorable members with statistics concerning costs of cultivation. This involves, ploughing, scarifying, harrowing, and, by other means, working the soil; and the cost is calculated at &#163;2 , 10s. 6d. per acre. The cost of seed is &#163;11s. ; that is to say, 3 lbs. to the acre at 7s. per lb. Sowing with hand drill costs 8s. per acre. Cleaning during the growing stage, based on a wage of1s.6d. per hour, amounts to &#163;8. Skinning costs 103. per acre. Bags for a 6-ton crop are calculated to cost &#163;4 4s. per acre. Twine, and sewing bags, on the basis of a 6-ton crop, means an outlay of11s. 6d. Stripping, at the rate of ls. per bag, amounts to &#163;3 12s. Carting to the railway station, at the rate of 7s. per ton, involves an expenditure of &#163;2 2s. Loading and weighing, together, add a further 9s. The total cost per acre for growing and placing on trucks is set down at &#163;30 Ss. lt is calculated that the average annual area under onion crop in Australia is 6,000 acres, and that the average yield is 4&#189; tons to the acre. Taking the return at 6 tons to the acre - the present price being &#163;3 per ton - the oniongrower&#39;s return amounts to only &#163;18, while his costs are more than &#163;30 per acre. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will agree to an increase of the duty from ls. 6d. per cwt. to 6s. per cwt. - that is, to &#163;6 per ton. Honorable members may be interested to know that Australians get most of their onions from Japan. Importations from that country last year amounted to 43,796 cwt., valued at &#163;32,631. The total importations for  19.19-20  were  55,245  cwt., valued at &#163;39,326. From the United Kingdom we got only  62  cwt., valued at &#163;60. From New Zealand, 7,S92 cwt., valued at &#163;4,363; from other British countries, 49 cwt., valued at &#163;61 ; from China, 32 cwt., valued at &#163;50; and from the United States of America, 3,053 cwt., valued at &#163;1,695. The enormous preponderance of our importations came, as I have just shown, from Japan. The local objection is not in respect of importations from countries where the produce is grown by white labour, but there is a very great objection to the great proportion of our imports coming from Japan. There, the onions are grown under conditions which, if the Australian consumer were aware of them, would put an end to his desire to purchase the Japanese product. The cultivation is carred on in very small lots, generally in back-yards; and I am not willing to indicate the kind of manure used. The. Australian industry requires adequate protection, or it will be crushed. I ask for a substantial increase. Deputation after deputation has waited on the Minister for Customs from different districts in Victoria, which State grows practically the whole of the Australian produce of this kind. If the onion-growers were to ask for the same degree of protection as the banana-growers succeeded in getting, their request would be for a duty of about &#163;9 per ton. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> that the duty on onions should be at least &#163;6 per ton; indeed, I would prohibit the importation of onions. There is an immense area of land in Australia on which onions can be grown, but, unfortunately, growers now get a price which hardly compensates them for their labour. The growing of onions is difficult and expensive, and we should do all we can to assist the growers. </para>

                    <para>Most of the work of the onion-grower has to be done on hands and knees; to grow onions effectively one has almost to crawl over his land. Onion-growing can be carried on profitably only in connexion with dairying and on small areas - areas of about 10 acres. The rental for onion land goes from &#163;7 to &#163;10 an acre, and this year onion-growers are losing at the rate of &#163;12 an acre. </para>

The industry is a necessary one, and needs encouragement. We have always favoured industries which enable the small man to go on the land, and onion-growing is an occupation for men with little capital. It calls for hard work, and the product, which is a perishable one, has to be marketed between April and November, those months being included. We should protect our growers from the competition of Japanese onions, which are imported about July or August. </para>

                        <para>.- With your permission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Chairman,</inline> I desire to make a personal explanation in regard to an attack made upon me by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who charged me wilh giving incorrect information to the Department in connexion with a matter to which I previously referred. At that time, I had the schedule issued prior to the one which was adopted by this Parliament, and I was pointing out the change that was being- made. I find that in this schedule there is one item in the first portion and two or three towards the end that are on the free list, as well as others. I rather resented the statement of the Minister when he asked the Committee to believe that I was not right in the statement I was making, because I have endeavoured to be very careful. I have not the privileges of the Minister in dealing with matters of this kind, but I have always endeavoured to be as fair as one can possibly be in dealing with questions of this description. </para>

                    <para>In connexion with the duty on rennet, honorable members will notice that importations in liquid form are subject to a duty of 6s., 7s., and 8s. per gallon, and n.e.i. 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 40 per cent. I uttered some very strong statements in connexion with this matter in the general debate, and I now desire to refer to the action of the Minister - who was probably advised by his departmental officers - in placing an embargo on the importation of goods, particularly when the Minister assumes the power to place embargoes on importations on the advice of the officers of his Department. Rennet is a commodity required in connexion with the manufacture of cheese, which is one of the big industries of this country. The Minister, probably at the behest of the Department, placed an embargo on the importation of rennet into Australia. It is a very difficult proposition to make good rennet, especially when the veils are not available for the purpose. I have in my possession nearly a hundred statements, which have been received from all parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and some from South Australia, complaining of the action of the Department in imposing an embargo on rennet, and which was shortly afterwards removed. I mention this to show that the Minister and his officers can also make mistakes, because when they found that their action was destructive to the industry, &#39;the embargo was removed. I lay particular stress upon the action of the Department in this instance,  because I desire to emphasize the necessity of the power being placed in the hands of the Parliament instead, of the Minister. The Minister recognised that principle when dealing with carbide, because he submitted a motion to Parliament when it was decided to place an embargo on the importation of carbide. When one considers the peculiar difficulties surrounding the manufacture of rennet in a country such as Australia, it must be admitted that special provision should be made in the Tariff to protect such an important industry.

                        <para>. - I trust the Committee will not agree to the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> I admit that the manufacture of rennet is more or less a difficult process, but I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that during the war the cheese-making industry would have come to an abrupt termination if the local manufacturers had not set to work to manufacture rennet. A considerable quantity was made, and it was found by the cheese manufacturers to be entirely satisfactory, although there were isolated cases where it was not so. It is a delicate process, and the production of the veils was difficult work, which required to be handled by men of long experience before the satisfactory nature of the veils could be guaranteed. Since the time to which the honorable member referred, when there were complaints, a number of people have been devoting a good deal of attention to the production of this necessary commodity. The New South Wales Abattoirs Board has given attention to the matter, and it is now turning out a thoroughly satisfactory vell, so that if our supplies should be cut off at a moment&#39;s notice one of our great primary industries is not likely to suffer very severely. Now that the industry has been established and is employing a large number of men, I think it would be a retrograde step to place this article on the free list. </para>

We can only say, looking back on our experience in connexion! with this matter, that it is desirable to continue the manufacture of rennet in the Commonwealth, and we should, therefore, give the industry some encouragement, particularly when the actual quantity used is comparativelysmall. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the amendment will be rejected. During the war it fell to my lot to visit the Commonwealth Laboratory, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the CommonwealthAnalyst, who did magnificent work during the war, was successful in manufacturing: rennet, if he did not originate its manufacture, in Australia. The British Government had said that owing to the necessity for conserving shipping space we should, as far as practicable, supply our own requirements in Australia. It was impossible during the war for makers of cheese in this country to import rennet, and, but for its manufacture here, cheese-making in this country would have come to a standstill. If at any time an attempt is made to take undue advantage of manufacturers of cheese in Australia, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will have in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> a gentleman&#39;-who will be fully competent to advise him. Now that we are practically self-contained in connexion with the manufacture of cheese, we certainly . should not allow rennet made in Denmark and in other countries to be admitted free of duty to the Commonwealth. We should give some protection to those who have gone to the trouble and expense of manufacturing rennet in Australia. They have produced an article which is satisfactory to our cheese-makers, and it has not been found that the quality of Australian cheese has deteriorated as a result of the use of Australian-made rennet. The rennet industry is a valuable adjunct to the more important industry of cheese-making, and we should do what we can to protect it. </para>

                        <para>.- It is right enough to protect the great cheese-making industries, but we shall not do so by imposing a duty on rennet. In imposing this duty the Minister for Trade and. Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is departing from an important principle of the Tariff. Under the item immediately before that which we are now considering a number of articles of manufacture are made dutiable, but the raw material essential to their  manufacture is admitted free. Rennet is essential to the manufacture of cheese. It ia not a big item, but it is an essential factor in the manufacture of cheese, and we should have the best we can obtain. We cannot expect to compete with other countries in manufactured articles if we do not use the best materials. The Minister should recognise the principle that the raw materials of an industry should be admitted free of duty. The manufacture of rennet can never be a very big industry, but cheese-making is a very important industry, and we should consider it in dealing with this question. </para>

I have here a sheaf of correspondence from all the principal butter factories and dairymen&#39;s associations of the Commonwealth, protesting against a duty on rennet. We should be guided largely by what these people have to -say. I ; shall read one letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Cameron, representative in London of the &#39;Victorian Butter Factories Association, as it is typical of the other correspondence that has been received. </para>

                        <para>With reference to the impost of a duty of 8s. per gallon on foreign manufactured rennet and 6s. per gallon on British manufactured rennet, I wish to draw attention to the fact that this is an injustice to the cheese producers of Australia. 1 understand that- one of the principal objects in imposing this duty is to foster local manufacture. To carry this out it means that it will cost the producers of Australia thousands of pounds.&#39; This does not altogether seem a fair proposition, more especially as it is made with the object of bolstering up an industry that will never be a success for the following reasons: - </para>

                                <para>There are not sufficient calf veils obtainable in Australia, for the reason that the dairyman does not as a rule kill all his calves. He invariably keeps the best heifer calves, and if the price of stock is a payable one he will not kill the steer calves either, and even when he does kill them he will not bother about saving the veils, as the price obtainable for these is so low. For calf veils to be <inline font-style="italic">good</inline> they have to he taken when the calf is a few days old. The law of the country here prevents the selling of calves under a certain weight. Consequently, the calf . has to. be kept until it is too old before being killed, and on this account a great many of the veils are useless. Again, it is impossible to . rely upon the veils, as the climatic conditions are against them. . In Continental countries the veils are taken from the coldest climates, such as the north of Russia, . and they are taken when the calves are very young. </para>

The latter  can be proved by the evidence of the principal manufacturers of cheese. Even if the locally manufactured article could be made of the same strength, there is not anything like enough to supply the requirements. </para>

                    <para class="block">All this correspondence goes to show that the rennet that is being manufactured in Australia does not meet the requirements of local cheese manufacturers. I am of opinion that in the circumstances foreign-made rennet should be allowed to come into Australia free. The cheese manufacturers of this country say that unless they can procure good rennet at a reasonable price they must be content to make poorer cheese or go out of the business altogether. </para>

                        <para>.- This item offers me a favorable opportunity to enter my protest against combinations of manufacturers that are operating to-day contrary to the best interests of the community. In my contribution to the general debate, &#39;Imentioned that the wholesale warehousemen were the greatest factors &#39; controlling prices, but that there were manufacturers - fortunately limited in number - who did not recognise their obligation to give the people their products at a reasonable price. I find that there- are certain associations or combinations of manufacturers working to the detriment of the people. There is a Salt Refiners and Manufacturers Association; and the InterState Commission, in one of its&#39;, reports, states that the Association has an agreement binding the manufacturers and refiners to certain methods of distribution and prices. This organization controls the whole industry. It not only fixes prices, but. according to what is best in the interests of its members, determines the area in which this man or that may trade. I understand that each member of the Association has to put up &#163;250 as &#34; a guarantee that he will observe any agreement that is arrived at. The salt companies have also made an undue increase in their profits during recent years, and consumers have not received at their hands the consideration that is due to them in respect of a commodity that is used by every family. When I learn of any combination acting to the detriment of the people&#39;s welfare, I do not hesitate to voice my protest against it. notwithstanding my adherence to the policy of Protection. In respect of, not only salt, but biscuits, rice, cereals, pickles, jams, and soaps, there are associations and combinations working against the best interests of the general community. There are in my electorate quite as many industries as there are in any other Commonwealth division, and I  realize  my  duty to those of my constituents  who . are employed in connexion  with-  them: One of these industries is  that of  soap-making, and I find that soap manufacturers have not only increased their prices, but have decreased the weight of the bars or packages, sold by them. It would not be right for me to allow this opportunity- to pass without protesting against such action. The Protectionists in this House are prepared to help our industries, but we expect those  engaged  in them to give a fair deal to the rest of the community. Even the most ardent supporters of Protection vote for  some  items with &#39;a-  greater  degree of satisfaction than they have when voting for others: I am- sent here to protect and encourage  Industrie&#39;s,,  not merely for the  future  welfare of the country, but to  secure  an immediate advantage to those  who are  employed in it, by the institution <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> better  conditions in employment, having due regard always to the protection of the -consumer&#34; from the avarice of commercialism, &#39;either in the form of  the  warehouseman or manufacturer. I. am hopeful that the Board which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has agreed to appoint will review the circumstances in which many local products are distributed, and also the prices charged for  them,  especially foodstuffs and clothing. </para>

                            <para>- It is somewhat strange that when it is a question of giving support to these industrial brigands in their efforts to get something more out of the public, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is silent; but that as soon as an honorable member commences to criticise them, the Minister, : who is putting this Tariff through in their interests, rises to object. If we are not to discuss the actions of the people who are benefited by this protective duty on salt, then why continue the farce of pretending to debate the Tariff? The action taken by the Minister confirms the statement I made during the general debate; that the whole Tariff was cut-and-dried, and that the discussion of it was a mere piece of &#34; tomfoolery.&#34; The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> complained that there was no interest taken in the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- Hence the protests from the other side. If the statement of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that the people do not take an interest in the proceedings on  the Tariff is correct, the tenor of the debate, so far, has justified their valuation of what happens here. The combinations, companies, and industrial concerns particularly interested in salt were criticised by the previous speaker, who complained that they took an unfair advantage of the Protection given to them and unduly harassed the public. If honorable members condemn these commercial enterprises for fleecing the public, and know that they are doing so, I cannot understand honorable members supporting these concerns in what they are doing, and helping them to do it more effectively by increasing the duties on the very articles which they are manipulating </para>

                        <para>. - There is no advance in item 89, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned. Under sub-item <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> salt from the United Kingdom is free, and under sub-item b, salt, n.e.i., from the United Kingdom, is subject to a duty of 20s. per ton. All the rock-salt we import comes from Great Britain. Still there are rock-salt mines in Germany and elsewhere, and I thought it desirable to give the United Kingdom a bigger preference than heretofore. I raised the general Tariff rate for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- Then I can only make an appeal to the Minister. In this item cotton seed oil and castor bean oil are not provided for. The manufacture of those articles would mean a great deal for many parts of this continent, more particularly in Queensland. The castor bean is now being grown very largely in Queensland, and is proved to yield about 50 per cent, of oil, which is as good as that produced in any other part of the world. There is no protection whatever on it, and we want to encourage this industry. Honorable members desire a larger population in this continent, and to establish this industry would be one way of insuring it. It would give good employment, not only to the men who would grow the beans, but also to those who would manufacture the oil. Then, as regards cotton seed oil, the Bureau of Science and Industry says that the consumption is about 4.000 tons per annum. Cotton is now being largely grown in Queensland, where it is anticipated that we shall have no less than 3,000 acres under crop. That area will produce 3,500 tons of seed cotton, from which will be obtained 500 tons of lint and 1,000 tons of sued. Surely that quantity is of sufficient magnitude to justify us in giving some protection to the oil produced from cotton seed grown in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Castor bean is not. I should like the Committee to understand the importance of both these industries to Australia. Any encouragement that can be given to growers of cotton seed or castor beans will be a matter of great importance to the Commonwealth, and there is no protection on castor bean or cotton seed. </para>

All the things the honorable member mentioned are protected, except the castor bean. There is no protect on in the Tariff for it, and no item which includes it. The reason I have not included castor beans in the Tariff is that all my inquiries went to show that you could not at present expect to have a reasonable quantity of them produced in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- There is no question that the plant will grow in Australia. It does grow prolifically in many parts of the Commonwealth; but the seed cannot be gathered at any one time. You do not get a crop which ripens so that the whole of it can be taken off at the one operation. The seed goes on ripening all the time. My information, so far as it goes, is that this seed has to be gathered by hand all the time, as it were, from week to week and day to day as it ripens. That is the reason this commodity is left Out; but I promise to look further into the matter, and, if necessary, I shall see that some action is taken before the Tariff is finally disposed of. I now have to move as a mere drafting amendment - </para>

                        <para>.- Has the Minister received any request from the Queensland growers in regard to canary seed? Just recently, I received a communication from them informing me that owing to an extraordinarily heavy crop it has been suggested that a Pool be formed. I have seen some of the wholesale seedsmen, who agree that the price is -extremely low and the demand very small. The UnderSecretary for Agriculture in Queensland has given me some figures, which show that in 1915 there were 15 acres under cultivation, producing 4,800 lbs., whereas in 1917 there were 7,596 acres producing 4,406,904 lbs. That fell away in 1919 to 226,599 lbs. from 1,698 acres, and in 1920 there were 2,500 acres under crop, producing 2,000,000 lbs. I am informed that the seed grown in Queensland is of very good quality, and the wholesale merchants of Sydney and Melbourne are quite prepared to buy it at a reasonable price. From time to time, however, they are troubled with imports from Argentine, Turkey,. Morocco, and Japan, and I suggest that the Minister might raise the British and intermediate duties by 2s., and the general rate by 2s. 6d. </para>

                        <para>.- Lucerne seed occupies rather an unusual position. A great number of returned men who have been given land in New South &#34;Wales, and, I presume, in other States, have settled on &#34;small areas for the purpose of growing lucerne. I have received a letter from a number of such returned soldiers asking me to move the Minister in the direction of prohib.ting the importation of lucerne seed. That sounds rather drastic, but I think it is essential that it should be done, not only for the protection of the man who grows the seed, but also for the protection of our pastures and crops. By the introduction of foreign lucerne seed, we have already brought into this country more than one great menace to our cultivation fields. I have here a letter from the Primary Producers Union of Aberdeen, New South Wales, from which I should like to read one or two extracts. The meeting of the union was specially called to consider the question of imported lucerne seed, and the following is from a report of the proceedings - </para>

                        <para>They would remember that, owing to the grave danger of the introduction of foreign noxious weeds, this branch made representations some time ago to have the importation of all foreign seed prohibited. The Government of the day, recognising the wisdom of this, met the request by imposing what they reckoned was a prohibitive duty of 6d. per lb., and, as a further safeguard, issued a regulation that all imported seed should be stained so that it could be identified.

I impress on the Minister the absolute necessity - if we are to do any trade, and maintain this necessary fodder in its pure state - of prohibiting the imported article, especially in view of the fact that Australia can produce a&#39;l we can possibly require. The dangers of importation are much greater than any benefits that can be derived. </para>

                            <para>- No; there was a prohibition on importation, but it was merely technical in order to secure the staining. It was subsequently discovered that the stain prescribed interfered with the germinating powers of the seed. As a consequence, we felt we had to withdraw the regulation. However, we set to work to find another stain, and the Commonwealth analyst has been successful. We now use rouge, which produces the desired indelible effect, and does not interfere with the germinating powers. The fact will soon become known throughout the trade, and it will be impossible to sell the imported for the Australian seed. </para>

                        <para>.- I am in accord with the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming).</inline> It is quite true, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> states, that, prior to the present Tariff, there has been  no  duty on lucerne seed, and I  find that a  great deal is coming in. A return shows that, during the last twelve months, Victoria imported &#163;2,000 worth, chiefly from South Africa. This South African seed is sold 5d. or 7d. cheaper than  the  Hunter River seed, although the latter is probably the best in the world. It  is now  proposed to impose a duty of only 6d., which means that the South African seed may be brought here, and sold  at  the same price as the Australian seed. Probably many farmers who do not know the difference may purchase the imported seed for Australian. The Minister has done good work in imposing a duty of 6d.,  but  I think&#39; he might add another 3d. </para>

                            <para>- I  Would  agree  to  that, for the duty certainly ought  to  be higher than is proposed in the Tariff. It  is  more satisfactory to produce our own seed, and know that no pests are being intro1duced. The South African seed can be produced much more cheaply owing to labour conditions, but as our own seed is second to none, and can be produced in abundance, our farmers should have the benefit. It is bringing about ls. 5d. to 2s. 2d. per lb. This duty is not going to make lucerne any dearer, for the simple reason that at present the South African seed is being sold at from 5d. &#34;to 7d. per lb. below the price charged for the Australian product. Would  it  not be better to add something to the duty in order to make sure of the market for the local article? -It is a fair request. </para>

                        <para>.- As the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has mentioned, I have taken a considerable amount of interest in the production of lucerne seed. Lucerne is our greatest insurance during a period of drought. My constituents have brought this question under my notice, and I want to emphasize the danger of introducing very serious pests in imported lucerne seed. The Minister has told us he has consulted the Government Analyst, and I am satisfied that the regulation, which was suspended but which is now in force, meets the case, so far as the staining of imported seed is concerned, but, in my judgment, the duty is inadequate. I would prefer to see it raised to1s. 6d. per lb. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> who represents one of the most important lucerne districts in New South Wales, and the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> whose constituents also grow large quantities of the seed, are both satisfied that we can produce enough for the whole of our requirements. </para>

                        <para>.- I  hope, the Committee will pause before agreeing to the higher duty suggested by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay).</inline> Surely the introduction of impurities in seed can be got over without actually prohibiting the introduction of the seed itself. In Victoria alone thousands of returned soldiers are engaged in the dairying industry on small areas, upon which they are producing lucerne, and I say it would be absolutely criminal to penalize them to the extent of an extra 1s. per lb. for their lucerne seed. What is wanted is better supervision over the seed that is imported. I appeal to the Minister not to accept the amendment submitted by the honorable member for New England, and I also urge him to take adequate measures to see that imported seed is absolutely pure. I have been informed recently - I am not in a position to stand up to the statement - that impure lucerne seed has been imported from other countries, sent to the Hunter River district, and from there to all parts of the Commonwealth, branded as Hunter River lucerne seed. Our Agricultural Departments should take steps to check this practice. </para>

But it is quite conceivable that the South African seed may be preferred for some climates, although as a general: rule the Hunter River seed is asked for. It is unnecessary to increase the duty to1s. 6d. If there is to be any increase at all, I hope the Minister will not agree to more than 3d. upon the present Tariff. </para>

A very real danger is to be apprehended from the introduction of impure lucerne seed. I have done some practical work myself in connexion with lucerne-growing, from the actual preparation of the fields to the reaping of the lucerne seed, so I am not speaking as  a  theorist. </para>

                            <para>- It is possible, by very careful inspection of small quantities of seed, to prevent the importation of pests; but the position is different when the Department is called upon to handle bulk quantities of lucerne seed. The officials might handle the better part of a ton, but if the last few pounds are not closely inspected there is always a danger of the introduction of some seed pests from South Africa or South America. The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay)</inline> has emphasized that lucerne is our greatest stand-by in our time of drought. It has saved Australia millions of pounds, and, as the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Livingston)</inline> has pointed out, quite  a  large number of returned soldiers now engaged in the dairying industry require the lucerne  seed  for their fodder paddocks. Surely the honorable member does not think that I would advocate anything against the interests of our returned soldiers. The locally-grown seed is worth twice  as  much as the imported article; but, unfortunately, most  of  these men  do  not know that. They have had  no  practical experience, and  so  they are induced  to  buy the imported seed. I again ask the  Minister, if  he does not increase the duty,  to  give us  an  assurance that there will be the strictest supervision over the importation  of  lucerne seed from other countries. </para>

                            <para>- To-day I can buy the best mutton tallow in tins at from &#163;14 to &#163;15 per ton. Two or three years ago it was worth about &#163;60 per  ton.  But what reduction has taken place in the price of soap and candles? Practically none. Therefore, I hope our friends opposite will oppose the granting of any further protection to one of the greatest Combines we have in our midst until they are prepared to give some of the benefits of it to their consumers. </para>

                        <para>.- If the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> had studied economics, he would have realized that even without Protective duties we would have millionaires and paupers. It is quite true that the price of soap is too high; but the fault lies with those who would not give this Parliament the power to prevent the local manufacturers from imposing high charges on the consumers. If we appealed to the people to-morrow to give us further legislative powers, those who are talking Free Trade to-night would oppose the granting of them. </para>

                            <para>- It is remarkable that, although the price of tallow has fallen from nearly &#163;100 per ton to under &#163;20, the price of soap has not decreased proportionately; but the trouble is that there has not been an all-round reduction in the cost of living. The men employed in making soap are still being paid high wages - I hope their wages will be even higher - and, as the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> has pointed out in regard to flour, if the bakers got their flour for nothing, the consumers would still be obliged to pay 7d. per loaf for their bread. In just the same way, if the soap manufacturers got their tallow for nothing, the. people would not get their soap for nothing. The duty under review ought to appeal to honorable members in the Corner, because it affords an opportunity for protecting the primary producers of fat. Honorable members laugh, but do they claim that the fact that tallow is a marketable commodity is of no use to them ? Then, they might as well, say that the hide of the animal they grow is of no use to them! </para>

                            <para>- Just at present it might not be, but a little while ago it was worth a considerable amount. The price the primary producer gets for his tallow from the local manufacturer must be of some use to him. The home market is always the best. Other matters besides the price of tallow must be taken into consideration with regard to the manufacture of soap. I hope that we will make the conditions in Australia the best we can. </para>

                        <para>. -  I would like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to state his reason for having increased the duty on soap, but before he does so I ask him to compare the conditions obtaining during the war with those at the present time, and to remember that the two big soap manufacturing companies in Australia, which practically determine the price of this article on the Australian market, are largely owned by British companies. British interests predominate in one, and in the other they are nearly equal to the Australian. The big drop in the price of raw material has not resulted in any reduction in the price of soap. In my opinion, the encouragement given to this industry in the previous Tariff was more than ample, and I shall require very strong evidence from the Minister to justify any increase. If the increase is agreed to we shall soon be obliged to consider the position of the Combine that determines the price of the commodity. </para>

                        <para>.- Honorable members are complaining about the duty on toilet, fancy, or medicated soaps, because there has been no increase, so far as the British preferential rates are . concerned, in the duty upon soaps n.e.i., under which heading all household soaps fall, and &#39;the household soaps which came into Australia in previous years - &#39; not in any very large quantity, because &#39;the local manufacturers practically&#34; covered  the whole market - came from, the United Kingdom. Honorable members say that we should not retain the duty because there is a Combine operating here and in Great Britain; but even if action were taken which made it cheaper for the British companies to dump their soap here instead of purchasing our tallow and manufacturing it locally, they would do it. It would be exactly the same Combine, or exactly the same controlling force) and Australia would not be any better off. Indeed, it would be worse off to the extent that the commodity was not being manufactured here. </para>

                            <para>- I think they do. But at ali events we are giving them an opportunity to try to do it. The manufacture of toilet soaps was to all intents and purposes not established in Australia prior to the war. We imported them from the United States of America, the United Kingdom - not very much from there - Germany, and France, and some from Italy. But during the war, when supplies of these costlier soaps were cut off, the local manufacturers set out to make them, and I have raised the duty in order to try to retain the industry here. It means more than the actual utilization of tallow, because other valuable industries are created in the making of boxes and in the packing of these fancy soaps. There are all sorts of ways in which the industry helps- others and the country generally. The manufacture of toilet soaps is undertaken by quite a number of firms in Australia, and is- not at all confined to the two companies to which the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has referred. In fact, it is proportionately distributed to a much greater extent than is the making of household soap. Prior to the war we imported well over &#163;100,00.0 worth of toilet soaps every year.It is a valuable industry to try to preserve, and for that reason I have left the British preferential rate as it was in regard to household soaps, but have raised the duty slightly upon toilet preparations and fancy soaps. </para>

The measure of protection previously extended to it, namely, 30 per cent., was ample. The price of, tallow to-day is very, low, and the price of soap is very high. Taking everything into consideration, it appears to me that the protection which we are at present giving the industry is ample. </para>

                        <para>.- There are somewhat extensive works connected with the soap industry in Australia. Some of the firms engaged in this industry are, I believe, associated with Lever Brothers, which represents a Combine. If it were essential to establish or protect from unfair foreign competition by reason of inferior industrial conditions, the- soap-making industry within the Commonwealth, I would give- it all the protection that was necessary ; but; as I declared previously, I am not a. revenue Protectionist, and, therefore, as the industry stands at present, I cannot see the justification for an increase on household soap. Of the soaps annually used in this country,,82,000,000 lbs. are manufactured locally, whilst only 1,468,000 lbs., are imported. Moreover, the importations consist chiefly of fancy soaps. </para>

This is a question which will have. to be faced in the near future. &#34;We must take the necessary action fo prevent our manufacturers exploiting the people of this country. So far as soap is concerned, it is in a similar position to that occupied by tallow. The great body of men who use tallow in mining enterprises have been compelled to pay three times its prewar price for it. The same remark is applicable to soap. </para>

                            <para>- Many of those firms conduct operations only in a small way, and some of them are located in country towns. Consequently they must be protected, and as we are about to impose an additional duty upon ordinary soap, I see no objection, to the duty which it is proposed to levy upon fancy soaps. We shall have to do something in the near future to insure profitable employment to our own people, because nobody knows what the next two or three years will bring forth. It is possible that we shall experience a very trying time. Fancy soaps are luxuries, and if people want them they should be compelled to pay for them. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the Committee will support the proposal of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> As has been pointed out by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> it is not proposed to increase the duty upon household soaps from the United Kingdom. These are the soaps which are used by the multitude of the people in Australia. There is, however, a proposal to increase the duty which is at present levied upon fancy soaps. - That increase, in the case of toilet, fancy, or medicated soaps from the United Kingdom, amounts to only 5 per cent. It is a very small increase, and I shall support it upon the ground that these soaps are generally absolute luxuries. They are mainly used by the rich, and if the. ordinary household soaps are not good enough for them, they should be obliged to pay a little more for their luxuries. It is in the highest degree desirable that articles of luxury should pay duty upon a considerably higher scale than should articles of necessity. This is a clear case of granting protection to an industry without doing harm to any considerable body of persons. </para>

The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has already pointed out that a large quantity of these soaps come from Germany and Italy.

                        <para>. - One must admire the pertinacity of a good Free Trader like the honorable member for Dampier, who, nevertheless, is nob a Free Trader in the scientific sense of the word. He has advanced the same old argument about the existence of a Combine. But if this Parliament chooses bo do so, it can legislate to control that Combine. The Soap Combine in England is one of the greatest in the world. But surely the honorable member will agree that no more important pronouncement has been made by a manufacturer than that which was recently made by Lord Leverhulme, who is the head of Lever Brothers. He has gone so far as to advocate a six-hour day, and&#39; for that I thank him. He was one of the first men in England to reduce the working day to eight hours. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly. Nevertheless, his was a splendid example, which was not followed all over Britain - because the House of Commons did not do its duty, just as this House does not do its duty. If Lord Leverhulme were to introduce a six-hour day in Australia,, his example would be followed much more widely and swiftly by Australian manufacturers than by those in the United Kingdom. I would prefer not to see 1 lb. of soap come into Australia. Are we not capable of making all our own requirements? If there should be a. combine charging unjustly, there is a limitation of prices upon which this House can insist.  I hope the honorable member for Dampier- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> will not continue to advance the old &#39; argument, &#34; It will build up a big combine here.&#34; I agree with the sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Port Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews).</inline> I, too, if it were possible, would prevent anything coming into Australia that can be manufactured here - making this reservation only: that Parliament should control and insist upon the observance of fixed prices. And, further, when the law is broken in that respect, the punishment should be gaol. Fines are no good in the cases of rich combines. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in sympathy with the desire to impose high duties in respect of all goods which are imported, but which could be adequately manufactured in Australia. My one objection to the imposition of duties is where . they apply to articles which5 are not made locally in sufficient quantity to fulfil our requirements. This reservation cannot apply, however, to the manufacture of soap. It is fallacious to say that the imposition of high duties is bound to build up monopolies; but even if that were the outcome, they would be monopolies which we could deal  with. Does the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> think there is not a monopoly among the importing agencies? They are the most easily constituted, the most dangerous, and the greediest of all monopolies. I have been pleased to listen to the arguments advanced to-night from the corner in denunciation of monopolists. I look for the support of honorable members of the Country party whenever motions may be launched from this side t to deal with monopolies and profiteers. I trust the proposed imposts will stand. I would support an even higher duty on soap. </para>

Over-sea markets are being secured. Last year we exported, in fancy soaps, 500,225 lbs., of a value of &#163;47,206 ; and in household soaps, 8,007,356 lbs, valued at &#163;174,724. </para>

                    <para>Mr.RILEY (South Sydney) &#91;10.24&#93;. - Some honorable members think that, so long as there can be provided common soap for the common people, there is no need to worry about anything, or any one, else. But there are such things as fine toilet soaps. &#34;Why should not the common people, who are the backbone of this country, use good soap? Honorable members now want to put up the price of fancy toilet soaps in order to keep the common people from using them. I will not oppose the proposed duty, but I warn honorable members that the result will be that Lever Bros., and one or two other firms which control the industry in tha Commonwealth, will merely employ the opportunity to still further increase the price of toilet soaps. The English firm is making toilet soaps in Australia today, and the imposition of this duty will not cause it to make any more here than at present. When we import toilet soaps from England we get them from a branch of Lever Bros. If we impose a high duty, that firm will import just a little of its English manufacture, and will then supply the local market with its locally-made article, upon which the price will have been put up. The poor people will suffer a little more, and the wealthy manufacturers will make a little more. </para>
