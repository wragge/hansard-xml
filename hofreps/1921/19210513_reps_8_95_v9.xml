I have here a hook by Hugh Martin, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Ireland in Insurrection.</inline> It has been imported by a firm of booksellers in this city and is in circulation. On its cover are pictures of persons known as Black and Tans, and these are labelled murderers.. Another book, bearing on the whole subject of Sinn Fein and the Republic. written in a temperate and analytical fashion by a learned professor in Ireland, has been stopped at the Customs, apparently because it . has been imported by a particular firm of booksellers. Have these anomalies been brought under the notice of the Minister; and, if not, will he inquire about them and have them corrected? </para>

                    <para class="block">Farmers' Agreement Act. The effect is to make the scheme upon which the farmers of Western Australia propose to embark for the bulk handling of their wheat  a  more modest one. It will relieve the shareholders of the necessity for collecting £60,000 more capital, and also relieve the Commonwealth in the meantime to the extent of £110,000 of its obligation. I commend the measure warmly to honorable members. I think the farmers of the western State are acting wisely in proceeding, in the circumstances, with a modified scheme, and in confining their operations for the present to the building of terminal silos. </para>

                        <para>.- This House in August last passed a measure confirming an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the farmers of Western Australia, who were about to form a co-operative concern for the purpose of handling their wheat in bulk. It provided for a capital expenditure of £800,000, and' stipulated that the farmers should allot at least 300,000 shares at 10s. a share. After they had spent £100,000 in the erection of silos in country districts, or at terminal points, the Commonwealth was to lend them £1 for every £2 expended by them. That, shortly, was the proposal put before the House. There was little opposition to it. Honorable members of the Opposition endeavoured to secure the insertion of one or two small amendments, but beyond that there was no division, either on the second or the third reading. Evidently the farmers of Western Australia calculated rather highly. Otherwise we would not be asked to amend the Act. Apparently, they have not been able to issue the whole of the 300,000 shares. </para>

                    <para class="block">In order to do that, it is necessary to amend the agreement so that we may advance to&gt; the society a certain proportion of the money originally arranged for, notwithstanding that they have not been able to fully comply with the terms of the Act. In view of the fact that the Federal Government is not asked, in this amending Bill, to incur further obligation, I cannot see that any great objection need be offered to the proposal. We are simply reducing, as it were, the amount provided for in the Act. That is to say, because the farmers were not able to take up the whole of the 300,000 shares, they have approached the Government for the purpose of having the Act amended so that they may proceed with the erection of terminal silos as portion of the whole scheme for the preservation of their wheat. The amount to be advanced by the Commonwealth Government is to be reduced, proportionately. Instead' of being called upon to advance to the society £550,000 the Government, in the terms of this amending Bill, will be authorized to advance up to £440,000, which is the true proportion of subsidy to the farmers' capital investment in the venture. The war demonstrated the urgent need for the protection of the wheat crops of Australia. It would have been much better if the proposed silos were built on land owned by the cooperative society. If I remember aright, during the' debate on the scheme some little time ago, it waa stated that the site of the terminal silo at Fremantle was owned by the State Government; but, nevertheless, the Commonwealth is amply protected "by mortgage' over the securities of the society, which moreover has to expend £100,000 of its own money before the Commonwealth is required to advance anything by way of subsidy. I am sorry to have to say it, but I believe there is a bad time ahead, and that neither the Federal Government nor the State Governments will be able to get all the money they require for public works. This will mean a large amount of unemployment I fear in the near future, although I hope I am wrong in that supposition. If this co-operative society can undertake the expenditure of £100,000 on its terminal elevator it will provide employment for a good number of men in the western State, and to that extent the Commonwealth Government will be relieved from its obligation, because it will not be called upon to expend one shilling of subsidy until the society has spent £100,000 on the scheme. The rate of interest on the Commonwealth subsidy will be 6 per cent. </para>

This may be regarded as an urgent matter. Another subject to which, perhaps, I may be permitted to refer as equally urgent, is the question of increasing the allowances paid to our old age and invalid pensioners. I hope the Government will consider this matter. I believe the House is favorably disposed towards it,- and also towards an increase in the exemption of the Income Tax Act. </para>

                        <para>.- The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is to be congratulated on the manner in which he has dealt with this Bill; but the position is scarcely as he stated it - that the farmers of Western Australia undertook more than they were able to carry out. What is now sought is a temporary modification of the Act passed last August. Experts have unanimously advised that the first work to be undertaken should be the erection of the terminal elevator, because the money so expended will immediately come into utilization. It is regarded as the wisest' course, and it is therefore pot necessary  to  call  the  whole of  the  money  Until  the terminal site has been erected. There is another reason why it is not advisable simultaneously to go on with the whole scheme. Materials have come down in price somewhat and will drop lower, and the advantage thus gained will be shown over the entire scheme. Therefore, it would  not  be good policy for  the  society to proceed with the whole of the work at once. When terminal elevators have been erected they will be used immediately, even though the other section of the scheme may not be completed. It is unnecessary for me to speak further in support of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to raise one point, and to do so early, in order that some representative from Western Australia when speaking may put me right if I am under a misapprehension as to the real position. My point is apart altogether from the desirability or otherwise of providing silos. If I understand the position rightly, the Government of Western Australia takes no financial responsibility whatever. If that be so, then we are establishing what may. possibly prove to be a very dangerous precedent. </para>

I intend to make my statement whether honorable members like it or not. We are undertaking to render a service to the farmers of Western Australia. I do not object to that. The point I wish to raise is that if we are to undertake this service, and incur the liability set out in the agreement, the State Government of Western Australia should be behind it. Who ought to know the position from every point of view better than the State Government? I ask the representatives of Western Australia in this House to' let us know whether the State Government stands behind this liability, and, if not, why not? </para>

                            <para>- It is probable that similar schemes will come before us from other States. If the liability is one which the Commonwealth should properly incur, then the State Government should stand behind it. It is not because of want of sympathy with any legitimate effort to stimulate and increase production that I raise this question. The principle involved is important, and I ask the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> for a reply to my inquiry. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has done a service to the House by raising the question of the principle involved in this proposal. At the present time there is a great lack of housing accommodation in the State capitals. If a company is formed to build homes for the people in, say, Melbourne or Sydney, and applies to the Commonwealth for assistance in carrying out that scheme to the extent of a Government contribution of £2 for every £1 spent by it, will there be any objection to the application of this principle to such an enterprise ? </para>

' The people of Australia find it difficult to obtain the clothing and blankets they require at the present time. If co-operative companies are formed to produce such goods i-i Australia, will the Commonwealth Government come to their assistance as they are coming to the aid of this co-operative enterprise? Will my honorable friends from Western Australia agree to assist any similar co-operative concern ? </para>

                            <para>- I am pleased to have that assurance, because the principle foi which this Bill provides may be extended to other enterprises. Australia is not producing anything like the quantity of woollen goods that it consumes, and I hope that if co-operative companies are formed to carry on the woollen industry here the Government will be prepared, as in this case, to assist them in supplying the requirements of the people. I shall vote for the Bill, because I believe in the principle of the Government assisting cooperative enterprises. </para>

He realized that we have enormous waste spaces in Australia. He realized the necessity for populating this great country. He made definite promises that co-operative organizations established to increase production would be given Commonwealth assistance, and an Act was passed, two years , ago, enabling £2,800,000 to be allocated for this purpose. Knowing the honorable member for Wakefield as I do, I should have thought that he -would give his approval to a proposal such as that contained in this Bill, where the control of the enterprise to be assisted is left, as far as possible, in the hands of those engaged in the industry. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member must know that the Western Australian Government are behind this proposal, but he desires that they should fill the position of a second mortgagee. We have to satisfy ourselves that the security proposed is good enough and that this enterprise will help to increase the production and wealth of the country. It should be remembered that, as has already been pointed out, this Bill represents merely a modification of a proposal which was accepted by this House almost unanimously a little time ago. I trust that there will be no serious opposition to the passing of the Bill. The difficulty of providing labour need not greatly concern honorable members, in view of the great probability that the proposal will increase the wealth of the community and so will provide for increased employment. I am prepared to give the Bill my most earnest support. It does not involve any new principle. Only the other day, at Shepparton, I saw evidence of marvellous progress as the result of assistance given by the Victorian Government to fruit-growers and mutton-growers. I was told that tinned fruits to the value of no less than £90,000 were, this year, sent away from the canning  works at Shepparton. I hope that honorable members 'will pass the Bill, which I believe to be a good one. </para>

                        <para>.- When a Bill similar to this was before this House on a previous occasion I opposed it as strongly as I could. One of the grounds for my opposition was that the people of Western Australia took no interest in the proposal, and showed that they had no confidence in it. The Commonwealth Government have no right to lend money for such purposes without satisfactory security. Another objection I had to the original  proposal  was that, at the time, there was in existence a coalition Government, which we know is an immoral Government, and will do things which no other Government would do in order to please different sections of their supporters. I know that on' the last occasion on which we dealt with this business an . honorable member said - </para>

                            <para>- There is no date on the volume from which I am quoting. I wanted to show that the outcome of that threat to the Government was the measure then brought forward. My action in opposing that measure has been more than justified, inasmuch as it has since been shown that the people of Western Australia, who will benefit from the proposal if it is a success, have failed to support it. If anything more is required to condemn the proposal, I am unable to say what it is. The people of Western Australia have, not subscribed the funds they undertook to subscribe when this House was asked to pass the previous measure. In my view, this is a rotten business to ask the  Commonwealth  Government to enter upon. If there are men on the Treasury bench who are not alive to the need- for security before money is advanced for an undertaking of this kind, it is time a change of Government was brought about. It is the first duty of members of this' House to sc&lt; that there is good' security for any money advanced by the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> and I represent the two States of the Commonwealth which, because of their larger populations and greater resources, will have to bear the burden for the benefited the smaller States.

This Bill is introduced because the people of Western Australia have shown that they  have no confidence in the scheme. No. better evidence df that can be found than the fact that,  when the Government offered  to subscribe £550,000, the people of Western Australia refused on their part to 'subscribe £300,000, the latter being a condition precedent. </para>

                            <para>- Then I shall say that last night I noticed the absence of representatives of a certain State. I have no doubt that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir .Joseph Cook)</inline> feels his position very keenly. I defy any honorable member to point to similar legislation in any Parliament in Australia. No one can deny that this proposal is for the benefit of the farming community, seeing that it has for its object the storing of wheat in order to keep up its price. There is no excuse for the refusal of those interested in wheat to subscribe towards the £300,000, for never before had they such heavy balances at their back. 'Where is their patriotism? What is their idea of the future of the wheat industry? I can quite understand the financial institutions not "rushing" the proposal; because there is not that sound security behind it that there would have been if the State of Western Australia had been a guarantor. With good security, we should have found not only the banks, but insurance and trustee companies contributing the necessary money, which would have obviated the humiliation to which the representatives of Western Australia are now subjected. If the scheme had been a sound business proposition there would have been no necessity for this Bill, and' members would be very well advised to hesitate before supporting it. Other States do not ask the Commonwealth to advance money on security that is not of the best. In financial matters, the Government ought to show an example and not take risks; it ought to offer ari object lesson to those inclined to enter into speculations of this character. After all, this Bill has in view only a terminal port ; the wheat will have to be bagged from the country districts to the silo, so that that branch of the work "will not be obviated. My own opinion is that the silo will not be used, and that, I take it, is «one of the reasons why those interested in the wheat industry have not' subscribed the -necessary capital. My acting Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> with that -affability .so characteristic of him, .has intimated that he raises no great objection to "the measure. The Bill provides for the expenditure of a lesser amount than -was contemplated under the original Act. Our only consolation, therefore, is that the Commonwealth will suffer a smaller loss. In my judgment the scheme is not a sound one. The State of Western Australia ought to guarantee the Commonwealth against all loss in connexion with the proposed undertaking. If the scheme were an ordinary business one, the person who had to advance the money would require the fee-simple of the land upon which the proposed silos are to be erected. </para>

                        <para>. - I unhesitatingly support the measure enabling the Commonwealth Government to make an advance by loan for silos to be constructed by cooperative farmers in Western Australia. It represents a move in the right direction. I agree with the encouragement of the principle of co-operation, and in new countries like those of Western Australia and Queensland, the people are badly in need of that encouragement. It is all very well to say that they should lean upon their State Governments. At the present time the Queensland Government have no money with which to proceed with any of their enterprises. In such circumstances the parent Government ought to go to the primary producers' assistance so as to promote the growth of our primary industries, and with a view to settling as many people as possible in the great States of Queensland and Western Australia. There are 419,000,000 acres in Queensland, of which 400,000,000 acres aTe still unalienated. It is our duty to encourage settlement upon Crown lands, and to achieve that result the settlers must receive either from the State or the Commonwealth some measure of financial assistance. If that assistance can safely be granted upon co-operative lines, as it can be in this case, it should be granted. I hope that, in the near future, Queensland farmers will come to the Commonwealth Government with a request for assistance by way of loan in the erection of silos for the maize industry, which is destined to become a very important industry, not merely to returned soldiers, but also to immigrants. </para>

What was done by this Parliament has merely had the effect of stabilizing the industry. But we have nothing for which to thank honorable members. We want nothing from them. All that we ask of this Parliament is that we may be left alone. Only last night the honorable member' for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> pointed out what taxation the man upon the land is really paying. My principal objection to the Bill is that it is not in the interests of the country at all. Last evening we witnessed the spectacle of £50,000 being voted for city interests in connexion with additions to the Perth Post-office. </para>

                            <para>- It may be from the honorable member's point of view, because he is interested in ports. Only yesterday the Treasurer told the House and the country that there was no money available to settle returned soldiers and Imperial soldiers on the land in the Burnett district, which the honorable member for Wide Bay represents, yet he had nothing to say about that. He sat in silence, but when a proposal comes forward to spend money lavishly in Western Australia, he says it is a good thing. He had not a word to say for his own State and for the district which he represents. He sat there smiling, and why? For political reasons, because there happens to be a Labour* Government in Queensland, and the harder that Government is hit, the more pleased he is. If ever there was a fraud and sham perpetrated on the Houses- </para>

I have never known one yet which was not the soundest in the world until they got hold of my " few bob," and then I am sorry to say that every one of them has turned out a blank. I do not blame the Western Australians for getting all they can, but what I do blame them for is their inconsistency in asking for money to be spent at the terminal ports of their State when it could be advantageously saved. Although it could have been saved, not one word of protest has come from the Country party. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member means that they can tip the wheat into the silos, and take the empty bags back. That will be some consideration. If this is such a good proposition as honorable members would try to make us believe, I am sure there are plenty of business speculators in the Commonwealth who would go into it with both hands and both feet. If there is one thing more than another that makes me chary of it, it is the interjection of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill).</inline> They have had a long time to gather the money. </para>

If that does not show I am anxious to lessen the liabilities of the Commonwealth, I do not know what would. There is something I have heard, but I shall not repeat it here, because I have no confirmation of it. A man who makes serious statements on the floor of the House ought to have something behind him, and the mattter to which I refer would involve a serious statement. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill will not be defeated, because all the honorable members opposite - Nationalists and Country members alike - are behind the Government. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> may rage and threaten, but when a division is taken, he and all the others on that side will vote for the Government. But the Bill will not pass without a protest from me at every stage. I shall oppose it in the interests of economy, and the real economists must support me. Why should the Government give £.300,000 to the Westralian Cooperative Farmers Association? </para>

                            <para>- I should be well satisfied with a system of Protection that gave me an advance of £300,000. Yesterday, the Acting Prime Minister said that bc had no money to lend to the Queensland Government. The Commonwealth would be more likely to get money back from a State Government, or, at any rate, interest on its advance, than from a private corporation. Population is needed in Queensland, ,and the State Government asks, not for £2,000,000 in a lump sum, but for permission to ' draw up to that amount, to settle our returned soldiers, and the Imperial Service men, on the rich Burnett lands. There was no protest from Country members, or from the representative of the district, when the Acting Prime Minister said that he had no money to lend. Yet to-day it is proposed to advance money to a farmers' cooperative company in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I congratulate the Country party on their success in securing the presentation of this measure to the House. It is an achievement. It is clearly designed in their interests, and in those of their friends , and of a particular class of person in Western Australia. In matters of this kind I have noticed that the Minister' in charge addresses himself almost exclusively to members of the Country party. We know that if a proposal of this nature had not the indorsement, and, indeed, had not been moved for in the first place by members of the Country party, it would not have been accepted by the Government, nor' presented to Parliament. Thus, I emphasize, the Country party are entitled to my felicitations. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is just fresh from his entirely laudable work of making this country blossom like the rose, by means of the Tariff; and, while so engaged, it was a matter for criticism that members of the party in .the corner looked upon him with a somewhat scowling front, and that the Minister, when he made his apology, directed it and all his arguments to the Corner. This, then, is a solatium, and those honorable members are happy. Secondary industries have been amply promoted during the past week, and now something is being done by this benevolent Government for .primary industry. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Dampier assumes an ignorance on my part to which I cannot plead guilty. I recall, also, the introduction of the original measure dealing with the identical subject-matter of the Bill now under discussion; and, upon that occasion, I offered a few words of criticism. I remarked that this was a proposal to lend money to a wealthy corporation in Western Australia- public funds, which were unsecured. I repeat that criticism. This proposition represents a;n unsecured advance out of public funds to promote the interests of a Western Australian company; and, while it may be good for the company. and for the local farmers, I ask that this benevolent principle of State Socialism be extended throughout the Commonwealth, and not confined to the friends and interests of those who may be able to bring special pressure to bear upon the Government. I note that the shareholders in this concern are to be <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> grain growers. There is no guarantee, apparently, given or sought te satisfy honorable members of what a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> grain grower may be; but I have sufficient confidence in the enterprise of some of the people interested in grain, and who are not altogether <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> grain growers, to suggest that they will very soon, by  specious representations, acquire an interest in this company as <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> grain growers - an interest sufficient, at all events, to satisfy this Government, which is so easily satisfied when it has to placate the Country party. We are amending a measure which was passed last year, and was designed for purposes which are set out afresh in the Bill before the House. We are amending it, I apprehend, because in certain particulars the original Bill was found to be, on the financial side, rather more dangerous "than was at first supposed. . </para>

                            <para>- I give the honorable member and his party fullest credit for caution. No one can suggest that they have failed in the smallest regard where their own interests in this Parliament are concerned. Every one knows, for example, how staunchly they have stood for the principle of Protection, except when it applied to something which they used, and that only then did they abandon that great principle. Now, in like manner, in coming here to secure some public funds to assist the primary producer in Western Australia, I give them the fullest credit for looking after their own interests. The trouble with certain honorable members on this side, such as the honorable members for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham),</inline> and Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page),</inline> is that they are foolish enough to give a whole lot of consideration to the general taxpayer, to the worker, and to the consumer, instead of merely - like honorable members in the Corner - paying attention to the farmer and the grazier. Let us by all means have a general and a generous expansion of this principle of Socialism. I want State-aided boots in Batman, for one thing. Boots are dear, and many of my electors are in need of them. I propose now, as I have before, that the Government favorably consider the suggestion made by me to form a boot manufacturing company in the district of Batman, which will be able to come with confidence to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> for support, with the object of producing good and cheap boots for the people of Australia, and especially those in the electorate of Batman, which I represent.

The vinegar manufacturer pays 2s. per proof gallon on the spirit used by him ; the wine-maker pays 6s. per proof gallon, and the maker of perfume 23s. per liquid gallon, while alcohol used in the preparation of medicines is taxed to the extent of 28s. per proof gallon, or 44s. 8d. per liquid gallon. Those are the imposts in respect of spirit made within the Commonwealth; such spirits when imported would pay the additional duties provided in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline> I want to make sure that the sick man requiring medicines in the preparation of which spirits are used shall not be called upon to pay a higher duty in respect of that spirit than is the man who desires to use with his food wine or vinegar in the production of which spirits are used. I desire to make sure that these rates will not be continued. </para>

The spirit used in pharmaceutical preparations is dealt with in the Excise rates, and I propose when we reach them to meet to some extent the honorable member's views. I have been looking into the question for some time, and desire to do something on the lines which my honorable friend suggests when we come to the Excise Tariff. We must, however, have regard to the duty resting upon us to protect the revenue, and to prevent the spirit being used for other than pharmaceutical purposes. </para>

There is an enormous increase in the Tariff on everything used in connexion with the preparation of medicines, serums, and vaccines. These increases will be felt by all who are troubled with illness, and will be an enormous tax on hospitals. Will the Minister state why the provision in the old Tariff for the free admission of denatured spirit under departmental by-laws has been dropped? </para>

                        <para>. - Amylic alcohol and fusel oil are by-products of the distillation of spirit. Amylic alcohol is made from fusel oil by a process of distillation, and both are used in the manufacture of paints, varnishes , lacquers, and so on. The Australian requirements can be met by the byproducts of the local distilleries. The provision in previous Tariffs for the free admission of amylic alcohol and fusel oil when denatured has been omitted, and an item inserted in the Excise Tariff providing for their free delivery where denatured. There are no importations of the denatured article. That, I think, gets over the difficulty raised by the honorable member in the latter part of his speech. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to move a reduction of the duties for which this item provides. In respect of collodion, which I understand is only used medicinally, honorable members will find that the former duty of 3s. per gallon, has been increased to 5s. per gallon. The Government, having established a laboratory here, are endeavouring apparently to protect that laboratory by increasing the duties on medicines, and indeed everything that is required in cases of sickness, and everything that is required in hospitals, whose expenditure must then be greatly increased. Is it not desirable that the best of patent medicines should be allowed to come in, I do not say free of duty, but without being subjected to an unreasonable impost? Medical men urge that we must have of the best, and in the interests of the health of the people it is desirable that medicinal preparations should not be too expensive. Since the establishment of Government laboratories the duties in relation to vaccine serums, drc, ha,ve been enormously increased. In one case, the increase amounts to over 9.000 per cent. There can be no reason for such additional imposts, unless the Government are anxious to show by the imposition of such duties that a Government laboratory is worth having. I move - </para>

                        <para>.- I hope the Committee will not agree to this amendment. It is true that collodion is used as a dressing after surgical operations; but I think it will be admitted that the quantity so employed is so small that the actual increased cost to the patient, as represented by this duty, will be almost infinitesimal. It is very desirable that collodion should be manufactured locally. It has important uses in the surgical treatment of wounds. Prior to the war, practically all the collodion used in Australia was imported, and 75 per cent. of our importations came from Germany. When the war came- down on us, and' the source of supply, which was almost entirely German, was cut off, we could not obtain any collodion, and it was not until local manufacturers came to our rescue at a very critical time that we were able to secure a supply. The rate of duty proposed is, I think, about 35 per cent. on what we may consider the normal value of collodion. That, in my opinion, is not an excessive duty. I do not think it would, as the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> suggests, represent any materially increased cost to even the poorest person. In view of the circumstances, and of our experience during the war, in regard to this particular chemical, I suggest that the duty proposed is only fair and reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- The importations in the year 1913, the year immediately before the war. were 314 gallons. By 1916 they had fallen to 89 gallons, and in the year 1917, when the war was at its height, they were 26 gallons. Honorable members will see to what an extent the local manufacturers, who took up the manufacture of this article at a critical time, as was the case in regard to a good many other things, came to our rescue. I have not heard from any source any complaint as to the quality of the collodion supplied locally, butIhave had from more than one source excellent testimonials. </para>

In Western Australia naphtha has been for some time past, and is now, being produced from the pith of the blackboy and other trees in that State which are a pest, so that there is no question of denuding the forests. The proprietors of the process contend that they produce a spirit equal to any that can be imported or manufactured by a like process from wood. They propose to give me some technical information which I should like to place before the Committee before the item is finally dealt with. </para>

                        <para>. -Prior to September, 1918, the position was that the Excise duty on Australian-grown tobacco amounted to ls. per lb., while the import duty on foreign-grown tobacco was 3s. per lb. - a preference in favour of the local article amounting to 200 per cent. To-day we find that the Australian-grown tobacco is affected by Excise duty to the extent of 2s. 4d. per lb., whereas the foreign-grown article pays an import duty of 4s. 4d. There is still a difference of 2s., but the degree of protection has decreased from 200 per cent. in 1918 to 85¾ per cent. to-day. </para>

That is to say, the amount of 2s. protection still remains; and it is that in which the grower is interested. It is not the amount of import and excise duty collected. It does not matter to what extent we may raise both the excise and the import duty. So long as we leave the margin per pound exactly the same, we leave the measure of protection precisely the same. </para>

                        <para>.- When  a  pound of tobacco has been cut up and put into the ordinary commercial 2 oz. package, the 2s. per pound difference between the imported and the locally-grown article becomes so slight that the majority of smokers will not purchase the Australian-grown leaf. No one will claim that the latter is as good as the imported article, and the difference in price is so small that the smoking public prefers to pay a little more to get the better tobacco. If the Minister could see his way clear to make the difference sufficiently marked, many buyers, with the object of saving a few pence on each package purchased, would smoke the Australian-grown tobacco and thus give greater encouragement to the local grower. </para>

                        <para>. - I perceive what the honorable member for Oxley desires, but the Minister is evading the question. The honorable member desires the Minister to lower the excise on the locally-grown tobacco and increase the duty on the foreign leaf in order to make the growing of the Australian article more attractive. It is all very well to say that the revenue is satisfactory as the margin between the two collections stands to-day ; but someone else besides the revenue collector needs to be satisfied. The town of Texas, in a comer of the Maranoa district, is a big tobacco-growing centre. At one time the manufacturers in Australia refused to take the tobacco from these growers, and only by extreme pressure on the part of the then Minister for Customs by means of a threat to reduce the excise and increase the import duty, were the Australian manufacturers brought to their senses. In the Bowen district there is grown a good cigar leaf ; the leaf grown at Texas is a very good tobacco when manufactured. As the honorable member for Oxley has pointed out, smokers would not buy the locally-grown tobacco alone but preferred to have it mixed with American leaf, thus getting good value for their money. The grower here should have a fair measure of protection. The difference of 2s. per pound means practically nothing by the time a pound of tobacco is put up in 2-oz. packages. </para>

                        <para>. - No one can accuse me of not being a Protectionist. No one desires more ardently than I do to see Australian industries carried on successfully. But this is one of the highest protective duties in the whole of the Tariff. In 1918-19 the average price of unmanufactured tobacco, imported, . was 2s. per pound. The duty .represented 100 .per cent. When the tobacco market went higher than during many previous years, namely, in 1919-20, the average price of imported tobacco was 3s. per pound, and, consequently, the duty was 66$ per cent. To-day it is very close to 100 per cent. I do not feel justified in going for a further measure of protection in this regard. </para>

                        <para>.- In connexion with this item there has been much correspondence in the press, having for its basis the price of cigars and the matter of relief being afforded to the local manufacturer in respect of Excise duty. I do not propose to raise the question of Excise at this stage. I am one of those who believe that, in treating a luxury of any sort in these times, it does not matter how high a Tariff is placed thereon. If I purchase a cigar - as I do - I am prepared to pay highly for that luxury. But I have a great objection to the Minister giving Protection to a phase of industry which could only live under a great deal of nurturing. It would pay the country far better to award pensions to all persons employed here in the manufacture of cigars. We raise a great cry about having to compete against black labour; but all the time we are wanting tobacco grown by black labour. I wish to know if there is any proposal to increase the duty upon cigars. </para>

                        <para>.- Does tobacco which is used as an insecticide come within this provision? If so, it will affect the manufacture of sheep-wash. I wish to know, also, if a preparation known as " Black leaf 40 " cornea under this item? When the Committee is dealing with, the specific item of arsenate of lead, and with similar- preparations affecting the fruit industry, I desire special consideration to be given thereto. Wo cannot afford to imperil the. prospects of our Australian orchardists merely for the purpose of placing high duties on such things as arsenate of lead. I would also point out at this stage that when the first Commonwealth Tariff was framed there was in the schedule a list of free articles, which , showed precisely and emphatically what was free. I do not wish to bring up the question of the powers assumed' by Ministers of Customs in the past, but at a later stage I desire to thresh out the question whether this Tariff, as framed by the Parliament, is to he the Tariff of Australia, or whether the Minister shall have authority to alter the schedule in any manner he may wish. I call attention to the phrase, " as prescribed by departmentalbylaws." Will "Black leaf 40" come within this provision ? And will the Minister give serious consideration to making provision in the schedule to assure the public that certain articles which Parliament says shall be free shall continue to be free - no matter what any Minister may say or do? </para>

                        <para>.- If " Black leaf 40 " were manufactured in this country it would be possible, under this item, to allow "tobacco destroyed for manufacture of sheep-wash or other purposes, as prescribed by departmental by-laws" to be used for its manufacture; and, no doubt, if any one were to undertake the manufacture of " Black leaf 40 " in the Commonwealth, he would be able to obtain such tobacco free- of duty. Undamaged tobacco leaf is subject to duty. But if, as has happened on several occasions, a shipment has arrived in Australia so damaged that it cannot be used for the manufacture of smoking tobacco, we can, under Departmental by-law, allow it to be used for the' manufacture of sheep  wash or other things for which it is suitable. We do not specify all the uses to which tobacco can be put, because we do not know them. So long as we are satisfied that damaged tobacco will not be used for human consumption, we permit it to so into manufacture. </para>

Therefore, it has been my earnest desire to make the duties as definite as possible, so that there may be no opportunity for an alteration of meaning by a Departmental interpretation. If honorable members wish to have this particular tobacco made free, they should move in that direction now. </para>

                            <para>- No. We are trying to encourage the growing of maize, an industry which, in Queensland and northern New South Wales in particular, will give occupation to a large number of returned soldiers and immigrants. The factory that I have mentioned has offered to purchase 20,000 bags of maize a month from one part of my electorate, and will manufacture that maize into glucose and other things, such as starch, cornflour, oil, and calf food. An immense quantity of maize is grown in America, India, and South Africa, and more cheaply than we can grow it. We must protect our manufacturers from the dumping by America of glucose made from surplus maize. The Webb Act of 1918 makes legal the existence in the United States of America of Combines and Trusts formed to dumb surplus products into foreign markets, though ordinary Trusts and Combines are illegal in  that country. Transport facilities are also given to enable products destined for export, either raw or in a manufactured state, to get to the seaboard cheaply. Dumping has, for a time, seriously affected the carbide making industry of Tasmania. It will be months before the stock of carbide that was dumped here is sufficiently diminished to allow of the Tasmanian product being sold again. "We should not allow the dumping of glucose, following on a good maize season in America, to injure our glucose industry and maize farmers. </para>

                        <para>.- I approve of the suggestion to increase the duty on glucose by 2s. The article is largely used in the making of confectionery, among other things. Competition in the United States of America is supported with huge capital, and directed by organized minds of the highest capacity. It creates a trade war as pitiless as any ordinary war. A duty of 10s. per cwt. is only a little over1d. per lb. Australian confectionery will hold its own against the world. I have blindfolded individuals, and got them to taste the highest grade of European chocolates and the chocolates made by MacRobertson, and have found that they could not tell the difference between the two. The OH Gold chocolate made by this Victorian firm is a line of which I can speak highly. I do not know of anything superior to it. If the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> will move an amendment in the direction he has suggested, I shall have much pleasure in supporting him. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the proposal of the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> particularly in the direction of assisting in the production of maize. In times of scarcity the value of maize in the past has been as high as 5s. and 5s. 6d. per bushel, but on occasions the price has been as low as 2e. 9d. per bushel, at which figure it was absolutely unprofitable to grow it. However, the operations of the Maize Products Company have in recent years brought about marvellous developments in maize production. </para>

But while their operations are considerable for a new industry, and for a new country, they are a mere flea-bite when compared with the extent to which glucose is manufactured in America. We have an overwhelming market for the various products of maize - there are six turned out by this company - and if further assistance in the manufacture of glucose will assist an important local industry, we ought to give  it. </para>

                        <para>.- When I adjusted this schedule I left the Division, Sugar, severely alone, and, of course, glucose is included in that division. I am aware that it is a product largely manufactured from maize, but, nevertheless, glucose is the raw material for other industries. For instance, makers of confectionery use a great deal of it. However, I feel inclined to accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Wide Bay to increase the duty on glucose, particularly in view of the fact that the Americans are beginning to dump it into Australia at a price which will have a very prejudicial effect on a local industry, which, by absorbing large quantities of a primary product, is most valuable to the primary producers of Australia, particularly the small farmers situated in coastal areas. </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible for us to do what the honorable member for Swan has suggested ; but as there is more than one manufacturer, and as others besides these factories are users of maize, the people to whom the honorable member refers will have no opportunity of rigging  the market. Competition will compel them to pay the market price. At the same time the factories are very useful to the primary producers when there is a big surplus of maize, because they take vast quantities which otherwise could not be absorbed. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> knows very well the extent to which small farmers in New South Wales grow maize. Small farmers in Queensland and Victoria also grow it extensively, and although it may not- be cultivated much in Western Australia, nevertheless it is a very valuable product of the soil.

                            <para>- The point I wish to make is that tens of thousands of acres of land have been laid out for fruit culture upon which thousands of soldiers have settled. It is possible that within a few years the production of fruit in Australia will be so enormous that it will be necessary for us to do all we possibly can to build up a big export trade in jams and preserved fruits. Nothing could be superior to the preserved fruit I saw at Shepparton the other day. I want to know if the Minister has considered the question of allowing a rebate of duty on the sugar employed in- the manufacture of jam or the preservation of fruit for export, and whether at the present time a rebate is not given to the manufacture of confectionery exported from Australia or to firms like Swallow and Ariell, who use large quantities of sugar in the manufacture of the commodities they export. </para>

                        <para>. - I had better set out the whole position, so that there may be no misunderstanding hereafter. Under normal conditions when there are no such things as sugar agreements, and so forth, sugar is imported and then used in the manufacture of jams or for canning fruits for export. A rebate of duty is allowed on this imparted sugar to the full extent of the quantity so used. There is a system by which the Customs authorities arrive at the amount of sugar contained in jams and preserved fruits. Where sugar is exported in the form of jam or canned fruits, a rebate is allowed upon the full amount of it so used. We have never had a series of years when the Australian production of sugar has been equal to the local consumption. There has always been a certain amount of importation. </para>

                            <para>- The quantity upon which a rebate has been allowed has never yet come up to the amount , of sugar imported. During the. war definite agreements were in force under which the Commonwealth purchased sugar and supplied it to the jam manufacturers and fruit, preservers. Speaking from memory, I think we sold sugar to them for export purposes over a period of thr.ee yeaTs, arriving at the quantity used in this way in exactly the same way as we arrived at the quantity of imported sugar used ' in previous years. We sold to these people at a lower rate than was charged to the Australian public generally. It was a much lower rate, and although I cannot recall the exact amount I believe it was about £8 per ton. It was in excess of the actual amount of duty, which was £6 per ton; but that was during the war. We then reached a period when the world's parity for sugar was infinitely higher than the Australian price, but we did not turn round and charge the jam manufacturers and fruit preservers the world's parity for the sugar used in tha manufacture of jams for export as we might have done. We gave them the sugar at the Australian price, because we considered it desirable to give every possible encouragement to the jam manufacturers to pay the fruit-growers a reasonable price and thus assist in building up the export trade to the utmost of our ability. We have now reached a time when that does not apply, as the world's parity for sugar is below the Australian price. We are making arrangements, which I trust will be completed without delay, under which it will be possible to give assistance in some way. I am not binding myself in any sense, because negotiations are in progress, but we are conferring with the jam manufacturers and ' the fruit preservers concerning the price of the sugar used in manufactures for export purposes, the intention being to allow the manufacturers of jams and canned fruits for export to obtain sugar at as cheap a rate as they could purchase it anywhere in the world. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and that will last another two seasons, under the agreement . already entered into. The latest reports from Queensland concerning the sugar crop indicate that, notwithstanding the magnificent promises in the early part of the season, we shall this year have to import considerable quantities of sugar. It. is, however, a fact, and one which I very much regret. We hope to be able to make such arrangements as to enable them to secure sugar used in the manufacture of exports only at as low a price as they could purchase it anywhere in the world. I was asked by an honorable member as to whether any manufacturers were getting that concession now, and I can assure him that they are not. </para>

                            <para>-Yes. The duty is only 4s. per cental. That protection is insufficient, and growers have written to me stating that with such a duty it is impossible to profitably carry on. The Japanese are sending in, for broom making purposes, an inferior millet which is being largely used. I have two letters, which I shall read to the Committee, in order to show that our farmers arc dissatisfied with the present duty. Here is one written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cunningham</inline> on behalf of the farmers of Nelson Plains, shortly after the Tariff schedule was laid on the table - </para>

                        <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> - I am directed by the Nelson Plains Progress Association to ask you to urge upon the Minister for Customs the necessity of raising the Tariff on imported broom millet in order to save an Australian industry from absolute extinction. We understand that the Tariff will be dealt with immediately Parliament reassembles, and would respectfully urge that you use your best endeavours to have the Tariff raised at least fourfold. As you are not, perhaps, familiar with the subject, I will try briefly to make the matter plain to you. The areas in which broom millet is grown in New South Wales are the Lower Hunter, and Manning and Richmond Bivers on the coast, and smaller quantities inland at Yanco and Tamworth districts. The amount grown in these districts is quite sufficent to supply Australia and New Zealand in any season, and consequently there is no need to import any from outside. At the present time millet is quoted at £50 per ton of 2,000 lbs. in Sydney, but very little is being sold for that, the average price being from £30 to £40, which is altogether too low a price to pay farmers at the present high cost of living. This low range of prices has been brought about by the action of the manufacturers and speculators forming a ring and importing, to date. 120 tons from Italy, although there axe ample stocks of Australian millet awaiting sale in all the millet-growing districts. Last year they succeeded in inducing the Federal Government to place an embargo on the exportation of millet to Kew Zealand, although then, as now, there were ample stocks to supply both countries, and this action was taken without consulting the growers, who were certainly entitled to have a say in the matter. To show you how the manufacturers score at the expense of the growers - The price of millet is no better, or hardly as good, as before the war, when you could buy a broom - retail - in any shop in the State for ls. 6d., whereas at the present time brooms range from 3s. Od. to 4s., and the cost of production to the grower has gone up 200. per cent. Trusting you will do your best in this matter, </para>

                        <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> - On behalf of the farmers of the Hunter Valley I wish to draw your attention with a view of having it placed before the Federal authorities of the treatment meted out to the millet-growers of this locality, as to importations of millet from other countries. Owing to the cost of labour, the price paid for the cultivation, raising, and cutting of this crop was nearly 100 per cent. more this season than in past years, and when the first millet was harvested, as early as December last, the price offered for this millet was £80 per ton at the shed. This is just a payable price, and nothing more. A few weeks later what do we find ? The " profiteers " have got their heads together, and to-day we are very lucky if we can get £40 per ton for it at the shed. Do you not consider this an injustice, and on top of this the Federal Government is allowing foreign countries to simply flood the country with so-called Italian millet. Is this a fair go? The past seasons may have been good to some farmers, but others have simply to depend upon this crop to meet their rents, &amp;c, and what is to become of the poor struggling farmer when, on the 1st of July this year, he has to sacrifice his crop for the paltry sum of £40 per ton when it costs him nearly £30 per ton to raise same f We consider it a grave injustice, and I think you would earn the esteem and appreciation of all the millet-growers in New South Wales if you would ventilate this matter on the floor of the House. What we want is to get the Tariff increased, and an inquiry made into this matter. Hoping to hear from you in the course of a few weeks, </para>

                        <para>Broom millet is grown in Victoria principally in the valleys of the King and Ovens Rivers in the north-eastern part of the State, and in New South Wales in the Hunter River district and similar country. The output annually averages 250 tons in Victoria, and 550 tons in New South Wales, of fibre. The land most suitable for its cultivation ' is a rich alluvial loam. The cultivation method usually adopted is to plough the ground as soon as conditions permit after winter, harrow twice, then subsequently either plough a second time or utilize a cultivator, and again harrow to produce a fine tilth before seeding. Seed is sown by drilling as soon as warm weather sets in, say, from the middle of October to the middle of December, in rows 30 inches apart. It is usual to fertilize with superphosphate during growth of crop, and cultivation between the rows is carried on in order to retain moisture and capillarity, and develop root growth. </para>
                        <para>The harvesting of fibre commences when seed heads begin to ripen, and is done by manual labour. The plants are bent down, and the  man cutting, using a sharp knife, cuts through the stalk about 4 inches down from the fibre, the object of retaining the short length of stalk being for convenience sake in subsequent handling. The fibre is laid down on the prostrated plants to dry until carted in, in small sheaves, to the drying sheds, where it is spread out until completely cured. It is then ready to be threshed. Threshing is accomplished by a crew of seven or eight men. It consists of holding the fibre in handfuls on a spiked roller which is revolved at high speed, and tears off all seeds from fibre. The roller machine is generally worked by means of an internal combustion engine of from 4 to 5 B.H.P. When threshing is completed the fibre is compressed into kales, wired round, and is then ready to despatch to factory, where it is made up into the finished broom. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The cost of production is estimated as follows: - Assuming it to be a good crop of broom, and basing its yield at 1 ton of threshed fibre to 3 acres, which is above the average on Government Statistician's figures, the production costs on lowest possible estimate are :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">added to which are railage, commission, storage, and handling charges, and cost of production to growers will amount to £25 or £26. This is the estimate of a good crop; but on reviewing figures supplied by Statists of Victoria and New South Wales, it was found that over the triennial period of 1917-1919, the yield was 5 cwt., 5 cwt., and 2½ cwt. respectively, and with prices fluctuating from £28 to £71 per ton, and averaging throughout £49 per ton, the gross return to the grower amounted to £9 8s. Id. per acre per annum, which, on estimate of cost, left little margin over expenses involved. </para>
                    <para>The work of growing and harvesting broom is mostly done by settlers on small holdings, assisted by their families or hired labour. Of the total cost of production, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> £25 per ton, rather more than four-fifths is paid out for labour alone, and estimating the yield of the fibre' in the King Valley this season to be 200 tons, it means that £4,000 is spent during the season amongst the workers engaged, which sum is of considerable importance to them in making up a living wage. The work is of an exacting nature, and fills all hours of daylight. </para>
                    <para>It has been found that fibre has been imported from overseas, principally Italy and Japan at as low a cost as £11 per ton landed, and this season at about £32. The existing Tariff is £4 per ton, but the producers are strongly of opinion that to afford some measure of protection and security a duty of not less than £14 per ton should be imposed. It is recognised that a price lower than £40 per ton is hardly remunerative to the grower. </para>
                    <para>It is pointed out in this connexion that when instituting inquiries into the manufacturing processes and costs, it was confidentially stated by a manufacturer that factory costs when the price of fibre was £70 per ton were about 2s. per broom, made up as: - Cost of fibre, at £70 per ton,1s. 2d.; cost of handles, wire, varnish, and making broom, 6d. ; overhead factory charges, 4d.; total, 2s. These figures were given when cost of material was at high war-time level, and, pursuing the inquiries further, it was found the retail price to the consumer averaged 5s. per broom, so that cost of distribution amounted to more than primary and manufacturing costs combined. </para>
                    <para>It will be seen that for every £10 per ton paid to growers for fibre, the cost of fibre in each broom would be 2d., in other words, at £40 per ton fibre, per broom 8d.; at £50, 10d.; at £60,1s., and so on, which is proportionally low to cost of broom . to ultimate consumer. Should the growers be denied this necessary protection, it will mean the practical extermination of an industry of value to the country.. All the fibre consumed can readily be grown within Australia without recourse to imported cheap labour stuff. It is an industry' essentially adapted to small settlers, or settlers' sons, to give continuity of employment throughout the year. </para>
                    <para>During a recent tour of the King Valley, it was found that several repatriated soldiers had grown fibre either on shares or on their holdings. The crops generally were good, but settlers were dispirited as to prices likely to be obtainable, and felt themselves to be unfairly at the mercy of the Associated Manufacturers, who depress the market at will, assisted to that end mainly by the low Tariff on importations. That is the statement of men who grow this product, and have gone into the facts and figures of the case very carefully. If is an industry which  I  consider should have some protection. Up to the present  I  have taken no part in the discussion of the Tariff, but I submit that if Protection is to be the settled policy of the country our primary producers must have their reasonable share. </para>
                    <para>Mr.CORSER (Wide Bay) [4.0].- This millet and rice straw industry was started in Queensland years ago, and was successful until dumping took place, and numbers of growers found that they could not get anything like a payable price. Queensland has ample room for this industry, and is as suitable for it as any part of the world, but there must be  protection against dumping especially from Japan. Paddy or bill rice straw has been grown, to my knowledge, very successfully in Queensland. I imported, years ago, a quantity of rice seed for testing purposes, and the  results were splendid. I am sure that with proper protection a flourishing industry could be built up in many parts of Australia in growing millet and rice straw, affording ample employment for our returned soldiers and the immigrants whom we hope will come to Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- When the Tariff was framed, and broom, corn, millet, and rice straw were left at 4s. per cental, broom was then bringing the high price of something like £80 per ton, and I did not feel justified in suggesting an increase of duty. Circumstances, however, have materially altered,, and we now find ourselves in a different position. Importations are coming in at comparatively low prices, and in all probability it will be necessary to make some adjustment. £ had not expected to reach this item before next Wednesday, and I have to thank honorable members for the progress that has been made. </para>

                    <para>I am not prepared to admit for one moment that this money has been squandered. Of course, in connexion with repatriation, as in other matters, errors of judgment may have been made. lt is not to be expected that we can place 300,000 men in the industries of the country without errors, or a certain amount of overlapping between Commonwealth and State. But to say that the whole of the money to be expended has been squandered is to use language not justified by the actual facts. I should like to ask the Leader of the Country party whether he is correctly reported, because I do not wish to belabour him unnecessarily or unduly. </para>

In several years he did not suppose there would be more than £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 worth of tangible assets. The reason was that we had not had » post-war programme ready, simply because the city press was predominant over the country press.

                    <para class="block">The statement of the honorable member for Cowper pre-supposes that the purchase of land and the erection of War Service Homes have  been carried put and administered by six incompetent States, and that the land and houses are in the hands of incompetent soldiers, who are unable to carry the proposition through, or must be regarded as men who cannot be trusted to discharge their financial obligations. Some 16,000 houses have been built or are in course of construction, and of the £10,970,903 expended I am pleased to say that up to date over £800,000 has been repaid by. the soldiers, evidencing the appreciation with which they regard the acquisition of their homes. I invite honorable members, notwithstanding press and public criticism outside, to make an inspection of these soldiers' homes, which, I am sure, they will find are not deserving of the adverse criticism that is heard of them to-day. I do not seek at at this stage to justify the whole administration in connexion with War Service Homes, nor do I think the Minister himself would desire to do so. There have been shortcomings; but it must be said, in justice, that the Commissioner fell on bad times. He, just as did private builders who undertook extensive operations, found himself up against short markets and harassing industrial conditions, and, generally, the most difficult period of building activity Australia has ever known. Yet there are men going round this country to-day who are more concerned in securing publicity for themselves than in taking any true interest in  the soldiers or the welfare of their country. Instead of endeavouring to be of assistance and encouragement, they are denouncing every action of the Government in their endeavour to disparage our efforts to fulfil the nation's obligation' to returned soldiers. It would be far more fitting if these persons were to offer commonsense advice rather than mischievous and self-aggrandizing criticism. For a responsible member of this House, and he the Leader of a party, to say that an expenditure of some £60,000,000 will be reduced to an abiding asset of only about £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 is a statement which no child would take notice of. Such a remark brings more denunciation upon its maker than upon those at whom his reckless and ill-considered accusations are aimed. Frankly, I do not understand the purpose of the honorable member. I am prepared to listen to and, if necessary, to combat any criticism of an honest and well-intended nature concerning any branch of administration with which I have had to do. And I am certain that the Minister for Repatriation would be readily prepared to say the same for himself. I invite the honorable member to investigate the plight in which men with life-long experience in the building trade have been finding themselves. They have been metaphorically choked with dear material, and have been unable to sell it, or in any way, in fact, to get it out. The Commonwealth has certain stock in hand which has cost much money; but there is no trader of any magnitude in Australia who is not in a similar position. </para>
                    <para>With respect to land settlement, I have painted out that a sum of £25,000.000 has been spent in the acquisition of land. In that regard, the Commonwealth Government cannot accept the entire responsibility. </para>

I ask the honorable member not to be specially concerned with what is, after all, a passing phase of Australia's difficulties. I am one of those who believe that the bottom has not dropped out of the situation. I think I can see the elements of a great post-war revival throughout the world. The settlement of the reparations question with Germany may mean the inauguration of a great trade revival which will astonish the world. Our present troubles are an inevitable phase of the world's post-war crises. I repeat that the remarks of the honorable member for Cowper were not worthy of him and of his position. </para>

                        <para>The procedure adopted in connexion with this matter was grossly unfair to myself, to my colleagues of the Country party, and to the House generally. It was not proper for a Government Whip, practically without notice and in the last hour of the week's proceedings, to bring forward a matter of this nature, or for the Minister to make a reply such as he has done. To begin with, I repudiate the Minister's assertion that my statements have been made with any desire to secure personal notoriety. As for that matter, I invite the House and the public to judge between the Minister and myself concerning our respective war-time activities, and in the matter of our repatriation activities since the war. I also repudiate his statement that my utterances were either incorrect or ridiculous. I was substantially right when I remarked that, approximately, £60,000,000 had been spent upon repatriation generally, apart from pensions, and that within a few years there were likely to be only a few million pounds' worth of tangible assets left. In passing, I desire to mention that the newspaper reports of my remarks to the country press were condensed. I stated that the city press had always created public opinion in Australia, and that, by reason of that fact, matters had been permitted to go on to a degree which would never have been  allowed had there been a provincial press strong enough to forma body of country opinion which could be reckoned with, and would expose some of the failures under its own notice. </para>

At no time in the history of Australia could so huge an amount as £79,000,000 have been spent upon public developmental work with so little to show for it. </para>

                            <para>- Knowing that my time is limited, the honorable member is endeavouring to curtail it by running interjections. In my opinion, this Government and Parliament stand condemned for the inadequacy of the provision which was made during the war period for post-war reconstruction. The Government had a wonderful chance. But what happened ? The men who went overseas to fight for this country returned full of spirit and anxious to settle down to civil avocations straight away. But, instead of being able to do so, some of them have been waiting more than eighteen months to get upon the land. Their hearts have been broken, their hopes have been dashed, and to-day scores of soldiers who, only a few years ago were eager to fight for us, labour under a. definite sense of grievance against the Government' of their own country. </para>

Millen became Minister for Repatriation, he admitted that the plan for repatriating our soldiers would have to shape itself. It has done so.

                            <para>- Whilst we were doing nothing, every other country was attempting to do something in regard to post-war reconstruction. In England, during 1916, a Minister for Reconstruction was appointed. The authorities there endeavoured to arrange that as soon as the war was over, the machinery which had been brought into being for purposes of destruction should be used for purposes of reconstruction. I know that it is nob a proper thing to depreciate one's own country, and I do not indulge in those tactics. There is still plenty of opportunity to redeem the past, and to achieve something worth while. I have no desire to blacken the record of the Government. But I do say that the soldier is not getting a fair deal. Whether that statement upsets the Government or not, is a matter of indifference to me. But the men who fought for us a year or two ago, to-day have a definite grievance against us. In Canada the authorities were making plans for repatriating the soldiers of that Dominion in the middle of 1917. </para>

But the Commonwealth Surveyor-General admitted the other day, in evidence, that too much land had been bought at boom prices, and one particular block was mentioned, which had been purchased in Newcastle, which was frequently 9 inches under water during a good portion of the year. </para>

                            <para>- That may be thb honorable member's opinion, but it is certainly not the opinion of those who know me intimately. Only last year the War Service Homes Commissioner purchased a saw-mill property in Queensland for £500,000. The statement has been made that if the mill is kept working for ten years, and if timber maintains its then price, the Department will make a considerable profit out of the transaction. But if that mill be worked at the present time, the Commonwealth will unquestionably sustain a loss upon it of many hundreds of thousands of pounds, in addition to the £500,000 which it cost. I make that statement deliberately, and I claim to know something about saw-mills. </para>

                            <para>- Many members of the local Repatriation Committees have had to pay money to our returned soldiers out of their own pockets merely because the methods adopted by the Department were so slow. Yet the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> and myself have outlined comprehensive schemes of soldier settlement which would have permitted the utilization of large areas of Crown lands. In my own district, for an expenditure of £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 in railway construction and a hydroelectric scheme, with an additional £5,000,000 for resumption purposes, the Government could have immediately added to 6,000,000 acres of land a capital value of at least £130,000,000, and this would have been a continually growing asset. Of this area 70 per cent. would have been Crown land unavailable for settlement by reason of inaccessibility under present conditions. When one recollects these facts he is led to wonder why our entire scheme of repatriation has resolved itself into the building of a few houses around the capitals of the States and in other places where their value is ultimately bound to depreciate. </para>

                            <para>- I have made no charge against this Government; but I say that on the whole this money has been so spent that after a few years the asset that will be created will be comparatively small and diminishing, while it could have been spent in a way which would have created an enormously valuable asset, and an increasing asset. There were possibilities in the scheme suggested by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> and myself. Not simply would it have resulted in an increase in the value of the land taken up, but it would also have utilized soldiers and officers who had been properly trained abroad. Of the men coming back, 60 per cent had no jobs. Among them were many officers who had risen from the ranks, who during four or five years of war service, had learned to manage commissariats and to control bodies of men, and might thus have made ideal captains of industry. Had returned soldiers been put on to improve land, and to build subsidiary transport and power, they would have been usefully employed from the start, and practically the whole of the Australian Imperial Force could have been absorbed in two or three schemes, which would have created an asset worth £200,000,000. </para>

If a co-operative scheme like that of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> had been put before the soldiers before the war gratuity proposal was dealt with, a great deal of the money that has gone in payment of this gratuity could have been devoted to co-operative effort instead of being spent aimlessly by reason of want of immediate employment. However, there are still large sums to be spent, and although much evil has been done in the past, there is no reason why we should throw away millions more. Expenditure should be directed towards practical objects, in the manner I have suggested. </para>

That would prevent a lot of trouble. </para>
                    <para>Every soldier who went to the war from the United States of America could insure his life up to £2,000 at a minimum of cost, but in Australia he would have had to pay a premium of £200 for that insurance. If a man did not apply personally to be insured, he was insured automatically. I should like the Minister to address a letter to the authorities of Canada, South Africa, and the United States, the three countries in which conditions are most like our own, asking what is being done there for returned soldiers. When the information has been obtained, I should like a table to be prepared setting forth that Australia has done such-and-such things,' and Canada, South Africa, and the United States of America such other things. If we have done better than any other country in helping our returned men, the more honour to us, and, if not, the knowledge of what they are doing may stimulate us to greater efforts. </para>
