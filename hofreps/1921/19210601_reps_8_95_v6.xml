                    <para>- Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations provides for the establishment of a permanent Court of International Justice. At the first session of the Assembly of the League of Nations held in Geneva in November and December of last year a Statute providing for the constitution and jurisdiction of the Court was agreed to unanimously. A protocol was drawn up providing for the acceptance by the members of the League of the Statute and the jurisdiction of the Court. This protocol has already been signed by the whole of the British Dominions which are members , of the League, other than Australia, and the Government  have  now decided to authorize the Prime Minister to sign the protocol on behalf of Australia, and <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> request His Majesty, after the protocol has been so signed, to ratify it. The acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Court does not extend to the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction provided for in the second paragraph of Article 36 of the . Statute. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite unable to state, at the moment, what is contained in the agenda-paper of the Imperial Conference. All I can say about the Imperial War Cabinet is this : It was an institution of the greatest possible usefulness during the war, all the Dominions being taken into the confidence of the Imperial Government: I cannot conceive of anything more useful than a repetition of those Conferences, so long as care is taken that they are on the same plan, and have in view the same objective, as the War Cabinet, which I was privileged to attend: </para>

                            <para>.- It is only because of the outcome of the deputation to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> the other day that I am moving the adjournment of the House in regard to this matter. The position of the graziers in New South Wales, and in the central western portion particularly, is such as to cause general uneasiness, not only in that district, but in other parts of the Commonwealth as well; for, while that portion of New South Wales is feeling the depression particularly, many other important districts of Australia are in exactly the same position owing to the fact that the Associated Banks have not only refused further cash advances to graziers, but have asked them to reduce their overdrafts. The position calls for action on the part of the Commonwealth Government because the situation is the outcome of war conditions, and therefore is national in character. The Acting Premier of New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dooley)</inline> has been endeavouring to make some arrangement whereby the graziers in the districts affected may be able to stock up their holdings, and thus carry on the industry, thereby creating that wealth which is so necessary for the progress of the Commonwealth. The paralysis, so far as the wool market is concerned, is due to the fact that at present the people of Europe are unable to buy our raw materials, and apparently they will not be in a position to do so until some system of international credit can be arranged. I have no doubt that, under the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Bawra scheme, considerable relief will be experienced, but unless more credit can be established, our raw materials will be sold at considerably below their true market value. In the districts to which I refer, the central and central-west of New South Wales, I have particulars of forty-three cases of graziers - and these may be regarded as representative of the whole of those engaged in the industry throughout Australia - and I find that the amounts advanced by the banks represent 33 per cent, against the land, and only 27 per cent, against land, stock, and unsold wool. The outstanding debts average about 3 per cent, of the present assets. Thus the banks have advanced about 33 per cent, against the land itself, and only 27 per cent, against land and stock, excluding plant, which is a not inconsiderable item. The advances are on a very conservative basis, whereas the small land-holders find it impossible to stock up unless they are advanced up to 50 per cent. </para>
                        <para>The number of sheep grazed in New South Wales is about 14,000,000 below the average for the last ten or twelve years, a very disquieting fact when one takes into consideration the grasses and herbage available. On the other hand, Queensland has plenty of sheep and cattle, and they can be bought very cheaply; but if those who are anxious to buy are unable to get advances from the banks, or do not receive sympathetic treatment from the Commonwealth Government, that stock must remain in the northern State, and the paddocks of New South Wales must continue to remain idle instead of producing wealth. It is not only the graziers who are held up. In some cases mixed farmers are compelled to go slow because of lack of funds with which to pay wages to those who might otherwise be engaged in ploughing their land. The position is clearly set out in a schedule of forty-three cases which has been prepared, from which I shall take a few items indiscriminately. </para>
                        <para>In this schedule, sheep are valued at 15s. per head, horses at &#163;8 per  head,  cattle at &#163;6 per head, and wool at &#163;10 per bale. The valuation is indeed conservative. </para>
                        <para>Case 43 is that of a settlement lease of 5,289 acres worth &#163;1 per acre. It carries  1,173 sheep valued at 15s. per head. Other assets consist of two horses worth &#163;8 each, and unsold wool valued at &#163;210. The total assets amount to &#163;6,395. The banks have advanced &#163;1,010, and thi3 grazier&#39;s outstanding debts are covered by another &#163;516, but he wants a further &#163;1,500 to enable him to stock up. He has been absolutely refused any further advance. Indeed, he has been asked to reduce his overdraft. </para>
                        <para>Case No. 1 refers to 3,877 acres of conditional purchase and Crown lease land valued at &#163;1 10s. per acre, or a total value of &#163;5,905. He has no stock and no wool. He owes the bank &#163;2,226, and his outstanding debts amount to &#163;200, but he requires a further &#163;1,200 to enable him to stock up. He has been refused any further advance. </para>
                        <para>Case No. 3 refers to 6,000 acres of conditional purchase and Crown lease land valued at &#163;1 10s. per acre, or a total value of &#163;9,000. The stock is worth &#163;1,500, and the unsold wool &#163;300. The total assets are &#163;10,800. There are no outstanding debts. A bank has advanced &#163;4,500, but in order to stock the land properly the holder requires a further &#163;1,,500. However, the security is not regarded as good enough, and the bank will advance him nothing further. </para>
                        <para>Case No. 4 is that of freehold, conditional purchase, and Crown lease land, comprising 2,710 acres worth &#163;2 10s. per acre. The total value is &#163;6,775. Ewes and lambs are worth &#163;600, cattle &#163;200, and horses &#163;70. The total value of assets is &#163;7,545, on which a bank has advanced &#163;2,800. The holder, however, requires another &#163;1,000 to enable him to stock up, but his bank has absolutely refUsed to give him any further assistance. a </para>
                        <para>Case !No. 5 refers to freehold, conditional purchase, and Crown lease land, comprising 9,612 acres. The freehold land is worth &#163;2 10s. per acre, and is paid up to &#163;1 5s. per acre. The conditional purchase land is worth &#163;1 10s. per acre. The total value of the holding is &#163;13,400. The stock is valued at &#163;6,,075, and wool unsold is worth &#163;930. The total assets are valued at &#163;20,405, on which &#163;6,700 has been advanced, hut the owner has been asked to reduce his overdraft. This he cannot do. As a matter of fact, he really requires more capital in order to stock up his property to its carrying capacity. </para>
                        <para>Case No. 7 is that of a Crown, lease on which all conditions have been fulfilled, and the property is now convertible to a freehold. It comprises 4,647 acres worth; at &#163;1 per acre, &#163;4,647. The sheep are worth &#163;450,, and the unsold wool is valued at &#163;110. The total value of the assets is &#163;5,607. . The bank advance is &#163;1,185, and the outstanding debts amount to &#163;110, but the holder requires a further &#163;1,100 to enable him to stock up his property properly. He has been absolutely refused any further assistance&#39;. Indeed, he has been asked to reduce his overdraft as soon as possible. &#62;l) </para>
                        <para>The Associated Banks have got cold feet, or they are in such a position through carrying the importers that they cannot advance further capital to any individual. It is beyond doubt that the grazing industry is perfectly solvent, because against the whole of the assets of the forty-three cases in this list, which are an average of conditions that apply throughout Australia, the banks have only advanced up to 27- per cent, of the value of the stock and land, exclusive of plant. .

                        <para class="block">Personally, I do not take any responsibility for the suggested note issue or the short-dated loan in London. I believe there is sufficient credit in Australia to support men. who are absolutely solvent, and require only a little temporary assistance in order that they may re-stock their land and carry on until they have sold their wool, or until such time as the wool position is eased. Whilst the Acting Prime Minister may be opposed to any further inflation of the note issue, and will not entertain the suggestion for a short-dated loan in London, he should, at least, make some arrangement with the Associated Banks whereby they will not foreclose on small land-holders. It has been suggested by representatives of the Associated Banks that it is not their intention to. close down on the small men. Others cold-bloodedly say that times are bad, and the weakest must go to the wall. That is a brutal and vicious principle to enunciate. A man who has been twenty, thirty forty, or even forty-five years on the land, . and finds himself, temporarily embarrassed owing to drought, followed by floods and the depression of the wool market caused by international conditions, should not be forced off his land because of temporary tightness of the money market or panic on the part of the bankers. The schedule which has been filed deals with forty-three cases, in all of which it has been found that the valuation of properties is about twelve years old. The properties have not been re- valued in the meantime, although, in many instances, the value of the land has completely altered. Many of the properties have been further improved, and the titles have been converted. A property which might have been valued at &#163;6,000 twelve years ago would to-day be worth probably double that amount. Notwithstanding that fact, the banks will do nothing to relieve the situation. </para>

                                <para>- I say that the value of twelve years ago has been doubled. A great number of conditional purchase blocks and Crown leases have been converted, and conditions have been fulfilled which make the land considerably more valuable - 100 per cent, more valuable in some cases. Where the title of a conditional purchase has been converted the security is ever so much better. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, the  Chairman  of Bawra, attended the deputation which waited upon the Acting Prime Minister, and we suggested to him that Bawra should take control of the whole of the wool. I am a frank advocate of the pooling system ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J</inline> ohn Higgins stated that unless the whole of the wool-growers were prepared to go into the Pool he could do nothing, whilst the Acting Prime Minister said that he would not compel wool-growers to place their wool to the Pool. If the wool growers were to come together and enlarge the business of Bawra, so that that body could establish credits and pay on appraisement, as was done during the war, the situation would be considerably relieved. I believe that the pooling system is so good that it should be adopted always, and not only in times of war and financial stringency. </para>

When hundreds of thousands of men are producing the same article, they should come together as a co-operative society for the selling df .their products instead  of marketing them through agents like Dalgety &#38; Co., Dreyfus &#38; Co., :and other big wool-broking firms. The wool-growers and the wheat-growers could market their own products, and thereby eliminate the middlemen. . If the wool-growers establish their pooling system they will be in a very much better position than they are to-day. There is no difference between Bawra holders and holders df free wool. There will &#39;be involved merely the matter of enlarging their business. It will be  for  wool-growers generally .to say whether they shall so expand their business. But it will take time ito inaugurate a scheme to pool the whole of the wool of .Australia *o much time, .indeed, that those who are being .forced by .the banks to-day would probably find themselves removed from their small &#39;holdings.

                        <para>Before sailing for London this, afternoon the Prime Minister made a statement on the wool position before the Assembly. -He said that the - Government &#39; had been negotiating &#39; for -the -sale of the new clip .to the British .Government, hut had found difficulties. He was .not sure Whether it would succeed, and, therefore, in view of the financial situation, the Government had come to the conclusion that it would -he &#39;necessary -to &#39;assist &#39;the producers to- revive the scheme in&#39; operation , -before &#39;the war, whereby the banks, with -a Government guarantee, made advances on wool. </para>
                        <para>General Smuts-said that the wool and mohair farmers would be entitled to an advance of up to 50 per cent, on pre-war prices, which would enable them to tide over the financial depression. The Prime Minister praised the liberality Of the banks, which/had agreed to accept 64 per cent, interest. &#39;He has impressed . on &#39; the  banks 1 the .grave &#39;necessity; owing to the present crisis, of not . contracting, credit for too much. </para>
                        <para class="block">Apparently, .just what took place in South Africa in the matter of the banks forcing graziers .has occurred in Australia. The -Government .can immediately relieve the situation here if they desire. . This is an absolutely solvent industry, requiring, perhaps, not more than a couple of millions sterling by way of necessary advances to those who are in need. It would be an easy matter to authorize the Commonwealth .Bank - which -would act&#39; in conjunction &#34;with the Associated Banks - to establish a credit which would permit -these people .to -.stock up and carry -on. &#39;If some such assistance is  not granted  the -present condition of unemployment throughout Australia &#34;must become considerably more acute. In Kew -South Wales there &#171;re :between  10,000  and  15,&#39;OGM  men out of work. The position in Victoria is just as bad. Tn South Australia there ate some  5,000  men out, and there is unemployment in Western Australia, Tasmania, &#39;and -Queensland. The shearing -season is approaching, but, -unless the industry is stabilized, -quite a number Who,  ordinarily,  &#39;would employ labour &#34;for shearing&#39; will not -be in a position to do -so.

                            <para>. - I have not much that is fresh to say upon this matter. . The honorable member the other day introduced a deputation to me, which was representative of the men in the far-back districts referred to this afternoon - ?men who, .no-doubt, are in dire distress. I cannot &#39;agree to &#39;their proposals, however. <inline font-style="italic">&#39;I</inline> told the deputation emphatically that. I would  not  have anything to do with the schemes propounded to me. I said I would not attempt to give them credit in the shape of further inflation of the currency to the extent of &#163;10,000,000, as the deputationists suggested. I pointed out that that would not help them at all, but would only aggravate their difficulties. I told them I was quite unable, even if I were willing, to get them a loan of &#163;5,000,000 in London at present. Just now, nearly all the States are, asking for loan money in London, and we ourselves need it- if we can get it - from that same source. Then there is the other proposal of the deputation, namely, that wool should be stabilized for two years by establishing a reserve price of l0d. per lb. on wool instead of 8d., as has already been agreed to. There may be some possibility of relief in that direction. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins invited these wool people to come into Bawra and avail themselves of the privileges which Bawra offers. Really, I think that that was good advice. Instead of this matter being brought before Parliament, as it has been to-day, and instead. of the Government being asked to acquiesce in impossible schemes, it would be wiser, to look a little nearer home and face the actual causes of the whole trouble.. The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> stated just now that these valuations, which showed such tremendous margins, were the valuations of twelve years ago. He left it to bo inferred that the price of land in the districts indicated was very much higher to-day than it was then. But the contrary is the case. I understand that land in those parts is not now worth in some cases half what it was twelve years ago. </para>

                                <para>- I am referring to New South Wales, and did not mention Queensland. The fact is that honorable members opposite, and the parties with which they are associated, are responsible for writing down the values of those lands, and it is time they began to recognise that the chickens are coming home to roost. We sympathise with those who are the victims, but honorable members opposite and their political friends are causing many of the troubles with which the graziers are confronted. They are also largely responsible for the attitude of the banks, who see their securities becoming less valuable. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable  member and his supporters know that contracts made with the leaseholders in Queensland have been interfered with, and that trouble has arisen in consequence of such action, which has adversely affected the money markets in London and in Australia. They cannot have it both. ways. Honorable members cannot go out with predatory intent against these institutions, and then ask them to be more liberal than ever. It is of no use blinking our eyes at the situation. Personally, I have the greatest possible sympathy with those men who are struggling to keep their holdings, and who cannot secure the necessary accommodation from the banks. </para>

                                <para>- I shall leave it at that. In all the districts referred to by the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> he and those with whom he is associated are helping these unfortunate people by submitting a new log for shearers which is going to add a groat deal to the graziers&#39; costs. I do not know the exact figures, but I believe it will mean a very great increase in the cost of production as compared with what it was before. On the one hand, there is a proposal which means more costly production by increasing the log rates, and on the other a request for financial assistance. Even the honorable member who submitted the motion will agree that that additional expenditure cannot be overcome by the  introduction of machinery, or anything of the kind. </para>

                                <para>- All that I can do will be done. I trust the banks will be as lenient as possible. The policy of the banks throughout the world at the present time is to&#39; draw in as much as they can in the interests of their own solvency and financial stability. We&#39; have to meet the conditions that are upon us, and the honorable member for Darling stressing the so-called liberality of the South African banks does not help the position. He indorses all that General Smuts said concerning the liberality of South African banks, who. are only charging 6&#189; percent. He praises the action of the South African banks, and denounces that of the banking institutions here who are financing many important undertakings for us at 6 per cent. </para>

We have been very careless in the . past, . and, there is grave. -.danger for the . future,, unless we -mend our ways. This is naturally a time of financial stringency, but, as has been . pointed out &#34;by the; &#39;-Treasurer. <inline font-weight="bold">..(Sir joseph</inline> Cook), that stringency-must . &#39;be accentuated by the class . of . legislation -introduced, into the New South Wales Parliament only recently, and the threat that that legislation is to be brought, forward again. </para>

                                <para>- There can be no doubt that many of our troubles to-day are due to economic as well as. to industrial conditions. Much of the trouble has been brought about by Government interference. I think that speeches made on this motion might well be made on the Tariff, as it might be pointed out that, by increasing the cost of living through the Tariff, we are making it more difficult for those engaged in the mining, farming, and pastoral industries to carry on. For the purpose of discussion of the Tariff I  brought here to-day some particulars, concerning the condition. ; of Argentina. That country has not to face : the difficulties confronting us, as it did not assist in the war, and,- therefore, has not incurred a big war debt.The statement I have before me refers to the marvellous progress which Argentina has made within the past few years. I quote the following:- </para>

                        <para class="block">  The economic state of Argentina is one of veritable prosperity, according ; to the recent report issued by . Ernesto Tornquiest and Cia, bankers, of Buenos Aires. The abundance of cereal production, coinciding&#39; with the worldwide scarcity,has- occasioned keen competition among the countries .  interested, in. -securing . a portion of it for themselves . Contrary, to the fears which, were at,. one time entertained, neitherunfavorable&#39; exchange rates nor high prices have proved to be an obstacle in the way of the easy sale of the country&#39;s produce in general. In  consequence,, large numbers -of ships have arrived, and continue to arrive, at the various ports, and the country&#39;s foreign trade has become enormously active of late. . . Low exchange rates have favoured the cancellation of mortgages and other debts in Europe, and important quantities of bonds of the Argentine public debt, Cedulas of the NationalMortgage Bank, &#38;c.,have been imported Furthermore, subscriptions to loans recently floated by the Governments of France and Italy reached very high sums in Argentina. In short, Argentina is passing through an&#39; epoch of great prosperity, and one &#39;which, judging by all appearances, is likely to continue for some time. </para>

                                <para>- Extraordinary circumstances which, in our case, have been destroyed by our economic and industrial conditions. I think we would be justified in giving serious consideration to bur present- industrial laws. When prices were soaring in this country, the workers, in my opinion, did not receive a fair share of the huge profits that were being made. I am anxious that they shall always receive fair play ; but, having regard to the wretched economic position with which we are faced - in view of the fact that mines are closing down, and that there will be no employment for men in the outback country, the existing condition of things must be changed. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not think that any  one  will say that the remarks made by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> or the &#39; utterances of&#39; the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> are likely to help in any way the people on the land who, at the present time, are labouring under serious disabilities. -The honorable member for Dampier . indulged in one long tirade against the workers,  of  Australia, and was reminded by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> that the workers have the same - right to live as has any other section of  thb  community. When he asserted that the Land Bill introduced into the Parliament of New South Wales by the State Government had depreciated land values in that State, and was making the position of the . man on the land extremely difficult, I asked him to cite one clause  in the measure which was calculated to have such an effect. He was unable to do so, and I suggested that he had never seen the Bill. If eel sure that he has not seen it, or that if he has he has not carefully considered it. The honorable member said that it provided for the compulsory resumption of land, and that because, of that provision it had had the effect of depreciating land values in New South Wales. In Victoria, where there is not a Labour Government in power, an Act providing for the compulsory resumption of estates has been in operation for many years. When it was being passed there, was no talk on the part of the banking -institutions of calling upon land-holders . or any one else to reduce their overdrafts ; but because such a measure was introduced by a Labour Government in the New South Wales Parliament, the honorable member urges that it has brought about all the difficulties under which land-holders in that State are labouring to-day. We know, as a fact, that it has not done so. The Acting Prime Minister(Sir Joseph Cook) also urged that the man on the land in Queensland and New South Wales had been subjected to the most unfortunate conditions because of legislation passed by State Labour Governments.It is to be regretted that the right honorable gentleman was unable to discuss this question without introducing party politics. He might, have well been expected to propound some scheme to assist the people on the land who are in such difficulties today. Unfortunately he made no such attempt, but approached the consideration of the question from a purely party political stand-point. The right honorable gentleman also made the most extraordinary statement that land values in New South Wales were higher twelve months ago than they are to-day. </para>

                                <para>- I shall not say that the Acting Prime Minister made the statement knowing it to be false, but it certainly is wholly opposed to fact. Land values in New South Wales, today are as high as they have been within my knowledge for the last fifteen years. If the right honorable gentleman and the honorable member for Dampier really believe that land values in the Mother State have very greatly depreciated, I invite them to seek to purchase land there. If they do, they will speedily discover that they are mistaken. </para>

                                <para>- That is an entirely different matter. The honorable member is looking at the question from the right point of view. If as a result of the most disastrous, drought ever experienced in New South Wales landowners there are in difficulties to-day, and if, because of those difficulties, they are in many cases forced off the land, values will certainly decrease. The present situation is due to natural causes, and what I might describe as &#34;bad luck,&#34; rather than to legislation. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; because land-owners who have had to fight drought conditions have not yet had pressure brought to bear upon them by the banks. They are struggling under serious handicaps due to the natural causes to which I have referred, and if the financial institutions call upon them to reduce their overdrafts before they can get on their feet again, there certainly will be a depreciation in land values. Bad seasons and not bad legislation are responsible for the present situation. As a matter of fact, the Land Bill to. which the honorable member for Dampier; referred was not passed. Ito was withdrawn. That Bill was capable of much service, and I trust that it will be improved and re-introduced, in the hope of doing something in the direction of cutting up large estates of 50,000 and 60,000 acres and over, and thus giving an opening to people who are now looking for land in vain. </para>

                                <para>- Not at all., The Commonwealth Bank should be  capable  of exercising all the functions of a truly national bank, functions which &#39;it does npt now exercise. There is too much . political control brought to bear, and this prevents the Bank doing what a national bank should. Too much thought is . given by the Government to the protection of the . private banking companies, &#39;and, because df that, the Commonwealth Bank cannot perform its proper . functions.  . If  it were allowed to perform these functions, the . pastoralists and others on the land to-day would not be experiencing their present difficulties. The national credit of this country could be used to a greater extent &#39;than : it is ;  it  was so used during - the war period, and it can . be msed in . any -.time of national difftoulty. The war &#34;was -a &#39;national trouble, and, had it continued, we should have had - to rely on our national -credit for years to come.  &#39;It  is a hackneyed, but nevertheless a true -saying, that the primary producers are the &#34;backbone of the country &#34; ; and now they are in difficulties.  If  these producers suffer, the whole country suffers, and the present is a time when the national credit should be used to relieve them  by  means of -the National Bank. Perhaps it would be too harsh to say that the Acting Prime Minister is preventing that being done  by  the Bank; but there is no doubt that the right ; honorable;gentleman -in -his position as Treasurer -could do something to assist it . in using the &#39;-national &#39;credit -.to a&#39; greater -extent. I have several letters in my possession &#91;from people - on . the land in New South Wales,.. &#39;and they are  typical of -.hundreds- referred &#39;to by the honorable member  forDarling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley).</inline>  and others. It will be :  admitted that the . position of . New South Wales is exceptional. During -the : 1am four &#34;years; &#39;that ; State has : su&#39;ffered &#39;more from drought and bad &#39;seasons . than any other State -of ..the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>Mr.CUNNINGHAM (Gwydir) &#91;4:28&#93;. - Honorable members who have spoken in opposition to any action being . taken by the Commonwealth Government do not, in my opinion, take a broad enough view of the position. Those honorable members seem to think that the difficulties referred to are confined &#39;to New South Wales, but there is evidence that they affect Queensland, as well as certain  portions ofVictoria. -There is no doubt, that the State -Governments can &#39;alford a certain amount of &#39;relief, and. &#34;the . New South Wales Government has promised to do so, hut this industry is a national one, extending all over Australia, and under the circumstances I submit that it is the duty of this Government to take steps to safeguard it. The Commonwealth Government very properly has control of the  defence of the nation, because such a matter-  cannot properly be managed by the States individually, and on the Commonwealth Government falls the duty of safeguarding the interests of the nation. I submit, therefore, as a fair analogy, that when war is being made, as it were, on a section of our primary producers engaged in a national industry, the Commonwealth Government ought to come to their protection and aid. We have been told that the banks have gone as far as they can - that they are business institutions, and have to safeguard themselves. I remind honorable members, however, that the private banks enjoy certain privilege&#39;s under the laws of this country, and, moreover, that when money is plentiful we find bank managers approaching producers and urging them to go into propositions in order to absorb bank funds that would otherwise be idle. Many men have been induced by bank managers in that way to go into certain propositions, and now that the period of depression has come upon us, some of the banks are suffering from cold feet, and are doing much to injure the credit of this country by intimating to the landholders that their credits are not good, or that they have to reduce their overdrafts. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; some say that this is a deliberate attempt to discredit Labour Governments, and it is significant that this move was first made in New South Wales, a State which has as good credit as has any other in the Commonwealth. Still, it is there that we find a great move made to order men to reduce their overdrafts. In order to meet this order, many of the men are forced to dispose of what I call their reproductive capital. A man may have 2,000 acres of land worth &#163;3,000, with &#163;1,000 worth of sheep - a flock that be has, perhaps, spent years and years in breeding up to a certain pitch of perfection. When he is ordered to reduce his overdraft, he has to sell that flock. Therefore, to reduce his overdraft, he leaves his property bare of stock, and, consequently, bare of his reproductive capital. Land and grass, without stock to grow wool or increase in weight to be sold as fats, are of no use. The reason for the attitude of the banks is beyond my comprehension. They stood at the back of the importers and paid their debts overseas, as we know, because the papers are full of it. When these men ordered ten times the amount of stuff they required, and large quantities were unexpectedly delivered, the banks stepped in and met their debts overseas. The papers went so far as to say that the banks should have shut down on the importers six or twelve months be- . fore they did. It was only when these men had drifted into such a position that the banks saw no chance of their paying their debts, that they shut down on them, and refused further credit. </para>

                                <para>- My information came from reliable sources, as well as the daily press that supports the present Federal Government. If I am wrong, the honorable member&#39;s press supporters are wrong also. It seems to me that the action of the banks is designed to crucify the country at the expense of the cities. I am one of those on the land, and am continually receiving letters from men who have been forced to sell their live stock. If this policy is persisted in the Government will find big areas of land in New South Wales, as well as in other portions of Australia, without stock on them. The present holders will have no incomes during the next twelve months, and, consequently, large amounts of revenue will be lost both to the State and Federal Treasuries. Blood cannot be got out of a stone, and if a man has no income, he pays no income tax. If the banks persist in their attitude, and do not call their dogs off, many of these men will be forced off their holdings, and if the mortgagees foreclose, the properties will be sold. The bank in each case is; of course, covered, because it has advanced only about one-third of the value of the property, and, consequently, will get its money out of it; but what becomes of the man who is pushed out with nothing? He joins the ranks of the unemployed, and drifts into the city, and then there is a clamour for the raising of State loans in order to provide employment. The banks themselves will buy up many of these properties after the occupiers have been forced out. In the past the banks have put up &#34; dummies &#34; to buy in properties of that kind. I have known cases where men were forced out by the banks, and the &#34; dummies &#34; put up by the banks bought their properties. The banks, using their position under the laws of the country, have been able to acquire properties in that way at less than their true value, and to thrust out many a pioneer with his swag on his back after all his years of labour. &#34;We on this side take up the position that it is the duty of the  Government to see that no &#34;man is pushed out of his home when his position is not &#39; his fault. Honorable members opposite may say that that is not a business proposition. They are full of praise to-day for the gigantic harvest wo have had in New South Wales, which brought into that State approximately between &#163;35,000,000 and &#163;40,000,000 ; but when the State financed those men, when it gave them seed wheat and orders on the storekeepers for groceries and horse feed, that was not a business proposition either. Many of those men were walking about waiting for the storekeepers to sell up their horses and drays and farming machinery. I know one farmer in Narrabri who told me that fifteen months ago he did not know where to look for his next month&#39;s credit, and yet to-day he stands behind &#163;1,500 worth of wheat. Giving him assistance was not a business proposition, and no bank in the world would have ..touched him at that particular period, but Governments are not like banks. We must not look at these matters from the business point of view from which a bank looks at it. The function of a Government is to protect its people, and if the present Government fails to realize its duty in that regard the alternative is that these men will be pushed out, and will join the army of unemployed. If that is allowed to happen, this Government will have neglected its duty. I was surprised to hear the Treasurer adopting such a helpless attitude as he took up to-day. One would think that his hands were tied, and that he was powerless ; yet men who are considered&#39; to know finance and to understand the Constitution of the Commonwealth say that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to stand behind the men on whose behalf I am speaking. The Government is the controller of finance in Australia. The Commonwealth Government controls the note issue, which is one  of the main factors of the finance of the nation. If the Commonwealth Bank cared to take up the accounts of these men it could increase its business three or fourfold with no risk, and acquire their business for all time. It was to protect the people that this Bank was instituted. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to stand behind these men in their period of depression. They look to the Government, as the controller of finance, to perform its duty to the people of the community, What else are Governments for, if it is not to safeguard the interests of the people? It is a poor consolation, to the man who is pushed out to be told that the Commonwealth Treasurer sympathizes with him. The Treasurer said plainly and emphatically to-day, &#34;I cannot help these men.&#34; We say that a Treasurer who adopts an attitude of impotence, who says that he can do nothing, has failed to realize his functions as a member of the governing body which represents the people of Australia. One honorable member, and, in fact, the Treasurer himself, decried the credit of these people by saying that the lands which they occupy are not so valuable to-day because of certain proposed legislation. That is all a myth, because if the Land Bill referred  to  had been passed it would have applied only to estates of over &#163;30,000 in value. The men for whom we are fighting have assets far below that in value. They are men with &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 up to &#163;8,000 or &#163;10,000 worth of property and plant. A man with &#163;30,000 worth of land would probably hold, with land and stock together, assets in the neighbourhood of &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000. It will be found that none of the men quoted by the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> hold asset3 going above &#163;10,000 or &#163;15,000, and the great bulk of them possess far below that figure, In fact, most of them come within the limit of &#163;5,000, which is only one- sixth of the estate value which it was intended to affect by the passage through the New South Wales Parliament of the Bill in question. For a man in a responsible public position to decry any State is traitorous to the Commonwealth itself. These land values have not decreased. A member sold land in New South Wales only a few days ago at remarkable prices. </para>

                                <para>- Prices far above any placed on the land mentioned here this afternoon. I understand that grazing land was sold, for &#163;7 10s. an acre. When prices like that are obtained, there can be no depreciation of values. Prices may have gone down a little, but not to such an extent that the banks have to force men to meet their overdrafts by sacrificing their stock. Men who are forced to sell their stock under these circumstances will be ten times worse off than they were while the stock were on their land. I am of opinion that the banks are not disinterested in this action. They hold large areas of grazing land, and during the drought did not spend money on saving their stock. They preferred to let their stock die, and to depress the stock market, so that they might restock at the expense of the small land-holders, whom they are dragooning. I hope that the Commonwealth Ministry will realize  it3  duty under these circumstances, and that, if the Treasurer says that he can do nothing, this Parliament will insist that he shall, if necessary, use all the resources of the Commonwealth to save these men from being forced to join the great army of unemployed. Of what use is it to bring thousands of immigrants here to be put on the land if our own people are being turned off it? If our own men cannot make a living on it, no new-chum immigrant will do so. If this Government does not do its duty now, I trust that the electors will call it to account when they have the opportunity to review the work of this Parliament. lt is the duty of the Government to stand behind the men on the land when the banks are threatening to turn them off.

                                <para>- The honorable member knows that the  President  of an Arbitration Court - if any such Court which has been extreme can be so named - has advised the miners to accept a reduction of 20 per cent. If what is now proposed were done, where should we end? The conditions that have been spoken of by the honorable member and others prevail, not in the wool industry alone, but in every other industry, and are likely to be acute for some time to come. It has been insinuated that the banks are acting cruelly; but, knowing something of the actions of the banks towards the industries of this country, and particularly towards our primary industries, I maintain that we in Australia have banks which are as well conducted  and as generous as any in the world. During the past few years the generosity of our banks has been emphasized. </para>

                                <para>- The Commonwealth Bank has not done -so. It has done what the other &#39; banks have done; Had it not done that? it would not have been so successful as it has been from its inception. I do not want the impression that might be caused by the remarks of some speakers about the .banks to go abroad as the truth, because it is not. I know what have been the misfortunes of the people of New South Wales during the past two years, and I sympathize with those who have suffered; but, everything considered, the position of our producers is, generally speaking, satisfactory. Recently, in conversation, one of the biggest machinery men in Australia told me that, taking the Commonwealth as a whole, 90 per cent, of the acceptances for machinery falling due two or three&#39; weeks ago were met. I spoke of the misfortunes of the men in New South Wales, due to the drought, and his reply was that the way in which that &#39;State, as well as the others, had come up to the mark in its payments was amazing. If anything is to be done for the relief of producers in New South Wales, it should be done by the New South Wales Government. The National Government should tell the people, in unmistakable language, that this is not its business, and that it does not propose to follow a dangerous path. This Government will have enough to do to pay its own debts ; indeed, it &#34;will have to strain its resources to the utmost, now and for some time to come, to meet its own engagements. </para>

                            <para>.- Although the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> have said that this debate is a waste of time, and that the subject that is being discussed should not have been brought before the Chamber, I hold &#34;that no more important subject has been discussed here, during my term, at any rate. Realizing, as I do, the position of the graziers of Australia, and particularly of New South Wales, I am surprised that any member should say that the adjournment should not have been moved to discuss this subject, and to impress on the Government that it is its duty to come to the assistance of the men on the land. As I am particularly interested in the subject, I have listened attentively to all the speeches that have been delivered during the debate, and paid more than usual attention to that of the Leader of the Government. But of what did it consist? The right honorable gentleman said that he sympathized with the graziers in the present crisis, but that he could not, and would not, do anything to assist them. The rest of his speech was an attack on the Labour Governments of New South Wales  and Queensland. He endeavoured to make party capital at the expense of the graziers of Australia, not caring how many men might be forced off their holdings and on to the labour market, so long as he could do that. In speaking of the attitude of the Labour Government of New &#39;South Wales to the land-owners of the State, he carefully refrained from mentioning that last year the Government did what no other Government has done:; it borrowed &#163;2,000,000 to assist necessitous farmers, with the result that the acreage under wheat was increased, and has -given a generous return. That Government last year, by its action, stabilized the man on the.-&#62; land ; and actions speak louder than&#39; words. Members opposite have&#39; spoken of the generosity of the banks, and have said that they did not believe that the banks were forcing men off. the land. They added that the banks themselves  are having rather a bad time, and, being short of money, are asking their customers to reduce their overdrafts. I find from a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that the net profits of the Bank of New South Wales for the last six months amounted to &#163;403,932, as compared with a net profit for the previous six months of &#163;364,219. It would appear, therefore, that while the Bank had an exceptionally prosperous time- in the previous six months, it did much better during the half-year that has just closed, a dividend of 10 per cent.,, as well as an &#39;extraordinary bonus of 10s: per share, being paid. Notwithstanding this, the Government and members of the alleged Country party have been trying, to persuade us that the banks have been generous in their treatment of graziers and  land-owners  generally, and that they are having rather a bad time, themselves. This, of .course, is not so. A few weeks ago honorable members had an opportunity to discuss the financial difficulties of the wool-growers, owing to the -fact  that they are. unable .to market their wool. That debate in itself was an admission that the graziers&#39; position is a very serious one indeed. Figures relating, -to the stock returns &#39;in New South Wales show that at the present time there are only 25,000,000 sheep .in that State - the smallest number recorded during the last forty-six years. The land, since the drought, is flowing with milk and honey, so far as .grass is concerned, but the graziers are unable to stock up. Many, indeed, are being forced to sell in order to carry on. Speaking with a positive knowledge of this, subject, I can inform honorable members that three weeks ago &#39;we sent a couple of hundred sheep to the Sydney market, the consignment including 100 crossbred wethers, well grown and in prime condition ; and 90 lambs, exceptionally well grown and very fat. For these we obtained a net return of only Ils. per head, whereas a couple of years ago the wethers would have realized from &#163;2 10s. to &#163;3 per head in the Homebush market. &#34;This proves conclusively that some graziers are in financial difficulties, and are being obliged to sacrifice their stock in order to meet the claims of the banks. It is of no use for the Treasurer to say that the banks are lending money on exceptionally cheap and easy terms. Speaking again from personal experience, I can inform honorable members that I am paying <inline font-style="italic">7\</inline> and 8 per cent, for my accommodation from the bank, so honorable members will have some idea of the real position and the so-called &#34; generosity &#34; on the part of the hanks. I submit, therefore, that it is the duty of the Government to come to the assistance of the graziers by enlarging the powers and extending the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, if necessary, so. that the Bank may take over graziers&#39; accounts and finance them until the wool and stock market is stabilized, thus preventing the ruin which must inevitably come to. a large number of land-owners unless something is done to help them. Every honorable member, I think; realizes . that the most important industry in Australia is that of wool-growing, and because of its precarious position at present, some- definite action should be taken to prevent &#39;the graziers from being &#39;forced to realize on their stock or sacrifice their land. </para>

                            <para>The payment to soldiers&#39; widows are made as directed in the first schedule of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act of 1920, and in the case of all widows with dependent children they represent an increase in the total amount (pension and living allowance combined) paid under the old Act. The pension paid soldiers&#39; widowed mothers is also provided under the first schedule of the amending Act, which further prohibits the granting of pensions to the children of such widowed mothers unless they were dependent &#39; upon the deceased soldier (see section 22, &#34; Dependants &#34; (el) and the third schedule, &#34; Other. Dependants &#34;) . The Act of 1920 was designed to merge pension and living allowance in the one payment - the pension. The only variation made by the Government has been in the direction of increasing the benefits provided by the Act. </para>

                        <para>.- Honorable members are aware that I have always advocated the nationalization of the iron and steel industry in Australia, but as it has been proved over and over again that the Commonwealth has no power under the Constitution to do that, we have encouraged the establishment, in two instances, of big iron and steel works in the State of New South Wales. Many thousands of people are employed directly and indirectly by these works, and my concern is as to their continued employment and the conditions under which they are working. I find that since this schedule was placed on the table of the House there have been considerable changes, such as increases in the price of coal, increases in harbor dues, and increases under Wages Boards findings, so that the commercial values of the duties set out on most of the lines produced by the two big establishments in New South Wales have been, in some instances, reduced by 70 to 80 per cent., and in other cases completely obliterated. For instance, the value of the duty on pig iron has been reduced by 70 per cent. Instead of being 20s. British, 30s. intermediate, and 40s. general, it is 6s. British, 16s. intermediate, and 25s. general. The same thing applies right down the list of similar items. Recently, there has been a considerable increase in the importation of steel and iron, presumably from Belgium, but it is questionable whether the imported steel has not really originated in Germany, where, as I shall show, the wages paid are exceedingly low in comparison with those paid in Australia. This material has been landed in Australia and sold at about; &#163;10 per ton less than the price of the local production, and if this importation continues, it is obvious that it will be utterly impossible for our own works to compete. The value of the duty on ingots, blooms, &#38;c., has been reduced in the manner I have already described from 32s. British, to 10s. 7d. I do not propose to weary honorable members by instituting a detailed comparison in regard to the duties under the intermediate or general columns of the Tariff. It is sufficient to say that the reductions are proportionate throughout. The reduced value of the 44s. duty on bar, rod, angle, and tee steel is minus 2s. 8d. That is to say, the duty has been practically wiped out altogether. </para>

                        <para>The Bethelem Steel Company has announced a reduction of wages at the South Bethelem plant of from 10 to 20 per cent., effective on the 16th January. The announcement was made following a joint meeting of the company officials and representatives of the workmen under the employees&#39; representation plan in effect at the plant. The reduction is similar to the one being made at the Lebanon plant. A 10 to 20 per cent, redaction is also announced for the Sparrow&#39;s Point plant, effective on the same date. The company employs from 5,000 to 6,000 men under normal conditions. </para>

                    <para class="block">In Great Britain, we find considerable reductions have been made in the wages paid in the iron trade. The <inline font-style="italic">Engineering and Industrial Management</inline> of the 27th January, 1921, gives the information that the Furness Miners Union had &#39;agreed to accept a reduction, in wages from &#163;1 2s. Sd. to 19s. 7d. per day, and that the iron ore miners in Lancashire had agreed to accept a reduction in wages of about &#39;3s. per day. The same publication in .its issue of the 10th March, 1921, contained the announcement that the Cleveland ironstone miners had given notice that the 2s. advance per day granted in November, the war wage of 3s. per day, and the Sankey payment of 2s. per day shift would be terminated on the 31st March. The patent fuel export trade manufacturers applied in January for a reduction of 20 per cent, in wages, and the iron and steel employers of Sheffield gave notice in March that a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">\7\</inline> per cent, was proposed for men working in rolling mills and forges. The motor waggon works at  Sandbach  were to be re-opened on condition that the men accepted a- .one-sixth wage reduction. </para>

                            <para>- And in. other places, I believe. With a view to keeping going an industry which now exists in Australia, I would suggest an increase on particular items of duty which would be some equivalent to the handicap imposed upon the local manufacturers by competition from abroad. No country ever became a great nation that did not produce iron and steel as a key or base for other industries. If the industry for which I am speaking had not been established in Australia during the war, the Commonwealth would have paid for rails and other materials locally produced an extra &#163;6,000,000, if we compare Australian prices with British prices, or an extra &#163;4,000,000 if the comparison be with the prices in other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I am speaking only of the industry in my own electorate. When the coal export trade was dislocated, the iron and steel works at Newcastle and Lithgow saved the situation. They were able to not only manufacture rails for State Governments, and to produce iron and steel for other purposes, but they also sent rails to France to help the French and British Governments in the prosecution of the war. It was a fine thing for this country that works which had been brought into being at practically a moment&#39;s notice should develop so rapidly as to be able to, not only supply Australia, but to also contribute material help in the great struggle in Europe. </para>

                <para>A cablegram from Commercial Attache W. C. Huntington, Paris, states that a French decree of 18th December, published in the <inline font-style="italic">J ournalOfficiale</inline> for 27th December, reestablishes with the corresponding coefficient the import duty on rails, fishplates, bridges, and parts thereof, which was suspended by decree of 30th November, 1914, and 3rd March, 1915, in cases where such materials were required for repairs on railways, &#38;c., necessary for national defence. The duty on heavy structural iron and steel is 12 francs per 100 kilos., with a coefficient of 3, which makes the duty now in force 36 francs per 100 kilos., or 3 dollars 15 cents per 100 lbs. - &#163;14 2s. 6d. conversion on standard value of France. </para>

                            <para>- Quite recently we read that England is paying attention to these basic industries by imposing, in some instances, duties of from 70 to 80 per cent. For many years this Parliament discussed how the iron and steel industry could be established in Australia, and ultimately it was established; and we are in the fortunate position of know-&#39; ing that our iron and steel works,&#39; although young, are making good progress and developing on a firm basis. The iron and steel works in my own electorate employ directly about 6,000 people; and it is hard to estimate the number of people who are indirectly dependent upon them. </para>

                            <para>- Take into consideration also the subsidiary industries that are collecting around the mother industries for the utilization of the smaller sizes of steel. To-day, when all other nations are trying to rebuild their iron and. steel industries, we should take steps to protect and foster ours until they are on a sound footing. I have shown the necessity for those industries, and how much they have already meant to the Commonwealth. Australia is an island continent, and if it were at any time cut off from the help of the Motherland, our people would be powerless to defend themselves if we were without steel works to produce the material for our armaments. A well-established iron and steel industry is the greatest essential to a country that desires to be self-contained in respect of defence requirements. We feel safer when we know that, in addition to having the finest men in the world, we are able to arm them within the Commonwealth. I do not intend to say anything further upon the first of these items, but on later items I shall move that the duties be increased by an average of 50 per cent. Even if that increase is made, the local products will not be on as good a commercial level as they were when the Tariff was first laid upon the table, because some of the old duties have been wiped out altogether, and in respect of other items the effective duties have been reduced by from 70 to 80 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- If they compared those rates with existing Tariffs in other parts of the world where huge steel and iron industries flourish, they would be impressed by the fact that my proposal is a relatively low one. And it is so, judged by the standard of the Tariffs which were imposed in order to establish works of magnitude in the countries indicated. In my electorate, more than &#163;4,000,000 has been invested in the iron and steel works. There are at present about 6,000 men directly employed, to say nothing of those concerned in attendant industries which are being grouped around the iron and steel works, and which are producing independently and giving employment to large numbers. If the Tariff stands without the amendments which I desire, those Australian works which are just now becoming firmly established will have to carry on without adequate protection such as is being given to other Australian industries, both small and great. We must place the big parent industries upon a sound footing, so that they may withstand competition emanating from cheap-labour countries. I sincerely trust that the Minister will accede to my request. I want to see these industries, not merely firmly based, but flourishing. Unless we grant sufficient protection, we cannot expect that. </para>

                            <para>- The bounty may have been well enough in the early stages, when the industries could not produce enough to meet Australia&#39;s requirements; but when steel works have reached a stage at which they can turn out sufficient to supply Australia&#39;s requirements, the matter of a bounty goes by the board. If it could be shown that we had suffered by the operation of the Tariff as a means of protection to these industries in the past, if Australians had been penalized by Australian iron and steel producers behind the shelter of Protection, I would he able to understand the desire to grant a bounty rather than increase the degree of protection. But the plea for a bounty rather than a high duty fails to attract when one considers the price of these products throughout the world. The establishment of these works in Australia, under the protection of the Tariff, instead of being detrimental to the public interest, has saved them in the aggregate perhaps &#163;10,000,000. I make use of that figure in the light of what Australians would have had to pay for their requirements had they imported them during the period under review. I ask the Minister to consider the danger confronting these new Australian industries, not only from such sources as America and Germany, but from India, where works are now being devoted, after a period of war-time activity, almost entirely to export trade. Australia is one of India&#39;s closest markets ; and where will we be in competition with cheap Indian labour if we are not safeguarded? Australian manufacturers have proved that Australian steel is of the finest quality in the world. The industry is rapidly growing, and its interests - wrapped up as they are in those of Australia itself - demand our practical sympathy. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with interest and pleasure to the remarks of the honorable member, and I am quite in sympathy with his objects. I have visited the great steel works at Newcastle. They are a credit to the Commonwealth. They should receive every possible encouragement by way of adequate protection. At the same time, I call attention to the danger of imposing a heavy duty all round upon iron and steel productions. We must be careful not to place a practically prohibitive duty upon certain lines of manufacture which are not yet being turned out in Australia. I cite as an example steel plates and sheets, upon which, on and after the 1st January, 1922, there are proposed to be duties - I quote merely one size as an example - amounting to 65s., S2s. 6d., and 100s. per ton. A certain firm in my electorate was tendering some time ago for a contract involving the manufacture of fifty-five locomotives. The firm had to compete keenly both with Britain and America. There are various lines of steel and iron products which  cannot yet be made in Australia. If they have to he obtained from overseas, an exceedingly high duty upon them will naturally affect any tender such as that of  the  firm in question. We must protect the general machinery founders. I wish to know if the Minister will consent to withhold the&#39; imposition of the duty if, after  1st  January,  1922,  certain lines are still not manufactured here? </para>

                        <para>. -  It is our desire to see Australia become, as far as possible, self-sustaining. In order to bring that about, our infant iron and steel industry must be much more practically encouraged than in the past. Our trouble hitherto has been mainly that we have not been able to furnish from within Australia the essential raw products, or, at any rate, in requisite quantities. That difficulty, however, is now being obviated. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> interjected some &#39;minutes ago that instead of considerably increasing duties, it would be wiser to revert to the bonus system, under which the whole of the Australian people would give their share of financial assistance. The bonus system justified itself only so long as Australia could not furnish the Australian industry with the necessary raw product. If our industries are to flourish and become great, and supply the whole of the Australian demand, we must be able to furnish the raw material from within. There is one difficulty which has arisen, however, in connexion with providing the raw product for the iron and steel industry. To-day there are only two large interests supplying iron, namely, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and Hoskins Limited. Complaints have been made by smaller men which, unhappily, are justified. The iron and steel manufacturers may say that they are not in a position to supply smaller manufacturers with their product, and the smaller men, whose operations are interfered with, have then to compete unfairly with those who are receiving supplies. &#187; </para>

It was said on one occasion that the nasty workers went on strike, and that those engaged in the collieries would not handle coal. Personally, I hope that those who are inadequately paid will continue striking until their conditions are improved. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but such a charge could also he laid against other companies. That is one of the damnable situations which arise under our present economic system. We also know that the importers supply only certain people, and I am merely submitting arguments against the imposition of higher duties. I am hoping that the increase suggested by the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins),</inline> if adopted, will be the means of inducing other manufacturers to come to Australia. Even if they do, there is the risk of an &#34; honorable understanding &#34; being entered into with other capitalistic institutions; but I am hoping that the measure which the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has promised to bring before this Parliament will be the means of preventing commercial combines from operating to the detriment of the consumers. This practice is not common to the iron trade alone, because it was said that, if the spinning mills in Australia would not supply certain small manufacturers with the necessary yarn, they would have to pay a higher price for imported yarn, and would thus be placed in a very unfair position. Of course, the spinning mill proprietors said that  they could not help it, as they had certain contracts to complete; but nevertheless the smaller men were penalized. We have experienced similar difficulties in many other directions. When we were discussing the last Tariff, and the duty on rope and jute was under consideration, the smaller manufacturers said that if we placed a duty on yarn Australian manufacturers would not be able to compete in the open market. I was in favour of encouraging the manufacture of yarn in Australia, and therefore had to insist on the imposition of a higher duty. We have to depend largely upon the actions of the firms. We know that capitalism has no soul; but if the capitalists do not look after their own interests, no one else will. I am prepared to tell the manufacturers of Australia that they are foolish if they do not assist in establishing industries for the manufacture of our raw products,; but if these industries combine to the detriment of others, this Parliament must have the opportunity of taking them over, not at their own price, but at a price acceptable to the Government. If I happen to be on the side that dominates the political situation when such action is taken, these gentlemen will get very short shrift from me, because if we are not prepared to control their operations we will be in a very bad position. </para>

                            <para>- No ; and any other Government who had the support of the Country party would not, I am afraid, do as I wish. We have to accept the inevitable whether we like it or not, and&#39; manufacture the raw products in Australia. There is a great demand for the articles mentioned in sub-item b, which the manufacturers say that they cannot obtain. The district which I represent does not produce the raw material, but there are several large iron and steel manufacturing firms within its boundaries; if they cannot obtain imported iron and steel - and I am trying to prevent them - they must procure it from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s steel works, or Hoskins Limited. These firms must not prevent the smaller manufacturers from getting what they require, and if they do they are seriously injuring important industries and retarding progress. I cannot prove that such is the case, but the matter has been brought under my notice. </para>

I am warning honorable members not to play into the hands of the Free Traders, and I trust that our manufacturers will sell their product direct to the consumers, and not through middlemen. I shall assist the honorable member for Newcastle in the amendment he ha3 suggested, and trust that some provision will be made by the Government whereby combines who endeavour to restrain trade can be effectively dealt with. </para>

                        <para>.  - I have had an opportunity of closely investigating the Australian iron industry, and recently visited the works of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and Hoskins Limited. My last visit was made about two months ago, and it is possible that conditions may have altered somewhat since then, but at that particular time, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and Hoskins Limited were quite satisfied with the duties now before the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. The manager of the Broken Hill steel works said that at Iron Knob they have the richest iron ore deposits in the world, and they could produce from their deposit in South Australia 1 ton of pig iron for every ton of coke used. He also informed me that the next cheapest producer in the world was Pittsburg, where it took 25 cwt. of coke to produce 1 ton of pig iron, thus showing that Australia had a preference of 25 per cent. over America. I am quite prepared to give the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and Hoskins Limited fair and proper protection provided that the public of Australia are also protected. If I thought for a moment that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, in competition with other manufacturers, would be penalized, I would support a higher duty, but I have not heard an argument put forward that would suggest that an increase should be made. In giving protection to our Australian industries, we have to be careful not to create Combines, which would be dominated by a few commercial men, and which would eventually be a curse to Australia. We have only to visit the site of the steel works at Newcastle to find that the adjacent ground is divided into blocks which they are prepared to lease to other firms for the establishment of secondary industries. At the present time the Austral Nail Works,. Wire Netting Works, and Lysaght&#39;s Galvanized Iron plant are established there. The Austral Nail Works cannot sell a pound of nails without the consent of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. The position seemed so unusual that I perused the records in the Arbitration Court, and found in the evidence of the manager of the firm that such was the case. I shall never support increased duties if they are to be the means of creating monopolies. </para>

                            <para>- I say that sworn evidence to that effect is on the records of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales. The manager of the company said that the Austral Nail people could not sell a pound of nails without the consent of the Broken Hill Company. If arguments are advanced to show that it is necessary to give this protection to help Australian industries, I am prepared to support it, but I will not support an Australian monopoly. If the Broken Hill Company and Hoskins are prepared to consider the interests of every firm in the iron manufacturing  industry  throughout Australia, and supply to each the raw material it. requires in open competition,. I shall be prepared to protect the producers of the raw material. There are, however, industries started in the neighbourhood of the works of the Broken Hill Company who, having their own railways and rolling stock, can run the raw. material out of their yards into the yards of these companies, whilst other firms manufacturing iron in other parts of Australia have the cost of the raw material they use loaded with a high cost for freight. </para>

                            <para>- I say that a subsidiary industry established in Newcastle can buy raw material from the Broken Hill Company at a lower rate than the company is prepared to quote for a big firm that will take 54,000 tons in three years. That appears to me to indicate that the Broken Hill Company is a monopoly. </para>

                        <para>.- Honorable members have just listened to a speech in which the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> claimed to be a Protectionist, and then said that he was not going to support these industries unless certain things are done as he desires. Although the honorable member claims to be desirous of making Australia self-contained, his speech would appear to have one object only, and that is to destroy all prospect of the successful carrying on of steel and iron works. If the statements which the honorable member has made were correct, the Committee would not be justified in voting for increased protection for these industries. It is because I believe they are not correct that I have risen to speak. I have the assurance now from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> the gentleman named by the honorable member, and the manager of the particular works to which he referred, that there is not one atom of truth in the statement that has been attributed to him. </para>

                            <para>- If I believed the honorable member&#39;s statement to be correct, I could not conscientiously vote for any increase of this duty. The Newcastle works of the Broken Hill Company have been established now for a few years. I say that they were of immense value to this country during the war. I do not know what we should have done in Australia had it not been for this particular company. When the honorable member for Parkes talks of objecting to a monopoly, let me remind him that he is no more opposed to monopolies than I am. But I am not coming here to play the hypocrite, and I say that even if the Broken Hill Company were a monopoly we should not permit monopolies established outside of Australia and carrying on their business with cheap labour to send their goods here to the detriment of the people for whom we have to find employment. The question is whether the recent war has taught the people of Australia and members of this Parliament that this country must be self-contained. If it has taught us that lesson, then we must discuss this Tariff with a view to establishing Australian industries. The speech of the honorable member for Parkes leads me to the conclusion that he does not understand the position. The Minister for Trade and Customs has stated on more than one occasion that if this Tariff is passed it is his intention to create a Board, and if he finds through the investigations of that Board that any monopoly has been created for the purpose of exploiting the people, he will bring the matter before this Parliament and have the monopoly dealt with through the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- As the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has said, the Constitution gives us full power to deal with Customs ; and if those whom we protect do not act fairly by the people, we shall be able, by the exercise of our Customs power, to put them in their proper place. That being so, we have only to consider whether or not the duty is adequate. The honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> has stated that it is wholly inadequate. It might have been sufficient for the purpose when this Tariff schedule was submitted twelve months ago, but since then there have been many changes in Australian conditions. Amongst other thing3, owing to the increased cost of living, wages have been increased. Then, again, freights have gone up, and the price of coal has increased. All these matters have to be taken into account by us in determining whether or not the duty is adequate. We know also that throughout Europe the workers, in many instances, have been obliged recently to take reduced wages, in order that the industries in which they are engaged may carry on. During the war the workers in other countries received much higher wages than they had previously enjoyed, and we were in a better position, therefore, to compete with imports from oversea. Circumstances, however, have changed, and labour abroad being now much cheaper thau it was two or three years ago, we could not fairly expect a duty imposed twelve months ago to be effective to-day. We have, therefore, either to increase the duty in this case or to allow cheap-labour imports to come in, to the detriment of our own people. The outlook is not too good, and it is essential to establish our industries on a firm basis, in order that employment may be found for our own people, as well as for those who are now being induced to nome to Australia. It is true, as the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> said this afternoon, that Australia is managing as well, perhaps, as most other countries; but what is happening in other countries must be reflected here if we permit the free introduction of goods made under conditions that we would not tolerate. Already we hear of thousands of unemployed, but if we do not protect our own industries from the cheap labour of other countries, we shall have tens of thousands out of work. </para>

                            <para>- I was pointing out to honorable members of the Country party and their constituents the effects. of the establishment of a Protective policy which would encourage our industries to such an extent as to find employment for our people, and markets for the product of those on the land. I do not think that any one will endeavour to controvert the position I seek to establish. Our future prosperity must depend on our capacity to find employment for our people; and, in view of the necessity for a greater population, we must establish such industries as that of iron and steel. It has been argued that, so far as the iron and steel industry is concerned, it represents something in the nature of a combine. </para>

At the present time, however, the iron and steel industry is not confined to any one company ; we have the Broken Hill Proprietary, and Hoskins Brothers, while we are given to understand that in Queensland, also, it is proposed to establish iron works. </para>

                            <para>- No. Honorable members may laugh at my proposal, but what it means is an increase from 20s. to 30s. in the British preference column, 30s. to 45s. in the intermediate column, and 40s. to 60s. in the general column. I venture to say that these are not such big increases. as to justify any laughter, when we consider what has happened since the Tariff was originally imposed. For instance, relying on my memory, I may ask what has been the increase in the price of coal, which is used to such a large extent in this industry? </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to the &#34; other side &#34; if the honorable member will wait. There has been a very substantial increase in the price of coal, and, in addition, the workers employed by this particular company, and, indeed, in all other industries, have received increases in wages, though those increases have never overtaken tie cost of living. However, in the iron and steel industry the increases in wages have been pretty heavy, and then we have to consider the increase in freights, harbor dues, and so forth. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I say so now. The honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> has asked, &#34; What are the increases on the other side ? &#34; I can only inform him that, with the exception of Great Britain, where, unfortunately, there is great trouble to-day, every country has seen a decrease in the price of coal, and at the present time coal is being imported from France, America, and elsewhere to other parts of Europe. In Europe, therefore, there is no dearth of coal, and that is one fact -which operates in favour of those who manufacture iron and steel -on the Continent. Then, again, I am sorry to say that in Europe wages are falling every day, the workmen being compelled to accept reductions. </para>

                            <para>- So long as only reasonable profits are made, it is good for employers and employees to have prices kept up. At the present time, wages are decreasing week after week, and this has given rise to the disastrous strike in the Old Country. In Belgium, both wages and the price of coal have fallen, and it is possible there to produce more cheaply than we can here. That state of things is likely to continue, and, if so, how can any objection to an increase in this duty be justified? We meet here as men desirous of making Australia self-contained; and if we do not achieve our object the results will be disastrous. The price paid here may be a little higher than in Belgium, but does any one say that we, with our better conditions and higher standard of living, ought to be able to manufacture here at the same cost as in Belgium? We must remember that freights are not half what they were twelve-months ago. </para>

                            <para>- It might have been started, but the war conditions helped it - the matter is doubtful. However, we have to face the position as it is. If the conditions have altered so materially abroad, and if we wish to preserve our rates of wages and present standard of living, we must impose such a Tariff as will exclude the foreign manufactured article; and I speak now as one who has gone through the mill. I have denounced the exploitation of people by means of excessive prices, but I realize that we must keep prices up to a reasonable level in order to insure to our people a proper standard of living here. We cannot compare our conditions here with those that prevail in foreign countries. </para>

                        (Dampier) &#91;8.151.- I think everybody in this Parliament, or anywhere else in Australia, is quite satisfied that an industry such as that which has been established at Newcastle by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is essential to the future welfare of the country; and if it could be shown that it needed any special protection, I am sure that Parliament would be quite unanimous in giving it whatever assistance it required. But has it been shown by any  speaker  here to-night that the industry has been languishing at any period since it was established, or that the company has not been able to produce successfully against any competition that might be brought to bear against it?

                            <para>- I always hear that cry from a certain&#39; section who would buy their own goods from the Chinese. I find that the men who make all these protestations are the crowd who generally go to the Chinaman&#39;s shop to buy their groceries. I have made it clear ever since the Tariff debate started that I am very little concerned about the duties as they affect outside countries other than Great Britain. I should have liked to include Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa in the treatment accorded to Great Britain. I have done all I possibly could to. show how desirous I am of encouraging trade with the British Empire - that is, so far as we could do so with fair consideration to ourselves. In what I have said, I have always wanted the Committee to realize the value of the natural protection which Australia enjoys in regard to the importation of goods from outside. I do not intend to press that point so far as iron and steel are concerned, but when we are dealing with agricultural machinery and bulky articles of that sort, the question of natural protection is a very big one. </para>

                    <para>It is wise for the Government to encourage an industry such as we are now considering. The only question is what nature that encouragement should partake of, and to what extent it is necessary. Nobody has shown that the Broken Hill works at Newcastle are languishing, or that they have not been carried on at very great profit. </para>

                            <para>- No. If the honorable member will permit me, I shall show shortly, by reference to other countries, and particularly to Canada, what I mean. The Broken Hill Company has built up this industry on first-class lines. It has as fine a plant as there is in the world. I have read its book, <inline font-style="italic">From Silver to Steel,</inline> and a good many of its reports. Unfortunately I have not been able to visit Newcastle to see its works there, but I believe I am correct in saying that it has one of the finest plants in the world. Assuming, however, that we had a second or third-rate plant in Australia, turning out iron or steel, would honorable members be justified in saying that, because the industry was languishing, and those running it could not make it pay, high duties should be imposed on the goods it was turning out, simply because it did not possess an up-to-date plant? That is where the trouble lies. We are asked, because up-to-date appliances are not used, and because a factory does not avail itself of all the latest inventions- </para>

                    <para>Mri GREGORY. - That is so, and the more difficult we make it for the farmer to get his machinery in, the harder it is for him to use up-to-date methods. If Parliament were to say,. &#34; You must get everything you want in Australia; you must not use the inventions: that are being made all over the world,&#34; the difficulties of the farmer would be intensified. Quite a number of industrial concerns, realizing the competition they are meeting from other countries, are seriously considering this phase of the question. Only the other night I read a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> about the Barrow Haematite Steel Company, in England, which, by installing a new blast furnace, had effected a saving in coke, wages, and. other charges which worked out at the rate of &#163;60,000 a year compared with the expenditure on the furnace that it replaced. It is absolutely essential to consider that question in this case, for the very special reason that we are dealing now with one of the great key industries of Australia. By every fraction by which we increase the cost of iron or steel, we are penalizing every other industry in the Commonwealth. If we make steel dearer in Australia, we must surely make dearer every implement that is required in the mine or on the farm. </para>

                            <para>- It applies more particularly to a key industry such as this. Therefore, until we are satisfied that it cannot be carried on successfully without a duty, we should hesitate before imposing one. Surely some argument should be brought forward to show that without this duty the industry cannot be carried on. The Broken Hill Company has, I believe, one of the most up-to-date plants in the world. Its works are situated right on the seaboard, and it ought, therefore, to be able to get its products in and out as cheaply as any other part of the world, including America, Canada, and Great Britain. </para>

If it is, we shall have to build up an. export trade, and I believe it is quite possible for the company to be able to do so. At any rate, the honorable member should realize that we cannot build up population in Australia by dragging all the people from the country into the cities. The company ought <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be getting coal as cheaply as in almost any . country in the world. Our coal miners and coal mine-owners should, be able to produce at a figure which compares favorably with coal production anywhere else. They ought to be able to compare more than favorably with the coal miner of England, and certainly ought to be able to compare with the coal miner of America.. If we are not doing so already, and I do not say that is the case, it is probably due to the use of out-of-date methods.. A paper which I have here, dealing with the coal industry, shows a remarkable difference in the production of coal in America. and in England. </para>

                            <para>- The American workman is probably a great deal more independent than the workmen of other countries, and does not &#39;allow outsiders -to determine his conditions, as, for instance, at Mount Lyell and Mount Morgan recently. The .point I am making is that we must introduce the most up-to-date methods. I understand that coal can be obtained at &#34;Newcastle to-day at &#163;1 ls. 9d. per ton. In England, according to the latest returns, coal costs &#163;2 12s. a ton. That was the price just prior to the strike. It takes 3 tons of coal to manufacture a ton of steel,&#39; and I question whether coal was obtainable in Great Britain prior to the strike for twice the price at which it can be got here. Then the Broken Hill Company has at Iron Knob, in South Australia, a practically inexhaustible supply of iron ore, assaying from 66 to 68 per cent, of iron fairly free from sulphur, and without phosphorus, whereas in Great Britain the average percentage of iron obtainable is from 30 to 36, and about the same, in Germany, and in the United States of America it is not more, than 38. Therefore, a ton of iron ore from Iron Knob will yield nearly twice as much pig iron as can be obtained from the iron ore mined in the countries from which we get our chief supplies of iron and steel. In Australia, we have cheap coal and rich iron ore. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that. What we should require of labour here is that its output should be equivalent to that of other countries. With the advantages I have named, we should be able to produce iron and steel as cheaply as, and even more cheaply, than other countries can do so. It is idle to say that, in the Old Country, wages have been cut down below what are paid here. In March of last year, according .to the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Chronicle,</inline> the rates of wages in the iron industry of England were from 20 to 25 per cent, higher than the rates paid in Australia. Wages have not increased here to the  extent that might have been anticipated, more particularly when the high prices that the Broken Hill Company was getting for its output during the war are remembered. The company did good work during the war, and gave us supplies that we could not then obtain elsewhere, besides sending steel to the Old Country, which was highly commended. But the company was started before the war, without any expectation of the big protective duties now proposed. Are these duties justified ? The big profits made during the war must have helped the company to build up reserves, and to increase plant, and thus a large industry has been created. But we have not yet got back to pre-war conditions, and prices are still exceedingly high. </para>

                    <para>I do not know, whether the statement made to-night, that the .company has been supplying one firm and not another, is correct; but with the help of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins some vile Combines have been started in this country. We know of the formation of the Zinc Producers Organization, which has compelled the Mount Lyell Company, the&#39; Broken Hill Company, and other companies, to hand over to it all their output for the next fifty years. A Copper Producers Association was also formed. In a circular which has been .sent to members by Messrs. Lysaght, it is pointed out that &#163;33 a ton has to be paid for local mined spelter, although the market price of spelter in England is only &#163;24. For  copper, too, the local manufacturer has to pay 25 per cent, more than the price at which it can be bought in the markets of the world, although copper is produced in Australia. We must break down these Combines. <inline font-style="italic">*-</inline> this city to-day, there are the makings of some very fine ones. &#39; Men are getting behind the scenes and securing control of our industries in a way that will become intolerable unless it is checked in time. </para>
                    <para>Prices have not come back to the prewar level. I have here a list of maximum prices received prior to and during the war, and also at the present time. I obtained the list from a hardware merchant to-day, and I think I can guarantee its accuracy. In regard to bar and wrought iron, I find the pre-war price was &#163;8 10s. per ton, that during the war it rose to &#163;36 per ton, and to-day it is &#163;28 per ton. In this line it will be seen we have not by any means got back to normal conditions, and, in addition, heavier freight, insurance, and exchange charges are all in favour of the local manufacturer. Fencing wire before the war was &#163;7 10s. per ton wholesale. During the war it rose to &#163;42 per ton, and to-day it is &#163;23 per ton. How on earth are our people going to develop the outback country if they have to pay such high prices for these necessary articles upon which very heavy duties are now being levied? My list contains particulars of other articles, all going to show that present prices are, on the average, 100 per cent, above pre-war rates. We should follow the Canadian practice. Canada is right alongside a great manufacturing country like the United States of America, which has a big free list. Item 613 of the United States of America Tariff, steel ingots, cogged ingots, blooms, and slabs, dieblocks or blanks, and billets, made by the Bessemer Siemens-Martin open hearth or similar processes, is on the free list. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister will study the United States of America Tariff he will find that the duties have been rising and falling as different Governments came into office ever since 1803, and I may remind him that the McKinley Cabinet, which was responsible for the heavy Protectionist duties in 1890 went out of office on the next appeal to the country. I do not know whether the present Government will meet a similar fate. I am only reminding the Minister of what happened in that case. The United States of America so built up their iron and steel industries that they can do witheut protection, and Canada, which is alongside the United States of America, and whose industries are in competition with those of the United States of America, is content with a duty of 10s. 5d. per ton on pig iron, whereas this Committee is asked to increase the duty of 20s. per ton by 50 per cent. </para>

I want also to remind honorable members that the Canadian manufacturers, besides having to meet the United States of America manufacturers in competition, have to import a great proportion of the coal required for manufacturing purposes. For instance, in 1918, they imported 45,000,000 tons of anthracite coal, duty free, and over 14,000,000 tons of bituminous coal, on which they paid a duty of 35 cents per ton, and still they are able to carry on with lighter duties than are proposed in this schedule. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer reminds us that the conditions have altered. I have been looking up earlier <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports and reading the wonderful speeches made by members of the Free Trade party headed by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and aided and abetted by the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> I cannot believe that either of those gentlemen has altered his opinion to any extent. It is possible, however, that political views have made all this difference in them. I want to show that industrial conditions have not altered in Australia to the extent that they have altered in Great Britain and America. I shall show, later on, that the wages paid in those countries in the manufacture of agricultural machinery are considerably in advance of those paid in Australia, and that the production elsewhere is ever so much greater than it is here. If the workers would only give an adequate output, the cost of wages paid to them would be no great item. </para>

                            <para>- I have figures that show that the prices of these big lines coming from Belgium are nearly 300 per cent, higher than pre-war prices. Of course, we. shall never go back to the prewar level. I do not want that. I want to see good conditions established for our workers, because it will be useless for us to attempt to carry on without a contented community; but we cannot exceed the productive capacity of the country. We cannot pay wages beyond our productive capacity. We must consider the effect these duties are likely to have on people who are engaged in primary production. If the imposition of heavy duties makes land development too expensive, production must decrease; and if we cease to produce wealth we cannot continue to pay wages. </para>

                        <para>I see nothing in the evidence to justify the assumption that some form of fiscal assistance will be permanently inevitable. On the contrary, the richness of Australian ore deposits, compared with those of other countries (the Iron Knob ore yields 68 per cent. of iron as against 36 per cent. profitably worked in Germany), and the freight charges borne by our nearest competitors, make it probable that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat&#39;s</inline> original view that the industry can stand on its own footing in Australia will prove right once output is secured, and with it low production cost. The adage, &#34;The ore goes to the fuel&#34; is complied with in the Australian works. </para>

                    <para class="block">Before reading the recommendation of that Commission, I want to point out that the people of Western Australia are endeavouring to build up their State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lysaght</inline> has demonstrated the cost of conveying galvanized iron and other materials from Newcastle to Fremantle - the freight ranges from &#163;2 10s. to &#163;3 2s. 6d. per ton - and the Inter-State Commission has shown that even if a bonus were given for the delivery of pig-iron to distant places, no such bonus would be sufficient to enable Australian manufacturers to capture the Western Australian market. I do not suppose that much pig iron is imported into Western Australia, but I feel sure that steel and other-similar lines can be imported from Great Britain under the present Tariff cheaper than they can be from Newcastle unless the price of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s product is considerably reduced. Freight alone will enable the Western Australian people to get a cheaper article from Great Britain. </para>

He has looked into evidence furnished to the InterState Commission in 1912, and has studied most carefully the recommendations they made. But those investigations and recommendations were made under a condition of things totally different from those existing to-day, and I do not think they can help us in anyway. The honorable member must realize that the cost of production has increased 100, 150, and in some cases200 per cent. </para>

                    <para>SirROBERT BEST.- Probably they have, mainly under war conditions, and I commend the proprietors for their enterprise; but we must realize what has actually taken place during the last twelve  months. Honorable members have referred indiscriminately to the increase of duties to be proposed by the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins),</inline> and much confusion exists as to. the real issues ; they have overlooked the very essence of the question. As the honorable; member told the House - and this is the kernel of the matter - the duty proposed by the Government twelve months ago was 20s. per ton British preferential for pig iron. As the result of an investigation by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> and his officers into the affairs of this great industry, the Minister was satisfied that fair and reasonable protection for the industry would . be a. duty of 20s. per ton. I ask honorable members to apply their minds to what has happened in the meantime. According to the Hibble report, the cost of coal has increased 4s. per ton; according to the Board of Trade award, wages have increased 8s. 6d. per week per employee; and, in addition, harbor dues have been imposed, making a total increased cost of14s. per ton. </para>

                            <para>- I will tell the honorable member presently. My contention is that the investigations of the Minister enabled him to satisfy himself, when he introduced the Tariff, that 20s. per ton was a reasonable duty for the encouragement of this industry. And in that view this House would have, supported him. Parliament would have been satisfied that 20s. was a fair duty to impose in order to effectively protect the industry. However, the duty which he then imposed is to-day worth only 6s.; and it is in those circumstances that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company come to Parliament and. lay their case before it. I have just been asked what has been the state of aff- airs on the other side of the world. I have shown that the increased cost of production here is equalto70 per cent. reduction in the value of. the duty. On the other side, taking Belgium for example, coal has considerably decreased in value. </para>

                            <para>- In the United States of America there has been a decrease of11s. 3d. per ton during the year. That means that the cost of production has decreased, so far as fuel is concerned, by that amount per ton. As for wages, I can furnish abundant material to prove that there have been substantial decreases in Belgium, from which source we fear much opposition; and in America also. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> made reference to the contrast between our wages and those paid in Germany last year. Wages were &#163;7 per month there as against &#163;18 here. This year, wages in Germany are at the rate of &#163;5 per month, as against &#163;22 10s. paid in Australia to-day. That clearly indicates that, while the cost of production here has greatly increased, the cost on the part of our competitors has considerably dropped. </para>

                            <para>- The price is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> odd per ton. But I am speaking of the altered conditions so far as our foreign competitors are concerned. Some honorable members talk as though we were resorting to some wild and untried experiments, or some scheme which would prove, upon experience, to be detrimental to the best interests of Australia. The American people, by greater foresight than we are exercising, realized that the only way in which to build up the iron and steel industry was to impose high duties. For many years the imposition was equal to 80s. per ton. Ultimately the duty was reduced to 75s. There were two results. The first of these was that the production of America was vastly increased, and more than supplied the home market, and the second was that with the increased production, the cost to the consumer fell considerably. I am in a position to quote highly authoritative figures which conclusively demonstrate that the outcome of the exceedingly high duties imposed was not an increase in the price of commodities to the primary producer, but the very reverse. That has been the experience of the world. America could never have established her iron and steel industries but for the imposition of high duties, because from the moment of their inauguration those activities would have been overwhelmed by importations of English products, in which country similar industries had been established for a very long while. It was due to the erection of the high Protective wall that the American industries were so flourishingly established as to attain vast proportions, while, at the same time, there was a striking decrease of prices to the consumer. And there was this complementary result&#39; that prices of competitors in the Mother Country were also brought down. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and that can be demonstrated very easily. We need not be much alarmed by this proposed increase of duty, since it can be shown that it is not paid by the consumer. We realize that the iron and steel industry is essential for Australia, and that it is the duty of Parliament to give whatever protection that industry requires. The great point emphasized by the honorable member for Dampier was that it had not been demonstrated that a duty is required at all. I shall quote illustrations to show how essential is the imposition of a duty. I draw my facts from a statement furnished by the Industries Protection League, upon whose figures I can absolutely rely. I have before me a statement showing comparative prices of British, Continental, and Australian steel products. For example, the landed price, duty paid, of pig iron in Australia is &#163;10 15s. 6d., and the cost of producing here at local works is &#163;9 2s. 6d. The landed price per ton of ingots, blooms, billets, &#38;c, from the Continent is &#163;10. With duty added, the price is &#163;13 5s. landed here. The Broken Hill Proprietary works cannot turn out the same line of product under &#163;14 10s. per ton. Then, with respect to bars, rods, angles, and tees, the landed cost here today from the Continent is &#163;17, while the actual cost of production in Australia is &#163;21 10s. The landed cost of bars, &#38;c., from Great Britain, of course including duty, is &#163;19 14s., and, as I said, the cost here is &#163;21 10s. The landed cost here of rails, 60 lbs., 45 feet in length, is &#163;17 4s., but they cannot be produced here for less than &#163;17 17s. 6d. Joists, channels, and girders from the Continent cost &#163;18 landed in Australia, duty paid, and the cost to produce here is &#163;22 10s. </para>

                            <para>- The experience in America proves conclusively that high protective duties reduce the cost to the consumer, as the industries are established and expand. We can, of course, throw open our ports, and allow goods to come from abroad free of duty ; but in doing so we will annihilate our industries and bring disaster on the community by causing unemployment and higher prices ; by so doing we place ourselves at the mercy of the foreign exporter. We have to consider whether the proposed duties are reasonable. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> said twelve months ago that 20s. per ton was a fair rate; but we have to realize that, owing to altered circumstances .which have arisen in consequence of the increased costs, that that duty now represents only 6s. I admit that this is a difficult matter to adjust; but I repeat what I have previously said, that we should appoint a Tariff Board, whose duty it would be to fully investigate the conditions under which protected industries were operating, and if it were discovered that too high a duty was being imposed, or that advantage was being taken of the Tariff, the Board could recommend Parliament to adjust the duty, and thus create fair and reasonable competition. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> does us a great injustice when he suggests that we are creating monopolies. We have no desire to do that. </para>

                            <para>- I would sooner assist in creating a monopoly within Australia than support one operating abroad. In America monopolies were created, but they were dealt with under the antitrust laws. If combines are created here as the result of a Protective Tariff, it will be open to us to deal with them. This is a key industry, and it is admitted by every honorable member that it is one that should be encouraged. We should not take any risks, and if the Committee is satisfied that the industry requires further protection w enable it to expand, and that we are justified in accepting the assurances that have been give*., we mud not ignore the claims made. I trust a,fi Minister will investigate the matter, and let the Committee know if he considers the amendment to be proposed by the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> fair and reasonable in the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>.- One does not mind figures being quoted with the idea of opposing or supporting an item in the Tariff schedule if they are within the range of reason; but when inaccurate figures are submitted, such as are those quoted by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> a word or two in reply is necessary. Tn opposing higher duties, the honorable member quoted the richness of the ore from Iron Knob as compared with that mined in other .parts of the world. According to analyses the iron contents of American ore from Lake Superior ranges from 55 per cent, upwards. </para>

The American railway companies grant special freight concessions in carrying ore to the principal -works throughout the States; but Iron Knob is a considerable distance from the port of Newcastle, and as all the carriage is by water, harbor and other dues are incurred. </para>

                            <para>- I want to say that, as late as 22nd March, the price of coal in America was reduced to 3 dollars 36 cents per ton, or 17s. 3d., as compared with 21s. per ton, the price at which it can now be obtained at Newcastle. That has to betaken into consideration, and also the fact that there has been a reduction of some 4s. to 6s. per ton in the price of coal in Belgium, and on the Continent, where coal mines are now operating. All that I am concerned about is the adjustment of the duty to bring it up to the equivalent of what it was when the Tariff was laid on the table. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> questioned whether the increased duties I propose would not cover some of the items which are not produced here. I am able to inform him that everything in the schedule on which I ask for an increased duty is being produced at the Newcastle works, and also at the Lithgow works, in sufficient quantity to supply any orders that come along. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a very important item, because, as has been stated more than once, it affects a key industry. If we agree to the amendment, the result will be that steel and iron used in the production of agricultural implements, fencing wire, and other manufactures, will be increased in price, and quite naturally those conducting the secondary industries will pass on the increase in price to their customers. This wealthy company is asking for more protection. What does it want to be protected from? I have heard no one suggest what this company requires to be protected from. </para>

                            <para>- It is an infant industry, but it will be admitted that it is a fairly lusty infant. We have always heard as the chief argument for the imposition of Protective duties that they are necessary to enable a struggling industry to get upon its feet. If the Broken Hill Company and other companies engaged in this industry are not on their feet now, when are they going to be in that position ? As I have previously said, as these industries grow, the more insatiable becomes their appetite for higher Protective duties. I should not be surprised if the amendment were passed, because our experience of the consideration of this Tariff has been that if an honorable member moves for an increase of 10, 15, 100, or 150 per cent. on the duties proposed, he stands a first-class chance of getting his amendment through. The object of the proposed increase of duty is to enable the Broken Hill and other companies to raise their prices. Who is going to pay the increase ? In the case of fencing wire and agricultural implements, it is the man on the land who will have to pay it. Whom is he going to pass the increase on to ? I  wish . that some ef the-cb&#38;mpians . of these monopokata.in this country, would teU me and. the primary producer in. general whom they are. to. pass, these. increases on to. We know &#39; that. ibis, wealthy company is asking for . protection really, from the operation of the world&#39;s parity . which tfiSy insist that the primary producer shall conform to. Immediately the price of primary products in this country rises a fraction above what it. is in: the markets of. the &#34;world, . there is criticism, of the nn&#62; fortunate- primary producer, who is told that, he -must accept, the world&#39;s parity, and, should ask for no more. These, so-called . infant industries are not to be&#39; restricted in that . -way. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to speak at any length. My experience is that it-is of little use to say anything in regard to- this- Tariff. No &#39;matter how irrefutable one&#39;s; arguments may be, if &#39; they are. in; -advocacy of lower duties they- will not receive the: slightest attention. The primary producers who are using the products of the- steel industry and other, industries, in Australia have to. sell in the. markets of &#39; the world, and. their . wages, are Free Trade wages. We-. are told. that it is unfair te expect the white. Australian workers employed, in this industry, and in. other, city factories to compete- with black-labour rates;, but the men -on -the land, who use the implements which those factories produce, have to submit to black-labour rates, not- only overseas, but within the Commonwealth. That- assertion has not been squarely faced by any honorable member; except;- strangely enough, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> The honorable gentleman admitted that it was unjust to ask the primary- producers. to sell- at export parity when&#39; they had&#39; to pay &#39;import parity for the means of production. He admitted that. if they, were forced to pay import prices for their -means&#39; of product tion they should, be entitled, te import prices, for what they- . produced. </para>

                            <para>- I&#34;  am glad to hear  that &#34;Hear, hear!&#34; but if a proposition were submitted that the prices of meat, wheat, and butter in Australia&#39; should be the import parity, how many &#34;Hear, hears!&#34;&#39; would greet it? How many votes would bc cast for such a proposition! These wealthy monopolies, these &#34; infant industries,&#34;&#39; as&#39; they are called, must be protected from world&#39;s parity, and the unfortunate straggler in the bush, who, in many cases, is working, not eight hears, but fourteen hours, a day - working under conditions which the honorable member&#39;s constituents would not stand for. twenty-four hours - must &#34; pay the piper&#34; in order that the industries in our big capital cities shall nourish. Honorable numbers opposite support these high duties because they think they, mean more factories, and more factories mean greater competition for labour. They lose sight of the fact that high i duties also mean that labour must pay higher prices for what it consumes. Let this state of affairs go on. Let the organized capitalists of Australia fight for higher duties, and the organized&#39; Labourites support them! Let this unholy alliance go on, and, sooner or latej, a day of reckoning will come. &#39; The primary producer to-day is having a hard time. Honorable members opposite talk of the hard times of the workers in our cities; but I would remind them of the low prices which the men on the land today are receiving for wool, sheep-sking, meat, butter, and all other products/except . wheat. I hope that the Committee will not only reject the amendment providing for an increased duty, but will vote for the further amendment which the. honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> intends to move for a reduction of &#39;the - existing duty. </para>

                        <para>. - It is rather perplexing to hear coming from the Corner party objections to a, union of- Capital and Labour. I.have always: been: under the. impression . that one of the great objects of . the: party, and of many other people in- the country, has been to bring about that happy state of affairs which, the . honorable member for Wimmera- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> says, this .  Tariff is going to produce. The honorable member has asked several  times, &#34;Who is going to pay the increased cost of commodities which will result from the higher duties for which, the Tariff provides? &#34; So far as most of them go, they will be paid by the people who ultimately consume the products affected, and in the case of the industry in which he is particularly interested, they will be paid mostly by the city consumers, of bread. That the honorable member should have worked himself into such a fury over the proposal to give this industry some protection, when, at the present moment, his industry is enjoying a protection that it never had before, in that it is permitted to sell its produce here far above world&#39;s parity, seems to me not to be in the best of taste. </para>

                    <para>I had, however, desired rather to direct my attention to some of the remarks made by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> In the course of his speech, the honorable member expressed the hope-a hope that I do not think he really cherishes - that our conditions would be reduced to those of the countries with which we have to compete. At a later stage he said that he. wanted the workers of Australia to be more happily placed than those of. other, lands. Many of our industries are competing with the products of very low-wage countries. Conditions in Australia are not the same as those of any other country, with the exception, perhaps, of America, and I, for one, do not write myself down with those who think that the ills of the Commonwealth can be cured by a general reduction in wages. I have yet to learn that the high-wage country is not always the best country for all the industries carried on in it, and it should be the object of our statesmen to establish the highest standard of living that is possible in all the&#39; industries conducted here. I make that statement with the knowledge that at times some of bur industries require consideration from those engaged in them, and that consideration should be given.  </para>

I am one of those who started in politics as a believer in Free Trade principles. But I do not regard it as a reproach to be told that I have departed very far from many views which I believed to be right when I was youug. It would be a matter for regret if the people of this country, particularly those charged with its government, should have a quarter of a century&#39;s experience of changing conditions without being able to adapt their conclusions to the altered circumstances in which they find themselves. The honorable member for Dampier is one of the few people I have come in contact with on whom the war has made no impression, and to whom it has taught nothing. If the war has left any great lessons, surely the first is that this country to endure must be made self-contained. </para>

                            <para>- I point out that we are not waving the flag of Great Britain, hut the flag of the British Empire of which we are as much a part as Great Britain is. If we do our work well in Australia, we are promoting, not only our own interests, but the interests of every part of the Empire. The narrow view which honorable members opposite attribute to those who preach Empire solidarity is not the view of those who see furthest as to what the course of Empire will be. </para>

                    <para>As to the iron and steel industry generally, 1 hold the view that it is hardly possible to name a price too high to pay for its establishment within the Commonwealth. I give credit to the men who control the industries associated with the steel works at Newcastle and Port Kembla for the example they set to other manufacturers in regard to the fixing of prices. It would certainly make it much easier to frame a Tariff if all the manufacturers followed the wise policy of making their price, not the highest possible inside the Tariff, but a price representing a fair return for the work put into the goods they sell. </para>

                            <para>- In the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> I try to find some sign of the wretched down-trodden primary producer. Let Australia look to that gentleman as an example of the rewards which slavery on the land may bring; at any rate, I can only say that if those who, according to the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> go on the land to &#34; slave,&#34; can all secure similar results, the secondary producers must pnvy them, and certainly no amount of protection could keep people off the land. Alongside this attempt to set city against country there is evidence that almost every year the amounts paid to landlords for the privilege of working their land are increasing. I suggest to the reformers that they examine a little more closely the money thus exacted by people who render no service to the industry, and that they have a little less to say about those who in the cities are earning all the money they are paid for services rendered to primary industry. </para>

The only question we have to decide is whether they shall be conducted in Australia, or somewhere else. The honorable member for Wimmera is not going to cultivate his land with the old wooden plough of the Eastern peoples. Ho is going to cultivate it with modern machinery, which must be made either in or out of Australia. He is going to give employment to the people in Australia, or to their competitors outside Australia. In that matter, the honorable member has no choice. If he is going to conduct his industry on modern lines, he must employ somebody in secondary industries. </para>

They will be such as the Australian people approve; but if the argument of the honorable member for Dampier is to prevail, and we are to look to the cheap labour of the Eastern countries as the standard to be set up here, then not only will the secondary industries of this country fade away, but the primary industries will be reduced to the same level as their competitors across the sea. </para>

                            <para>- But is it anything to the uproar the honorable member  makes  when some other industry gets a little advantage which he thinks is at his expense? No matter what we do in this Parliament, there will be an uproar. What we must do is what is best for Australia. We cannot hope to escape criticism for our actions. If we do things in the interests of Australia, we shall offend those who wish to exploit Australia. Our duty is to do the best we can to establish the primary industries, and, when they are established, to do the best we can to maintain such a line of secondary industries as will make Australia self-reliant and self-dependent. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall support the proposal of the honorable member for Newcastle(Mr. Watkins). We live in exceptional times, and unless we adopt precautionary methods iron supplies will be dumped in our market very frequently. In a letter that I have here it is stated that, whereas Australian steel bars cost &#163;23 5s. a ton in Melbourne, wholesale lots can be landed from Belgium - a country that has been left out of the calculations of most honorable members to-night - for &#163;17 a ton, including the present duty. </para>

The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> was silent as a tombstone when it was proposed to put duties on onions and millet; but when it comes to protecting what is one of the key industries of the country, and doing what is needed in the interests of the Australian people, a howl of indignation  comes from him and from the corner of the chamber where he sits. The relations of the countries, of Europe are not the same to-day as they were two and a half years ago. Germany was then our enemy and Belgium our ally; but to-day, from the trade point of view, both are our enemy. As an Australian and as an Australian legislator, if I have to choose between an Australian and a foreign combination I must choose the former. Some honorable members say that, we are giving a monopoly to the Broken Hill Company and to Messrs. Hoskins; but I rely absolutely on the promise of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> although I differ from him politically, that as soon as the Tariff is out of the way a Bill will be introduced to constitute a Board of Trade whose special duty it will be to see that no manufacturers who enjoy Protection shall fleece the public. </para>

                            <para>- I am. If I were not, my attitude towards some of the proposed duties would be different. Today the exchange rates operate largely in favour of Germany and Belgium against Australia, and put those countries in almost as favorable a position for competing against us as if wo had no Tariff. The object of importers is to destroy the local manufactures, and to recoup themselves later for the initial losses they may be forced to incur. They do this at the expense of the consumers of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Every Australian butter producer would be glad to receive always for his butter the price the Danish butter brings on the London market. The honorable member has spoken of a combination between the capitalist and the worker as unholy ; but the members of the Country party are in alliance with the biggest exploiters of the Commonwealth, the importers of Flinders-lane and  other  importers. I would rather be in the company of the manufacturers of Australia than in that of the importers of Flinders-lane. This is an industry that has been established in Australia, and if honorable members care to look back over the records, they will find that during war-time the Broken Hill Proprietary Company could have obtained London prices for their iron and steel products for railway and shipbuilding purposes, but made them available at several pounds per ton below London quotations. </para>

I think the honorable member will find that its recommendations will stand good for many years to come. But for the establishment of these iron and steel works in Australia our railway construction works would have been held up during war-time, and I point out to honorable members of the Country party, who are always talking about decentralization, that in the steel works at Newcastle and Lithgow we have the finest examples it i3 possible to get. </para>

If we can only develop the iron and steel, the woollen, and the cement industries, we shall be able to provide employment, not only for the men and women of Australia, but for a large number of people from other parts of the world, in the manufacture of goods for our own requirements without the export trade at all.

                            <para>- I will not say that Neither has it been made safe for autocracy, because crowned heads have been tumbling one after another. I remind the honorable member for Wimmera that in 1920 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat</inline> was very emphatic in stating that unless the iron and steel industry were protected by the Tariff from dumping, his company could not possibly carry on. He was then thinking of the condition of shipbuilding in other parts of the world. I think the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> will bear me out when I say that it was impossible to get a quotation from English shipbuilding yards for the construction of vessels at about that time. The yards would only undertake to build at a certain rate which averaged about &#163;35 per ton, whereas in Australia the cost was about &#163;30 per ton.
