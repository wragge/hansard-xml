                                <para>The reasons for the lengthy period of construction of H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> will be fully set out in this paragraph, but before dealing with this phase of the question in detail, it may be stated that the new construction work included in the reply to Question <inline font-style="italic">4</inline> is of an entirely different nature from warship building. The vessels completed were comparatively simple in design. Material was available to enable  each one to be completed within the time stated, much of it being available locally, while in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> materials and fittings are almost wholly of a highly specialized nature, which it was necessary to import through Admiralty contractors who were busily engaged on urgent war work. The plans for the vessels were considerably fewer in number, and were prepared at the Dockyard or were available from the Ship Construction Branch, it not being necessary to wait for drawings from Great Britain embodying war experience. It may be pointed out that the design, construction, and equipment of warships undergo a constant process of evolution, and when the building period is protracted by the non-receipt of essential parts, a greater number of modifications and additions as the results of service experience gained in the meantime is involved, and this in turn causes added delays in awaiting delivery of additional items of equipment, which, owing to their particular nature, are only manufactured by certain expert firms on the British Admiralty list who specialize in such matters. This refers more particularly to gunnery, torpedo and electrical equipment, and in this regard special attention is drawn to the list of additional electrical items mentioned in the reply to Questions 1 and 2. </para>

                        <para pgwide="yes">The first delays in the construction of H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> were experienced during erection of the hull, when important items of structural material were not delivered as required ; in many cases still greater delay, would have been experienced if the Dockyard had not been able to supply suitable structural materials from stock. Supply of this material from stock involved greater cost owing to the sizes of plates being greater than were required for the particular work in hand, but it was considered that this increased cost would be off set by the time gained. As an instance, plates for turbine seats, longitudinal girders, plummer block seats, auxiliary engine seats, frames in forward engine room, watertight and oiltight frames were not ordered by Chatham Yard from the rolling mills before 24th January, 1918, and were not delivered at this Dockyard before July, October, and December, 1918. The vessel was launched on 27th July, 1918, and it is quite obvious that, had not many of the above-mentioned items been met from stock, the vessel would not have been in the water until several months later. Delivery of the material in question was requested by this Yard as early as December, 1917, and a cable was accordingly despatched from Navy Office to High Commissioner. Steel material continued to be delivered during the construction of the vessel right up to January, 192 1. Many important drawings were not received from the Admiralty at the proper time, and required to be prepared at the Dockyard. </para>

                        <para class="block">H.M.A.S. &#34; Adelaide.&#34; - Time of Delivery of Forged Machinery Parts. &#34;With reference to the above-quoted letter, the first quoted letter forwarded copies of the contracts for the rotor drums. Spindles and wheels of the main turbines, from which it is noted that the dates of delivery of these parts were given as 12-14 months from some date subsequent to 20th June last, the date of the Contractors&#39; tenders, the actual date of acceptance not being given, to which must be added the time for shipping to this Dockyard. The second letter quoted above forwards sheet No. 5 - Machinery dated 21.8.1916 - schedule of supply of materials - showing dates of delivery of various materials for the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> and against these particular parts, no definite date has been given, only &#39; earliest possible date.&#39; The date of order on sheet No. 5 is given as the 16th June, but this does not agree with the copies of the tenders, which are dated 19th and 20th June, and, as stated already, the date of acceptance of order is not given. &#34; 2. It is desired to draw particular attention of the Naval Board to the very serious effect which the time required for the deliveries will have on the work of building this vessel. If the contract dates as given are not anticipated, it will mean that some of the most important ports of the main turbines cannot be commenced till about a year hence, and when the time required for the necessary work to be done at this Yard is added, estimated at about 10 months to prepare the turbines for installing, it will be seen that the installation of the main turbines on board cannot be commenced for nearly another 2 years, and the date of completion of the vessel cannot be expected to be for at least 3 years from this date. &#34; 3. It is presumed that the cause&#39; of these extremely long dates for the forging of the rotor parts is due to the heavy demands now being made by the Admiralty for war purposes, but the effect, so far as the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> is concerned, is nothing less than lamentable, as, of course, the length of time taken to build this vessel will in all probability be put down to delays at this Yard, observing that it is considered that 12-14 months for the forging of the rotor wheels, &#38;c., appear to be absolutely unreasonable. &#34; 4. In view of the above circumstances, as apparently the machinery will not be ready for installing on board for nearly 2 years from now, it is not proposed to commence the erection of the hull on the ship for the present, in order to avoid the apparent length of time that the vessel will be under construction, but the work of preparation will continue as the materials arrive. &#34; 5. It is requested that the Engineer Overseer in London may be requested to make a special report on the progress of the forgings of these rotor parts with a view, if possible, of the contract dates being anticipated, and also that he may report as early as possible the probable dates of their delivery in order that the building of the hull may be arranged to suit.&#34; (Sgd.)

In consequence, the turbines were not completed and ready for installation in the Ship until the 7th August, 1920, in the case of the port turbine, and the 16th September, 1920, in the case of the starboard turbine. This Dockyard persistently urged that the delivery of these forgings should be expedited, and pointed out the considerable delay which would be caused in. completion of the vessel, but without avail. It is evident from correspondence between the Naval Representative in London and the Navy Office that the delay in delivery was principally due to the following reasons :  - </para>

                1. - These fans were reported as in course of shipment in April, 1920, and in each of the subsequent monthly reports until December they were also shown as being in course of shipment. In December, 1920, a letter was received from the Navy Office enclosing a copy of a letter from the Naval Representative admitting that the fans were not yet ready, and they were eventually received in January, 1921. The non-receipt of these large fans caused considerable delay and inconvenience, as the fan rooms could not be closed up till they were shipped.

                3. - No advice was available regarding these articles until the June, 1920, report of the Naval Representative, when it was stated that Admiralty were arranging supply. In the October report they were shown as due for completion on 20th November, 1920. The goods were subsequently shipped per s.s.

                in February, 1921, and received during the present month, and now that delivery has been made, it is found that, whereas it was stated in the monthly returns that Admiralty were arranging for supply of switches for torpedo runways, the only articles supplied are the trolleys and purchases. This will necessitate the switches being cast and the runway being made and erected. At the present stage, when all other work in the submerged torpedo room is partially completed, this will be a very awkward operation. No detail plans of the switches and runway have been received at this Yard, and these will not have to be prepared to fit the trolleys and purchases received.

                4. - Copy of the demand for these plates was received at Dockyard in June, 1919, and in August, 1919, a portion of the requirements only was sent out. Attention was called in March, 1920, to the fact that part only had been delivered, and there was then no reason to believe that the plates would not soon come to hand. Attention was again drawn to the delay in delivery in October, 1920, following which a cablegram was sent to the Naval Representative hastening delivery. Reply was received that Admiralty had forwarded all the necessary material, having substituted3/16in. plates for&#188;-in. In reply to this communication, a letter was sent laying out the whole position, showing which plates were still outstanding, and this information was sent to London by cablegram. No reply was received to this cable until receipt of Naval Representative&#39;s letter stating that a portion of the material had been overlooked by Chatham Yard officers, and would not be forwarded. THE MATERIAL WAS EVENTUALLY RECEIVED IN JANUARY, 1921. It will thus be seen that, although attention was drawn to the fact that this material was not to hand, it was not forwarded until January of the present year, and only after two cablegrams had been despatched to London on the subject. The non-delivery of this material has held up the completion of the bridge and chart house, and the numerous electrical and other fittings attached thereto.

                5. - It was originally intended that the coolers should be manufactured in Great Britain, and sent out complete, but owing to difficulty in obtaining them, it was decided to send out tubes only, and the coolers have had to be manufactured at this Yard. Tubes were received in

                6. - It was originally intended to obtain this gear of Australian manufacture, but inquiries failed to produce any suitable tender, and Navy Office was notified in July, 1918, that it was proposed to order through High Commissioner, and a draft cable was forwarded to Navy Office, which was sent on to the High Commissioner on 20th August, 1918. In the Naval Representative&#39;s monthly statement for April, 1920, the plant was shown as being due for completion in September, 1920. This date was continually shown until the October, 1920, report, when it was shown as not yet complete. In the December report, it was shown as estimated for completion in one week, and it was finally shipped per

                        <para>- Is the Postmaster-General taking into consideration the desirability of extending the hours of certain telephone offices. I understand that now, unless the revenue of an office is over &#163;250 per annum, the telephone there is not attended to after 6 p.m. An extension of hours is badly needed ? </para>

                        <para>- I draw attention to the coat of arms on the parliamentary stationery. My complaint against it is not new, because I objected to the design before it was adopted. The emu and kangaroo seem to be up the wattle tree, an offence against the artistic sense of every honorable member, and an absolutely unnatural position. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to have a sensible, natural, Australian coat of arms put on our letter paper. </para>

                            <para>- That is not under the control of the Department. The Anzac tweed was for a considerable time controlled by the Department, but subsequently a trust was formed, and it is now entirely controlled by the soldiers, who were subsidized by the Government. I arn glad to say that the soldiers have paid off the whole of the money advanced to them, and the Department has no control over that or any other tweed. </para>

                        <para>:- In the course of my remarks on Friday, I intimated that I intended to move an amendment to have this matter submitted to investigation by a Committee of both Houses. After further consideration I have decided not to adopt that course. One reason is that I understand that the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will make a statement in regard to the wool position at an early hour today. This matter is one of great importance ,and requires deep consideration at the hands of honorable members before we enter into an arrangement with Bawra or anybody else in regard to the disposal of the future production of wool. It is well to refresh our minds regarding the history, of the industry during the last , few years. Throughout the war the British Government bought the whole of the Australian wool clip at a flat rate of ls. 34d. per lb. Of the wool so acquired and paid for at that rate, there remains an accumulation of, approximately, 2,500,000 bales. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the honorable member&#39;s figures. For those 1,700,000 bales of Australian wool the growers have been paid ls. 3&#189;d. per lb., and by the agreement made with the British Government they are to get, in addition, half of any profits made on the re-sale of the wool. It appears to me. that,. during the war, the British Government have been guilty of profiteering. I am sorry to have to say that. Ever since the outbreak of war, people all over the world have complained of the dearness of woollen goods; and whilst it is said that 7 lbs. of wool should be in a good suit of clothes, I understand that not more than <inline font-style="italic">B$</inline> lbs. is put into any suit to-day. Thus the purchaser is getting less wool in his suit than he should get, and at the same time he is paying double the pre-war price for the article. We must be careful to insure that, in any scheme now adopted, we do not place a further burden upon the people. Prior to the war, the average price of wool was 10&#189;d. per lb., and if the growers have already received ls. 3&#189;d. per lb. for all the wool they grew during the war period, .they have received .a very good return. But because the British Government charged a higher price than the flat rate of ls. 3&#163;d., there is now a big accumulation of unsold wool. The market is. overstocked, and, in view of the British Government&#39;s desire to dispose of the carry-over wool, it is difficult to see how Australia will be able to market t &#34;u year&#39;s clip. If the new clip remains unsold, Australian interests will be detrimentally affected. The more l think over this question, and the more I read of the views of men who have a knowledge of the subject, the more am 1 convinced that, as the British Government and the Australian growers have already had a good return for the wool, it would be better, in order to stabilize the market, to keep the Bawra wool in store. The British Government would be doing only a fair thing if it agreed with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> on his arrival in England, to keep the Bawra wool oil the market. We .are assured that it will not deteriorate very much; even if it does deteriorate a little, it has already yielded a fair profit. If this suggestion is adopted, the market will be left clear for the future production, there will be a chance of getting back to normal conditions, and people may be .able to get their clothing cheaper. Commercial men tell us that they cannot reduce the price of suitings because they bought stocks in England at high prices two years or twelve months ago which are being delivered now. Those high prices were caused by the action of the British Government in charging so much for raw wool during the war period. If the Commonwealth Government agree to give Bawra an official status- and if they use the Customs Department for the purpose of controlling exports they will be doing that - Bawra will be able to regulate the whole supply of wool for some years to come, whilst Parliament, which gives them the power, will have no say ,at all. Throughout the war, people were complaining of the growth of bureaucratic control. New trading Departments* were formed, and Boards were given control of various commodities which they administered behind the back of Parliament. The representatives of the people were treated .as mere ciphers. The Boards fixed the prices to suit themselves. We have been urged to restore normal conditions, and to resume control of the&#39; reins of government; but if we agree to a proposal such as has been outlined to us, shall we not be giving Bawra a power which it can exercise in defiance of the jurisdiction of this Parliament? Undoubtedly we shall; and, therefore, we must be careful of what we do in this matter. I desire that all the facts should be placed before the House. Certain information has been handed to me by the wool-buyers This is a copy of a letter sent by the secretary cf the Wool Buyers&#39; Association to the Acting Prime Minister - </para>

                    <para class="block">I should be perfectly right. He has a habit of interrupting those who can throw more light on the particular subject under discussion than he is- able to do. When interrupted, I was referring to the position of returned soldiers who have taken up land during the last few years, and have devoted their attention solely to sheep-farming. If wool brings a low price, as it will, no doubt, they will be the chief sufferers, and those who have mortgages on their holdings will have to submit to foreclosure in a year or two unless the State comes to their aid. I would remind the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster),</inline> who thinks I know nothing of this subject, that already 15&#189;d. per lb. has been received by the growers of the Bawra wool, and that, in addition, they will get one-half the proceeds derived from the sale of the 1,700,000 bales of the carry-over. If we allow one bale of Bawra wool to be put on the market for every two bales of the new clip, or two bales to three bales, and 9d. per lb. is secured for it, the growers interested in that wool will get, not merely 9d. per lb. in respect of their present clip, but 4&#189;d. per lb. in addition, as their half share of the proceeds of the Bawra wool so sold. The small farmer, however, who has only recently come into the industry will receive only 9d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, and in addition to that those interested in the Bawra wool will ultimately get half the proceeds of the sale of the carry-over. My contention is that the man who has already been paid handsomely for that wool might reasonably be Expected to stand out of .his money for some time in order to give a chance to the poor man who has no interest in the Bawra wool. </para>

                            <para>- If there is nothing wrong with the market, why are we wasting the time of the country in discussing this question ? The Prime Minister told &#39; us last week that the bottom had practically fallen out of the market, but now we are told by honorable members interested in wool that everything is all right. If that is so, let things go on as they are. If the honorable member&#39;s contention is correct, then we are defaming the credit of the country and protesting when there is no occasion to do so. It is strange that everything appears to be all right with the wool market as soon as one begins to put the other side of the Bawra arrangement. </para>

This Parliament should shoulder its own responsibilities; it should not  transfer them to some other body. If the Government propose to take over this matter, I am against it. </para>

                            <para>- I should not have the right to speak again. During the war I supported several measures in regard to which I subsequently regretted my action, and I do not propose to vote for anything else that I may think wrong. The Government should not continue the spoon-feeding of outside combinations. We are getting suggestions from everywhere. On Monday the . Gisborne Farmers&#39; Union - a New Zealand Union - carried a resolution suggesting that the Imperial authorities should purchase this year&#39;s wool clip at 50 per cent, below the commandeered prices, and that this bts pooled with the balance of the commandeered wool in hand, and disposed of at the mean average price of the two clips. It is urged that if this were done it would probably save a loss on 740,000 bales of commandeered wool, that it would stabilize the market, and that it would safeguard &#163;8,000,000 surplus profits. The proposal might well be considered. </para>

But. I; can hardly congratulate him on his consistency; What he has just said is strange doctrine to come from the representative&#39; of the: coal-mining industry, every particular of whose trade is regulated by Statute. Prices and wages are fixed; and everything from. A. to Z and top to bottom is subject to regulation. </para>

At any rate, I assure the honorable member, tot begin with, that: this Government will be no party to buildings up a trust in wool or anything else. If I thought for a moment that that was the object that is now being sought by honorable members interested in the wool industry, they would get no support from thisGovernment, and certainly none from me. The honorable member has setup two or three contradictory positions. To begin with, he commiserated the men who have to pay a heavy price for suits of clothes: It is quite true that clothes are very dear: </para>

                        <para>- That, however, is not due to the cost of the wool that goes into the clothes. Even Bawra itself; undiluted, uninterrupted, and uninterfered with, only suggests a reserve which will practically mean saying to the- buyer of clothes, &#39; &#39; You must pay at least 5s for the wool that goes into them.&#34; That is all; and my honorable friends opposite; therefore; see that the interest of the - wearer&#39; of clothes in this connexion is  a  very slight one, as compared with the interests of the industry itself, and as  a  whole. No more unfortunate illustration could have been selected than this idea that anything we do to. regulate and control the. price of wool very seriously affects the price of garments as we wear them to-day. For that we must look to other causes. I do not wish to say any more  about the honorable member for. Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> or. his speech, except that this question has a very slight local application. I understand that about 2&#189; per cent., certainly not more, of the wool that is produced here is consumed in Australia, as the honorable member- will see if he gets the figures for himself from <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs.</inline> During the war time we consumed about 15,000,000 lbs. of wool in Australia - even when we had our heavy commitments to supply the troops with warm clothing - and that was out of the total production of 600,000,000 lbs. </para>

Nobody more than I will welcome the time when we . shall be able to make this wool into clothing and consume it ourselves, as far as possible; but it is idle to talk about the paramount interest of the dwellers in the cities - consumers of wool in Australia - when, as a matter of fact, they take only 2 per cent, of our total production. Clearly, therefore, we have to look overseas in connexion with this industry. </para>

                    <para>I should like to call attention to one other point concerning thi6 industry. This is the greatest of all our industries, employing, as it does, 80,000 people directly in the growing of wool, and, I suppose, at least two or three times that number in collateral industries. As to this free wool spoken of so much by the honorable member for Hunter, his remarks apply to only 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, of the wool-growers of Australia, the balance of 96 per&#39; cent, being all in this union, if I may so call it. What is suggested, I understand, is that the Government shall assist this union by giving &#34; preference to unionists &#34; to the extent of a reserve which . has been definitely suggested. </para>

                            <para>- Both these views cannot be right - some reconciliation is, I think, needed. However, I shall say no more on that point, but pass on to consider what I regard as a very serious situation. It is a situation which. I should have very much liked to escape had it been possible, and I confess I am approaching a task which is somewhat uncongenial. I should not mind so much if I could see my way clearly through ; but no man can dogmatize- on a question of - this kind. After balancing everything, we have to make up our minds as to the course we think will ultimately &#34; prove to the advantage of this country - I wish to say clearly that the Government have no further interest than that- not merely to the advantage of the wool industry,  but to the advantage of the country as a whole. It is from that point of view I shall approach the consideration of the matter. I have listened very carefully to the debate as it has proceeded so far, &#34;and one or two things seem to me to have emerged. The honorable member&#39;s speech is a further confirmation of the fact that everybody is agreed that the present condition respecting wool is abnormal, and very serious, indeed. Some effort is necessary to combat the special difficulties surrounding the conditions in the wool trade, though opinions may differ as to methods. So far we are on common ground. The speech of my honorable friend discussed the question, and suggested various methods to cope with the difficulties, which, as I say, everybody recognises. One thing is pretty evident by this time, and that is that the Government itself must take some&#34; attitude towards this very important question. What that attitude is I shall indicate in a little while. I do not think it amiss to remind ourselves of the elements of the question ; as I see them they are these&#39;: Whereas in the last three years the average realizations of wool have been &#163;48,000,000 per annum, this year they will be considerably less than &#163;20,000,000. During those three years the British Government came to our assistance. It was the British Government, let us never forget, that kept our prices up and enabled us in this way to shape our attitude to the war, with far less serious consequences than would have been the case had we not been possessed of the means of finance. The British Government purchased from us 7,127,000 bales of, wool. </para>

                            <para>- My own impression is that every other country got a higher price than the British Government charged; but that fact, apparently, is lost sight of in  some  quarters. The British Government did not profiteer in wool; on the contrary, it was generous to Australia in the purchase of it, and that we ought to remember. Why is it that we are not getting more than &#163;20,000,000 now for our wool? The answer is, first of all, that England is no longer the large purchaser of our wool she was during the war. Other countries could not purchase; there was only one purchaser, and now that one has failed us for the time being, and the wool is left on our hands. The fact is that to-day Europe is paralyzed, and that is why our stocks- of wool are so heavy. In the season before the outbreak of the war, France, Belgium and Holland bought from the Commonwealth 669,000 bales, of wool; Germany, 425,275 bales; the United Kingdom, 318,661 bales; the United States, 90,265 bales; Japan, 23,800 bales; and Italy, 13,200 bales. To-day that demand is absent - the demand on the Continent&#39; is negligible. It is not that the Continent does not require wool more badly than ever. Honorable members will have read in their newspapers the other day, as I did, that to-day the Germans are still wear-  ing paper underclothing, as I saw them doing during the war; indeed, oftener than not, in the later stages of the war, the German soldier had nothing beneath, his tunic but his bare skin. Europe is  hungry  to-day for wool, but cannot buy it from us, and so we have our wool here, though it is badly wanted abroad. The result of all this is that natural law is operating, and there has been a tremendous land-slide in the values of wool. The wool boom that we had during the war, though it was only a mild one, has slumped to the extent of 60 per cent, in the case of our better wools, and as much as 80 per cent, in the case of some of our crossbred wools. In other words, and this is the national aspect I desire to stress, Australia is confronted  to-day  with the possibility of receiving, on account of wool, an income of &#163;3 per head of population, as against &#163;9 and over per head during the last three years. I am pointing out how this is most profoundly affecting our finances, as well as the stability of many of our undertakings. The carry-over . wool has been fairly stated at S50,000 bales of Australian wool, 850,000 bales of British wool, 800,000 bales of New Zealand wool, and 200,000 bales of South A&#39;frican and other wool, making a total of 2,700,000 bales.&#39; By June next there will be 750,000 bales of new wool to be added to the former total; some people say that there will be an additional 1,000,000 bales. </para>

                            <para>- Including South African and New Zealand wool, we shall have, by June next, 4,500,000 bales of carry-over wool, with the new season well under way. Altogether, we have to anticipate a mountain of wool comprising between 6,000,000 and 7,000,000 bales. The average price of greasy wool for the three pre-war seasons was 9id. to 9f d. per lb. After all, the jump from 9fd. pre-war to 15$d. during s the war was no bigger than was the rise in every other article that enters into the cost of living. During the control period, the Australian growers received  15&#189;d.  per lb., plus 50 per cent, of the profit on resales; that was the profiteering with which the British Government has been charged. If there has been profiteering, we were parties to it, inasmuch as we received half of the profits.&#34; I have not yet heard a suggestion that we pay. any of those extortionate profits back to the poor people of Britain, from whom we wrung them. </para>

Whilst the price of wool has increased, so has the cost of production, and, after the fullest investigation I could make, I satisfied myself that 9d. per lb. is, if anything, below the actual cost of production. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that; but I do say that the- industry is&#39; entitled to all the consideration we can give it at the present time. Like many other industries,, it is passing, from an abnormal set of circumstances, and we shall have to do the best we can , until normal times return, and the world is once more on an even keel. With the wool market throwing itself about as it is, up one day and down the next, although. mostly down lately; what are we. to do.? Clearly the guiding desire in such a condition&#39; of affairs should be to stabilize the industry so that people may know what they have to face, what they must lose if need Be} and what they can gain on a fair and reasonable footing. Same people&#39; say-; &#34; Stabilize the&#39; market by throwing the wool into the- sea.&#34; Others have suggested that the wool should be burnt. These are wicked suggestions, and- not entitled to one moment&#39;s consideration&#39;. Others again say that we. should take all the carry-over wool off the market. There may be something in that proposal, and I shall consider it in a moment, but, at any rate; there is something to,besaid for the efforts to stabilize the conditions; of&#39; the market. At present everybody is buying from hand to mouth. Nobody will- stock up. The manufacturer will not, because he does not know-how the price will be in a month&#39;s time, consequently he buys just enough to eke out his industry. But I am told that, in pre-war times, the world carried 2,000,000 bales of stock wool. Therefore, if we can stabilize the market, and allow people to look forward for. a reasonable period, they will stock up again, and by so doing will&#39; make a big hole in this mountain of wool that has accumulated . through, the, lack -of . stabilization. ; At the same . time, ; one has to. remember this fundamental fact, , that : a  cheap and inferior thing -will, if allowed  to do:so, always interfere to the &#39;detriment . of . a . dear, but superior, article. I cautd quote from <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> own experience many instances -.of. that. j&#39; have known railway commissioners to purchase coalmines of . admittedly ; inferior quality for the purpose ..of trying . to . keep . down . the  price , of the abetter coal, -which , they were compelled to&#39;.buy . because it was . cornered. There are . many . instances of the kind. Wherever, there, is a cheap, inferior article floating . about the market, it will always pull down below a reasonable level the price of the superior and dearer article. </para>

                    <para>During this debate it has been suggested that we should sell this carry-over wool on long credits to the Central Powers. The proposal is all very well, but is full of danger. If we give credit to these Powers, we have not to find any capital, but we must take care that during the . currency , of those long-dated credits we are not giving. to Germany .  and </para>
                    <para>Austria, our erstwhile enemies, an immense advantage over countries which, during the war, were our staunch allies. We must take the greatest care to see that by the adoption of such a proposal, the markets, not only of our Allies, but also of the Imperial Government, are not swamped. But as there are so many interests to be served in Great Britain, I think we would be extraordinarily lucky if we could induce the British Government to go out of this business. They have so many interests at stake and so many obligations to their own manufacturers which we, in turn, have made ours that it seems to me we ought to regard Bawra as a compromise and work it as such as far as possible. </para>
                    <para>There is another proposal - to keep Bawra off the market for two years. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> am not an expert, but my information is that wool will not last indefinitely, and that as a good deal of the Bawra wool was shorn three or four years ago the keeping of it off the market for a couple of years more in a climate like that of Great Britain would lead to very serious deterioration. </para>

                            <para>- Then there is the question of the minimum reserve price suggested by Bawra to the Government. In that regard we .must have some respect for the cost of production. If the average cost of production is 9d., it does not seem to be an undue reserve to suggest in connexion with an industry which is passing through such &#39; critical days. Of course, it must be borne in mind that the average takes in our drought years, as well as our good years. We can only deal with these matters by the law of averages. The proposal is to sell in England one bale of our- current clip to two bales of the carry-over, which is about the proportion of our merino wool to our crossbred wool, though I do not know whether there is any relation between the two facts. </para>

So long as they subscribe to the minimum reserve they are free to sell in any part, of the world at a price above that reserve. In fixing on a minimum there is no regulation of price in the strict sense of the term. The small grower will be able to get as much as he can for his wool in any part of the world and in any market. The more he can get the more power to his elbow. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rodgers,</inline> reminds me that the small men will be perfectly free so far as our internal market is concerned. As a matter of fact, they deal with no other market. They sell to the man who takes their wool as near to their door as they can get their money. </para>

                    <para>The case is altogether abnormal and special, and as we have seen so often during the war and all over the world in every country as well as in Australia, these abnormal conditions have to be met by means which are not in themselves normal. &#39; Special cases require special treatment. The question of whether we are justified in any interference in this matter is arguable. One cannot lose sight of the fact that the world is still upside down. Markets are smashed up, exchanges are smashed up, people cannot buy; they cannot turn themselves around&#39; economically and industrially; no marker is normal ; the condition of the world industrially and economically is very far from normal; all our processes for the disposal of our primary products are deranged and out of joint; great gaps have been made in the former lists of eager &#39; buyers in the markets of the world. This-  condition of affairs has prevailed in many other industries. It is evident in England to-day, where the latest proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George to the miners of Great Britain is that he shall make a direct contribution from the British Treasury to ! Miners&#39; Pool. Even in that country, to which we are supposed to look for examples of all that is sane and wise in matters of government - and we .do not look for it in vain - things are so abnormal that many of the industries, including the great coal-mining industry, are subject to control. We have our Wheat Pool, our Butter Pool, and our Gold Pool. Our gold is not permitted to be sold except through a Gold Producers&#39; Association, which sells it at a premium of about &#163;1 103. per oz. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see the relevancy of the honorable member&#39;s interjection. When we have an abnormal ?et of circumstances, we must make the best of them, and do the best we can to cope with them. We have felt tremendous effects from the war. Perhaps owing to our isolation, we have suffered more than have other countries. Indeed, we are feeling the effects to-day, and the Government have already been obliged to step in for the purpose of endeavouring to assist our great primary industries to tide over. abnormal conditions. That is all I am suggesting now. There is nothing novel in the proposal that has -been made regarding our greatest industrial and financial concern. </para>

                    <para>The Government have had a great deal of conflicting advice. Even in connexion with the wool trade, there are conflicting views and conflicting interests. There are the buyers and the sellers within the wool world as well as outside it; and I have been very much amused at some of the letters which have lately appeared in the press signed by &#34;Tom,&#34; &#34;Bill,&#34; &#34; Harry,&#34; or &#39; &#39; W.&#34; One writer says that stabilization will only be reached by regulation. Another says that the way not to stabilize the market is to adopt this system of regulation. Another says that we can only attain stabilization ultimately by having a free market. Another says - and this is the proposal of Bawra - &#34; Try to stabilize the market without sacrificing our wool.&#34; If that can be done, it is what every one wants. It is easy enough to stabilize the market by destroying the Bawra wool. The Bawra  proposal,  as I understand it, is a compromise of the Imperial Government&#39;s interest in this wool and our own. Bawra says, &#34; Try to stabilize the market, and at the same time to save the  carry-over  wool.&#34; Can we do that? I am not here to say that it can be done ; but while these conflicting interests put their arguments from day to day we must always keep in mind the fact that bur selling interest is paramount to our buying interest. We are the sellers .of wool ; other people are the buyers of ft. We use here only 2 per cent, of our wool; the rest has to find a market overseas. Our interests, therefore, are exclusive regarding 98 per cent, of our total wool output. That is the point which we must ( always keep in mind. It has been said that some interests have not been consulted. It ia a pity if that is so. I have made inquiries, and am informed that the reason why the buying interests here have not been directly, consulted by Bawra is that Bawra has been, and is today, in close communication with the actual buyers in London who are represented by agents in Australia. I cannot help feeling, however, that it would have been well had Bawra consulted the agents here. The Government has tried to consult some of these buyers, and has obtained from them one or two useful suggestions. Even when we have consulted the whole of them, and have tried to balance the very conflicting interests, I shall have some doubts as to the success of the Bawra proposal. A man would be foolish in these days to dogmatize on the wool position. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; bub one does not need to be a wool expert to  know that when you embark upon a proposal which cuts into first principles you are incurring grave risks. These first principles have a habit of asserting themselves despite all our efforts to divert, control, and shape them definitely to certain courses. We have to make the best of the position as we find it ; but my view is that in the end we may. find ourselves up against a free market as the only way out of our difficulties. That will mean irreparable loss to Australia. It is, however, a choice of alternatives as to what is best to be done in a position that is full of difficulties. There are the relations of other parts of the world to be considered. We may control our own wool within the Empire, but we have still to deal with the production of 900,000,000 lbs. in the rest of the world. Europe, Asia, India, and America . represent a production  of 900, 000,000. lbs. I . think that, roughly speaking, the Empire, including South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, and the Old Country produces about as : much wool as the rest of the world. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the honorable member is right. The buyers, amongst .:others, ,  say . that if . we. -fix , a reserve of 10d.,..9.d,,:8d.., 7d.,:or whatever it may be, we may drive our customers to other -parts of the world. . 1 cannot help feeling that this - warning is just a little ; interesting, but -I think  we - may very well letBawra handle its own business. . That association &#39; is not &#39; likely to -commit commercial suicide. &#39;Themen controlling it are far too-.astute . and keen- and experienced to allow of &#39;that being done. Nevertheless , the -whole matter &#34;will require the closest watching &#39; the most experienced minds can bring to bear upon at. </para>

                    <para>Thesuggestion, has been made, in more quarters than one, that the period . of limitation proposed by Bawra is too long. Bawrasuggests six months, other people say two months; but I fear that two months would really aggravate exposition . The first effect . of a &#62; two months&#39; limitation would ; be . that buyers &#39;would&#39; stand off until . the expiration of that period. I . am, therefore, . afraid that we must put aside that suggestion . for the present. The Government . has . come to the conclusion, perhaps reluctantly and  not without some misgivings, that we should agree to the proposal made by the most competent and representative &#39; body in Australia, so far as this, interest is concerned . The. suggestion is- that we should agree to the -reserve price proposed,- leaving sellers otherwise perfectly free to- sell  anywhere . above the imposed . minimum. </para>

                        <para>. - I approach this- question with some trepidation, nott that I-  am  alarmed at; the requests, and. they &#34;are numerous, which  have  been made by- various associations to support the Government proposals; but because of. its magnitude-, and because, as the Acting Prime- Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook-, has said, the Government, in taking this action, will be interfering, with</inline> i  one. of the. first: principles of . political economy. Although . the Government have decided to take this step, every honorable member must, realize that he may bo charged with- the. responsibility for. it. If the proposal- fails,, not only- the Govern* ment, .but. every member of. Parliament who supported it, will be blamed. For. that reason I, as an old parliamentarian., feel it to be my duty to point out to the Government that, it proposes- to interfere with the operation, of the law of supply and- demand in the markets of. the  world.  It is. difficult- for a. Government , to  fix  prices - within, its: own. territory, as&#39; we proved during the war.. Under the War Precautions- Act, the Common wealth Government-- tried, to fix the prices- of meat, with: the result, that no- prime&#39; beef was. sent to. the market, because the- growers- could, get uo more for. their prime? cattle, thaw for their stores.- While&#39; those who were able and willing to pay- for&#39;  at  better quality meat could  not get it,  those in- the poorer localities &#39;had to pay more.- for their meat than had hitherto  been: charged.  Then  an attempt was. made to keep the . price- of galvanized&#39; iron  at a reasonable level,  and a regulation was passed prohibiting a seller from charging- more, than a. certain profit- I think. 15 per cent.- What happened was that galvanized &#39;iron  was passed  from one purchaser to another before- it found its way- to the user; and in the city of Rockhampton as much. as.  &#163;80  pelton was paid, for second-hand galvanized iron. There was only a limited supply and. a&#39; very big demand, and. thus the law of supply- and demand, operated, to keep the price, up. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It is- possible for huge trusts and combines, to regulate prices,, and they do so; but I doubt, whether the Government, though it might do  . a; little in war time, can do anything in peace time in this- direction. Where there is  competition like that of the Commonwealth Bank with the private banks, rates may be kept down; but, generally, Government interference in attempts at regulating prices fails. The Commonwealth Parliament is now asked to take action to prevent the wool-growers from selling their wool for  less  than an average of 8d. per lb. In other words, we are asked to compel them to join the One Big Union. This is a project for unionism made compulsory by Commonwealth law, and, if adopted, will be a precedent for compelling the farmers and dairymen of the Commonwealth to join a union, and for compelling the wholesale merchants of all kinds to join another union. </para>

The course now proposed to be taken will be a precedent for compelling the retail houses - the grocers, drapers, confectioners, and others - to join a union for the regulation of prices, as well as a precedent for compelling the miners, waterside workers, transport operatives, shearers, mechanics and labourers of the Commonwealth to join One Big Union. These men have their labour&#34; to sell, and do not wish to sell it below a certain price. Are we justified in saying to them, &#34; You must join one big union, because if you do not you will compete with one another, and the bottom will fall out of the labour market.&#34; </para>

                    <para>It is proposed to limit the - compulsory unionism of the wool-growers to a period of six months - the Prime Minister suggested two months; but it seems to me that if the arrangement is to be successful it must last for five or six years.

As a political economist, I question the wisdom of what is proposed, and as a member of Parliament, responsible for the operation of the laws he votes for, I am not prepared to  take the blame of the failure that may result.

As I understand the position, the Commonwealth sold our wool on the understanding that the growers should get not less than1s. 3&#189;d. per lb for it, together with half of any profits over and above that. The deal was so successful that the British Government paid for all the wool at1s. 3&#189;d., and there remains to be sold 2,700,000 bales. Fifty per cent. of the profit of the sale of this wool will, after expenses have been deducted, go to the Australian, New Zealand, and South African growers of it.

This may suggest a way out. What is to prevent the directorate of Bawra, . five of whom are in England and six in Australia, from negotiating with the British Government with a view to its accepting from the wool-growers&#39; section of the association - the Australian, New Zealand, and South African growers of the wool - priority certificates or warrants, to be redeemed when the wool is sold? The wool-growers could then determine what should be done with the wool. </para>

It would appear that the approximate number of sheep in the world is in the neighbourhood of 550,000,000 to which total Australia contributes nearly 16 per cent. I notice that no mention in this record is made of the number of sheep possessed by Japan, and I have not had time to look up the figures. I understand, from the Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> that Japan has no sheep industry; but I read in the newspapers that Japan is buying Australian rams, with&#39; the object; of; crossing- them with sheep in Mongolia, a country nearly as as big as Australia with a population, of.&#34; about. 2,000,000.. We may, I should. say, expect, within- very few- years, that- Japan will be an important competitor in the matter of sheep, and possibly wool, which will be turned into textiles in Japanese factories-. </para>

To ascertain whether our production- of wool- will have the effect.. that the. directors ofBawra expect, we must consider the imports of wool into. the. United Kingdom,., I find from a table taken- from the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth&#39; Year- Book,,</inline> page 337, that the imports of wool into the United Kingdom in 1918 - and I presume the amount has been, practically the same during the last two: on three years - were as follows : - </para>

The question-: that arises in my mind is that if the Commonwealth Government tell the Australian growers that they shall not sell and export their wool at less than 8d. per lb., willtheGovernment not be fixing a price at a shade over which the foreign grower can sell ? The foreign grower will know our price is fixed at 8d., and he will; say to himself that, all he; has to do is to sell just under it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. For our purposes this table shows &#39; the destination of our wool, and the wool of Cape Colony and River Plate. I ask honorable members what would be the effect of our having 7,000,000 bales of wool on hand, with the price fixed at 8d. per lb., below which Australian growers may not sell. I doubt -the wisdom of the action of the Government in this regard, if that action be taken. We shall have to bear all the odium if - there be a failure; and later on I propose to ask honorable members to consider the position of those at present engaged in the industry. It appears to me that if the Government are to take control of the wool in the interests of the industry, it would be better to leave the fixing of the price from time to time to the directors of Bawra and the wool-growers associated with them. Suppose that the directors decide that, on account of the market, 8d. per lb. is <inline font-style="italic">top</inline> much, and Parliament is not sitting. Of course, if Parliament were sitting, an alteration in the price could be made in an- hour. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with those who say that it would be wise to hoard these millions of bales of wool. In the true and permanent interests of the pastoral industry and the general public, that wool should be put into use, although not at a sacrifice price. The&#39; gentlemen who form the directorate of Bawra comprise the very best brains in the pastoral industry and we understand that the graziers and others interested in the production of wool are all agreed that the course proposed is the proper one. If they are united in that opinion, I suggest to them that, rather than come to the Government for the assistance of the law - meaning, of course, the military, police, and Customs officers - they should go in for voluntary co-operation, which appears to be a great deal more successful than Government compulsory co-operation. </para>

                    <para>The best plan I have heard suggested is that the British Government should sell the 2,700,000 bales of Bawra wool to Germany and Austria. I heard one honorable member say that that policy would mean that our late enemies would turn the wool into textiles, which would compete unfairly with the products of British manufacture. No doubt they would, but the suggestion is- coupled with a proposal that the Government should accept from Germany and Austria, for the wool, gold bonds redeemable in five years and carrying interest at 6$ percent., and that the wool should be only for consumption within those two countries, and should not be exported. </para>
                    <para>We know that the Allies have not been able yet to arrange for the payment of the indemnity by Germany, and that there is a great deal -of unrest in the world, but that matter may be settled at any time. There can be no doubt that the .people of Germany and Austria require wool. During the war they were compelled to use paper instead of wool and cotton for underclothing. Much of this accumulated wool, being crossbred, and of . poorer quality, could be used by the German- -and Austrian people for the manufacture of the clothes they require, as well as carpets, rugs, and other textiles of that character. As evidence of what Australia is losing by not trading with Germany, I submit the following table, which has been furnished to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Knibbs, acting for the Commonwealth Statistician :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">It would appear that for the five years before the war. Germany was buying Australian wool to the value of &#163;8,000,000 per annum - forty million pounds sterling in five years - and I have no doubt that as soon as the trading conditions become settled that volume of business will be restored. There must be in our own interest, a time limit to international hatreds; the pastoralists and. other primary producers will suffer so long as there is a refusal to trade freely with the continent of Europe, Germany and Austria included. I sincerely hope that the payment of the indemnity will be made as soon as possible, in order that the world may get back into its stride and that the people who are unemployed in all the big cities throughout the world may be provided with work. I read the other day - and this bears upon the capacity of the wool-buyers of the world to pay an average price of 9d. - that there were, 3,000,000 unemployed in the United States of America; 2,000,000 in Germany; and in February last 1,300,000 in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- We are passing through the crisis that inevitably follows every war in every country. There was the boom period during the war, when all the mills factories, and workshops were producing at their maximum, material which was just as rapidly being destroyed on the battlefields. Then, when the armistice was signed, there was a boom, and competing buyers of wool forced up the prices. That boom soon ceased, and today nearly all the wholesale houses are stocked with goods which they bought at high prices during the war or during the boom following the armistice, and there is naturally a poorer demand for commodities, and unemployment. One difficulty connected with the wool position is that wool  is  not like copper and other metals. When the price of copper slumped the mines closed down; but the wool is growing all the time, and the grower has to get rid of his. product. If the House indorses the Government scheme to fix a flat rate of 8d. per lb., below which wool must not be exported, what will happen to wool-growers who own the sheep at the present time and will own the 1921-22 clip? There are 4,000,000 bales of Bawra and free wool to be sold. What will be the outlook of the wool -growers? They will not be allowed to sell under 8d. per lb. flat rate for export. If the whole of the wool growers were in a huge co-operative body and all were to share in the benefits or diminished profits, the position would be bad enough, but they are not all included in the Bawra scheme. What is to happen to those men who cannot sell their wool under a certain price ? Will they shear their sheep ? And if the wool is shorn, where are we to store it? An honorable member said the other day that some pastoralists were burning their wool because it did not pay them to take it away. </para>

                            <para>- This scheme does not affect the &#34; bosses &#34; only. The whole industry is concerned. Little men and big men are all on the same footing. The scheme will save instead of swamping the small grazier. When the wool appraisement scheme was first brought in some members of the Labour party imagined that it would kill the little- man. As a matter: of fact; it was a god-send to him. It made it possible for him to get the full value for his wool. He could not do this previously, when the practice was to sell star lots. However, that is by the way. The Graziers, Association are in favour of the Bawra scheme, and they do not want any.Governmentinterference. The only assistance they ask is that, persons should be stored from &#34; scabbing,&#34; on the scheme. They know what they are doing. </para>

Every, calling throughout Australia would be affected-, the carriers; who get their living by carting the wool,&#39; the railway workers who take the wool &#39;to the market, the shipping people, and the wharf labourers - all would: be affected. No one could . tell where the end would &#34;be. In plain words, it would mean disaster to Australia. No one would suffer more than would the small grazier for whom the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is concerned. If the big growers were allowed to put their wool on the market without restriction, the small man would be swamped; there would be nothing left for him.

                            <para>- The price of woollens was going up all the time, but the wool-growers did not : reap the benefit. The additional profits went to the manufacturers and the Flinders-lane merchants. We have been told that it takes only 7 lbs. of greasy wool to provide the material for an average suit of clothes. If at the time of which I. speak that wool had brought 2s. a. lb., a. suit of clothes would. thus have. represented only 14s. worth. But the price obtained by the woolgrower was less than 5s . for the lot. It is easy to ascertain where the profiteering came in. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Not only would all the industries I have mentioned suffer if the bottom fell out of the wool market, but the finances of the Commonwealth and States would be most seriously affected. Pastoralists inQueenslandand New South Wales would not be able to pay their rents ;it would be impossible to collect taxation payable by them, and we should be in a state of financial chaos.I am greatly pleased that an enterprising body of men has come forward to try to lift us clear of this financial mess. I have sufficient faith in Australia to believe that, ; dark though the financial clouds may be, they are not without a silver lining, and that, with the help of Bawra, the pastoral industry and our finances generally will right themselves. </para>

The wool-brokers would naturally object to it. Honorable members on this side of the House, including myself, have often referred to the price of wheat and the high cost of bread. The buyer always wants to make his purchases at the cheapest possible rate, and the seller wants to sell in the highestmarket. </para>

                            <para>- A lot of our wool is converted into the very best material in France. I asked a member of the French. Commission which visited this country not very long ago, how our merino wool compared with that of other countries, and was told that it was amongst the finest the world produced. He referred particularly to that grown in:the western portion of Victoria. He had never been in Australia, but was familiar with the principal wool-growing centres of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I am satisfied that the House will do well to support the Bawra scheme. The position has been put in a nutshell by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> The honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham)</inline> was the first to propound in this House the proposal that the Imperial Government&#39;s interest in our stock of carry-over wool should be bought out, and that we should gradually dispose of that wool. He made that suggestion by way of interjection, and later on the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> stole his thunder, and put H forward as his own scheme._ I thought at first that it would be well if the pastoralists of Australia could be financed by the British Government, by the &#39;Commonwealth Bank, or by any of the Associated Banks, so that they might buy &#34;P that wool. </para>

T feel for them; and I may also say that I do not want to &#34;go broke&#34; any more than I&#39; want to see any other man &#34;go broke.&#34; Prosperity is good for all of us. When the country was prosperous we raised our own &#34; screws &#34; as members of Parliament because we thought we deserved it; but there is no means by which those dependent upon wool-growing can raise their &#34; screws &#34; if the bottom falls out of the market. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I am not too sure about the position of the cattle-raising industry. The tallow market is falling, and meat is going down in price. &#39; Some eighteen months ago a man in Charleville, in my presence, offered 35s. per head for ewes in lamb and nearly fully fleeced. The person to whom that  offer was made would not take it. </para>

No one else has any interest in it. -Surely those who own the wool -should &#39;have the right to say what shall be done with it. .Some take a pessimistic view of its. effect on  i  the new clip. I do not- feel that it will interfere with the &#39;present sales. If we sell .two bales of the new -wool for one of Bawra we shall get a fair deal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, with - one exception. These telegrams mean-that. all engaged in the industry, both growers and sellers, are agreed ; and, though .we have had no word from the buyers lin Queensland, I am satisfied that the Bawra scheme is regarded .as all right. During&#39; the dinner adjournment one or two &#39;honorable members expressed to me the opinion - that, while the scheme may suit the &#34; big men,&#34; they desire to know where the &#34; little men &#34; come in. .My reply .to that is that a scheme is of more advantage to the &#34; little men &#34; than to the &#34; big men.&#34; .Experience has shown me that the big wool-growers are able to take care of themselves; but the small man struggling on the land must have some one to look after&#39; his. interests. Honorable members who represent metropolitan constituencies have no idea of &#39;the troubles, trials, and mistakes of the men who go on the land. :It is no &#39;easy &#39;matter for a man to  successfully occupy a homestead area in Queensland, ;with -no one. to help &#39;him. but &#39;his own family. I. have -seen .many families -struggling &#39;.on grazing areas in .Queensland, and I -know what. they have. to. suffer. .Many -of them have made good, but thousands have &#34;.gone .to &#39;the wall.&#34;  Others have  taken the places of the unsuccessful, and they are the men who are there to-day. &#39;Of all industries, the stock-raising industry is -one that requires capital, whether &#39;the stock raised &#39;be sheep, cattle, or horses. The much-abused &#39;squatters in Western Queensland -in &#39;the old days -.are to be thanked :for the-.position now occupied&#39; by the men on the land .there -to-day. The squatters of that day gave many of their employees a start under the Resumption Act of 1884. </para>

The brains of the pastoral industry are in this scheme, . and :  when I receive telegrams  expressing  their&#39; unanimous approval of it; I know that such approval would not be given to anything which was against the interests of those concerned. As I have said&#39;, the squatter is a man who can take care of himself ; no one knows better than he when to put up the umbrella &#34; and&#39; &#34; get out of the rain.&#34; When these people tell me that the scheme is a good: one for the industry, I venture to believe them; and I have the greatest faith! in&#39; Australia, and in the power of the pastoralist industry to pull the country together: </para>

                        <para>.- When- the Prime Minister: <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> made a statement in: connexion with the wool industry on Thursday last, he took occasion to deal with the question of economy; and his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has to-day given us excellent reason why it is essential &#34; we- should make some effort to economize. We have been: told that whereas, for the last four years, some &#163;9 per head of our population has been coming; to us from, the-wool industry, the. amount: at the present time. is. only&#163;3 or. &#163;4. In the. statement., he made the Prime Minister assumed that because the: Government had succeeded, in. passing&#39; certain Estimates, they were justified, in spending the money, . and. that the House should take the responsibility for. the: expenditure. That is- a point which&#39;. I. do not wish to. deal with at length on the present&#34; occasion, but. will: take advantage of&#34; another opportunity; later on to do so. The Prime Minister&#39;.&#39;attemptedtothrow the&#39; responsibility&#34; on -the House; and : reminded&#39; us of certain statutory commitments amounting&#39; to millions on&#34; the one&#39; hand; and told us that other millions were spent because of the clamorous application of&#39; honorable members&#39;. I might instance the &#163;68,000,000 spent on the repatriation of our soldiers, upon War Service Homes, and so on . This House was quite willing to give the Government. ample. means to properly repatriate our soldiers, but it did not give authority to spend money on land,&#34; which&#39;, for the most part, is . under nine inches, of water. We do not wish to diminish. the Naval Estimates, or those for naval shipbuilding;, but. we did&#39; not give: the- Government! <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> to. permit such a fiasco as we have witnessed at Cockatoo Island. </para>

                            <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> suggests that it <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> merely a bogey scare. I should like to deal for a few moments with .the argument  used  against the views expressed by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> and by other graziers outside this House. I do not wish to dogmatize in any way. I recognise that any proposition put forward is purely tentative and experimental. The view thar I desire to put is that the proposal by Bawra, though offering grave objections, is the one which holds the field against any other yet publicly made. The position is made doubly difficult of discussion and solution by reason of the conflicting interests that are involved. But one may be helped to arrive at a correct conclusion by looking at the way in which . the various conflicting interests are pulling. When we find that the wool buyers, who admit that they represent the manufacturers in Australia, Great Britain, America, and on the continent of Europe, strongly advocate a certain course which is in opposition to the unanimously expressed wish of practically all the graziers and wool brokers throughout Australia, one is justified in treating their advice with a certain amount of suspicion, and, looking for some reason which is not apparent on the surface, why it should npt be carried out. In their letter, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to-day, they &#34; let the cat out of the bag &#39; &#39; when they say - </para>

                        <para>Australia should not attempt to. force European manufacturers to purchase here, as, in the unsettled state of affairs, sufficient wool for present requirements can be secured elsewhere.

                    <para>In the second place, I wish to correct the impression sought to be created both outside and inside the House, that the wool-growers and the whole pastoral industry are in a state of prosperity and free of hardships. That is not so. There have been pastoralists in favorably situated districts who have had the good fortune to do well, but throughout the whole of northern New South Wales the present position of every pastoralist is very precarious indeed. I know of one man who had 110,000 sheep, and who has had to spend during the last eighteen months &#163;70,000 in actual drought costs; his sheep are reduced to 30,000, he is up to the limit of his overdraft, and cannot get further assistance from the bank to even pay wages. He has withdrawn his three boys from King&#39;s School, Sydney, and has discharged all the other men on his place, while he seeks, with the help of his three boys, to handle the station. The sole reason for this is that the. bank has said that, whilst it will not call up his overdraft, it will not advance him any more with which to carry on. There are many other men who, if they are able to pay for the shearing of their sheep, will not be able to pay the freight to send the wool to Sydney, to enable it to be offered at auction or forwarded to England. It is proper that the true position of the pastoral industry should be rightly estimated by the public of Australia. Throughout northern New South Wales there is a universal inquiry as to the possibility of introducing a moratorium in that district in order to enable the wool-growers to tide over the present trying times. </para>

                            <para>- They have been in this industry for the last thirty  years  I know of one man who was worth &#163;50,000 at the beginning of the war, but who went out of the pastoral industry a year ago, and to-day is working for wages at the Newcastle steel works. In those circumstances I repel the statement that the pastoral industry is not in need of assistance at the present time. It is in the interests of the men who are creatin the wealth of Australia, and enabling the Government to raise taxation, as well as in the interests of other associated industries - the selling agencies established in Australia as the result of many years of work and co-ordination - rather than to assist the interests that are represented by the Wool Buyers Association, that I am prepared to support a scheme that receives the unanimous support of all the growers and the brokers, except one, and all the banks, except two, which by a strange chance happen to be institutions the bulk of whose capital is found in London. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot speak as to that.&#39; I desire to examine the various remedies that have been suggested to meet the present critical situation, for, I think, even the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> will admit that the situation is critical. Four alternatives have been suggested. The first is that the whole of the Bawra wool should be thrown on the market with the present clip and that there should be a free auction. What -would be the inevitable effect of that course? We have seen that when portions of the Bawra clip have been thrown on the market during the last year the prices at the first sale sagged from 10 to 20 per cent., and at the next open sale a further 20 per cent. The effect of putting the whole of the Bawra wool up for auction would be that the market would fade away, there would be general bankruptcy in the pastoral industry, and there would be no assets with which the pastoralist could finance himself, whilst outside speculators would be enabled to acquire the wool at a very low price and hold it in such a way as to  unstablize  the market for some years. That is a fair statement of what would happen if the whole of the wool were thrown on the market. The second alternative suggested is to persuade the Imperial Government, as half owner, to hold the Bawra wool off the market. That idea has a considerable number of supporters. Of course, the difficulties in the way of that scheme are that half the wool does belong to the Imperial Government, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins has said, it was only with considerable difficulty that the British Treasury officials were induced to permit the Bawra wool being placed on the market in the proportion of one bale to&#34; two bales of the fresh clip. Quite apart from that it seems to me that holding at the back of the market this huge accumulation of wool, which with the carry-over this year will amount to practically two years&#39; clip, will create a spectre which will keep the market continually unstabilized.  Even if it did not have any effect on the market at all I am one of those who hold that the principle which has been suggested of dumping the wool into the sea or burning it would be an international crime, when the bulk of the people of Central Europe are threadbare. I express considerable surprise at the attitude of Labour members of the House who, apparently, think only of a few interests in Australia and neglect altogether the interests of the British consumer and the wearers of the goods at the other end of the world, who have a right to such treatment as would insure them clothes at a reasonable figure. The third alternative suggested, and it seems to be the most popular in Australia, because, apparently, its authorship is claimed by two members on opposite sides of the House, is that we should buy the British Government&#39;s share and still hold the&#39; wool off the market. The principle of holding back the wool is vicious. The idea of a Government cornering a commodity of this nature, and keeping it entirely out of consumption for the purpose of keeping- up prices is altogether wrong. </para>

                            <para>- No. It will allow the wool to go into circulation, provided that there is a fair price assured. The Government cornering of a necessity in the way suggested must inevitably lead to a mental conception of Australia iu other countries which it does not deserve after the efforts made by our people during the war. But apart from this aspect, the main difficulty in the w.ay of purchasing the wool from the British Government is that it would involve from &#163;4,000,000 to &#163;8,000,000, according to the value which the Imperial authorities place on the wool. And who would find that money? We cannot ask the public to find it. We cannot expect the Australian Government to further tie up development, as it is being tied up at the present time simply because State Government after State Government is unable to borrow money to carry on national works. The purchase price would have to come out of the realization of the present clip. But my objection to the proposal is greater than that. At the present time, the Imperial Government is a partner in this Bawra wool. If we buy out the British Government, it will lose .all interest in the wool; but it being able to give extended credits to European countries, and being on the spot always to advise us as how to get the wool away, is the best factor in helping us to get the wool sold. We would be acting against our own interests if we bought out the British interest. There is a further reason why it would be unwise to hold the Bawra wool off the market, and that is the great risk of deterioration of a considerable portion of it. From 7 to 10 per cent. of the total is scoured wool, which is liable to moth. The burry wool., also, is liable to deterioration. But my biggest objection is this: That when a shrewd organization like the Wool buyers&#39; Association is so very keen to have the wool held off the market, I cannot be convinced that it is in order that the price may be kept up: The wool-buyers say that as they are paid by commission it would be against their interests to bring about a reduction in the price of wool; but can any one imagine that if they are able to get wool at a low rate they will not get something better than commission from their employers? What would be the other effect of holding Bawra wool off the market. It comprises about half of crossbred and half of merino. There is- no doubt that there will always be a fairly decent market for merino wool. The difficulty will be in disposing of the crossbred wool. The very fact of keeping the Bawra crossbred wool off the market will simply make it easier for South America, with its surplus of 300,000,000 lbs. of crossbred, to sell at better prices. South America will unload her wool while we keep the market up for her. If South Africa comes into the Bawra scheme, there is no reason why Bawra should not control the whole market, and an Empire Association will be able to make other countries which grow crossbred wools to come to terms. So fax as merinoes are concerned, the Argentine produces only a small proportion compared with Australia, while South Africa, which grows a considerable amount, will be in the Bawra scheme; therefore, in that regard there should be no trouble. Other countries in Europe and America which grow merinoes are not likely to compete with us in the London market, because they will find use for their own wools in their own manufacturing centres. The following figures will bear out the contention of the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> as to the destination of merino wool: - In 1913,. Australia sold to the United Kingdom 102,500,000 lbs.; to France, Holland, and Belgium, 214,000,000 lbs.; to Germany and Austria, 164,000,000 lbs.; to Italy and Switzerland, 6,500,000 lbs.; to Russia, Norway, and Sweden, 3,000,000 lbs.; to the United States of America, 16,000,000 lbs.; and to Japan and China, 6,500,000 lbs. We have not been able to utilize these Continental markets as we might have been able to do had wool been cheaper, and if credits could have been arranged much more readily. With a return to something like pre-war conditions, there is no reason why the matter of holding the carry-over wool up for two years should be considered, quite apart from the moral aspect of the question, to which I have already alluded. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Then we come to the fourth suggestion. From the beginning I have regarded the whole principle involved in the request of the Bawra Directorate to use the Customs Act as very shaky; but this fourth proposal is the least objectionable of them all, and offers the greatest hope of success. Whether it will be successful remains to be proved, but nevertheless, in the circumstances, it is well worth trying. If the Government propose to take action to give Bawra power in regard to the restriction of reserve prices, I think they have a right to the complete inspection, supervision, and control of Bawra&#39;s books, in order to make certain that there is no inside speculation in this private corporation to the detriment of the wool-growers of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The capital value of the Bawra scheme is &#163;22,000,000, and there is to be a dividend of &#163;5,000,000 before the 31st July next, while as further realizations take place there will undoubtedly be other dividends. I understand the position in regard to Bawra is that the actual price paid .by the British Government was ls. 3&#163;d. per lb., and that the British Government have handed the 1,700,000 bales of Australian carry-over wool and &#163;13,000,000 still available out of profits to the BritishAustralian Wool Realization Association for equal division between the wool-growers and the British Government, with the request that the scheme should market this carry-over on condition that half the profits from the sales should go to the Imperial Government.  </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the Bawra scheme seems to have -definite advantages over other suggestions. I am not- wedded to it, but it is the best alternative offered. We are up against desperate passes, which need desperate expedients, and this scheme will stabilize . the market in some degree, thus enabling sales to take place of wool which may deteriorate, and which, if not sold, will become a permanent loss to the pastoralists of Australia. As I have already pointed out, a proportion of it must be totally lost if it is not sold and used at once. The scheme will permit of a dividend being distributed to many persons who have no wool in the present clip. Two or three years ago many pastoralists in the north-western district of New South Wales, who have suffered heavily from droughts, had decent clips. They have big drought burdens to pay off at the present time, but have practically no wool in the present clips. A dividend from Bawra would enable a better distribution of money to be made throughout the Commonwealth than would be possible if only the present clip were taken. The scheme under present conditions will tend to keep the wool trade within ordinary channels, and will enable the Australian brokers to maintain their connexions. In addition, a definite minimum value will be put upon the clip, and to some degree this will enable it to be financed, because wool will have some value in the eyes of bankers and financiers. </para>

                        <para>It is fully realized that in asking growers, to protect their own interests by sitting tight and holding their wool for a reasonable reserve some owners may require financial assistance to carry on the working of their properties, and in order to assist all growers the directors of Bawra have undertaken under resolution &#34; E &#34; to redeem &#163;5,000,000 of priority wool certificates on or before 31st July, 1021.. What further assistance may be required or may be available remains to be seen, but I can only assure you that Bawra will strain every nerve to support the wool-growers by every means at their disposal. Definite promises cannot be made, but everything possible wilt be done. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> to the holdings of wool in the Pool. If the Bawra scheme be adopted, four or five years will probably be occupied in working off the accumulation of wool, but. one result of its adoption will be that, manufacturers will know immediately exactly where they stand, and will be induced to get busy in making up their stocks. It is said that the greater portion of a year&#39;s clip is generally held in manufacturers&#39; stocks throughout the world. At the present time there is a considerable excess unmanufactured. With a return to the ordinary conditions of trade; a great proportion of what is now held in an unmanufactured state will be made into woollens. The stabilizing of the market in this way will lead manufacturers to recognise that no advantage is to be gained by holding off; they will be induced to enter upon the making up of their stock in the same way as before. The Central European countries are undoubtedly bare of wool, and under the scheme we shall be able to get rid of some of our surplus. The carrying out of a scheme of this character will do something, although it may not be very much,, towards inducing Germany to settle down to business in regard to the payment of its indemnity. At present, Germany is marking time in the hope of securing the best possible terms. The Germans do not intend to set to work too vigorously, feeling that the production they show may be used against them in the determination of what indemnity they should pay. I am afraid that the higher we fix the indemnity the worse the position, will ultimately be, since we can only hope to take payment in labour or goods. We do not seem to be too anxious to use their goods ; but if this scheme be adopted Germany will be able easily to get to work and start to use up our surplus. </para>

                    <para>In the last place, I think that this scheme should be supported, for the reason that I gave in support of the proposition which was put before us on behalf of the coal miners ; in, other words, the wool-growers know their business best. Graziers&#39; associations in every State have telegraphed to us that they are practically &#39; unanimous in their approval of the proposition. Not only the associations, but the great bulk of individual graziers, also, are unanimously in favour of it. That being so, I know of no reason why any outside person should say that the scheme - should not be given a trial. The people who own the wool ask that the scheme be tried, and for that reason I do not know why the .Victoria Wool &#39; Buyers Association, or any outside body having no property in this wool, should be allowed to dictate what should be done with it. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter which we may discuss at some other time. There are two suggestions that I desire to put before thos&#169; who will control this wool. The first, which  emanates from the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Robert Cook)</inline> is that if we cannot obtain  cash for this wool an effort should be made to exchange it, or a portion of it, for machinery for the manufacture of woollens, as well as for hydro-electric and other machinery. Having regard to present condition, I think that suggestion worthy of consideration. If we were able in that way to secure power-production plants, and machinery for the manufacture of woollens, we should be able to solve a good portion of the difficulty by manufacturing a great deal more than the 21 per cent, of our wool which we, at present, turn into woollen goods. Another point which is emphasized by the various grazing associations throughout the Commonwealth is that, although it has been found necessary to try to secure the approval of this House to the view that owners of wool should not sell at a lower price than the majority of their neighbours desire, still as&#39; little political influence as possible should be associated with the handling of our wool. They are not anxious, therefore, that a limitation of only two months should be - made in order that the Prime Minister may deal with the whole matter in England; they desire to be free to do &#39; their own job without political interference. </para>

                            <para>- They approve of the use of such machinery; but they do not want the actual business of buying and selling to be subject to the interference of outsiders. Our desire is, not that the Customs Act shall be strained to enable the scheme to be carried out, but that having regard to the present circumstances, separate legislation shall be passed for the purpose. We do not desire that for the purposes of this scheme an interpretation shall be given to the Customs Act which has not hitherto been applied to it. Finally, I would impress upon honorable members the fact that practically every association of pastoralists throughout Australia&#39; has asked that this scheme shall be given a trial. Failing that, they consider the position hopeless. With the approval of this scheme they think there will be some hope for them ; and surely those who own the wool, and who, to a large extent, have been responsible for the building up of the prosperity of Australia, are entitled to a fair deal, and may expect Parliament to accede to their wishes. </para>

I had not the advantage, unfortunately, of hearing the statement made to-day by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> but I have endeavoured to glean from him and other honorable members what the effect of it was. 1 presume that we are still discussing the primary motion moved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> &#34; That the paper be printed.&#34; </para>

Although the wool problem, because of the Acting Prime Minister&#39;s subsequent statement, has naturally been singled out for special treatment, we ought not to lose sight of the other two problems to which the head of the Government directed his attention. The first of these was that of finance. </para>

                    <para>The Prime Minister, as I read his speech, first of all deprecated wild statements that had been made In the country and in the press about the expenditure of the Government: He implied - in fact, he almost expressed the idea - that to criticise the outgoings of the Commonwealth was unpatriotic and dangerous at this juncture, and likely to imperil the credit of the country. Unfortunately, however, after the right honorable gentleman had administered that rebuke to indiscriminate critics in the country and the press, he himself uttered statements which, I think, coming from his responsible lips, are more calculated to shake the financial fabric of this country than anything, which has been said by outside critics. I lament the fact that the right honorable gentleman, in the obvious hurry in which he made his explanation to the House, was not better advised, because I can conceive of nothing calculated to damage the Wool credit and the money credit of this country abroad more than the statements made by him. Already, as- 1 shall have occasion to remark later, private finance in this country is causing those responsible for its guardianship the gravest possible concern. I shall go no further than that, but with sliding values for almost all assets upon which bank advances have been made, it is obvious that bankers must deal with the situation with the greatest delicacy and tenderness. The situation ought not to be aggravated by any words of ours, or of responsible leaders of the Government, making the task of private financiers, which is closely connected with public finance, more difficult. I watched with interest the right honorable gentleman&#39;s efforts to convince the people of this country that the Government was doing its duty in relation to finance. He, first, of all. earmarked quite, a number of items on the disbursement side of the balance sheet of the Commonwealth as being unalterable. They were statutory obligations he said, and therefore, nobody could lay unholy hands upon them. I do not know whether any other honorable member was satisfied with that statement, either as an analysis of the situation or as an assurance -of economy and wisdom in the future, but I candidly confess that I was not. The way in which responsibility was transferred by the utterances of the Prime Minister from the shoulders of the Government to those of members of the Committee of Supply, and of this House, struck, I think, a blow at the base of responsible government. It is true, as the honorable member who has just spoken said, that each of us has his individual share of responsibility as a holder of the purse strings ; but for the Governor-General&#39;s message originating all items of expenditure here, whether out of revenue or loan, the Government is primarily, and, up to a certain stage, is wholly responsible. I do not desire, at any time, to shed my responsibility as a private member, and the Ministry can never shed their responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- Study holy writ. I am not going to bandy words with the honorable member. We have sat together in Parliament for twenty-three or twenty-four years, and during that period have had our quarrels, but have remained friends, and if the honorable member will permit me, I shall pursue my ordinary course, and discuss &#39; public questions regardless of personalities. The expenditure of the Commonwealth this year is, in round figures, &#163;98,000,000. No amount of juggling can get rid of the fact that this country desires that every item that can be eliminated&#39; from the expenditure list shall be cut out. The responsibility for that work rests upon Ministers. The right honorable gentleman who presides over the Treasury suggested, in the letter which the Prime Minister read, the appointment of accounting officers who, under a new system, will exercise some check in the Departments. I do not believe that that arrangement would be evil or costly, but I do not believe it would be effective. The appointment of a committee of management of the Public Service, as recommended by the Economy Commission, for which the Government became responsible last session, would, I believe, .be more effective. But even that is not likely to be as effective as this House and the country would desire. The more you study the history of the alternating periods of prosperity and depression in each of the various colonies or States of Australia, the more you become convinced that there is only one power that can cut down expenditure, and that is the Ministerial power. The officials cannot do it; responsible Ministers are the only persons who can do it. In 1894. Victoria re-organized her expenditure of her public services. The honorable member for Kooyong was a member of the Government to which, under the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, was intrusted the task of squaring the account. The public officials did not do the work; it was done by Ministers themselves. After two years of incessant toil, the Treasurer and Premier of the State was able to announce that the ledger was balanced. It is going to be the same in Australia with whatever Government may be in power, when the coming crisis really arrives; and I beg the right honorable gentleman who presides over the Treasury with a much longer experience of public life and Ministerial office than I can hope for, to remember that he cannot shed responsibility, or give to any one else the&#34; power to do work that Ministers alone can do. </para>

If so, it must meet those commitments to the full amount. But- with regard to the vast bulk of our estimated expenditure - &#163;9S,,000,000 - the House- expects - at any rate, I, as an individual member, do - that the Ministry will save as much as they can without impairing the usefulness of the votes. It is idle to say that honorable members can lay their hands on only 3 J per cent, of that sum. Every detail ought to be scanned with the view of cutting out every penny of unnecessary expense, and to spe, as the Prime Minister said, that we get 20s. worth for every sovereign expended. \ </para>

For instance, Parliament voted so much for Defence, and so much for the Post Office. It says now that what was voted for Defence is not too much, and that what was voted for the Post Office is not enough. The Government&#39; must have respect to those obligations or go out of office. </para>

                            <para>- I am not making that assertion, though there are obvious reasons for suggesting that, in some cases the Government has failed to get 20s. worth for. a &#163;1 of expenditure. I allude to recent statements made before Royal Commissions. The Treasurer will pardon me .for dwelling on two other phases of this question. He knows better than any one else that he is facing new conditions in regard to Customs revenue. The Customs revenue has held up wondrously during the first nine months of the financial year, but it cannot hold up right through the year, and is now sliding &#39; heavily. </para>

                            <para>- Those who know the figures of importations now and to come have reasons for believing that the right honorable gentleman cannot, next year, depend on the same returns from Customs and Excise, especially from Customs, as he has had this year, and Customs and Excise duties are the main source of indirect revenue. How much this revenue will fall I will not presume to predict; the right honorable gentleman, with his staff and the officers of the Customs Department are- best able to do that. There will, however, be a substantial difference between the Customs and Excise revenue for 1921-22 and that for the year ending on the 30th of next month. </para>

                            <para>- Revenue from income taxation will also fall. I am not abusing a confidence when I say that I know of a company in this country, engaged in a mercantile business, which has already written down the value of its stock by the sum of &#163;200,000. That vast sum is taken off one balance-sheet in reduction of the assessed value of the assets of the corporation. Honorable members will see, if that is symptomatic of what is being done generally by the holders of stock and the conductors of wholesale and retail businesses, that the income tax paid next year on the profits earned this year will be a substantially diminished one, and I am sure that the Treasurer is not comfortable in the cushioned chair that he adorns, when he thinks of next year&#39;s income from direct taxation. </para>

I noticed the promise in the Prime Minister&#39;s speech, but the Tariff discussion .will consume a vast amount of time, and members will naturally desire to rise as soon as that work is over, so that, probably, we shall not be summoned to meet again until reasonably late in the spring. If, in addition, the presentation of the Budget is to await the return of the Prime Minister, it is possible, and 1 think probable, that we may not have the financial statement until November. </para>

If, as the Prime Minister has shown, the Australian consumer is, on the average, getting wheat cheaper than the f.o.b. price of exported wheat, I am satisfied. I think that the parity should be kept as nearly as possible in all these transactions. Difficulty has occurred through , what I think to be the cardinal blunder of fixing the price for twelve months. The Government disclaims responsibility for that. </para>

                            <para>- That was adjustable. Technically the Government might have had no constitutional power, but it held the finance end of the advance, the effect of which was to regulate anything, it chose to regulate. I am not raising the cry of town against country. I think that parity should &#34;be maintained as far as possible; but in regard to a commodity which fluctuates generally very quickly, and which in the year when the fixation was made would obviously rise or fall, a perilous risk of misunderstanding and injustice was taken in fixing the price for twelve months. How the matter will end none of us can predict; all we can say is that so far the average has not been unjust to the consumers. </para>

                    <para>Now I wish to discuss the wool question as far as I understand it, and I take it to be, in the strictest sense of the word, a non-party question. For example, I listened to the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> to-day, flatly contradicting the treasonable old statement that no true blue Labour member could advocate the claims of the rich squatter.&#39; He endeavoured to see through the mist of party prejudice, and advocate the pastoral interests of his electorate and of the great northern reaches of Queensland, and he gave us a very interesting exposition of his views. I regard this as an entirely non-party question, which is grave or gay, according to the temperament of man. The optimist is not so frightened of the situation. The pessimist, arid the honorable member for Maranoa assumed that <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> to-day, is right down in the depths of anxiety and tribulation. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> unfortunately encouraged that view, and as I hope to be able to show, gave us too gloomy a picture. I speak as one who lives . in the town, but has endeavoured to understand the country, interests, and who, for a considerable time during the Prime Minister&#39;s absence in Europe, was the Minister handling the . wool scheme. It was my duty then to try to understand this question, and I have since continued my studies as far as a private member can. I do not think this is a time when a man should tie himself hard and fast to any dogmatic reading of the facts. The wisest and best informed amongst us may make an error of judgment. We ought all to enter the discussion of this matter saying that we cannot see much further than our noses. Conditions may improve much faster than the most hopeful minds anticipate, but on the other hand they may become blacker. </para>

                            <para>- I sympathize very much with those men whose circumstances were referred to by the honorable member for Cowper. Because of the drought, in addition to the difficulty confronting them with the carry-over wool, all their profits and much of their capital are lost this year. That is a double infliction, but the position of the wool industry generally to-day is not so&#39; bad as it is when a great drought strikes the pastoralists. Yet the pastoralists, big-hearted men, have struggled to their feet again and won through, and other sections in the community have been unable to help them although they have sympathized with them.

                    <para>The Prime Minister said that his reading of the wool facts of the past had shown a clearer vision ti an that of the pastoralists, and he, therefore, suggested that the advice of the Government, in relation to the remedy now proposed, should be taken. I do not think that statement is fair either to himself or to the pastoralists, who have been interested in the control of wool ever since the Pool started. I remember that, when the right honorable gentleman was last in Europe, after the extension of -the first wool contract had been made early in 1918, it became possible to discuss with the British Government a still further extension of five years. That first extension was for two years and a full wool year after the termination of the war. It happened that, as the war terminated in November, 1918, the contract ran for one and a half years after that date, and finished on the 30th June, 1920. We were just able to draw up for consideration a further contract of five years, which would have lasted until 30th June, 1925, when I, as &#39; Acting Prime Minister, was stopped, by the Prime Minister, then in London,, from proceeding further. I say this, because, if that contract had been drawn and signed, as I have every reason to believe it would have been but for the Prime Minister&#39;s retarding influence, we would have been getting a flat rate of ls. 3|d. for our wool till the 30th June, 19.25, and I think the Prime Minister,, no matter who advised him - whether English or Australian views gathered in his mind - made a blunder from which the pastoral industry of this country will take many years to recover. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> as a prominent member of the Central Wool Committee, knows all this,, and he, I think, was doubtful whether we should sell for a further period of* five years. </para>

                            <para>- It would have been a priceless benefit to this country if we had been permitted to make that contract as we proposed, and, I believe, the British Government were; prepared to buy at that time - April, May, or, at the latest, early in June, 1918. The war was still raging, and the British Government were making preparations for a long campaign. It is not quite fair to close this phase of the argument by saying that we wish that had been done, because the British Government would have had to pay through the nose, and there might have been talk afterwards of some release from the contract after a year or two. But, at any rate, the pastoral industry would have been stabilized in an indescribable way if we could have made a more extended contract. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in the way I have described. The  Britsh  Government might not have been content to go om with the contract for the full term, but it certainly would have been better for us than the position in which we are placed now. The scheme produced by the Prime Min-, Ester last year, and which I believe was not assented to by the Central Wool Committee, was for the suspension of sales in England for about six months, and for auction sales of the new clip to be held in Australia only. There were two features about that which shook the confidence of British folk interested in wool, as I, who was in England, was able to observe. First there was the difficulty as to the time at which the prohibition of further sales from the carry-over wool started. If the proposed dates had been assented to by the British authority there would have been a famine period for Australian wool in  London, which would have enabled those who held stocks to exact their own price until the new clip arrived. That was a very bad calculation, which Bradford and London and the interests which study the </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Australian wool clip from the points of view of manufacture and finance, pointed out at once. The British Government assented to the suspension of sales foi six months and allowed us to carry on sales of the new clip in Australia without competition; but the system broke down. One of the chief causes of the breakdown was this: Tt was almost impossible, in some cases, frankly impossible, for French, Belgian, and Dutch buyers, who had operated in Australia in pre-war times, to establish credits in Australia for their purchases. At that time it was &#39;impossible to find exchange for anything&#39; but very small sums of money, or to transfer credit or sterling from London  to  Australia, and those people, however much they wished to buy our clip, could not finance their purchases. But if some sales had been conducted in England and some in Australia it would have been possible to establish, a market which, I think, would have prevented the debacle from which we are now suffering. I point to these facts because I agree with the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> in his statement that however able and talented a politician is, he cannot understand a highly technical and specialized business of the importance of the wool industry as well as can a man who has spent his life in it. And I would, therefore hand over to the men who had charge of the Wool Pool and now have charge of Bawra, whatever control is necessary so long as we are assured that the public interest will be protected. The honorable member for Cowper has suggested a means by which that might be safeguarded by a free access of governmental or auditorial authority to the books of Bawra in order to enable Parliament and the Government to know exactly what is being done by this huge corporation which is handling one of our basic commodities. </para>

                            <para>- Very well. What I understand by the Bawra scheme is the original proposal with which it started its life. When the British Government and the Australian Government consented to the creation of the British- Australian Wool Realization Association it was to be a voluntary proposition. Those who wanted to come in could come in. Those who wanted to stay out stood out. I think I am right in remembering that about 96 or 97 per cent. of the wool-growers intimated their willingness to come in. That is the Bawra scheme ; and, although it has not met with all the success that was hoped for, no amendment that the Government suggests seems to me to invalidate the wisdom of that provision. If there had been no attempt to prevent this wool being flooded on to the markets, either in Australia or in Europe, values might have been a long way lower for all grades of wool than even they are to-day; and it was wise prevision on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins and his associates on the Central Wool Committee to attempt to create such a body for the purpose of preventing the incoming clip from sharing in the general downfall. The Government say that the conditions have altered very much - at least I assume that is what &#39; they &#39; say - since Bawra was originally created, and that it is necessary to fix a minimum price below which wool shall not be sold outside Australia. </para>

It may be well qualified to speak as to the outlook of wool, but there are certain constitutional, legal, and political principles for the consideration of which this House must make itself responsible.

There must be some other reason in their minds. As one honorable member has said, although this may be a wise and necessary provision, at the end of six months we will be just as we are to-day. We may have sold some of the new wool, but we may not have been able to reduce our carryover stocks. I would like to have an explanation from a Minister. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Maranoa did give the &#34; show away &#34; when he said that. It is not a healthy principle. Some of my friends opposite seem to think it is, but honorable members on the Ministerial side have frequently denounced it. Any attempt to force men in a time of peace, even although there are trade or economic&#39; difficulties in existence, into a line of conduct of which they do not approve with regard to their own interests, will always be regarded as dangerous by men who hold the principles for which honorable members on the Ministerial side stand. That is a feature they ought not to lose sight of. It can only be defended because some substantial and undoubted advantage may be achieved by it. </para>

If it is helpful to the banks, it may be an advantage or a disadvantage; but we have to see how it will help, not only the operation of a public principle, but also the stabilization of a great industry. I do not think much advantage will be obtained by the postponement of the operation of  a  sliding price. Unless I can see that it is going to have some effect on the ultimate destination of the carry-over wool, it does not seem to me to be worth considering. </para>

                            <para>- Then it could only have occurred within the last few weeks. When the war was over, the gold producers said, &#34; Gold is at a great premium, and we can get no advantage from it. We want to be able to export gold.&#34; After considering the matter, the Government decided that the export of newly-won gold was quite a sound proposition in order to save some of the fields that were struggling, but we would not allow the export of our reserves against note issue or bank holdings, and we drew up conditions to show how we could fairly permit the export of newly- won gold. I said to the producers, &#34;&#39; You must form yourselves into a gold producers association. Any one who likes can stop outside it, but he cannot export his gold unless he does it through the association.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid not. I was not in the House when that legislation was passed. Indeed, I have always been extremely doubtful - though it has not been my business to express my opinion upon the matter - as to whether the machinery adopted for the application of arbitration has not brought about the downfall of the system. It is an arguable matter; but, in any case, I am not in favour of compulsory unionism, and I do not think that many outside the ranks of Labour are in favour of it. </para>

                            <para>- One does not strain points when he analyzes reasons. If the honorable member is not influenced by academic considerations, of course he will miss many points , in this House. I always endeavour to take them into account. Where they are too thin I drop them out; but some of them are important and pertinent, although theoretic There is, however, a practical point to&#39; which the honorable member for Cowper refers - the effect upon the South American holder of cross-bred and other low-grade wools. If we fix the price at 8d. per lb. it will be just the opportunity for which this man is looking in order to unload. If we keep our goods off the market, it will be his chance of a market, not free from, competition, but with very little competition. </para>

He may have wool which is worth more, and may be able to sell it ; but in competition with us he may have difficulty in doing so. Ido not pretend that either the Treasurer or myself is the best man to analyze that question; but the heads of Bawra, who know and see precisely what is going to take place if we grant this six months&#39; immunity to them, should consider it. </para>

                            <para>- It is. . The real duty before us is to endeavour to get back some of our old customers. The antipathies formed during the war have found expression in perfervid oratory on both sides of the House as to future trade relations with enemy countries. The Prime Minister from the time he moved or helped in the creation of the Paris Economic resolutions, took his stand against any future trade with Germany. It is perfectly plain that however utterances have prejudiced men, or &#39; committed them, we have to take our * choice between two courses, and to determine which is the better to adopt. We have either to trade with Germany, or to see her remain in her present helpless state, unable to pay reparation as long as we cease to trade with her. I am speaking now, not of Australia alone, but of the rest of the world. If all the nations were to say to Germany, &#34; We will not trade with you; we will not buy from, or sell to you,&#34; then Germany could not be restored to anything like her pristine vigour, and her reparation payments would become impossible. In the enemy countries of Middle Europe, there are between 150,000,000 and 200,000,000 people who formerly did a more or less considerable trade in wool with Australia, but who are not now doing anything substantial in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of the Balkans. Poland is now friendly, but was not so until she broke off from Russia. Bohemia, which is in the area of which I speak, was formerly a- part of Germany. All the middle of Europe, which was formerly alien and enemy is not doing with us the business that it did before the war. How then can we get back some of our old customers? There are four difficulties in the way, and I should be glad if honorable members would pay particular attention to them as they consider the subject. There are actual practical difficulties in the way of the resumption of this trade. The first of these is the question of the fixation of prices. That is not insuperable. . The second is the question of determining exchange. The last quote in respect of the German mark given in our Australian papers was 260, instead of 20 marks to the sovereign as before the war. The German mark is worth about7/8d., according to the quotation which appeared in the newspapers of yesterday or the day before. For two or three months the German mark ran at 240 to the &#163;1, which meant that the former German shilling was worth1d. The exchange difficulty is undoubtedly great. Then we have the question of credits, or, in other words, the question of payment. Supposing you fix prices and get over the exchange difficulty, how are you to arrange for payment? Finally, we have a difficulty that is likely to influence the English mind &#34;more than that of Australia. I refer to the competition of exported textiles as a result of the purchase of our raw material. </para>

                            <para>-I desire to give brief attention to these four problems - not to attempt to solve them, but to contribute to the subject a thought or two which may bring some fruit to the efforts that ought to be undertaken to secure the return of this trade. I am assuming that we want to restore the prestige and stability of our pastoral industry as best we can, that we want reparation from Germany, and are not above selling some of our wool to the enemy provinces of Middle Europe if the business can be put on a stable foot ing. The question of prices is one that the bargainers between the two peoples should be able to fix. They should be able to decide whether the wool is to be sold at what we speak of as1s.,1s.1d., 1s. 2d., or1s. 6d. per lb. That is a question upon which the buyers, the wool experts of both countries, can arrive at an agreement. The most difficult question of all to determine in the early stages will be that of exchange. It has been suggested that we should barter. That means that these countries, in exchange for our wool, should immediately hand over certain goods produced by them upon some arbitrary basis of so many articles for a bale of wool. That would be impossible. First of all the equation could not be established. Secondly, we do not want the manufactured goods of Germany in direct payment for that wool. This is a problem on which I am not dogmatizing, but rather wish to offer suggestions. It is, however, possible for the British and Australian Government to say, &#34;We will have for the purposes of this transaction an arbitrary fixation of the mark value. We will not take any notice of the 260, the 220, the 212 value, or whatever may have been the value of the mark during the last year or two, but we will fix a 50 or 60 mark value to the sovereign, and so bring the whole matter within the reach of practical business.&#34; If that were done in the most arbitrary fashion by the authorities of both nations, aided by their selling and buying people, we could register a transaction in these wools. By that means, instead of keeping this mountain of wool, which will always be liable to fall on us as long as it does not pass into consumption, we could pass the lower grades into Middle Europe, where they are so badly needed. If that could be done it would carry us over two hurdles. </para>

I suggest now a means by which payment could be made. We are not going to get anything for this wool, if we keep it, for some years. In the circumstances, therefore, I would be prepared to take the credit notes of&#39; the country to which we sold. In the one case it might be the credit notes of the new region of Czechoslovakia, in another it might be those of Austria, 411 a third case it might be the credit notes of Germany, and in the fourth case it might be the credit notes of Poland. I would be prepared to take those notes, with a currency of three to five years, fixed on an arbitrary valuation of the mark per sovereign. In that way we could do trade with these countries. </para>

                            <para>- If we fixed it &#39;at twenty we would  have  to lift the prices, and prices and exchange ratio bear an intimate relationship. As to the re-exportation of the finished textiles, I say, with great respect, that too much is being made of the possibilities by Bradford and the English manufacturers generally. Judging by the clothing conditions of the people of these countries, to which I have been referring,&#39; they will not have much to export for a few years. Those people, who are using cotton and paper goods, if given the means of restarting their textile manufacture will, as far as possible, bite into the supply, and, I believe, there would be very little left for immediate export. But even if a proportion of their textiles was exported, neither the Bradford nor the Australian people could expect to &#34;have it both ways.&#34; They cannot expect to pass this mountain of wool into consumption and not to get the kick of it when we reach the point of competing with woollens manufactured from the re-exporting countries. The British woollen makers have been up against such competition before from all parts of the world, and will have to get used to it again, just as the Australian grower, stepping out of the shelter of  the  protection of the Pools formed during  the  war, has to compete with the fierce forces of unrestricted international competition. </para>

                    <para>I very much appreciate the consideration which the House has shown me, and will not presume.&#39; upon it. The prime necessity of the next few months is to endeavour to&#39; arrange a <inline font-style="italic">modus</inline><inline font-style="italic">vivendi</inline> for the disposal of a substantial proportion of our carry-over wool to the customers we have lost, and every effort of the best business brains/ and of the Executives of the countries concerned, should be bent to that end. I think there are in the service of the British Government, and I am certain there are at the disposal of the Australian Government, brains which can supply their portion of such a scheme. I have no doubt that Germany would find the same type of men to organize that triangular understanding which alone will remove the <inline font-style="italic">impasse,</inline> make for stabilization, and for their proportionate consumption of the wool that we have. I am endeavouring now not to show the futility of the two or six months of immunity suggested, but simply to  point  out that the whole  object  of any delay or prohibition is really to get breathing time for the creation of a consumption scheme. You have to get your consumption scheme in operation by soma  such means as I have endeavoured to outline. I do not hold dogmatically to any feature of the scheme I have advanced.; but if it were put powerfully before the British Government, I believe it would win approval, and that there would be negotiations in support of it. </para>
                    <para>The disturbing factor in relation to exchange to-day is surely the reparation question. France&#39;s exchange has become better within the last three months as the Prime Minister of France has got nearer what the French people think a settlement with the German people, and the currency of Germany has equally receded by depreciation. If we were to settle the reparation question, exchange would tend to right itself very quickly. It would&#34; right itself far more quickly than the exchanges and Bourses of Europe appear to believe possible. We can have  no  hand in the settlement of that question at this stage.- It has to run its course. But if an arbitrary relationship between the pound sterling and the mark could be fixed for a large transaction of this kind, extending over three or four sections in the next two years, it would do much to hasten an improvement in the Continental exchange position. That in itself would induce the trade which it appears necessary to stimulate by this artificial means. It would improve the exchange business enormously if it were known that Germany, in respect of her great textile operations, was again afloat; and if a reparation settlement of the tentative kind which it is thought may be brought about by the middle of the year, were effected, trade would resume in a much more rapid way its normal flow. Then, instead of legislators being bothered with problems of this kind, business men and financiers would have almost the whole consideration of them. I hope that the right honorable gentleman in charge of the House will consider this&#34; last matter, whatever he may think of my first criticism, and endeavour to have a consumption scheme considered, formulated, advocated, and, if possible, approved. </para>
                    <para>I think we are entitled, also, to know if the Government proposes to secure approval of this proposal by a Bill or a resolution. The mere authorizing of the printing of a paper, and the operation of this technical sanction by the Minister for Customs under the Customs Act, seems to me a slovenly way of establishing such an important departure from principle as is intended. </para>

You could not lift any restrictions imposed by an Act except by passing a repealing Act, or providing for the cessation of its operation by a proclamation. The advantage of a resolution, and the operation of it under the Customs Act, is that it would allow of the removal of the restrictions whenever that might seem necessary. </para>

                            <para>- I agree that rigidity would result from the passing of an Act, whether it were temporary or permanent, though a measure might be made operative by proclamation. But what I desire is an opportunity for Parliament, to review all the circumstances, not only to vote on this distinct issue, but to condition it if the majority of members believe that it should be conditioned in some way. The mere saying of &#34; aye &#34; to the proposal to print a paper could not provide that. I ask the Acting Leader of the Government, therefore, to consider whether a resolution or a small Bill would not afford the opportunity which I think members should require. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> if it is possible to persuade the Parliament of Victoria to allow the reserve to the north of these buildings to be opened, so that children may play in it. At present that reserve is the worst eye-sore in Melbourne, and a blot on the credit of this Parliament, because we are blamed for its condition. . In the slums around about there are many poor little kiddies who have nowhere to play, and their running over this ground would at least keep the weeds down, and to that extent improve its condition. I do not suggest the removal of the iron fence, though I would take away that abomination if I had the power ; but the wooden fence, from Albert-street to Spring-street, might be removed to the advantage of the children and their parents. A large petition, got up by Councillor H. H. Smith for presentation to you or to the  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, is now being signed.I hope that you will enter into communication with the State authorities in order to have the change made. </para>

                        <para>- I would remind the honorable member that the time for asking questions has passed. However, as he has raised this matter, I would inform him that I am not sure that we have any authority over the reserve, which is separated by the temporary right-of-way from Albert-street to Spring-street from the premises of which we are the tenants. The honorable member is aware that representations have been made by the  President  and myself as to the desirability of improving this ground, and we have offered to expend as much as &#163;1,000 on it if we can get the permission of the State authorities to do what we propose to do. I shall have the honorable member&#39;s suggestion placed before the Joint House Committee, and perhaps representations from them to the State Government may have the effect he desires. </para>
