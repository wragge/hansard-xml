                - Yes. Goods may be exported from Australia to-day to any part of the world. There is no discrimination in this matter between countries. Of course, there are conditions to be complied with, as to standards and so on, but no restrictions on exportation itself. As to importation, goods may not be imported from Germany except such as are needed for the carrying on of industries in this country. For instance, parts of plants or machinery that originally came from Germany, which cannot be got elsewhere, may be imported ; but outside these limits, importations from Germany are not permitted at the present time.

                    <para>- I desire to say, by way of personal explanation, lest' misrepresentation occur because comparatively few members voted against the Government's resolutions last night for the disposal of the wool clip, that, owing to the determination to push matters to a conclusion by means of a late sitting, and the consequent inability of many members - I among them - to address themselves to the subject, I did not wait for the division. I wish it to be understood, however, that I was opposed to the Government scheme, and made arrangements, to which no doubt effect was duly given, for recording my opposition in the form of a pair. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Acting Prime Minister lay on the table of the House <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> S. Gullett's report on the Burnett lands, and will he let us know whether the Government has come to a decision about the request of the Queensland Government for a loan of £2,000,000 for the construction of railways in the Burnett district with a view to the settlement of soldiers and immigrants there ? I ask the question because there is a great deal of unemployment in Queensland, and a favorable reply may help to relieve distress. </para>

I see no reason why it should not be laid on the table of the Library. No Cabinet decision has been arrived at about a loan to Queensland, but I say, clearly and frankly, that I have not at the moment £2,000,000 to lend to the Queensland Government for any purpose whatever. </para>

                        <para>- All I can do now is to promise that the matter will be considered. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' statement yesterday I should like to make my own position clear. Three or four reporters came to me the other night. They told me, I think, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins had announced his intention of resigning, and I replied that I was not aware that any information on the subject had reached the Government, which is the fact. I went on to say that I had observed from the newspapers that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins had, quite a number of times, threatened to resign; but I immediately and deliberately withdrew the word "threatened" in order to avoid saying anything which might give the slightest offence to  His  Honour, substituting the word "proposed." Unfortunately the reporters let the word "threatened" appear in their reports. I regret that the word has appeared, but it is not my fault. I wish to add that I share the opinion that it is unfortunate that there should be a controversy in public between a Judge on the bench and any member of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>- I draw attention to the fact that the High Court Procedure Bill, which stands second on the notice-paper, could be disposed of very quickly, whereas the discussion of the Tariff, which precedes it, will take a very long while. I suggest, therefore, that the Government might well get the High Court Procedure Bill out of the way before the Tariff is proceeded with. That will give the Senate something to do, and would enable many persons who wish to get to the Court to do so. Wisely or unwisely, Parliament adopted a certain procedure. </para>

                        <para>- The matter has been considered, but it is thought that no station would be capable of providing for the traffic between the mainland and North Tasmania which did not cost less than £60,000 or £70,000, and in view of the fact that there is a quarantine station at Portsea, in Victoria, and another at the southern end of Tasmania, which can be made to serve, the Government does not feel justified at the present time in incurring that expense. </para>

                        <para>.- It is not my intention to make this contribution to the general debate on the Tariff a prelude to a series of speeches upon the various items. Rather do I desire to outline the main principles which will govern my votes upon those items. Neither Free Trade nor Protection can be regarded as a panacea for the nation's political ills.  The economic emancipation of the working classes cannot be secured through either medium. Under the existing commercialistic system the adoption of either policy would afford but a temporary expedient. But we must deal with things as they are, and not with what we would desire them to be; we must face the problems of the living present, and when I take into consideration the merits of Free Trade and Protection, I realize that there are degrees of advantage to be obtained by supporting a policy of Protection. Two cardinal principles appear to me as being the redeeming features of that policy as compared with the policy of Free Trade. Protection will provide a medium for constituting Australia as a self-contained nation by the development of its own industries. Furthermore, it will serve to provide adequate employment for our people. If principles of an equitable character, industrially, were prevailing throughout the world, there might be justification for instituting a policy of Free Trade; but when we find certain degrees of standards' of living applying throughout, the various, nations of this earth, we must realize that it would be decidedly to the disadvantage of that nation which afforded the higher standard of living if it should attempt to subject its industries to open competition from countries in which a lower standard of living was prevailing. The policy of the Labour party is to adopt that form of protection known as new Protection, which, while affording to the manufacturers of commodities made locally ample protection, also gives security to the local consumers of those commodities, and to the persons employed in making them. Already this Commonwealth Parliament has endeavoured by the passage of legislation to establish that new Protection; but, unfortunately, because of the limitations of our Constitution, it proved to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires'</inline> by the decision of the High Court in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Barger</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">the Crown,</inline> reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> vol. VI., 1908. However, although I am a layman, and have no claim to legal knowledge on such matters, I am under the impression that the decision given by the High Court last year upon the powers of the Commonwealth, which decision, to a certain extent, reversed previous decisions in relation to the same powers, indicates that this Parliament really is empowered to enact some form of new Protection. It is very desirable that this should be done, because there are some persons associated with the local manufacture of goods - they are only a small percentage, certainly - who are prepared to take undue advantage of the protection afforded to them by extorting from the public exorbitant prices for the goods in which they have been enabled to create almost a monopoly. That is not a circumstance that generally governs the industries of Australia. Those who favour Free Trade contend that free imports mean lower prices for many of the commodities used by us, and therefore a reduction in the cost of living. I doubt  the accuracy of that assertion, and my doubt is founded upon substantial facts set out in reports of the Inter -State Commission, which some time ago investigated Tariff matters. Prices are not based upon a competitive system, but rather upon the capacity of the people to pay them, and at times the prices fixed are altogether beyond the means of the people. This circumstance changes the whole phase of many contentions on the merits of Free Trade and Protection which would have been received logically and with some justification in 1791, when the  principle of Protection was first recommended to the United States. The relationship of commerce has considerably changed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington, Chairman</inline> of the Inter-State Commission, in a recently-published volume entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Next Step,</inline> clearly . indicates that wages are just 12 months behind the cost of living. It would seem that competition plays an insignificant part in the determination of our economic conditions. For this the manufacturers of Australia, in my opinion, are not responsible. There are, as I have said, isolated instances where local manufacturers unfortunately have taken undue advantage of the protection afforded them. But generally speaking it is the wholesale warehouses which extract from the people exhorbitant dues and adopt a system under which competition, is absolutely reduced to a minimum. It would appear that there is a desire on the part of some of those associated with the wholesale undertakings of this country to camouflage their actual operations and to make it appear tha-t they have no arrangement for fixing prices. The  President  of the Melbourne Warehousemen's Association, giving evidence before the Inter-State Commission regarding the question of clothing, said : - </para>

                        <para>Shortly after the outbreak of war, correspondence passed between similar associations in the various States with regard to increase of prices owing to war conditions, but it was finally resolved that action in that direction be left to the discretion of individual members. Another instance which showed a desire to fix prices occurred in the latter part of 1014,, when the Melbourne Association requested the Adelaide Association to join in fixing the price of calico, owing to the competition of non-associated houses. It does not appear that any combined prices were actually adopted by the associations, and the  president  of the Victorian Association,' when asked to explain the account in the minutes said: - "On the face of it that would seem to show that we aimed at fixing prices, but I say that there was no suggestion as to fixing the price, though I cannot explain exactly what it means." </para>
                        <para class="block">At page  44  of the same report the Commission, writing of the controlling influence of wholesale distributors states - Speaking generally, the price of clothing is affected more by the wholesale distributing houses than by any other section of the trade. The immense bulk of imports, the large proportion of Australian-made goods which is only procurable through warehouses, the great and increasing amount of manufacturing carried out by wholesale merchants, and their financial connexion with many retailers' businesses, all combine - to suggest that no control of prices can be effectual which does not include that section of the trade which occupies the stage between production and the retail house. </para>
                        <para class="block">The position is further explained at page  45  of the same report - </para>
                        <para>Prices are now fixed by wholesalers, not by adding the same uniform percentage to landed cost, but by directing 'the head of each department, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> manchester goods, ready-made clothing, silks, &amp;c, to produce at the end of each half-year a defined gross profit on the sales. The departmental head knows what his goods have cost into warehouse, and so adjusts the additions to that cost of the various articles handled, as to bring out an aggregate amount in turnover which will yield the stipulated gross profit over aggregate landed cost. </para>
                        <para class="block">Articles imported at a low price are not sold at low rates, but are used as a sort of balancing medium. The same course is followed with respect to local manufactures, and the warehouses so adjust the circumstances of their businesses as to obtain from the general' public the fullest contribution of profit that it is possible to secure from them. It is stated by the Commission that- </para>
                        <para>When supplies are ample, either of imports or of Australian manufactures, the warehouseman balances prices so as to insure himself against possible losses on certain classes of  goods. Risks of this sort do not now exist, as the unanimous testimony of the trade is 'that everything is readily sold which can be got into the warehouse. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I desire to make very clear the point that Australian consumers do not secure any direct advantage 'from cheap importations. The warehouses are the controlling factor. My view is that we should make it necessary for the warehouses to purchase locally-manufactured goods, rather than those manufactured abroad, so that we may in that way insure more employment for those engaged in industry in- Australia. I object to the system at  present  operating under which warehousemen exercise a most effective control over the affairs of our country and the requirements of our people. I do not agree with the contention that the Commonwealth Parliament has not power to deal with such a system, but if it be correct that we do lack the power, there could be no graver reflection on the framers of the Constitution. We have, however, to meet the circumstances as best we can, and I feel it is far better that we should adopt a policy which will keep our workmen fully engaged rather than carry on under a policy which leads to frequent periods of depression and to the swelling of the great army of the unemployed. It is stated in the report of the Inter-State Commission in regard to groceries that - </para>
                    <para>The wholesale merchants are a very important factor in the conduct of the .grocery trade, not only in the control of prices, but also in the control and distribution of both local and imported goods. </para>
                    <para>Here, again, in respect of lines which profoundly affect the cost of living, these' wholesale warehousemen make their presence felt in the meet marked' manner, and have a directly controlling influence over the . powers of. the , people. Greater power is possessed by . the big warehouses of Australia in regard' to the determination of the economic conditions of the people than is enjoyed, according to honorable members opposite, by the Parliament itself. I agree, however, with the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> that under section 51 of the Constitution we have ample power to deal effectively with the trade combinations that of recent years have become so marked a feature of the commercial world. I desire now to refer to the Brisbane Merchants' Association. I find that the. association of retailers exert no undue influence over prices but the operations .of the Merchants' Association evidences a decided mastery over both transactions and prices,' as the following extract from the report of the Inter-State Commission shows:- - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>According to the secretary, the wholesale lists issued from time to time is compiled in the following manner: - There was no regular time for issuing those lists, but it was generally found necessary to take some action in that direction when an increase took place in the import price. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In. Sydney there is a retail house, which has been registered under the name of Merchants Limited. That firm has endeavoured to purchase direct from the manufacturers with a view to benefiting the public by the exclusion of what is known as the wholesale middleman; but the warehouses have instituted a form of - boycott and have endeavoured by all the means ' in their power to prevent direct supplies. One line of commodity alone affords proof of the intimidation, which the wholesale warehouses endeavour to exercise over manufacturers. I refer to the <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Morse</inline> Indian Root Pills, which are manufactured by W. H. Comstock, Sydney. The Brisbane Merchants' Association wrote to the proprietors of these pills, asking them to confine their sale to members of their, association. This request the pill proprietors refused, whereupon the association threatened to -adopt a plan that would prove extremely detrimental to future sales of the article. There was, however, a second refusal, and the Merchants' Association then raised the price of the pills 'by 25 per cant. There can be' no doubt that that was a deliberate attempt at intimidation. The facts I obtained from the report of the Inter-State : Commission, and they afford ample corroboration of the statements regarding the powers exercised by warehousemen. The Inter-State Commission also reports as follows : - </para>

                        <para>General lj' speaking, it may be said that the wholesale merchants are in the best position of any of those .'engaged in the grocery trade.

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I hear repeated complaints from retail grocers that they are subject' to undue pressure by the wholesalers concerning certain - lines that they supply for  public  use.' Many of the retail storekeepers are held responsible for the. increase in the cost of living, but, as matter of fact, that sin does not -lie at their door, sp much as at the door 'of the. wholesale men. It is my hope that we may be able to institute a form of protection which will secure the people against imposition, guarantee the worker a congenial standard of living, and protect those engaged in manufactures and industries generally against any. unfair advantage on the part of those engaged in similar work in other parts of the world. </para>
                    <para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> early in 1920, there was reprinted a circular, which had been sent out on the 16th December, 1919, to retail dealers in men's wear, by the Australian agents of a well-known English firm of felt-hat makers. This circular certainly affords proof that the warehousemen actually endeavour to fix the retail prices of certain commodities. The circular was as follows: - </para>
                    <para>Dear Sirs, - As you must appreciate, we find it necessary to again rearrange the wholesale and retail prices of- hats, which will now be:- </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be seen that the wholesale men do not confine themselves to goods actually passing at the time to the retailers, but dictate the retail prices of goods already stocked in the retail houses. Only during the last fortnight there appeared in <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> of the Melbourne newspapers an advertisement, inserted by a man named Henderson, who carries on business at High-street, Northcote, and who, I understand, has been subject to interference by the wholesale people. They have endeavoured to intimidate and boycott him, in their desire to control his business. We have been able to successfully establish in Australia the tweed industry, and it is one which should be fostered and encouraged. The fact is, however, that the wholesale people of Flinders-lane have secured an almost governing influence over the output of the mills. The Mayor of Geelong, Alderman Hitchcock, spoke at a civic luncheon at Ballarat, tendered to Geelong municipal visitors, and he is thus reported : - </para>
                    <para>Alderman Hitchcock congratulated Ballarat on its woollen mills. Geelong, he said, had Ave such mills, but, nevertheless, in that city they could not buy their own tweeds. That fact placed them in a ridiculous position. They had to go to Flinders-lane, where from 20 to 25 per cent. profit was made. He considered that the people in centres where mills had been established should be able to get their material at reasonable prices. It was possible that new woollen mills would be established with the special object of supplying goods direct to retailers, and so give the advantage to the public. </para>
                    <para class="block">I submit not only that the people who live in the localities referred to should have the advantage of cheaper cloth, but that the advantage should be extended to the people of Australia generally, and I know positively that according to the price at the point of production, this can be done; I say that with emphasis. This is but another proof that the manufacturers are not directly responsible for the great increase' in prices; the responsibility is that of the great distributing warehouses which are able to secure more than a fair return for the services they render to the public. The arrogance and indifference of these wholesale people certainly show a lack of morale and of appreciation of the duty they owe to the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daniel-</inline> Solomon, manager for J. and B.

                    <para class="block">Those are the circumstances that govern the position of Australia to-day, and as it is proved that the warehouses are a dominant factor in the control of prices and the regulation of trade, We should do  something to  compel them to purchase the locally-manufactured article in preference to the imported. Many will doubt whether by the exclusion of imports we shall in any way improve the situation. If the imported article were to cost only one-fourth of the price of the locally-produced article the consumer would not secure it a.t a cheaper price, because the warehouses are out to make the maximum of profit. That was instanced by  disclosures in  regard to shaving' brushes imported from Japan at a very low cost, and sold at the maximum price. The regulation of prices is out of the question, because the great commercial institutions have honorable, or, as I think, dishonorable understandings among themselves to fix, not only the wholesale price, but also the minimum retail price. The disadvantage experienced by the local manufacturers iri not being able to' deal directly with the retailer, but being compelled to sell their goods through the medium of Flinders-lane establishments, can be readily understood. It is with a desire that such trade shall not be availed of by the warehouses to further enhance their profits that I am prepared to give such Protection to the industries of Australia as will enable them to further extend their operations, and provide means of employment, not only for the workers already in Australia, but for others who may desire to come from the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire to engage in industries that will be profitable to the community.- Therefore, I shall afford my support to the proposed measures oi Protection for the local manufacturers.

In framing a Tariff it is well to have regard to the industrial and economic conditions obtaining in those countries which are likely to be the most formidable competitors in the Australian market. They seem to be the Asiatic countries, particularly Japan. Japan is only 5,000 miles from Australia, less than half the distance from the Commonwealth to the nearest European country. Having regard to the conditions of labour in Japan, it must be recognised that Free Trade would work to the decided detriment of the people engaged in Australian industries. It is very desirable that our public men should interest themselves in this problem, for we on this side, at any rate, do not desire to see the social and industrial standards of the Australian workers lowered in fact, it is our determination to see that every standard of comfort is provided, the minimum being the standard set by the Basic Wage Royal Commission. Although our standard of living and conditions of labour are amongst the most advanced in the world, they are still far from being perfect. As an indication of the conditions against which we have to compete, I submit the following table of wages in Japan and Australia in the year 1917, that being the latest year for which I could get returns, for Japan: -  </para>

                    <para class="block">No. doubt the  members  of the Country party, or " foreign Country party," would like to see the Japanese agricultural wage ruling in Australia. " The views of those members, however; are not typical of those of the Australian farmers, who, generally speaking, are fairly broadminded. Honorable members in the Corner do not faithfully represent the views of the men upon the land. I find that in not one industry is the Japanese wage sufficient to pay for the ordinary cost of living. According to Professor  Iwana,  of Tokio University, the' cost of living, -on the data available to him, wa3 87.46 yen, or £3 15s. a month. The  industry  in Japan which most nearly ap- "* preaches that standard, is the brickmaking industry, the labour employed in which receives about £3 lis., or £3 12s. per month. In that country not only does the hush and go to work, but the wife and members of the family generally supplement the income of the .home with their exertions.  The nation employs a larger number of females than of males, and a big percentage of the labour in factories is child .labour. ! In 1917 the operatives in Japan numbered 458,638 male3 and 636,669 females. In Australia, I am glad to say, there are more male workers than female workers, our operatives numbering 233,959 males and 87,711 females. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Transpacific,</inline> for May, 1920," contains an able exposition on tie subject of the employment of female labour in Japan; and much information concerning it is to be obtained from the Japanese <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh.</inline> The rates of wages that I have quoted are from that source, and the information is, therefore, as authentic as it is possible to secure. Many of the conditions of employment in Japan, especially those connected with the employment of girls in the textile industries, are revolting. The conditions of labour are not such as we regard as desirable, nor even in accordance with our average .standard of public morality. Under these circumstances, I shall "not vote to give .a .nation which pays insignificant wages to its people, and employs them under industrial conditions which are below the average standard of the world, an advantage over our Australian industrialists. Japanese manufacturers have not been faithful to the decisions adopted at the World's Labour Congress, which was to set world standards of industrial conditions.- In order to adequately protect our employees, and to allow them to maintain and even to improve their industrial status, because I am convinced that it can, and must, be improved to at least provide for the finding of the Basic Wage Royal Commission, I shall support" the Tariff Schedule generally, reserving to myself the right to consider the special circumstances of certain industries dependent upon importations. I find that in Japan, in the raw silk factories, the hours of labour are from thirteen to fourteen a  day, and in the weaving mills from fourteen' to sixteen hours, and that the .general national working day of .Japan is from ten to twelve hours. Japan has competed successfully against the western nations because of her cheap methods of production due to her low wages, inferior industrial conditions, and long hours of labour. It is said that the labour of an eastern woman is equivalent in value to one-third that of a woman in Western countries, but, even if that be so, the instalment of up-to-date machinery, and the adoption of scientific methods, will keep Japan in a position of great advantage, so .that if we do not give ample protection to our industries, our workers may be required to lower their standard of living. I trust that that will never happen, and no one will fight harder than I shall to prevent it. "Women are largely employed in mining in Japan, both underground and on the surface. They even work in the coal mines. No fewer than 50,323 Japanese women work underground in the mines, and 41,235 are employed on surface operations. The average wage of Japanese miners varies from lOd. to 2s. 2$d. per day. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire to handicap out mining industry. My view is that, instead of it being affected adversely by the fluctuations of the metal market' abroad, we should manufacture our raw material into finished articles. May I remind the '  honorable member of the result of Asiatic intrusion upon the world's metal, market regarding an Australian mineral product, tungsten? The importations and expectations df Japan show the influence that she is exerting upon international trade. In "1917 her exports were valued at 1,603,000,000 yen, or £160,300,000, and her imports at 1,038,000,000 yen, or £103,500,000. The value of her exports thus exceeded that of her imports by 568,000,000 yen,' or £568,000. Without desiring to be offensive to the Japanese, I say that 90 per cent, of their manufactures are deceptive. Some of the dealers in precious gems in London are finding that out now) and we have discovered it in Australia in regard to things used in the home. The crockery that has come here from Japan of late is not in use very long before it cracks, the handles come off, and it becomes, useless and has to bo thrown into the rubbish-bin. . Instead of making our own requirements, we import them from Japan, and, paying the price of a good article, get only an inferior one. By confining our purchases as much as possible to the Australian product we have powers to determine standards of quality. The Japanese Government .have fostered and encouraged industry which might well give  employment to the people' of Australia. Not . only does Japan amply protect her industries with Customs duties, but she helps them also with preferential rates on the railways, goods of Japanese origin being at an advantage oyer those imported into the country.

                        <para>Nothing in the present inquiry has been more striking than the reiterated emphasis of Australia's dependence upon importations. That the greatest wool-producing country in the world should occupy such a singular position in regard to woollen clothing is a continual challenge to the theught and interest of Its citizens.

We have large stacks of wool hero, in fact we have a depression of prices owing to a surplus of carry-over wool which is jeopardizing the pastoral industry; yet the people are not being supplied with cheaper, woollen goods. It would be much more desirable if local manufacturers could absorb more of the raw material and turn it into the finished article', thus providing employment for many people who are now walking the streets of our cities looking for work. That instance alone affords me strong ground for supporting the industries of Australia against those of countries overseas. </para><para>If the honorable member for Barrier; <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr .Considine)</inline> had endeavoured to employ his efforts towards the establishment of industries in Australia which would absorb the raw material produced by the ' mines of Broken Hill, he would have) adopted the best course for stabilizing the metal mining industry, in which so many . of his 'constituents are vitally concerned. Prior to the war, the best customer for Australia's metals was Germany, but the raw material we supplied to that country was ultimately manufactured into munitions of war, to be used later on against us. Perhaps the same thing is occurring in respect of Japan. That country is ready to buy our metals. Owing to recent trading conditions, Japanese buyers have nob lately been able to make large purchases of our raw products, but past experience indicates that, when the opportunity offers,' they will be prepared to resume their purchases of our metals, which it is just possible they will apply to the very same purpose to which they were applied by the manufacturers of Germany - ultimately to be used against us, as has hap&gt; opened in the past. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- It is more desirable to establish, industries in Australia which will absorb the output of our mines, and thus deprive any aggressive nation of the opportunity of securing a raw material so essential in the manufacture of munitions of war. By doing this we would be more secure against aggressive action on the part of any other nation. At any rate, the miners of Broken Hill would appreciate the fact that the establishment of local industries which would absorb tha product of their mines would secure for them that continuity of employment which they desire and prevent that market-rigging which is indulged in by speculators in other parts of the world. </para>

The secret of prosperity for any people lies with the people themselves, and in their determination to control and regulate matters for themselves instead of intrusting them to a coterie of individuals who fatten upon the efforts of. the producers. Australia has been the happy hunting ground of mercenary mendicants from abroad who have been encouraged as far as possible by our warehouses. Our importers, realizing that they can get, an extra margin of profit by importing from abroad, entertain no feelings whatever of loyalty to the locally-manufactured article. They are quite prepared to enhance their own positions at the expense of the credit of their country. It is necessary to stabilize our own industries and the market for our raw material. We must have protection for industries already established or for those that can prove a likelihood of successful establishment in the future, but I am not prepared to impose a duty on- any article which is not being manufactured in Australia to-day, or in respect of which there is no likelihood of it being manufactured here.

Many industries in Australia have been subjected to serious depression, and we have great armies of unemployed walking the streets of our capital cities. Industry needs to be encouraged. The security of Australia must rest upon the strength of her people. By making ourselves a self-contained people, by absorbing our raw materials in manufacturing various commodities which we now import, we shall keep our credit, within our own boundaries, be  enabled  to relieve our obligations abroad "by the export of manufactures, and  provide  not only more employment for the highest class of labour already here, but new avenues of industry for tens of thousands of that class of people most likely to co-operate . with us and prove desirable fellow .citizens. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Our first duty is to our own people. We should see that those who produce reap some of the advantages of the production for which they are responsible. I am completely in accord with the view expressed by the Fair Prices Commission, that industries which are secured by a protective Tariff should be allowed to export only their surplus production, and that the people of Australia should have the first claim upon' what we produce. My desire is that our people shall secure the advantages of the wealth for the production of which they are responsible. Are we prepared to go on doing the unskilled work of the world ? Should we not rather be anxious to give to our own people the highest forms of employment by opening up new industries which will insure to them the best standards of life? In the production of raw materials our people are engaged, for the most part, in unskilled labour. Surely they are capable of carrying on the highest forms of industry. I am a competent judge of the young manhood of Australia. Pur young men are just as alert, capable, and 'intelligent as - if not more so than- - are those of any other part of the world. Why should we give them no real opportunity for the us© of their undoubted talents by keeping them employed mainly in . unskilled labour? We must direct our attention more and more, not only to the development of our primary industries, but to the expansion of our secondary industries. By sending abroad so much of our raw material,' instead of working it up here, we are simply providing the people of other nations with opportunities for the highest forms of employment. So far as the young womanhood of Australia is concerned, 'statistics demonstrate a greater number of male operatives in' local industries than that of females. That is- a very desirable provision, and while affording our- Australian women every opportunity for equality, it certainly must be regarded that home life is essentially the realm of our womenfolk,' and that it  should be encouraged by every form of comfort and congenial surrounding. While the conditions prevailing in Australia are not all that they ought to be, they do, at least, provide for a standard of living which allows of our womenfolk remaining at home instead of being required, as in some Asiatic and European countries, to supplement the family income bv working in various industries. If we are to become worthy of a place in the councils of the nations we shall have to become absolutely self-contained. We must offer the very best inducement to our people to remain here, and we can best do that by building up our industries and improving the conditions of living. </para>

But if the number of chassis required in Australia just now is not such as would justify the establishment of that industry, although I invite competent opinion, it has always been considered by me that everything required by Australians could be made in Australia. Assurances, however, have been given to me by Union officials and manufacturers, that at present no such industry exists, and that there is certainly little prospect for the immediate future. This article, perhaps, could be placed on the deferred list. No doubt there may be many similar cases, especially in foodstuffs. It would be unreasonable to cause a depression in that trade by imposing an unreasonably high duty, and thus defeat the very purpose for which we are endeavouring, and in consequence penalize our own people. </para>

                        <para>.- Personally, I believe in a Protective Tariff drawn up on scientific lines. It strikes me that, just asa father is prepared to pay a premium, and assist his son to become efficient in a trade, so this country should be prepared to assist its industries by putting them in a position to compete with those of other countries. Then, again, just as a father, after having assisted to establish his son, expects him to then rely on himself, so I feel that our industries, having been once firmly established, should be prepared to carry on without further Protection. </para>

                    <para>I should like to take this opportunity to quote from the latest Queensland statistics a few figures with regard to the position of manufacturers in that State. The figures will be comparative as between 19.10 and 1919. </para>

                    <para>the great increases, as shown by these figures, will probably impress many honorable members as they have impressed me. The honorable- member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gregory),</inline> when speaking last week, remarked that several members on the Government side had changed their opinion in regard to Protection since the previous Tariff was discussed, and it is undoubtedly a fact that many have learnt the lesson which the war should teach us. Lord Jellicoe has remarked that Australia's defence power lies in the development of industries that supply national wealth in times of peace, and means of warin times of strife, and in the growth of' a self-reliant industrial population. There is no doubt whatever that we should do everything possible to become a self-contained nation. The honorable member for "Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> speaking last week, made an eloquent appeal for protection for the cotton industry. Since then honorable members have .had an OP.portunity of hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> the Queensland cotton expert, and it must be admitted that he gave a most interesting account of the industry. He pointed out how, at the present day, in the northern State, there are only 2,500 to 3,000 acres under cotton, whereas fifty years ago there were 14,000 acres so employed. It is recognised that Queensland is the finest cotton-growing country in the worm; and I trust that the Government will be able to afford the industry adequate protection. I am also entirely in agreement with the honorable member for- Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> in his appeal for higher protection for the banana industry, in which many of our returned soldiers are employed, and are  at present having a very difficult time. What they ask for is shown in this extract from a pamphlet issued by the Southern Fruit-growers Association Limited, which states - </para>

                    <para>I trust that the request of these men, as expressed in the words I have read, and voiced by the honorable member for Lilley, will receive the consideration and support of all honorable members. </para>
                    <para>We have also to consider the present position of the timber industry. I hope that adequate Tariff protection will, be afforded during the present session qf Parliament against the dumping of timber into 'the Commonwealth from the United States of America, the Baltic, Russia, Japan, and other places. The Director of - Forestry in Queensland recently said -   . . the recent dumping, of timber was attributable largely to forced realizations on the part of a number of oversea concerns, some of which were selling sawn timber at less than the price of the  unsawn  logs; and, though a large percentage of the 45,000 saw-mills in the United Sta,tes of America and Canada had closed down during the universal depression, there still remained a proportion which Were, working upon timber concessions that cost nothing more than the obligation to open up new districts. </para>
                    <para class="block">We have heard in- this House that Timber Combines have made it very difficult to carry on the construction of War Service Homes and other works; and no doubt this matter will have to be thoroughly investigated. During the war it became essential for the southern States to import Queensland timber, whereas in the past those States had used timber from foreign countries; and that fact, alone shows how important the industry is to Australia. I have already said that I believe thoroughly in a Protective Tariff drawn up on scientific lines, and I shall say nothing more now, reserving any further remarks until the items are under consideration. </para>

                        <para>. -  |I wish to say, at the outset, that this is not the Tariff of the party to which I belong, and it is not the kind of Tariff that the party on this side would introduce if they were in power. I make that remark, because a good deal of criticism has been levelled at this side of the House by members of the Country party, who have been described by the honorable member for Hindmarsh as the foreign Country party, as if we were responsible for the Tariff.. Every one knows, or every one could know, that the fiscal policy for which we on this side stand is that of giving protection, not only to manufacturers, but. to consumers and .the workers, the latter of whom, are, of course, included amongst the consumers. That is what we call .our New Protection policy. </para>

My position is that if I cannot get the New Protection, I prefer the old Protection. I am not only a New Protectionist, but an. old Protectionist. This country can produce nine-tenths of what we require; it is a young country with immense possibilities, its whole destiny before it; and if any one who claims to be a true Australian takes up any other attitude than that I have indicated, .

Several times in the course of his remarks he declared that this country must be a self-contained one, and must build up its own industries; and yet, as I say, his speech in other parts seemed designed to meet the wishes of the majority of his colleagues, whose ideas, if carried into effect, would make such a result impossible. </para>

I shall quote price lists to prove that the honorable member is entirely wrong '. I do not wish to misrepresent him, but I cannot help thinking that he was expressing the views which he thought would be favoured by the majority of the people in his electorate, because he said that 'if he repre'sented a city constituency such, I presume, as. Melbourne Ports, he, too, would be all out for Protection.

                            <para>- It may be human, but the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is so staunch a Protectionist that if he were representing Wimmera he would still advocate Protection. I am a New Protectionist, but if I cannot get new Protection I shall take the old, in the hope that in the near future the party on this side of the House will be in office and convert the old Protection into the new. In the meantime, if we cannot get all we want, let. us take as much as we can. If the late war has. taught one lesson more emphatically than another, it is that we should embark on a policy that will make this country self contained, so that we may not be again left in the predicament in which we were during the five years of conflict. That lesson should have been taken to heart by even the rankest Free Trader in the country. No honorable member would be consciously opposed to the interests of his country, but I desire to point out to those honorable members who have advocated the lowering of our Tariff wall that their policy would lead us into certain disaster if wc were again in the circumstances which prevailed during the troublous years of war. One of the most pleasing features of this debate is the number of converts to the policy of Protection. </para>

                            <para>- One" cannot contemplate without amusement, the -fact of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> who was a pronounced believer in the Cobdenistic  doctrines, which  happily  are now being deserted by the big majority of the people, being to-day an advocate of Protection. Yet, it is only what is. to be expected after our war experiences. For that reason- the attitude of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory^, who does not seem to have moved with the times, is all the more deplorable. Whilst I contemplate with amusement .the change of front* by the Acting Prime. Minister and others I welcome it. So far from</inline> holding  them up to ridicule, I congratulate them on having seen the light. It is gratifying indeed, to find, both inside and outside Parliament,' that a number of the erstwhile believers in the superstition of Free Trade are now wholehearted Protectionists. I believe that the influence which, above all others, caused them to change their views was the experience we gained during the war, which taught the utter fallacy of not seeking to make ourselves a self-contained community. Personally, I have never held any other view,  notwithstanding that I have never represented  any  but a country constituency. When I represented the electorate of Indi, now represented by a member of the Country party, I won the seat because my opponent had " gone cold " on the accepted fiscal policy of this country, and the present member for that electorate can find only very cold comfort from the attitude of the party with which he is associated. However, that is his concern and not mine. So far, the debate has been of a very "general character, and  very  few items, except agricultural implements, have been singled out for detailed discussion. For that reason I shall speak principally of those articles this afternoon. Certain members of the Country party concentrated their attention upon agricultural implements, and their sole argument was that the lowering of duties would make the articles cheaper to the user, whilst an increase in duty would make them dearer. I propose to show that that contention is quite erroneous. I refuse to. concede the claim of honorable members in the corner that they are voicing the views of the people living in the country. </para>

                            <para>- The fiscal question had no bearing upon my loss of the seat. The issue was then an entirely different question, as is well-known. When I won the constituency Protection was one of the strongest planks in my platform-, but the honorable member indicates- by his interjections that if he were representing a country constituency in some other State he would alter his views; But, knowing the views of many of the men on the land, I feel it incumbent on me to disprove the. contention of those who, posing as the spokesmen of the coun'try people, say that they stand for Free Trade. That is an exploded notion. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has told us that a binder which was quoted at £80 last year was quoted at £120 this year, and he said that the effect of the proposed Tariff had therefore been to increase the price by £40. That statement was  absolutely misleading, as a reference  to the printed price-lists of the importing company will show. According to its pricelists' for September, 1920, this machine was quoted for delivery after- 1st January, 1921, at £125, but an Australian firm is now making a similar machine for £95, and the February quotation of the imported machine was £101, a reduction of £24, which was brought about by the competition of the Australian article. I challenge contradiction- in respect of these figures-, because I have made myself thoroughly conversant with, the facts, and know them to be correct. The- cost of the locally-made machine is therefore £6 less than that of the imported machine, thus, enabling the primary producer to save £30 on "the price charged for this machine before it was manufactured locally. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have the corroboration of the honorable member, who . represents an important farming community. Some members think that if they repeat their statements often enough those statements, however fallacious, become true. I, as a Protectionist, could never agree with the honorable member for Swan, who is a' Free Trader, on many things; but. neither of us can get away from the facts. When he and others who hold similar fiscal views declare that the imposition of a duty on agricultural implements, or on anything else, increases the price, they are making a statement which is not correct. It is in the interests of the primary producers that I advocate Protection, because I know that the- effect 'is to decrease prices by the competition thus created. A Protective  Tariff builds up our own industries, and frees us from the exploitation of foreign manufacturers' combines. </para>

                            <para>- No. But you cannot call, a Tariff Protective unless it really protects. The weight of evidence proves that Protection is in the best interests of the primary as well as of the secondary producer. The statement that Protection will crush the primary producers is a very old one. I am not sure whether the Minister went back to the 1906 figures to show that the Tariff of that year brought about the reduction of prices. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but it does not. affect my argument. I am showing that the .imposition of a duty did not increase the price of the machine, but, on- the contrary, lowered it materially. Then grain drills cost £87 l"0s. in 1906-7 and. £78 in the following year." Similar reductions were made after the passing of the 1906 Tariff in the prices of diamond harrows, disc ploughs, and chaffcutters. Let me now compare the prices of agricultural implements in a Free. Trade country with their prices in a protective country. If there were anything in the contention of the Free Traders, prices should be lower in the Free Trade country than in the protected country. Now the header thresher is sold in the Argentine, which is a Free Trade country, and in Australia, where there is a duty, by two American companies. I think this matter was referred to by the Minister when introducing the Tariff. He pointed out that these machines were dearer in the Argentine than in Australia. . Since then some writers in the press have declared him to be wrong. " Fact, not Fiction " </para>

                    <para>Was  the signature of one of these writers ; but the Minister's reply must have convinced that person that there was more fiction than fact in what he wrote. At any rate, we heard very little from him afterwards. A cablegram was sent to the Argentine by the Minister, and the reply showed that for the header reaper or header thresher, without the engine, the retail price in that country was 1,900 gold dollars, equivalent to£380, and for either machine with an engine the price was 2,650 dollars, equal to £530. The same machines were being sold without engines in Australia at the same time for £250. If, as our friends in the corner claim, the admission of these implements into a country free of duty has the effect of reducing their price, the primary producers of the Argentine ought to be living in a paradise as compared with the farmers of Australia; but the facts are all the other way. At any rate, in respect to agricultural implements the primary producers of Australia derive a considerable advantage by a margin of protection. I respect the opinions of my friends who sit in the corner, but I am unable to follow the devious methods they employ for the purpose of convincing others that the adoption of a Free Trade policy would be in the best interests of the Australian farmers. </para>

                            <para>-In America. One would think, to hear some honorable members talk, that the people in country districts were interested in nothing else but the duty on agricultural implements, whereas, as a matter of fact, they are interested in fully 70 per cent. of the items in this Tariff. For instance, they are interested in the very first item, the duty on ales and spirits. We must have barley for malting purposes. Would not the position of the man on the land with barley to sell be affected if we wiped out the duty on ales and spirits ? Some people talk about the duty on boots and shoes as if it were an item affecting only the. workers in factories ; but is not every man on the land interested in having a substantial protection on boots and shoes? It affects the skins and hides he sells. The man on the land is not only interested in agricultural implements. He benefits, also, by the protection afforded to the industries engaged in the manufacture of nearly three-fourths of the commodities covered by the Tariff. There is a hoary-headed statement, well worth repeating, that the interests of the primary producers are more highly conserved by a local market than by leaving them entirely dependent on foreign buyers; but if we allow our secondary industries to be crushed by exposure to the competition of cheap, foreign labour, we cannot have a good home market for our farmers. </para>

The honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> does not seem to agree with the statement which I have just read. Apparently we cannot expect very much cohesion , in the corner when the division is taken.

                    <para>I said a moment ' ago that the best market for the producers of this country is the local market. What the local market means to them is shown by the following figures relating to the local production and consumption for the years from 1914 to 1919 :- </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="095331192105063_20_2.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Of wheat we consume nearly 40 per cent, locally, of butter over 73 per cent., of cheese over 80 per/ cent., of mutton and lamb over 90 per cent., and of beef 75 per cent. of our production. These figures go to show the importance of the local market to our primary producers. During the period to which I have referred, we produced 55,000,000 bushels of cats, and actually consumed 58,000,000 bushels, so that we had to import to make good the shortage. We produced nearly 18,000,000 bushels of barley, and consumed 17,500,000 bushels. The percentage in respect of the production and local consumption of maize, hay, and potatoes is largely the same. I have taken these figures from the official statistics, and they go to show what the local market means to our primary producers. They go to show also what the local market maybe made to mean to them by a system which leads to the building up of our industries. </para>
                    <para>I have shown precisely where I stand in regard to the Tariff. . I am prepared to give a genuine measure of Protection to anything we can produce in this country, but anything that we cannot produce should be obtainable by us in the free markets of the world. </para>

                            <para>-Yes.I have already indicated that the policy for which the Labour party stands is that of New Protection. That would enable us to do what the honorable member suggests. I would go even further, and exhaust every means of getting at the cost of production abroad, and finding out exactly whether or not the prices charged for imported goods were exorbitant. Under the policy of New Protection, it would be impossible for a local manufacturer to exploit the people of this or any other country. That is the policy for which I stand. </para>

                    <para>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he proposed to appoint an Advisory Board to enable him to go into the manufacturing costs of various commodities, and thus to make it possible for him to protest the consumers. I am not a lawyer, but I offer the opinion for what it is worth - that this Parliament has at the present time considerable power to give effect to our New Protection proposals. I do not stand for the policy of protecting only one section of the community: I accept such a policy only because nothing more is offered to me by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly where I stand. in connexion with this matter. We have only a certain measure of Protection given to us by the Government'. As a believer in New Protection I have to  'Choose  -between the measure of Protection  offered  us and the policy of Free Trade. If I cannot get all I want, . I am going to take as much as is offered to me in the hope that the party in this House which stands for New Protection will be able to mould the Tariff into an effective instrument for the protection of producers and consumers alik«. Some of my honorable friends of the Country party have raised the objection . that by granting a higher measure of Protection we shall build up here combines that will be able to exploit the people. If I am to choose between two  sets  of combines - an importers' combine and a combine which is built ,up under a system of Protection such as the Government is offering us, then I prefer the local combine, although both are highly objectionable to me. We have a chance of dealing with combines in our own country, whereas we cannot hope to control those operating overseas. The fallacious argument has been advanced by some honorable members of the Country party that Free Trade does not expose a people to the vicious principles of a combine. The very worst form of trade combinations with which any country could be afflicted is that- of combines overseas. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will admit that circumstances have entirely changed since then, and that a Tariff which might have been entirely effective in 1906 would not be effective to-day. To vote against the measure of Protection that is offered us at the present time by the -Government would be. to leave Australia at the mercy of foreign combines. We could not be exposed to a worse form of combination. I cannot conceive of the people adopting any policy save that which will make us self-contained - a policy which will build up our  industries.  and by doing so will not only benefit our working men and the secondary producers of Australia, but provide the best form of market .we could have, a substantial home market, for our primary producers. 'Such a policy is in the interests of not only the secondary, but also the primary, industries of the country. </para>

                        <para>.- The remarks made by me on a previous occasion in regard to the ' price charged for binders have  been misunderstood. In September last while I was in Western Australia, a representative of those who sell binders told me. that he had sold a binder that week to a brother of mine for £-78 cash.- I said, " That is remarkable. We used to get binders for £40 and £45 each for some years before the war." " That is nothing," said the man, " I have' instructions from my principals 'that, on and after 1st January, 1921, this machine' is to-be sold at £120." That was the precise statement made to&gt; me by an agent who had his printed instructions at the back of his note-took. Several honorable members have tried ' to show that because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> V. McKay started to make this machine at £i00-r-others say £05 - the price of imported machines was reduced, and we (thus saved because pf the Tariff. But does that give the farmer much consolation, since before there was a Tariff, and no local competition, the price was .£7 ? The tendency ought to be for prices .to fall, because it was due to lie war that it rose to .£78. Now we are told that because of the Tariff the price of this machine is to be £120. Competition may bring it- back to £100, but there will still be a difference of £22. When a man has to pay for these articles with his own money, it takes something more than the mere book information of the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> to impress him. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to make some reference to the remarks of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> who took considerable pains to point out the small pay and long hours for labour in Japan, and how difficult it was for  a  manufacturer in Australia, under the con- *ditions of this country, to compete.  I  thoroughly agree with the honorable member; but I wish him to take a broader vision than is implied in the view that that argument applies only to secondary industries. The argument applies to primary industries just as much as it does to secondary industries. Japan grows one-third as much wheat as does Australia. While Australia's average per acre is 9.47 bushels, Japan's average is 18.27, with cheap labour. I am in competition with that country and other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>- That is immaterial; Japan is a competitor in the world's supply of wheat, even if she supplies only herself - her own supply is part of the world's supply. In the United States of America the average yield, per acre is 15 bushels, with an average freight of Hid. per bushel, while the freightage on Australian wheat is 4s. These figures are supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> himself, and they show a tremendous handicap on the Australian growers. Russia has an average yield of 12 bushels per acre, with  a  freightage of only about one-third that of ours. France has an average yield of 21 bushels, with scarcely any freightage at. all to the world's markets; and Germany has an average yield of 25 bushels, right in the centre of the world's markets, with cheaper labour than in the Argentine and elsewhere. How can primary producers be expected to face the <inline font-style="italic">world's</inline> competition in a Free Trade market, and buy their requirements in a Protectionist market? This business requires levelling up. The honorable member for Hindmarsh -made a reasonable statement when he said that he was against high duties on some items which would prove injurious to more important items and interests, but otherwise he was prepared to swallow the  Tariff "holus bolus." I agree with him in the contention that if a high duty on certain items will prejudice the production of more important items, the wise policy is to drop the burden on the smaller items. Now I ask honorable members whether wheat, in Australia, is a small or a large item? Are we not in competition with other parts of the world? Do not low wages elsewhere have as much to do with primary producers as with the secondary producers here in Australia? The argument applies all round, and some means should be devised to place the producers of Australia on a fair line of competition with other countries. </para>

                            <para>- The fact remains, and it can be shown in a hundred and one ways, that the primary producers, are 'desperately handicapped. America is beginning to appreciate the fact that, with higher wages and shorter hours in the large cities, people are leaving the country districts. I emphasize that fact, because a precisely similar condition of affairs prevails in Australia, and has been observed for the last twenty years. Something is wrong- when this drift takes place to such a marked extent. </para>

I was speaking on a ruling, given- by your deputy; and now that ruling is disagreed with. I have no intention at the present moment to speak on the first item exclusively, and therefore will satisfy myself with the remarks I have already made. I may say that my desire was rather to make those remarks by way of explanation. </para>
