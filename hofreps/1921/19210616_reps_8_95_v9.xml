                        <para>- It is stated in the South African newspapers, that the sending of unwholesome flour to that country from Australia recently was due, not merely to slipshod methods, but to the downright dishonesty of the exporters. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if inquiry has been made into the facts, and, if not, I ask that it may be made, so that the prestige of Australian exports may be maintained. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is under very serious consideration. Inferior flour was certainly sent to South Africa, but so far this is one of those cases in which nobody seems to he to blame. We are trying to get to the bottom of it, with a view to doing what the honorable member thinks should be done. I hope he will leave it at that for the moment. </para>

The recommendation contained in the interim report of the Royal Commission was that the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> and another vessel should be completed by the new Board of Control within the terms of their appointment. The. members of the Board are now at the Island, or are due there, and the sooner they can arrange to get men back to work the better I shall be pleased. </para>

The state of affairs disclosed is extraordinary,  in  view of our recent immigration legislation, and the campaign that has been launched  to  attract immigrants. Will the Acting Prime Minister cause inquiry to be instituted by the Immigration authorities, with a view  to  ascertaining the reason for the exodus  of  young men of whose services the country is so much  in  need? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the honorable member has asked the question, though I should have been better pleased had he given me notice  of it.  The facts that he has mentioned are  serious,  and are due, I think, to lack of organization. A number of young men came here from Great Britain, paying their own passages, but no arrangement was made for dealing with them on arrival. It was reported to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett,</inline> that a number of these immigrants were  in  very straitened circumstances  in  Sydney, and  it was  suggested that the Commonwealth Government should grant money for their relief. I agreed  to  the expenditure of £5,000, on the condition that the Government of New South Wales should make available the same amount, and wrote a minute for the information  of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> - this  was  before his departure for Great Britain - to the effect that the men should be looked after, and should not be allowed to starve in our cities. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly we are not, except in so far as we are responsible for the general condition of Australia. Nothing was done by the State Government of New South Wales, and last week I heard from the chaplain of one of the big church social organizations in Sydney that he was relieving a number of these immigrants, some of whom had wives and families, and had nothing to eat and no home to which  they could go. I have made available to  him £1,000 for the relief of those people. The whole scheme needs organization, and the great point is that we should take care that when immigrants come here there is an organization ready to receive them. There again we are up against our own limitations. The arrangement we made at the recent Conference in regard to immigration was that the Commonwealth would take full responsibility for the immigrants at the London end and attend to their passage to Australia, the States, on their part, undertaking to receive and deal with them on arrival, as is already being done by Western Australia and some of the other States. That was the division of work that was agreed upon, and I hope that the arrangement may soon be got into working order. There is, however, some little difficulty with the State Governments. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very important matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> and affects our reputation abroad and our immigration scheme most profoundly. I hope honorable members will believe that with our limitations and all the defects we have at present in regard to this organization, we are doing the best we can. We have the whole matter under review. I have already made £1,000 available for the relief of these cases, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> is now at work upon this very problem, and I hope we may soon find some solution for it. Meanwhile, he is developing his organization. It has been already launched in Victoria with very good prospects, and I see that a similar organization was launched in Sydney last Monday. I had promised to be present, but was unable to leave Melbourne. We are doing all we can to get the organization under way, but the obligation is on the States to undertake responsibility at this end, while we undertake the responsibility in London. If the States will not take the responsibility here we must, and will. In the meantime, I agree that, in our present circumstances, we shall do well to encourage the immigration of domestic servants and nominated immigrants. The latter is the best of all forms of immigration, because when the people arrive here after having been nominated by their friends, there is a place to which they can go and get something to eat until they can shift for themselves. That class of immigration is being developed already, and we expect 30,000 or 40,000 new arrivals next year through this medium alone. But that is only a trickle, and we must look to the larger tide of immigration in the immediate future. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst I realize that the electoral provisions of the Constitution can be amended only by the people themselves, I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, prior to the redistribution of seats in accordance with the new proportions of population in the different States, he will afford the House an opportunity of discussing what is known as the formula for ascertaining the quota, which is pronounced by experts to be altogether ineffective and inequitable. If that is done, I am certain the House will do no injustice to any State. All I am asking for is a fair deal for all the States, so that we may arrive at a formula that will be just to all concerned. </para>

Everything else was specifically excluded from the range of that aid.

I say, 'We are prepared to consider it; but we do not say with regard to public works other than the Murray River and the unification of railway gauge that we will provide the money.' In regard to the unification of gauge, we do say that we will provide the money. As far as developmental railways are concerned, I may remark that I shall look very favorably on them, because I do not think we can spend our money in any better way." </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                        replied that the Commonwealth Government was prepared to co-operate in all these public works undertakings to the extent of the mutual resources of the Commonwealth and State, but it could not go beyond that. He stated that the Murray Waters Scheme could be expedited, the Unification of the railway gauges undertaken, also any other public works that might be suggested, and upon which agreement might be arrived at. He also stated that the Commonwealth was prepared to cooperate to the fullest extent, because immigration was essential to the welfare and safety of Australia.

                        then pointed out that Queensland offered exceptional facilities for the settlement of the largest number of immigrants, and added that the Murray Water Scheme did not interest Queensland as a State. He intimated also that the same applied to the Unification of the railway gauges, because that would merely connect Brisbane with the border.

                        in May, 1921, stated that a promise was given at the July Conference between Federal and State Ministers that money would be advanced by the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the Burnett lands.
                    </para>
                    <para>The answer to this assertion is summed up in the explicit statement by the Prime Minister " that the Commonwealth Government would not undertake to give any assistance except in respect of the Murray River Water Scheme and the construction of a uniform gauge." </para>
                    <para>This had reference solely to immigration proposals. </para>

                    <para>To which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> replied - " That will come out of the £1,000 if the line is agreed to." </para>
                    <para>This £1,000 was the amount to be paid in respect of each settler, £625 being secured to the settler himself and the £375 being available to the States for the purpose of providing land. </para>
                    <para>Nothing was said that could be construed into a promise " that money would be advanced by the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the Burnett lands." </para>
                    <para>On the 15th November, 1920, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> wrote to the Prime Minister, stating that the ability of Queensland to absorb any number of immigrants depended upon the opening of further areas of land therein for settlement. He stated that there was a large tract in the Northern Burnett and Callide Valley districts suitable for close occupation, on agricultural areas, of many thousands of selectors, but that about £2,000,000 would be required for railway and road construction to adapt it for such purposes. This work would extend over three or four years, but, in the meantime, 1,500 men would be employed on the construction as soon as money was available. He added that if the Commonwealth Government would grant the State a loan of £2,000,000, to be used for the above purpose only, and to be drawn on as required, the Queensland Government could make a concrete proposal with regard to immigration. </para>
                    <para>The Premier further suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett,</inline> Director of Immigration, proceed to Queensland and go fully into the matter with the State authorities. </para>
                    <para>In reply to that letter, the Premier of Queensland was informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> would inspect the areas in question early in the" year 1921, and, further, that as soon as the report in the matter had been received the request for financial assistance would receive full consideration. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>Queensland representatives have expressed a not unnatural anxiety to receive some indication tending to justify the hope that undeveloped parts of their richly-endowed State might be made more accessible to new settlers. The Commonwealth Government sincerely desired to formulate some plan that could be initiated on practical and financially sound lines. This much was indicated by the Prime Minister at the commencement of the negotiations with the Government of the Northern State. The Superintendent of Immigration was sent to Queensland to report on the value of the Burnett country as a district for settlement. He carried out this duty, and the report was printed for the information of honorable members. </para>
                    <para>This action appears to be accepted ; by some critics as an admission on the part of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Government that it was committed to a scheme involving a loan of £2,000,000 to the Queensland Government. </para>
                    <para>The facts of the case surely demand no elaborate explanation. Queensland asked for £2,000,000 to be used in opening up undeveloped country. Admittedly, this was an admirable objective. But the Commonwealth Government desired to learn full details regarding the advantages to be gained in alloting £2,000,000. This would have been a natural procedure, even had the Commonwealth Government held ample funds for general purposes. But with a Treasury meeting heavy demands of an abnormal character, finance duly dominated the position. </para>
                    <para>The importance of the opportunity for development in the Burnett district has never been questioned -it cannot be questioned. But the fact cannot be ignored that Queensland is a State in which established railways cover wide areas of rich country, in which there is ample space open to prospective settlers. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Government regrets that it is not able to comply with the request submitted by the Queensland Government at the present time, as money is not available for the purpose. </para>

                        <para>.- When the discussion on this item was adjourned last night I was directing attention to the necessity of further protecting this industry, and I advised honorable members to inspect the factory" which has recently 'been erected in Melbourne. I have again visited the plant, and am impressed even more than I was on my first visit with its possibilities. In view of the unemployment prevalent in. our midst I am hopeful that it will be possible for the Government to provide adequate protection for this industry,, because I have been assured that if it is forthcoming, this company wil be prepared to employ 500 hands in connexion with the manufacture of metal. For the information of honorable members who were not in the chamber when the House adjourned, I desire to again direct attention to the interesting specimens of work exhibited in theQueen's Hall, which have been" manufactured from raw material produced in Australia, prepared by Australian workmen, and, in many cases, treated by Australianmachinery. An inspection of the factory will show that .work of a highly satisfactory character is being performed by machines manufactured in Sydney. Articles of various sizes can be manufactured, and in the hope that adequate protection would be provided under theTariff this firm has erected  a  factory covering, approximately, 2 acres,. <inline font-style="italic">saX</inline> a cost of between £20,000 «nd £30,000. The building has been erected on modern lines, and the company -only need fair protection to enable it to prosper. </para>

                            <para>- Sturtevant, Bedford; Proprietary Limited, of Lonsdale-street The firm is now occupying small premises, but hopes shortly to be occupying the new building which I have mentioned. If this and other industries are. given .sufficient protection there will be no necessity for sending away from this country hundreds of passengers who have arrived from the Old Country, as we have heard -of to-day. I am continually being interviewed by men seeking employment, and if our Australian industries are ade»quately protected these men will easily be absorbed. Since the present duties were imposed an award of the Arbitration Court has increased the wages bill by 20 per cent., and has also reduced the number of working hours. I do not desire at this juncture to discuss Arbitration Court, awards, but I am convinced that until the cost of living is reduced wages must remain, as they are to-day. When the machinery is installed, approximately £100,000 will have been invested in this particular industry, and it is only fair that the Government should come to its aid. Australian metals are used in the production of builders' brassware. The copper comes from Mount Lyell, the spelter from Broken Hill, the sheet brass from the Colonial Ammunition Company, and the tin from Mount Bischoff. All the machinery is manufactured in Australia. Quite recently the Repatriation Department called for tenders for 12,000 locks for War Service Homes, and, so far as one can gather, orders for only 600 were placed with Melbourne manufacturers. The bulk of the requirements in this direction were purchased from importing houses, which is conclusive proof that the present duties are inadequate. c </para>

                            <para>- I have these two locks before me. In comparing them, the man in the street, without practical knowledge, would say that the Japanese lock appeared to be all right, and was good enough. But the man who knows would compare the finish of the two. He would note the superiority of the Australian article, and perceive its greater durability. Price, however, would be the appealing factor with the uninformed individual. Naturally, the Japanese article is the cheaper, considering that the item of wage cost is almost negligible as compared with the same in Australia. </para>

Having had twenty-five years' experience in the building trade, I can say, although I do not set up to be an expert, that there is vastly greater value in the Australian product.

                        <para>.- I hope the Minister will accept the amendment. I thank the honorable member for Henty for having moved it, and for having so ably stated the case for the Australian makers. Having inspected the samples, I noticed an undoubted similarity, but I point out that the play of the Australian lock is more facile than that of the Japanese; also, that the spring which holds the bolt of the local- product in place is of brass, in keeping with the material of which the lock is made, whereas, in the Japanese bolt, the spring is of a cheaper metal. I can appreciate that there is hound to be a considerable difference in the selling price. I wish to- say, by the way, that in my criticisms, I do not desire to disparage Japan. Its people are the most artistic race the world has ever known. At the same time, our duty, as representatives of a white race, is first to Australia; and, even if the price of the imported line were less than half of that of the local production, we should support the Australian industry. One tremendous factor calling for our support is that all the material in the Australian lock is from Australian sources, that the machinery employed is Australian made, and that the workmen are Australians. </para>

That assertion was contradicted by the head of the War Service Homes, branch ;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie</inline> was told plainly that he was a perverter of the truth. Unfortunately for the veracity of the highly-placed Government official concerned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie</inline> had some of these lamps, in his own possession. An order was issued by the War Service Homes branch, for the return of all the Chinese lamps,, but some of them were not given up. They were missed, and their return was demanded. The lamps were only given, up, however, upon the Department issuing a receipt bearing the words to the; specific effect that the lamps were " Made&gt; in China." In the light of that incident one can understand that the War Services Homes Department would readily equip the soldiers' homes with Japanese goods. </para>

                        <para>. -  In the first place, this item deals with manufactures of metals n.e.i., and certainly covers the particular articles to which the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has referred. But I should be extremely sorry to be put through a catechism as to the additional articles which it covers. It embraces an immense range of articles, which vary both in the degree of manufacture that is involved in them and also in their values. The particular subject of the honorable member's remarks was brassware of one kind or another. I hope that he does not forget that very nearly as much labour is involved in the making of a steel bolt as is involved in the making of a brass bolt. It is true that there is a greater amount of labour requisite in the manufacture of a brass bolt than there is in the manufacture of an iron bolt, but the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty in both cases is the  same.  The duty upon the brass bolt, however, represents a far greater measure, of protection than it does upon. the iron holt, because we have to consider the value of the metal used' in each instance, and we all know that the value of the metal used in the manufacture of a brass bolt is very much higher than is the value of the metal used in the manufacture of an iron holt. The same remark is applicable to the still higher processes of manufacture. In the case of goods from foreign countries, the duty proposed, namely, 45 per cent., would be very high if we added 10 per cent. to it. I cannot see my way to increase the existing impost. If honorable members will look at the item, they will see that the duty upon it has been increased from 30 per cent., under the 1908 Tariff, to 45 per cent. under this Tariff. In all the circumstances the duties proposed appear to be sufficient to afford our local manufacturers a reasonable chance of competing successfully with the manufacturers overseas. I know that the industry is almost an entirely new one. Prior to the war its operations were almost of a negligible character, but since then it has made wonderful strides in. many directions, not merely in the manufacture of the articles of which the honorable member for Henty has spoken, hut also in the manufacture of locks. Then there is the brass metal, and other metal industries which are being established all over the country. It seems to me that the duties set out in the schedule are quite sufficient to enable our manufacturers to successfully carry on their operations. I ask the honorable member for Henty to accept those duties, because they cover a vast number of articles other than those which he has enumerated. </para>

                            <para>- It only bears its name. The Minister has confessed that he was almost ashamed to say that our Australian manufacturers are frequently asked to keep the brand, " Made in Australia," off the articles which they produce, because of the public prejudice against goods of local manufacture. Unfortunately that is true. If we have no regulations under which imported articles must bear the name of their country of origin, it is time that our Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act was amended in that direction. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am very glad that the Minister for Trade and Customs has intimated the intention of the Government to amend the Act in question. As I interjected when the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> was speaking, I do not think that that Statute applies to the case to which he has referred, and, as. a result, the Australian article has suffered severely. The intention of the Commerce Act was to enlighten the public as to what they were buying, and there is ample room for a substantial extension of it, so as to cover cases of this kind. I regret, with some of my honorable friends who have addressed the Committee, that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> cannot see his way to give some further assistance to this industry. He has rightly said that this particular item, "Manufactures of metal n.e.i.," has a vast range. I admit that it has, and from that stand-point his argument is difficult to answer. If, however, the honorable gentleman is satisfied that any department of industry, such as. that of brassware, covered by the item is entitled to special encouragement, there is nothing to prevent him from breaking up the item and giving to that department of the industry such further encouragement as he thinks proper. It is unnecessary to repeat the arguments which have already been advanced, but I would point out to the Minister that when he introduced the Tariff, some twelve months ago, he was satisfied that the brassware industry and other like enterprises were entitled to the percentages of protection set out in the schedule. The very object that he had in fixing these schedule rates was to give them the encouragement they required. If the value of those duties has since been substantially reduced, then we who are enacting this Tariff legislation at the present time must take cognisance of that depreciation. If, when the schedule was introduced last year, 35 per cent. was sufficient, a greater percentage must now be necessary; </para>

                            <para>- But, instead of wages in the brassware industry going- down, they have actually increased 20 per cent. since this schedule was presented. That being so, the industry to-day is not getting 25 per cent. by way of protection. Whilst I admit the force of the Minister's argument as to the <inline font-style="italic">omnium gatherum</inline> character of this particular' item, yet there is a means of compassing the difficulty; and if he cannot see his way now to give additional encouragement to the brassware industry, he may, after further investigation, entertain a proposal for an in creased duty when the Tariff is before another place. </para>

                            <para>- The brassware industry in Australia is only in its infancy, but it is of very great value to the Commonwealth. Exhibits of its products have been made within the precincts of the House. Many thousands of pounds have been sunk in starting the industry, and we should not overlook the fact, since it has been demonstrated that it cannot carry on in face of the competition from Japan and elsewhere. The Minister should further investigate the matter, and, if necessary, break up the item so as to afford the increased protection sought. </para>

                        <para>. -  We have taken clumps and leads out of item 212, in which they appeared in the old Tariff, and included them in this item. I propose to return them to item 212, under which they will be free of duty if of British origin, and subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 5 percent. (intermediate) and 10 per cent. (general), for the following reason :  -It was represented to us that the manufacturers were prepared to make clumps and leads in Australia. For that reason we included them in this item, thus making them dutiable. They now tell us that they cannot manufacture those articles here unless we grant them an increased duty, and this we do not propose to do. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell),</inline> who is at present engaged on a deputation, asked nae to refer to this item. According to my information, " The manufacture of clumps and leads is a different and distinct industry from type founding or casting of type, and in the United Kingdom no type-founder makes his own clumps or leads." I hear also that the whole of the type-making industry is in the hands of a tremendous American Trust, which is not only dealing with the type-makers of England by getting them into their fold, but is also beginning to deal with the Australian industry. If that is so, the request of the Australian manufacturers for an increase in the general rate, where it does not strike at anything British, is very modest. During the debates on this schedule those who desire to create Australian industries have said that they would rather have trusts here than outside, because they could deal with them here; but in this case, if the facts submitted are correct, an Australian industry is in imminent danger of being crushed by a Trust over which we have no control. </para>

                        <para>. - The statement made by the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> places the whole question in quite a new light. The Americans are doing their best to make their trade in many lines as world-wide as possible. It would be remarkable to me if we could not manufacture these articles in a big lead-producing country like this. We produce the lead and antimony in Australia, and it seems strange that we cannot supply the demand for the commoner articles used in the printing trade. A clump is merely a piece of lead made to various sizes, while a lead may be described as a thin strap of lead not quite type high, which is usually placed between the lines of type, although the linotype machine puts what is known as a "beard" upon each line, thus dispensing with the need for this separate piece of lead between the lines. Honorably members may have noticed that the leading article of a newspaper is usually printed in larger type, with more space between the lines, due to the insertion of the lead referred to. All circular printing, book printing, and work of that nature is treated in much the same way. Metal furniture should also be easy to manufacture, because all that is required is a mould into which the lead is poured, and afterwards cut off into the lengths required. The operation is so simple that it is evident the manufacturers here have not entered into the business more extensively because of the danger to be apprehended from American competition. This, I think, must be the reason for the request for a further protection. I can understand the Minister's disappointment at this request, because I presume that eighteen months ago - just prior to the introduction of the Tariff - the manufacturers suggested what they thought would be a fair duty, and evidently they came to the conclusion that 22½ per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent. would be sufficient protection against the American Combine. But conditions have so altered since then that this protection has in some measure been wiped out. I am anxious that the raw material for these articles should be turned into the finished product in Australia, because our printing houses use thousands of tons of lead material in the shape of clumps, furniture, leads, and quads every year. We obtain a good deal of our requirements from Great Britain; but it seems strange that we should have to send the raw material 12,000 miles by sea to England, and bring the finished product back to Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- It is my intention to move to amend the item by increasing the British duty to 35 per cent. Those engaged in this industry in Australia have had a big struggle against a great deal of opposition, particularly from the American manufacturers, who are employing their well-known methods to destroy the local industry in order that they may have a clear run of the market. The Australian manufacturers are selling their type at prices considerably less than those at which we have been able to purchase outside. I can speak from experience, because I have been associated with the co-operative movement in my own State, and I know that we have been able to get almost everything we required at reasonable prices. There is a gentleman in Australia acting as foreign and InterState correspondent for one concern that has not the welfare of the Australian industry at heart. This organization has issued a circular in which it invites the trade to endeavour to secure a considerable reduction in the existing duties on this item. This shows that even in Australia itself there are those who are endeavouring, in connexion with this particular industry, to bring about a reduction of the duties by which it is protected. After setting out the need for a reduction of duties, and dealing with the question of the serious injury to the import trade which the local industry represents, the circular to which I refer reads - </para>

Apart from any communication you may make to your political representatives, I should esteem it a favour if you would give me your views on this matter at your early convenience, for the confidential information of my principals. </para>

                    <para class="block">That circular is signed by T. D. Chataway, who, I understand, at one time occupied the position of a member of the Senate. That is the kind of opposition which the local industry has to meet. I have said that prices in Australia are less than the prices of English and American imports at the present moment; but a circular has been issued by a representative of one of the American firms in Australia in which the statement is made that they are prepared to sell type at a 50per cent. reduction on present prices. The firm carrying on the industry in Australia pays all the wages they are called upon to pay; and I may inform the Committee that 55 per cent. of the selling cost of type is paid in wages which are spent in Australia. In spite of this, the local industry is called upon to enter into competition with American firms that are prepared to agree to a reduction of 50 per cent. on present selling prices in this country. I mention, further, that everything used in the production of type locally is of Australian manufacture. Here, again, the local industry is placed at a very great disadvantage in connexion with the cost of the material it must use. In the </para>

                        of the 10th instant, I find that lead is quoted in Melbourne at £30 per ton, and tin at £224 per ton. In England, the price of lead is given at £22 17s. 6d. per ton, and the price of tin at £167 12s. 6d. Honorable members will see the great advantage which these lower prices for material give to the makers of type overseas. I ask the Minister to agree to an increase in these duties, and to retain in the item the two articles which he proposes to take out of it. It  is  true that representatives of the local firm approached the honorable gentleman some time ago, with a view to extending their operations, and becoming in a position practically to supply the whole of the requirements of the trade in Australia. On their representations, the Minister agreed to include in the item one or two articles which he now proposes  to  strike out of it, on the ground that the firm has not already started to manufacture these particular articles. The reason for this is obvious. It is of no use for the firm to undertake to put in the machinery essential for the manufacture of these particular articles when the industry they have already established is confronted with the disabilities to which I have referred. It is not reasonable to expect this firm to spend thousands of pounds upon the installation of the machinery essential to make these articles when they realize that their present industry is seriously attacked by outside competition. I have the authority of a representative of the firm for saying that, if these duties are made such as to protect the local industry against outside competition, they will be quite prepared to manufacture these particular articles that have been referred to, and to place themselves in a position to supply the whole of the requirements of the trade in Australia.

                        <para>. - I hope the Committee will not accept the amendment. In this Tariff I have raised the general rate already by 10 per cent. Importations under this item have in 1919-20 fallen off from £12,024 in 1913 to £4,499. Ever since this Tariff was tabled the figures of importation have included in this item clumps and leads, which were not included in it under the 1913 importation figures in the old Tariff. In the circumstances, it appears to me that the duties proposed are sufficient. </para>

I  ask  him the difference between a dog trap and a vermin trap. In my opinion, the dog is the most destructive of all vermin, and annually destroys stock worth millions of pounds. The proposal to tax dog traps is comparable in stupidity with that to put a tax on arsenic. The people of Australia need the easiest and cheapest  facilities for  getting rid of pests.

                    <para class="block">The  Minister's proposal is far from satisfactory. Its needless to repeat now what was said the other day, during the discussion on another item, concerning the loss to our primary producers caused by vermin. There are districts which would have to be given up entirely were not huge sums expended on fencing out and on trapping vermin, this expenditure being often greater than the rental paid.. The Minister has promised to make dog traps dutiable as vermin traps at 5 per cent. and 10 per cent., if imported from any other country than great Britain; but he insists that rabbit traps shall be dutiable at 20, 30, and 40 per cent. I would remind him, however, that, generally speaking, it is the big man who suffers from the depredations of dogs, and that the tax on rabbit traps will fall more particularly on the small holders. It is absurd to say that the manufacturers of these traps need the protection of a duty of 40 per cent. Every member who knows anything of country conditions will oppose this hampering of the man out-back. Many such men are holding country on which they barely make a living, because they lose in one year what they have gained in the preceding year. </para>

                            <para>- The same honorable members who passed item 219, tools of trade for the use of artisans and mechanics, at duties ranging . from nil to 10 per cent., are now supporting duties of 20 to 40 per cent. on the tools of trade employed by rabbit trappers. I object to this differentiation. The worker in the country should be treated in the same way as the worker in the city. The Committee has already imposed a duty on wire netting, altheugh it and dog traps and rabbit traps are essential to the man outback. I hope honorable members will realize the injustice that is being done to the man on the land by imposing these high duties of 20 percent., 30 per cent., and 40 per cent. on dog and rabbit traps. I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of bringing these articles under item 221, so that they may bo admitted free from Great Britain, with a general Tariff of only 10 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Nobody will convince me that duties of from 20 to 40 per cent. on rabbit traps are needed at the present time. Honorable members say that the prices of traps are falling, but I doubt if they have ever been higher than they are to-day. I should like the Minister to explain what has actuated him in imposing such a high duty. Is the cost of production more than twice what it was before the war? This is not merely a question of giving assistance to the big pastoralists; hundreds of men are earning their, living by trapping rabbits, and the more they can trap the better for the community. </para>

The comparison is not fair, because to-day the whole world is upset, and conditions are different from those existing in pre-war days.

The troublo is that the farmers will not be fair in return for the fairness they received from other sections of the community during the war. The manufacture of rabbit traps will mean the employment of some people, and the more we employ the  more  there will be to consume the wheat and wear the wool produced by the man on the land. </para>

                            <para>- The duty necessary to. protect an industry from foreign competition is. always worth while. The sheep-grower regards the rabbit as a curse, but the hat-maker considers it a blessing, because it supplies him with the fur for his industry, whilst those who conduct refrigerating plants and export meat also are grateful for the rabbit, and some people  are  wondering whether it or the sheep is the greater asset to Australia. I agree that up to a point the rabbit is a pest to the sheep-growers, but in' the country I have been glad to share with a farmer a rabbit caught for his own food. </para>

                        <para>.- In framing this Tariff the Government should. have been prepared to admit free of duty anything that would assist the country in destroying a pest. The Government established a Department of Health, and are carrying out special investigations in the north for the purpose of abating some of the plagues to which the country is heir, and all this is being done at the public expense. Again, the State Governments are spending enormous sums of money to combat the rabbit pest. Western Australia built a rabbit-proof fence over 1,000 miles in length to stay the invasion of rabbits from the east, and when that failed built other fences for the same purpose. Every honorable member is aware of the. grave injury done by these rodents, and the placing of a heavy duty on an article that helps to keep them in subjection is absurd. I sincerely hope that the Committee will insist that rabbit traps be admitted free of duty, and I shall make the same request when we are dealing with sheep dip and insecticides for use iu orchards. Those things are of immense value to the country. I cannot understand the Minister, who is a country representative, placing a duty of 40 per cent. upon rabbit traps. </para>

                            <para>- Surely we should learn something from the lessons taught by the war. While it was on we could not get traps, and rabbits were overrunning the country. Then three or four firms started to manufacture traps in the Commonwealth. But honorable members in the Corner now say that they do not care how those men came to the  relief  of the farmer ; their money must be thrown into the gutter, and their industry must be left to fight against foreign competition. Then when war happens again they will expect other firms to come to their rescue by producing locally the things they require. Is that a fair proposition? It is a short-sighted policy.

                            <para>- I increased the general duty on these traps because during the war the whole of that business was lost by Great Britain. The importation figures show that the whole of the business has been taken by British competitors. I do not mind making the general rate 30  per  cent. if honorable members wish it ; but, in view of the fact that these people came to our rescue during the war, and established works on a big scale, enabling them to turn out all the traps that Australia can use, the British rate should be, at least, 20 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I have cut out the dog traps altogether, because they are not made here, and these people propose to confine their operations to rabbit traps. It is not an unreasonable rate. The process of manufacture is comparatively simple, machinery being largely employed, but a fair quantity of labour  is  required in assembling. It passes  my  comprehension that members representing country interests, forgetting the bitter experience of the past, should be prepared to throw to the wolves those who came to their rescue in a period of stress and difficulty. An honorable member talks about cheapness. The first consideration in the question of developing any fiscal policy is security, cheapness coming in afterwards. </para>

                            <para>- There is no reason why they should not have got all the traps they required. The making of a rabbit trap is not a difficult matter, and there is no justification for the imposition of this heavy duty. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has treated the Committee with the greatest possible courtesy, and has extended the utmost consideration to the views of others and appreciation of their arguments. Therefore I appeal to him to be merciful, and to consider the sufferings of the very large numbers of people engaged in farming and grazing pursuits  in Australia -numbers  which, I regret to say, are steadily diminishing because of the heavy burdens being placed on this section of the community, and because of the lack of adequate consideration shown to their needs. During the last few minutes I have heard views expressed by honorable members opposite which indicate that they are not fully seized with the serious nature of the devastation caused by rabbits. The inference has been made that the existence of large numbers of rabbits is beneficial because they supply food and skins. I admit that when rabbits are trapped or shot their carcasses may be used for food and their skin for fur, or for the raw material used in hat making. This to some extent is a mitigation of what is otherwise a terrible affliction upon the Commonwealth. But this fact provides the strongest possible argument in favour of the removal of a duty which may result in making it unpayable to trap rabbits.We cannot exterminate the rabbits, but there is an enormous advantage in trapping them, and thus securing the carcasses and the skins, as against adopting the purely destructive policy of poisoning them. </para>

                            <para>- Closer settlement, of which members of the Country party are the strongest advocates, is a. most excellent preventive against the spread of rabbits, or any other pest; but the rabbit question has a most important bearing upon closer settlement, especially upon the settlement of soldiers on country lands. On one large estate I visited a few years ago in search of grass for sheep during a drought period I saw enormous numbers of rabbits. There was a sufficient amount of grass, but I remarked to my manager, when I decided to put my sheep there, that I felt confident we could not keep them there for more than three or four months. The rabbits on the property were very numerous, because at that time it did not pay to trap them exhaustively. This estate was subsequently bought for. the settlement of soldiers. It was exceedingly valuable land, with a good rainfall, and the prospects were favorable, save in one respect, the prevalence of rabbits. Last week I inquired as to the progress made by the soldiers who had bought the land, paying a price which would not have been unreasonable if there had been no rabbits. I was informed that they were not doing too well, and when I asked if they had got rid of the rabbits, the reply was, " No; they are the trouble." In regard to the duty upon rabbit traps, I ask the Minister to make some concession upon the British rate of duty.  I  know that he is prepared to make some concession in regard to the general rate, but the proposed duty of 20 per cent. on. British-made traps is too high. The discussion on this item has made it apparent that the imposition of heavy duties on rabbit traps is a very serious matter to all engaged in the farming and grazing industry. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> reconsider his decision, and amend the rates to 10 per cent. British, 20 per cent. intermediate, and 30 per cent. general? </para>

But I am also anxious to assist those people on the land whose properties have been devastated by the ravages of rabbits. In my own electorate, and in those represented by the other members of this party, there are thousands of settlers who are fighting day and night to protect their properties against rabbits and other pests. In some instances the burden has been so great that settlers have been driven off the land, and they are already increasing the numbers of people in our over-populated cities. Will the Minister agree to my suggestion ? </para>

                            <para>- There has been no concession or reduction in the British rate. The bulk of the rabbits trapped can be used commercially, and we should encourage the trapping industry rather than allow the rabbits to be poisoned, because the carcasses arc then of no use to any one. Even if it means remaining here late, I shall not neglect my duty by allowing this item to pass without raising a strong protest against such high duties. I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision in view of the cogent arguments which have been adduced. </para>

                            <para>- A large number of people in the country producing foodstuffs are not even paying expenses, and it is the duty of the Government to protect their interests. The cost of erecting wire netting fences on small areas of from, say,  200  to  800  acres, is more per acre than on larger areas. I would now point out that any extra cost of rabbit traps, or of rabbit trapping, must fall much more heavily upon small landowners than upon the owners of large estates, The owner of, say,  10,000  acres in one solid block will have comparatively little difficulty in protecting his property from rabbits by erecting a wire-netting fence all round it. But the smaller the area the greater the cost per acre incurred in wire netting. Consequently, a large number of settlers on small holdings cannot afford to protect their properties by completely enclosing them with rabbit-proof netting, because it adds to the cost per acre of the land. Therefore, they have almost entirely to rely upon trapping. I have already detained the. Committee longer than I intended, and. I now make a final appeal to the Minister to amend the rates in the direction I have suggested. </para>

                        <para>.- It is difficult to know, in following the arguments of the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),whether</inline> he is speaking as representative of the disappearing constituency of Grampians or as a prospective candidate for some metropolitan seat. I do not care, personally, whether the matter at issue is rabbit traps or not. With me, the question is, " Is this article, necessary as it is for use in Australia, to be made in this country or not? " Does the honorable member for Grampians desire the importation of rabbit traps from overseas ? </para>

                            <para>- Of course, these simple things ought to be turned out in Australia as easily as anywhere else, and there is no reason why they should not be made here to cater completely for Australian requirements. But, if honorable members desire rabbit traps to be made in Australia, let them agree to a duty which will permit these things to be turned out here, and overthrow foreign competition. If an honorable member were to say that there should be no duty at all, I could appreciate his view-point; but, when he advocates a duty as low as  10  per cent., it is obvious that he does not favour a Protective Tariff, but wants a revenue Tariff. He wants to impose so low a duty that it will not protect the Australian manufacturer, but will encourage the importation of foreign products - which, however, will be required to pay a heavy revenue tax. Why should any one take up such an absurd position? </para>

If honorable members desire Protection, the rates' of duty must be high enough to really and adequately protect, at the same time having regard, however, to the price which the people must pay for the goods. ' I consider that the Minister has gone far enough, and I hope he will not, either now or upon any occasion, agree to less than a rate of 20 per cent. For a duty less than that is not protective, but is merely revenue productive. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> has apparently missed a most important point. It is involved in the consideration of what is the least expensive method of destroying rabbits. Poisoning and the trap are the means most commonly employed. But poisoning is the most wasteful. It not only destroys the rabbit as an asset after its destruction, but it is destructive to the natural life of the bush generally. The use of the poison cart has cost Australia hundreds of thousands of pounds, if not millions. </para>

                            <para>- Sometimes poisoning is the most effective way ; but if effectiveness is the sole objective, the best method of all is to poison the water. That settles the rabbit, but everything else also, at the same time. The poison cart has been the means of almost exterminating bird life in parts of Australia. It has had the effect of tremendously increasing the blowfly pest, and it has added to our troubles with grasshoppers. There are many factors which operate in upsetting the balance of nature; but nothing has been so ruthless in that direction as the poison cart. By its use not only is the carcass of the rabbit itself wasted, but the balance of nature becomes seriously disturbed, if not locally overthrown ;- and that balance is the only certain safeguard of the man on the land. The trap may not be as destructive as poison; but it does not destroy the 'natural enemies of the rabbit and the various other pests which burden the producer. The rabbit trap is the small man's weapon. Netting, which is becoming ever more expensive, is the means adopted by the large holder for ridding his land of rabbits. Not only is the trap the main asset of the small holder in keeping down the pest, but it is the means adopted by thousands of children throughout Australia of bringing in a little pocket-money while assisting to rid their neighbourhood of rabbits; and it is similarly the means of providing employment for large numbers of men in the off seasons. The poison cart takes away the opportunity for young people to make a little money, and for the working man in the country to make a living during the dull periods. If .the Minister insists upon the rates set forth in the schedule he will be conferring undue advantage upon the poison cart. It is highly necessary that we should, as far as possible, restore the balance of nature. An old resident of New .South Wales, who has been writing to the papers for many years upon this subject, has established a sanctuary on his own extensive property in an effort to restore the depleted bird life and native fauna. He will not permit a poison cart anywhere near his run, yet, I am told, he is the least troubled by rabbits among all the landowners in his district. If all holders were to follow the advice and example of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott,</inline> they would not be troubled with the vermin and other pests which so handicap the man on the land to-day. There is a prominent resident of Melbourne who has also long given consideration to the subject of the restoration of the balance of nature. He has practically spent his life in working out problems having to do with the extermination of rabbits and the like, and he is bitterly opposed to the poison cart. In the matter under discussion there is not only involved the question of the rates of duty to be fixed upon rabbit traps, but there is this additional consideration: </para>

                    <para class="block">That any difference made in the cost of applying the two methods of destruction will go a long way towards further increasing the disabilities from which Australia is now suffering. If the Minister intends to accept or move an amendment, I hope it will be in the direction of according greater preference to Britain. In the course of the Tariff debate I have already urged more generous measures of preference towards the United Kingdom, and I have suggested that, if necessary, the duties in respect of foreign products should be increased. With its wide variety of climatic conditions, the Empire is capable of becoming self-supporting. Australia is not, and never can be, self-supporting. No single country, indeed, which sets out in that direction can become anything but a failure. </para>

                        <para>-Last week, when debating the duties upon wire netting, I spoke of the devastation caused by rabbits in the north-west of Tasmania and parts of Victoria. I do not propose to repeat those remarks, but I earnestly ask the Minister to accede to a reduction in the rates of duty upon rabbit traps. Of what importance is an industry - if it can be so called - engaged in the manufacture of rabbit traps compared with the welfare of agriculture and grazing throughoutAustralia? I fear that the Minister and many honorable members do not realize the menace of the rabbit pest. Had their experience been such as mine, they would perceive how  really  trivial is the question whether or not rabbit traps can be or should be profitably made in Australia. The cry of honorable members is, " Give Australian industry a chance." I say, " Give Australian pioneers a chance, and do not talk about the manufacturer every time you speak of Australia." I said, by interjection just now, that I did not care where rabbit traps came from so long as we got them cheap. I repeat that with all seriousness. What does it matter who makes the weapon with which we fight and try to overcome the menacing rabbit pest? I do not care whether the rabbit trap which I use to save my holding is made in Japan, or in Germany, or in some other world, in fact. It is our chief weapon of offence against Australia's worst scourge. In many parts, the man on the land is faced with ruin. We must use the trap, and the poison cart, and wire netting, too. We have already put on wire netting a very high duty, which was not justified in any sense. I am now offering my little plea against a further increase on the other weapon which we must use for the destruction of rabbits. I ask the Minister to give favorable consideration to our request. I have supported him on every occasion when those on the Opposition benches have asked him for an increase, and I do expect him to give some consideration to the people for whom I am speaking. </para>

                            <para>- No; but trapping by itself is not much good as a means of getting rid of the pest. We have had experience in Australia regarding the industry of manufacturing rabbit traps. The effect of making this duty  10  per cent. would simply be to turn it into a revenue duty, and the industry would go out of existence. </para>

                        <para>Without a duty local manufacture is impossible except for just a month or two as at present, while there is a dearth of imported traps. My reason for making this assertion is based on the experience of a few years ago. At that time a local factory was established, but the venture was disastrous, because makers abroad dumped traps into Australia at a price which made it quite impossible for the Australian firm to compete, and when it had been defeated, prices were, of course, raised. </para>

                            <para>- I feel that, with the experience we have had, we cannot agree to reduce this duty if we have any real desire to see Australia put in a position to protect itself in all circumstances. I cannot believe that a duty of 20 per cent, can result in any increase in the price of rabbit traps, with several makers manufacturing in this country. The duty is moderate. I am prepared to take out dog traps, and to make the foreign duty 30 per cent. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister's reply to the common-sense arguments that have been used has been simply a repetition of the answers he has given all through the piece to reasonable demands made by reasonable members. We have given him a very fair go so far as the Tariff is concerned. Everywhere outside one can hear it said that the people are going protection mad. I am a Protectionist, but many of the items to which the Committee have agreed represent, not protection at all, but extreme prohibition. An instance of that is the duty of 45 per cent, on a reaper and binder, which is one of the most useful necessities that a man can have on a' farm; and another instance is the duty of 68s. British, S4s. intermediate, and 105s. general, per ton on wire-netting. </para>

                            <para>- The items to which I refer are closely connected with, this item, which puts an almost prohibitive duty on imported traps. Rabbit traps were manufactured here for years in the past, and sold for a paltry 8s. 6cl. per dozen, and even then the makers made money. They are the implements of trade for hundreds of people, who have made a' very fine living at trapping. In 1917-18, the exports of rabbits, taking eight rabbits to the sheep, were equal, to 3,288,579 sheep. That shows what a good industry it is to the trapper. We must also remember the losses suffered by the man on the land through the destruction caused by rabbits. Hundreds of people throughout the "Commonwealth who are now idle could be well employed in trapping rabbits. Trappers have made up to £6, £8, and £10 per week. A good trapper can manage about 100 traps. The lifetime of a trap is only about one season, taking into account losses and other causes. Of the two industries, the manufacture of traps, which the Minister is so anxious to foster, and the destruction of the rabbit pest, the latter is far greater, and of much greater importance, and employs many more hands. If we handicap the man on the land in the way proposed, the population of our capital cities will increase in a still greater ratio than it has done in the past. The penalizing effects of the imposts which we are placing on wire netting and rabbit traps will make it practically impossible for any person to live in the outlying parts adjacent to rabbit-infested country. We have heard  with great regret how the rabbits have taken possession of Gippsland. They caine in there only comparatively recently, and honorable members can picture the lot of the Gippsland farmer, who is penalized to the extent of £100 per mile to fence his property, and is now to be further penalized by the fact that the rabbiter will not be able to purchase traps in consequence of the price that they will be put up to. All through the piece the amusing argument has been put forward that these excessive duties are going to reduce prices. That has not been my experience in the past, nor do I think it has been the experience of many other members. I am convinced, speaking on behalf of the man on the land in particular, that by imposing penalizing duties of the kind now before us, we shall do the country tenfold more harm than good. </para>

                            <para>-We want traps to eradicate the pest. An effort was made to start the industry thirty years ago, but the market was flooded, and the firm which had begun to make Australian traps was completely wiped out, so that up to the time of the war all the traps used here were imported. When the war began we had to fall back on our own resources, with the result that a factory has been established, machinery has been installed, and men have been trained to make these very important articles. The factories buy their steel and wire from Australian makers. Surely we are not going to take the advice of the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell),</inline> and say that we do not care where the traps come from so long as we can get them cheap? Such a policy could be applied to every industry in the Commonwealth, and we should then have hundreds of thousands of men out of work. I do not say that the Corner party believe in that sort of thing. No matter whether an industry is large ' or small, we must consider the principle of establishing it in our midst. If this industry is killed we have no guarantee as a Parliament that the price of rabbit traps will not b§ increased simply because the local competition has been beaten. Our experience is that the importer will regulate the market to get the highest price possible for his article. The reduction of this duty would not mean cheap rabbit traps. If local competition were destroyed, farmers and others who use rabbit traps would be in. the hands of the importers, who could enter into a Combine to regulate prices, and charge what they pleased. It is rather curious that honorable members of the Country party should be putting up a strenuous fight on this relatively unimportant item, seeing that far more important items were allowed by them to go&gt; through yesterday, notwithstanding that they were of great moment to the primary producers. I do not think that farmers and graziers will appreciate this display on the part of the Country party, who assert that pastoralists and others will be ruined if a duty of 20 per cent, be put on rabbit traps. That is all moonshine. </para>

I can sympathize with the desire of the man on the land that the cost of agricultural machinery and implements should be kept as low as possible, but this is such a. relatively small item that I fail to understand the attitude of my honorable friends of the Country party. We have to consider the position of the' manufacturer of rabbit traps in Australia and the men who have been trained in the industry established by him. </para>

I invite the honorable member to say what education is necessary in this regard seeing that all the parts of a rabbit trap are cut out by a machine. The process is as simple as shelling peas. The Minister also spoke of this as an "industry." I prefer to speak of it as a business. We do not want a permanent rabbit-trap making industry in Australia. What we want is to exterminate the vermin. </para>

                            <para>- But the conditions are different. My honorable friend can make black appear as nearly white as possible when he is showing that he is the friend of the farmer and also the friend of the city dweller, who is not always acting in the best interests of the man on the land. The Minister gave away his whole position in regard to this item when he said that one factory for the manufacture of rabbit traps had been established here, and that the proprietor of it had told him that it was impossible to make a success of it in the face of the present competition, because the business was exceedingly erratic. Undoubtedly it is erratic, because the vermin are at times more troublesome than at others; and there is no reason why we should endeavour to establish a permanent industry which is subject to such erratic conditions. There is no getting away from the fact that this increased duty will mean for all time an increased price for rabbit traps. </para>

                            <para>- The manufacturer who seeks this duty of  20  per cent. says that it is essential, because he cannot cope with the existing competition. I am proud to admit that the duties imposed to encourage a good many industries in Australia have ultimately led to reduced prices; but, according to the expert who asked the Minister to impose this duty it is impossible to establish a successful and continuous industry of rabbit trap making. If that is so, why impose this big duty?Some of my honorable friends opposite are familiar with the ravages of the dingo, the fox, and the rabbit. They know that in many parts of Australia the man on the land finds his work being destroyed night and day by these , pests. They know that both the rabbit and the dingo drove everything before them in the western districts of New South Wales many years ago. Their ravages were worse than those of a drought. Hardly a head of stock was left in many districts. And yet we are asked to impose this duty to support what is a mere pretence at an industry. I will fight this item to the last ditch, and, if it is. passed, I will do my best to bring about its rejection by another place. We ought to display some common sense; but it seems to me that this is about the worst example we have had of Protection run mad. </para>

                        <para>.- Although one can well understand the attitude taken up by strong Protectionists, I want to make it plain that in this case a new principle is involved. Every one knows that Australia, a virgin country when first occupied by white men, has been particularly subject to a number of plagues. The worst of these is the prickly  pear, and then come the dingo, the rabbit, the fox, and other pests. I think that the most ardent Protectionist, without any sacrifice of principle, can heartily adopt the view that no obstacle should be thrown in the way of obtaining, in the cheapest and most effective form, the materials necessary for coping with these pests. We need traps for trapping rabbits and dingoes, arsenic to deal with the prickly pear, and chemical dips for dealing with the tick and other evils. All these should be obtainable in the speediest and cheapest way. We are all familiar with the historical advice that a man should not argue with " the master of fifty legions," and it may be well for us not to refuse the bargain which has been offered us by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who is, after all, the master of the situation, since he is in charge of the Tariff. The honorable gentleman has offered to remove dog traps from this item; and I should like to know whether, in the event of my pressing my amendment, and the Committee deciding against it, we shall lose that offer. </para>

I hope that, even at this the eleventh hour, the Minister will render it unnecessary for us to proceed to a division, by agreeing to a 10 per cent. reduction of the duty as against imports from Great Britain. If he will do that, he may make the general Tariff as high as he pleases. </para>

I am strongly in favour of having rabbit traps made in Australia, but I. do not think that the imposition of a duty is necessary to secure that result. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has shown that this is one of those simple industries which do not require the assistance of any duty whatever. If a duty of 20 per cent, be imposed upon rabbit traps, it will most certainly increase their price to our rabbit trappers. </para>

                            <para>- The bite of the rabbit is one of the most injurious in Australia. This rodent bites the grass lower, and depreciates the pasture more, than does any other animal. It consumes the natural herbage which is required by our sheep and cattle, and tends to destroy the valuable grasses, and it thus inflicts incalculable injury upon our pastoralists. The rabbit is also one of the greatest enemies to our forests. In this connexion I propose to quote from <inline font-style="italic">The Standard Cyclopedia of Modern Agriculture,</inline> a work which has' evidently been exhaustively studied by honorable members, because I notice that every page of it has been cut. Under the heading of " Rabbits - Damage to Woodlands," I find the following :  - </para>

                    <para>In Britain rabbits are the most dangerous enemies to forestry. The time when rabbits are most likely to attack young trees is during frosty weather, and especially when the ground is covered with snow. They prefer soft-barked kinds of trees, but as all kinds of trees have soft bark when young, none are safe where rabbits abound. In copse woods the ash and hazel underwood suffers most, and in many parts of England once valuable coppices have been decimated where rabbits are preserved in the vicinity. </para>

                    <para class="block">It seems to me incontrovertible that the duties I propose are quite adequate for the protection of local manufacturers of traps. The Minister told the Committee that he had received a request for higher rates from a gentleman who said that the demand for traps fluctuated greatly. That must be true, because there are times when vermin of all sorts increase rapidly, and other times when they abate. The statement seems to me to show that the business of trap making is not an industry worth protecting. It is not. a manufacture that is complete in itself, and cannot properly be dignified by the name of " industry." One machine could pretty well provide all the traps that Australia needs. It is not creditable to the Minister and to his officers that they should have recommended a duty of 40. per cent. </para>

                            <para>- In 1918-19 the revenue collected on traps imported at the general rate of 10 per cent. was £1,500, which shows the value of the importations to have been about £15,000. In that year, not many rabbit traps could have come from the United Kingdom. In 1915-16 the revenue was £323. I have no pre-war figures immediately at Land. The reason for the 40 per cent. duty in the general column is, as I have already explained, that the trade was passing from the United Kingdom to other countries, and I wish to restore the balance; not that so high a rate is necessary for the protection of the local industry, which I think should be protected with a duty of 20 per cent. The value of. traps used in Australia annually would not be much under £50,,000, and their manufacture at the present time employs quite a number of people. Lane, a well and favorably known English maker, has recently established a factory here, and I think we should see that men who take a risk of this kind should be reasonably dealt with. </para>

I feel that the people of Australia are agreed that our war experience should not be repeated, and that we must be self-contained in the matter of providing means for dealing with this pest, so far as trapping can deal with it, although as a means of exterminating rabbits, I personally do not think that the rabbit trap will play any conspicuous part. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sorry that I cannot allow the amendment to go to a vote without expressing the view that honorable members are not yet seized of the real importance of this matter. I say that, because I have been accused of making a most exaggerated statement when I said that the duty is of real importance to Australia. It is important to this country as affecting the destruction of a pest which has cost Australia hundreds of millions in money, and the end of which no man can foresee. There are honorable members of the Committee who think that the rabbit is a source of profit, but any profit derived from the rabbit is more than counter-balanced by the injury we suffer from the depredations of the pest. The rabbit is a parasite upon the greatest Australian industry, and we are dealing under this item with a parasitical industry.

                            <para>- If we had ten factories costing £30,000 each, the capital invested would not represent more than the price of one large, well-stocked station. It is too ridiculous to think of establishing an industry of this kind at the expense of what is unquestionably the greatest industry in Australia. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that we cannot afford to interfere with the balance of nature. Nature, if left uncontrolled, has destructive methods of its own, and, in my opinion, the use of poison for the destruction of rabbits destroys the balance of nature, and throws everything out of gear. It is not merely a question of the number of rabbits spoiled by the use of poison as compared with the use of traps, but a matter of very much greater moment in the disturbance of the balance of nature, which is the only thing that keeps Australia such a remarkably healthy country for the rearing of stock. Those who are engaged in primary production know that there are fewer pests and diseases affecting primary production in Australia than in any other country. </para>

                            <para>- The interjection shows that the honorable gentleman does not understand the position.While I admit that the dingo is a pest, the injury he does to Australia does not represent a hundredth part of the injury done by the rabbit. The dingo is not nearly so bad a pest as even the prickly pear. I say this although I know that many people are to-day being driven off their holdings, and thousands of acres that used to be devoted to the rearing of sheep are now devoted to the rearing of cattle because of the ravages of the dingo. If we leave things to natural law we shall be able to cope with the rabbit pest; but when men bring along the poison cart, and so disturb the balance of nature, it is difficult to say what will be the ultimate result. I am opposed to this duty because, in my view, it may mean all the difference between the destruction of rabbits by trapping and their destruction by the use of poison, which is one of the most dangerous means that could be adopted. </para>

                    <para class="block">The manufacturers of both linseed and castor oils are experiencing great difficulty in carrying on at present. The position of linseed-oil manufacturers in particular is somewhat difficult owing to the fact that in England, which is the chief competitor, the product is the cake and the by-product the oil, whereas in Australia the oil is the product and the cake the by-product. In England, the cake commands a much higher price than in Australia; and, as 3 tons of linseed produces 2 tons of cake and 1 ton of oil, and as the manufacturers obtain the raw material from the same market as we do, namely, India, they are in a better position to compete in the Australian market in connexion with the production pf oil. As far as I am able to judge from a number of letters from manufacturers of paints and varnishes, no material objection will be raised to increasing the duty on linseed oil. I think that 4d. more on the general Tariff, and 3d. more on the British Tariff will give the local manufacturers a reasonable opportunity of carrying on their business. The rearrangement of duty on castor oil is necessary in order to put the manufacturers in a more satisfactory position. </para>

In Western Australia, one big firm engaged in the manufacture of methyl alcohol is obtaining a valuable oil byproduct from the blackboy tree. </para>

                        <para>.- Local manufacturers of cement have represented that the duty provided in the schedule is not sufficient. I know that prior to the war cement was brought cut practically as ballast at a freight of £1 per ton. If that was done then, when there was more cargo being sent to Australia than there is likely to bc under this Tariff, there will be greater risk of it happening in the future, because vessels coming to the Commonwealth to lift our primary produce will probably carry cement cheaply as ballast. It has been pointed out to me that in other parts of the world the hours worked in the cement industry are sixty-six per week, as against forty-four in Australia, whilst in the local industry time and a half is paid for overtime, and double rates for Sundays. If we desire to make this industry secure, we must protect it against the dumping of a product which has been produced at a considerably less cost than has the local article. The freight from overseas need not be taken into consideration, because it would probably be not greater than the cost of sending cement from Victoria or New South Wales to the north of Queensland or Western Australia. </para>

We experienced the advantage of the local industry during the war, when, if we had been dependent on overseas supplies, we would not have been able to get any cement. During the drought in New South Wales one large cement works suffered severely because for a number of months they had no water for manufacturing purposes, but I believe that provision has now been made for an adequate supply. </para>

                        <para>.- Has the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> given sufficient consideration to the fact that new cement works have been established quite recently? I believe there are works in the Newcastle district, and there is a new factory in my own electorate. In the 1908 Tariff the duty was 9d. per cwt., and in 19141s., the same as is proposed in the schedule now before us. As the Minister has been careful to strengthen so many other industries by affording them additional protection, I should like him to state why he has not increased the duty on cement. </para>

                            <para>- I am only stating what happened at the interview between the manufacturers and myself. When framing the Tariff, I made inquiries to ascertain whether the duties would be sufficient, and the extent to which the local manufacturers were able to meet the demands. During the last few years there have been enormous developments in the plants manufacturing cement in this country. The great shortage of cement during last year was due, not so much to the inability of local plants to cope with the demand as to the fact that because of shipping strikes and industrial disturbances the cement works could not carry on, and although they had a capacity of over 350,000 tons per annum, they  were  not able to produce more than 260,000 tons. New companies have been formed in Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania; and, in addition, almost every one of the existing companies has taken steps to nearly double its output. The prospects are that before the end of 1921 the capacity of Australian cement plants will be nearly 700,000 tons. This will be increased by nearly 100,000 tons in 1922 by the operations of the Tasmanian Cement Company. In all probability, the shortage will be entirely overcome this year; and, next year, unless there is some increase in building operations, the output of Australian cement works will be, I believe, greater than the actual requirement. </para>

They would appreciate an assurance from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> that if any such dumping be attempted he will apply the provisions of the anti-dumping legislation, which he informed the Committee will apply in regard to iron and steel products. Local manufacturers need the Australian market to enable them to stabilize their industry. They say that there will be no attempt to raise the price ; and I have if on the best authority that when the industry is stabilized, which must first be done, there will be a reduction in price. </para>

                        <para>. -  During the war, in order to meet the demand for this class of ware, an attempt was made to produce it in Australia, and met with a fair amount of success, particularly in respect to the manufacture of porcelain insulators to meet the requirements of the Postal Department. Previously Government officials had been rather diffident about affording to the local manufacturers that assistance which would enable them to meet the requirements of the Department; but that diffidence has now been overcome. Of course, if I ask for an increase I am met with the answer that the local manufacturers have been producing these wares for some time past; but, as I have already shown in regard to other local products, although during the war, and until quite recently, sufficient natural protection was afforded to enable the local makers to continue their operations, all the nations of the world which are now beginning to resuscitate their prewar industries, may be in a position to flood our markets with their products if the local man is not afforded some further protection. When the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> was approached by the people associated with this trade, did he not recognise that the duties he has provided in the schedule were not likely to give any security to the local industry? Was it not shown to him that the inadequacy of the proposed rates would, soon be proved when other nations revived their pre-war industries, and did he not consider the advisability of increasing the rate under the general division ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If we encourage the manufacture of the higher grades of clay products there is nothing to prevent Australian industries exhaustively undertaking the manufacture of other articles made from clays. This is an industry that could be successfully conducted, not only in the cities, but in country districts, and would be a means of giving employment in outside centres, as has been the case in the Old World. I came from the south-western portion of Britain, where china clay of a high standard is produced, and am fully conversant with the possibilities of this industry. It would be a difficult matter to enumerate the different uses to which clay can be put. I trust the Minister will give careful consideration to the arguments I have adduced, and will consent to the general Tariff rate being increased by 10 per cent. The manufacture of porcelain ware should be extended. Is the Minister prepared to increase the rate? </para>

During the war we were unprepared to meet our requirements of iron, wool, and timber, but we were in a hopeless position as regards cotton and clay products. During the war period the women of Australia found it practically impossible to purchase many articles manufactured from china, and this is our opportunity of encouraging local industries so that we shall be in. a position to meet all demands. </para>

                        <para>.- Of course industries ave stabbed at from abroad in a manner that at times does them injury. I have communications before me showing the competition we are subjected to in Australia. One does not wish to speak in unfriendly terms concerning the activities of other nations ; but we have to remember that in some countries the workmen are paid low wages, and work long hours, and it is time this Parliament made a stand in preventing competition of this sort. Prior to the war Germany commanded practically the whole of this trade, and when she lost it Britain began to pay greater attention to the manufacture of china and porcelain ware. When capital was invested in British industries, the Government subsidized them to such an extent that I believe they are now able to compete with the German product, that is, of course, if it is not " dumped." In Australia we are in close proximity to another country, whose shipbuilding operations have been on an extensive scale, and which owns a mercantile marine which is specially charged with ' the conveyance of goods manufactured in that country - I refer, of course, to Japan. This makes her a very serious competitor. The advantage Japan receives in consequence of her proximity to Australia, and the conditions under which goods are shipped, places her in a fortunate position, quite apart from the benefits Japanese manufacturers derive in consequence of cheaper production. If white men working in civilized conditions are to be properly protected, our local industries will have to be considered. Quite recently local manufacturers in this industry suffered in competition with Japanese manufacturers. Tenders were called for the supply of insulators for the city of Maryborough, in Queensland, and when tenders were received there was some doubt as to whether the insulators to be supplied under the accepted tender were of Japanese manufacture, and on inquiries being made the tenderer said that such was the case. </para>

                            <para>- I presume the civic authorities. Information has been received that Australian manufacturers of insulators - which come under this item - have had to compete with goods coming from Japan, and unless we stand behind our Australian industries and protect them from this sort of competition they must go under. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> with his previous Free Trade predilections, would, I believe, stand up - especially in view of our experience during the war period - and say that it is time we protected our Australian industries. </para>

We require insulators for our telephonic and telegraphic systems, and for a long time we have had to fight in this House to get the officials in the Postmaster-General's Department to admit that those manufactured in Australia were good enough for the Postal Department. Now we have achieved that proud distinction, and to-day we are producing, not second or third-rate insulators, but an article that is not only equal, but in some cases superior, to those manufactured in other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>- We have made a series of successful attempts with Australian clays, and in different parts of the Commonwealth we have varying types quite equal to any found elsewhere. The raw materials are at our feet, and other nations have been laughing at Australia because we have shown such inactivity in erecting factories and machinery for the manufacture of goods which we consume, and which are imported. In my own constituency we were fortunate in having a man bearing a foreign name-he was a German - who has some knowledge of the manufacture of china and porcelain ware. There was some trouble concerning this man, but he was a peace-loving individual, and left his country because he did not believe in the conditions under which he was working, and in the manner in which he was governed. A company was formed and, at Sunshine, they have been turning out cups and saucers and other lines of porcelain ware equal to anything in the world. This man has been instructing young Australians, with every prospect of firmly establishing one other phase of Australian industry. But, against the competition finder conditions existing to-day, the enterprise cannot make a successful stand. Cannot the Minister see his way clear to agree to a greater measure of protection? </para>

                        <para>. -  My information is that dry gum does not come into competition with anything that is being done in Australia to-day . In the future, it is possible that some new process may be developed and that this gum may then come into definite competition with our own manufacturers. If, upon further examination, I find that it is necessary to levy a duty upon dry gum, I will either recommit the item or make arrangements for the matter to be raised later on. I feel certain that no injury will be done to any local industry by the adoption of my amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- the manufacturers of gelatine ask that gums which are used in the manufacture of confectionery, or as adhesives, shall be subject to the same duty as gelatine. That seems to me to be a fair request. Dry gum is used to mix with gelatine for the manufacture of jubes. The importation which I hold in my hand is described as Soudan gum, from Arabia, and it comes into competition with gelatine. According to the statement before me, it is used in the manufacture of lollies and adhesives. </para>

                        <para>.- While I appreciate the fact that the next item deals with the gums in which the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> is interested, I would point out to the Committee that the gums mentioned in this item enter into competition with a gum which is being produced in Western Australia from the blackboy tree, and is used in the manufacture of spirit varnishes and various lacquers. I have here a sample of that gum, which is produced in sufficient quantities in Western Australia to satisfy a big want there, and the industry, if encouraged, will be able to meet the requirements of the whole Commonwealth. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is making a mistake in making these dry gums free. He should at least provide for a duty of 10 per cent. in respect of imports from Great Britain, and 20 per cent. under the general Tariff. I shall deal with the matter fully when we reach the item relating to methyl alcohol. I ask honorable members to give some little . encouragement to this industry in Western Australia. It is not denuding our forests, but is using up what is really a pest. </para>

                    <para>But another matter of very great importance is the question of sheep, cattle, and horse washes in liquid or powder form. A little while ago we had a great deal of trouble concerning sheep dip. Any one interested in primary production, and particularly in the" production of wool, which is the chief product of Australia, knows that we must have the best sheep dips if we are to produce the best wool. Whatever may he the actual experience of other honorable members; my own, as a wool-grower, has been that our Australian dips are not up to the best standard. </para>

                            <para>- Personally I do not care for Coopers' dip. That is, of course, a matter of opinion, and I know that the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> who has had a great deal more to do with the matter than ever I had, believes that some of the local dips are good. I have had a fairly extensive experience with dips, and can say, without in any way wishing to injure the Australian product, because I believe in using Australian products whenever I can get them of equal quality with the imported, that the Australian dip has never, in my experience, met the full requirements of the market. It is very good in districts where you simply wish to deal with pests, where you dip your sheep merely to kill insects, and possibly to keep the fly off ; but where you are dipping, not only for those purposes, but also to improve the quality of the wool, then I think that most men who have had experience will agree that the imported dips have stood far and away above the Australian. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say "solely," although I have known it done solely for that purpose. But where they dip chiefly for that reason, some of the imported dips have been far beyond the Australian. I have on quite a number of occasions seen sheep dipped, and have helped to dip thousands, purely for the purpose of improving the fleece. If you use the right dip it has a very beneficial effect, and is a paying proposition. </para>

                            <para>- It keeps the wool cleaner and improves the tip of the wool very much. When the sheep are out under natural conditions, a certain amount of waste takes place on the tip of the wool; but if the sheep are dipped at the right time, a great deal of what is technically known as waste in the tip of the wool is eliminated. For that reason quite a number of people have in the past dipped their sheep purely for the purpose  of improving the wool; but in nearly all cases dipping is resorted to for the twofold purpose of keeping the animals clean and improving the wool at the same time. </para>

                    <para>The primary producer has quite enough burden to carry without having to pay more for his dips. We have imposed upon him additional expense for all his improvements in the way of his fencing wire, galvanized iron, and things of that kind. We have added to the cost of all his implements and increased to a remarkable degree the cost of his fencing. We have even this evening put an additional charge on his rabbit traps and other appliances for keeping down pests. It seems to me that we have put quite enough, and far too much, upon the primary production of this country. I do ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to give the man on the land some consideration in connexion with dips. I know that one or two firms have been using the whole of their strength and influence in order to get their industry bolstered up. </para>

So far as my experience has gone in connexion with the Tariff, the finger of scorn cannot be pointed at any one on either side of the House.

                    <para>I urge the Minister not to jeopardize further this tremendous wool-growing industry of ours for the sake of minor industries. We have already added enormously to the burden of the wool producer. Every man is aware that, with the charges imposed on the woolgrower even before the passage of this Tariff, it does not pay to grow wool at present prices. That is rather a serious statement to make; but every man interested in wool-growing will, I think, agree with me that, at the average price of wool as fixed here a little while ago. in connexion with the Bawra scheme, it would not pay to grow wool. Since we put that arrangement through this House a number of additional burdens have been imposed, and now along comes the Minister, advised, no doubt, by people not practically interested in wool-growing, but directly interested in sheep dip, to impose another burden which will reduce the quality of our fine merino wool. </para>
                    <para>It would not matter so much for Australia, as a whole, if the effect of this impost was likely to be reflected only in the poorer qualities of wool. It would certainly be very important to the individual wool-growers, but this matter goes even further than that, because while the man who grows inferior wool will have it still further lessened in value, the high-class wool, for which Australia has become famous all over the world, will be apt also to receive a check. We cannot afford to do anything which will in any way lessen the value of our high-class clip. That is the one thing above all others for which Australia has made a name. </para>

                            <para>- Even if that is so, the man who has to dip from 20,000 to 35,000 sheep begins to consider the consequences. Very often the sheep are dipped more than once in a year. In fact, the dip is used in many cases throughout the whole course of the. year, more particularly to keep away the flies. I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter and reduce the duty to 10 per cent. British, leaving the intermediate at 20 per cent., and putting the general Tariff up, if he likes, to 40 per cent. or 50 per cent., because the only dips that really matter to us - the only ones which we consider completely outclass our own - are the British. I have already urged on more than one occasion, and will continue to urge, that we should give as much preference as possible to the Old Country; but in this case it is not so much a question of preference to Great Britain as that we want to maintain the standard for which we are noted- everywhere, as the producers of the greatest quantity of first class wool that the world handles. </para>

                        <para>. - I propose to urge the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to increase the duty on this item. Honorable members are doubtless aware that during the war pressure was brought to bear to increase the production of dips within Australia, and encouragement was given to certain firms to expect protection if they supplied the quantity required for Australian Wool-growers, &amp;c. This promise brought William Cooper and nephews from England to establish their industry in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that it was a direct promise, because that could be given only by this Parliament, but there was an understanding, as there was in regard to a number of matters during war time. The undertaking was that, as far as the Government were concerned, if the local manufacturers met the requirement of the Commonwealth they would be encouraged. There are now in Australia no fewer than twelve manufacturers of dips. I do not care what any honorable member says to the contrary - I have known dips ever since the first cattle tick was brought into Australia - no dip has given more satisfaction for cattle than the Royalcattle dip. Tt is absolutely adequate. Nothing better has been introduced from overseas. I can also assure the Committee that Victor Leggo's cattle dip and sheep dip are equal to anything that has been imported. </para>

                            <para>- Many people are by nature conservative. If they have had their clothes made by a certain tailor, they think no other tailor can make them as well That has been the case in connexion with dips. From practical experience I am sure that this industry deserves to be encouraged in order that, no matter what happens, the best quality of dip may be produced here for the requirements of this great continent. A large quantity of the material used in dip making is imported. We have increased the duties on that considerably, and if we are to protect the industry at all we must increase the duty on' this item; otherwise, the oversea manufacturer will be able to compete unfairly with us in Australia. It is not as if we were at the mercy of one or two firms, because already twelve firms are, I believe, established in the Commonwealth who can meet, and are meeting, all our requirements. Many honorable members consider Thomas' a good dip, and that article is manufactured here. Some time ago there was an outcry against the Ministry for preventing the importation of Cooper's dip, but Coopers have now established works here, and make a dip of the same quality as that which they used to send here from overseas. It must not be forgotten that the bulk of the materials used for the manufacture of sheep dip are dutiable at high rates; and I hope the Minister will increase the protection on dip by at least 5 per cent. to make up for that. </para>
