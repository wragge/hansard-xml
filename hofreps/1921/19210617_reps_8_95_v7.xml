                            <para>.- This is a very important . question, demanding the earnest consideration of members, and of all interested in the welfare of Australia. The Labour party is not opposed to immigration, but its members feel that provision should be made, by proper organization abroad and in this country, for the employment of those who may be brought here. We are not justified in bringing to this country, to their keen disappointment, immigrants who may return to their own lands sadder and, perhaps, wiser men. The statement made yesterday by the Acting Prime Minister, in reply to the question of the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr; Stewart), was a revelation to me, and, I think, to most persons. The Acting Prime Minister admitted that on . one steamer no fewer than900 immigrants were returning. </para>

                            <para>It was true that a number of men had come from England to Australia, having paid their own passage, and found on arrival that no arrangements had been made to receive or deal with them. A number of such cases in New South Wales had been reported to him by the Director of Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> and the mcn appeared to be in very straitened circumstances indeed. He had agreed to a suggestion to make an offer of Â£5,000 to the Government of New South Wales for the relief of such cases of distress on condition that the State Ministry made available a similar amount. The offer was made before the Prime Minister left Australia. He considered that those men should be looked after, and that they should not be allowed to starve in our cities. The Commonwealth Ministry agreed to make the offer, but the New South Wales Ministry would not do anything. Ministers saying that they had their own unemployed problem, which was acute - and he had no doubt that it was - and that-they could not see their way to close with the offer. </para>

                                <para>- The Commonwealth Ministry was not, except in so far as it was responsible for the general condition of Australia. Last week he heard that the chaplain of a church organization in Sydney was relieving some of the men and their wives and families, who have nothing to do, and nowhere to go, and he made available a sum of Â£1,000 for their relief. The whole thing needed organizing. Care should be taken that when the men arrived an organization was ready to receive them. Under the immigration scheme it was arranged that the Commonwealth Government should take full responsibility for the selection and passage of immigrants, and that the States should undertake to receive and deal with them. </para>

                                <para>- I am coming to that. What is the position to-day? It is admitted that men are coming here who cannot get employment, and are consequently returning to the Old Country and to other countries. The result is to give Australia a bad name, and rightly so. Those who return tell the people in the lands from which they came that they have been disappointed and deceived. That is the position they take up. They say, " We were given to understand that Australia was a land of milk and honey, and a land of plenty. We were told that if we went out to Australia employment would be found for us ; but when we went there we remained out of employment for a considerable time, and until our necessities compelled us, before we had spent our last farthing, to make arrangements to return to our Home Land." The Acting Prime Minister said yesterday that he had offered to supply Â£5,000 for New South Wales to tide people who came to that State from the Old Country over their period of difficulty, provided that the State Government would find an additional Â£5,000. The position in New South Wales to-day is such that the State Government has had to find over Â£100,000 this year to assist the unemployed. </para>

                                <para>- We must consider whether we are justified in proceeding with the present immigration scheme until we can absorb our own people who are looking for employment. We do want immigration, but it must be upon a proper footing. It was estimated yesterday that there were 20,000 unemployed in New South Wales, 10,000 being in the city of Sydney and the remainder in the country. In view of that fact, is it not time that the House thought over this matter? Are we justified in advertising for people to come to Australia from overseas when we have unemployed in such numbers? Australia is advertising abroad for immigrants at the present moment. I saw a copy of a paper which circulates in Germany and which contained a full-page advertisement calling for people to come to Australia to settle on the land. Is it fair to advertise for people to come here when we have no land for them? Who is doing the advertising? </para>

                                <para>- The fact remains that it is being done, and it is not fair to mislead people in this way. Does the Acting Prime Minister, with his strong views in regard to the necessity for increasing the population and developing the country - and perhaps my views are as strong as his - believe that, at a time like the present, when we are suffering from the aftermath of the war, and have not yet been able to restore the whole of our returned soldiers to civil life, we are justified in bringing people out by the hundred thousand? The right honorable gentleman admits that there must be organization in this end. It is absolutely essential that there shall be an up-to-date organization, and it is because of the Government's admission of the lack of that organization that I have taken this action to-day. It is in the best interests of Australia that this Parliament should speak and let the people know the necessity for organization and the guaranteeing of employment for newcomers before we bring them here. Successful immigration depends entirely on the development of the country. If we can develop our resources and expand our industries so that we can absorb 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 immigrants, who will object to their coming? I would not, and the party on this side would welcome them with open arms. But we say that organization at this end is a preliminary necessity, and if the Commonwealth is charged, as it is by the agreement made at the conference with the State Premiers, with the organization abroad, and the States with the responsibility of making provision for the absorption of newcomers on their arrival, is it not fair to ask if those arrangements have yet been completed? Have the States adopted and submitted to the Commonwealth Government a fully developed scheme for the reception and absorption of immigrants? The unemployed trouble exists not only in New South Wales, for the honorable member for Moreton says that the same conditions obtain in Queensland. </para>

                                <para>- They will settle themselves through the Arbitration Court and by other means. The Mount Morgan trouble is only one phase of the unemployed difficulty. In each of the State capitals unemployed are to be found in thousands. The trouble to-day is acute, and under present conditions we are not justified in bringing new people here. Every honorable member must admit that if we have not a properly organized system of immigration, and if we do not place the present condition of the country faithfully before the people to whom we are appealing, we shall not be acting in the best interests of the country in bringing new population to Australia. One would infer from the leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> this morning that we should permit people to come here in thousands if we can get them, regardless of whether or not employment can be found for them. I dissent from that view. Has not the outstanding failure of the Commonwealth Government since the war been the lack of organization in regard to many of our activities, as a result of which returned soldiers have not received the satisfaction that was promised to them? Everybody knows that to be a fact. "We know that there has been lack of organization in the Departments, but the present problem of unemployment is a much bigger thing. </para>

This Parliament cannot interfere with the land policy of the State Governments. All we can do is to insure that there is thorough organization for the reception of immigrants. It is useless to attempt to cloud the issue by remarks as to what this or that State Government does or should do. The existing conditions in the country must be recognised. The Commonwealth is entirely responsible for the overseas organization of immigration, and the Government should not proceed with their present scheme until they know definitely that the State Governments can absorb the people that may be brought here. Honorable members opposite must not try to make it appear that the Labour party does not want immigration. </para>

                                <para>- A change in the Federal Ministry might effect some good. The fact should be made known here, and also abroad, that this country is not capable of absorbing the numbers who are coming here at the present time; because already we have thousands of unemployed, and until we can absorb them we are not justified in bringing other men here. If the right honorable gentleman could ascertain from the State Governments that there was a chance of providing work for, say, 1,000 immigrants, then he would be justified in bringing in 1,000 additional labourers; but it seems to be the wish of some honorable members to bring in men in their thousands, whether they can find employment or not. To-day we have the spectacle of men coming here who, unable to find employment, are compelled to return to their own country - if they have the money wherewith to do so - or are obliged to fall back on the charity of people here. </para>

                                <para>- During the course of my remarks I have avoided discussing small matters, and have endeavoured to keep this question on the high plane of the development of a country to the best advantage and populating it; but honorable members, by their interjections, are endeavouring to drive me off the track. What bearing has the application of a certain workers' log, or the policy adopted by a State Government, upon our attitude? We are charged as a Parliament with the responsibility of organizing in such a way as will justify our advertising abroad inviting settlers to come here, with the guarantee that they will find employment on their arrival. We ought to be in the position of being able to tell them that if they want to go on the land a block will be available for them. What is to prevent the Government from  secur-ing  200,000 or 300,000 acres of land and dividing it into so many farms, according to its carrying capacity, thus enabling them to put their immigrants on farms upon their arrival ? .But nothing is done in this direction. The trouble to-day is the lack pf this organization I speak of. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, provided that we can absorb them. But I disagree with the right honorable gentleman's use of the word " anyhow," which implies that we ought to bring in as many men as we can get from any part of the world, notwithstanding the possibility that we may not be able to absorb them. </para>

                                <para>- I am pleased that the honorable member for Moreton is in accord with my views. First of all, we must provide for our own people. Having done this, we can bring others here. That is the attitude of the Labour party. Statements to the contrary are without .foundation. In the records of the Premiers' Conferences on this subject we find that the representatives of the Queensland and New South Wales State Governments pointed out that if they could absorb immigrants they would be pleased to act in conjunction with the Commonwealth Government in securing them ; but my present purpose is to draw public attention to the fact that the organization spoken of at the conference by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the representatives of the different States is not in existence. The first duty of the Commonwealth is to organize the whole thing. Let us first get control of the whole question of immigration, and then i take steps to provide employment for those we seek to bring here. Otherwise an injustice will be done to the people already here and to the country itself. </para>

                            <para>. - When I spoke yesterday I was quite ignorant of the actual facts, and therefore my remarks dealt generally with the conditions in New South Wales. But I repeat again that there is no trouble anywhere to-day that I am aware of except in regard to New South Wales. I hear now, for the first time, that there is similar difficulty in Queensland. </para>

                                <para>- There is no trouble in Western Australia or Victoria. This year 1,692 immigrants have come to Victoria, and nearly all of them have been placed. That is the result of organization, and that is what we want in the other States, but what we cannot get. We are trying to get it now. It is a strange thing that in the smallest State of the group the largest body of immigrants is being absorbed. Notwithstanding all the trouble in the cities, there is plenty of room in Australia to-day for labouring men. </para>

                                <para>- Last week a man who lives in Victoria came to me with a bitter complaint that he had nothing to do and had a wife and two children to keep. I busied myself trying to find him employment, and got the Public Works Department to offer him a position at Canberra. He would not take it. He wanted to stay in Melbourne. There is room in this country for tens of thousands of farm workers and workers in other spheres of employment. Therefore I do not view this matter in the light of temporary and sporadic outbreaks of unemployment in the city. The statement appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning that there are 800 young men going back to Great Britain disappointed with their conditions here is wickedly inaccurate, and most damaging to this country. I cannot understand the absolute recklessness of leading papers in making statements for which there is not a tittle of justification. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> quoted yesterday a statement from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> which made no mention of this number. I have had investigations made from the shipping companies and from the passengers on the boat referred to, and from what I can ascertain there are not eieht men going back under these conditions. </para>

It is manifestly unfair to interrupt the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> as he has only a limited time in which to deal with an important question. I therefore ask honorable members to restrain themselves, as they will have an opportunity of debating the question. </para>

                            <para>On the question referred to in the Commonwealth Parliament yesterday, as to dissatisfied immigrants returning to Great Britain, inquiries have been made by this office on several occasions during the past month or two. So far as Victoria is concerned, there is no evidence to justify statements that any considerable number of men are returning home in this way. All results of inquiries made, in fact, point to the opposite conclusion. Through the passports office, Home and Territories Department, a good indication of the position is available. The passports officer, who meets most of the applicants and* knows generally the circumstances under which people are proceeding to England, affirms definitely that he has seen no grounds to justify a belief that any considerable number of men is returning dissatisfied. Responsible officers at shipping offices, such as the Orient Company' and the Peninsular and Oriental Branch Service, who also come continually in contact with passengers booking, testify to the same effect. </para>
                        </quote><para class="block">That cannot he all wrong. </para><para>Amongst other inquiries made, it so happens that an officer from this branch was specially instructed to visit the R.M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Ormonde</inline> on Wednesday to make inquiries amongst the third-class passengers upon this question. </para><para class="block">That was before the matter was mentioned here. </para><para>His 'statement, written on Wednesday evening, after returning from the boat, is as follows: - </para><para class="block">Again before the question arose in this Chamber - " The first man I met had been in New South Wales eight years and had come over in the boat from Sydney. He had only seen one man of the kind I was seeking, but he said that he knew quite a number of people returning on trips. One man, whose cabin was adjacent, had been farming near Bathurst, New South Wales, and boasted that he was worth ' a few thousand.' " </para><para class="block">These are the men with swags on their backs. The report goes on - " The man to whom I was talking said that he had done better in his eight years in Australia than he had done in the previous twenty years in Scotland. Another passenger I spoke to had been in New South Wales for eleven years, and was returning on a trip with his wife. He had a return ticket. Another passenger had been ten years resident, and was returning on a trip; also another after fourteen years' residence. Two young single men whom I approached were uncommunicative, but stated they were on a trip. I saw three other young, single men, who stated they were on a trip also to England. Two of these were ex-A.I.F. men, and, although they did not ' say so, I imagine they might be going home to be married, as many are. All of these were young men who had taken up residence here at some time before the war. All of these passengers had como around from Sydney, and, with the exception of the one already mentioned, they had not seen any case such as I was inquiring for. While not claiming that the total result of my inquiries would indicate that there were no disappointed- recent arrivals other than those mentioned herein, I am certain that these cases were very far from prevalent. The particular man . returning I subsequently found, and recognised him as one I had previously met at the Immigration Bureau. He was of unadaptable type. Two other young fellows with him had gone out to Newcastle to employment there in engineering works, but,  having been, put off, had decided to return to Scotland. An important point is that all three of these men had not come to Australia under the Overseas Settlement Scheme, which requires approval on the part of a State before being booked. That there Will be ' misfits ' in the working of an extensive immigration scheme is inevitable, but it can be safely claimed for1 this State that very few dissatisfied persons are under the necessity of returning home or of wishing to do so. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- The immigration officer in this State. The point I wish to stress is that before anything; was said in this House on the matter arn officer had been on the boat endeavouring to ascertain the conditions under which certain men were returning to Great Britain, and to see if there were any considerable number leaving Australia in. the disgusted fashion alleged.. It is; monstrous that these reports should be published from time to time when there is not a tittle of fact to support them.. They are used to damage the Commonwealth immigration scheme, and why the papers lend themselves to this sort of" thing I cannot for the life of me understand. There are difficulties I know in: connexion with the organization, but they are being corrected as far as possible.-. The dissatisfied men in Sydney, I believe, . all came out to Australia on their own account. The Government had nothing  whatever to do with them. They are ex-service men sent out by the Imperial' Government. </para>

                                <para>- After the termination of hostilities, a King's fund waa raised in Great Britain for assisting unemployed men, and it was money from this fund which was used in sending many of these people to Australia. Funds were not obtained from any emigration agency. It is this type of men who are stranded in some of our cities, and honorable members should keep that in mind. Of course, there may be an odd case or two where desirable men cannot obtain employment. When I came to this country I could not have got back again. I had not Â£45 with which to pay for a steerage passage. I had to stay here, for the very good reason that I had not the wherewithal to secure my return if I had so desired. Here are all these men going back who have paid, at least, Â£45 for steerage accommodation, and I cannot help feeling that the fit and well among them, if there are any of them disgruntled, could have more profitably used that Â£45, in each instance, by employing the money to support them here until they could find work. All the evidence goes to show that the bulk of the men who are returning are going back as trippers, going for holidays, going for business reasons. </para>

                            <para>Considerable number British ex-service men have come Australia presumably under British Government scheme, broken down in health, and quite unfit for employment or settlement on land. Immigration such people most embarrassing and must be stopped. Glad if you could get in touch with British Government at once with view as temporary measure preventing any ex-service men coming Australia except through Australian Government channels, thus obviating immigration medically unfit and otherwise unsuitable persons. </para>

At the same time, I wish to say that if a man is fit and well, and cares to come out " on his own," he is the best of all types of immigrant. Indeed, he is not an immigrant in the sense in which we generally use the term. He pays his own passage money, and accepts the responsibilities for himself. He comes out unaided, and seeks to make a place for himself in this new land. The next best type is the man who comes out as a nominated immigrant, with friends here to receive him. There is abundance of room in this country for thousands of men of that kind. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- I say that we are not doing so. Honorable members opposite hold that we have no right to bring a man here unless we have a block of land on which straightway to put him. That is the ideal scheme of immigration, no doubt; but it is not the only practical or practicable scheme. If immigration must wait upon ideal conditions there will be only the smallest trickle of newcomers to Australia. With proper organization at this end, there is room for thousands of men in Australia to-day, in .the country districts, and in many of our industries also. And there is room for thousands of domestic servants as well. Flats are being built in all the centres of Australian population, because there is so little domestic help available. If we could get out two or three boat-loads of domestic servants the erection of these flats would cease. Everything we can do to encourage a steady stream of immigrants to this country - immigrants of a good, reputable, hard-working type - we should do. And we should have an organization here to enable us to deal with them when they arrive. Some of the States are already proceeding along these lines, and are doing so very efficiently. I can only express the hope that those States where organization is not being developed and strengthened as it ought to be. will soon , fall into line, and. so jointly prevent any men from coming out here without prospects or promise of work, or ability to work, and for whom, indeed,  there is little reasonable chance of their becoming established. </para>

                            <para>.- One great advantage arising out of the motion for adjournment this morning is the announcement which has been made on behalf of the Labour party that it is not opposed to immigration. I waa very pleased to hear that announcement, and I quite agree with the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that any scheme of immigration upon which we embark must be based upon right lines and must be well organized. It is a great pity that certain statements have been published in the press which convey the impression that a number of immigrants to this country have recently left it because they were disappointed with it. The idea which has been disseminated is that a large number of fine young men, most of them English ex-soldiers, have come here and have departed from Australia disappointed. There i3 no justification for any such statement. The evidence that is available abundantly proves that. But we must realize quickly the imperative need which exists for population in this country. If we do not get more people, consider the load of debt <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> that we shall be obliged to carry. Moreover, we cannot continue to hold this country unless we populate it and develop its resources. To do that, we require many tens of thousands of people to come here. I wish that I had in my possession a map which was sent to me from Western Australia, and which shows the volume of immigration to the United States of America, Canada, and Australia. It discloses that there is quite a generous stream to the United States of America, that a lesser number is going to Canada, and that those coming to Australia represent a mere trickle. It is evident, therefore, that there is something wrong either with our system of immigration or with ourselves, because Australia is one of the finest countries in the world. </para>

                                <para>- That statement is nonsense. Why, in 1911, we started a big immigration policy in Western Australia, and one which proved wonderfully successful. If the Government desire people to come here, surely we can organize a scheme under which they can be attracted to the Commonwealth. We have been told that the ideal scheme is to bring immigrants to this country and straightway settle them upon the land. To my mind, that is an absurdity. We want them to come here and work for a few years before settling upon the land, in order that they may become familiar with local conditions. </para>

                                <para>- They can get it if they want it. The whole trouble is that for the past ten or fifteen years our politics have had only one effect - namely, to concentrate population in the cities. By means of our legislation we are destroying the primary producers. Look at the enormous number of persons who are unemployed at the present time owing to the low price of copper. The Mount Lyell, Cuthbert, and Mount Morgan mines are closed down, and probably 20,000 men have thus lost their employment. In the nature of things we must expect that the workers will demand higher wages while the cost of living is continually soaring. But there has been no effort on the part either of the Government or of this Parliament to reduce the cost of living in any form. Only in to-day's newspapers we see a report of the new log which is being sought in connexion with the timber industry. Ten guineas per week is being demanded by bullock-drivers. Perhaps the odd 10s. is required because of the language test which they have to undergo. Is it possible for us to  build up an industry when we are obliged to pay such high wages? A similar condition obtains in connexion with every phase of agricultural and pastoral work. Look at the demands which have been made by the Shearers Union during the past year. It is quite impossible for the pastoral or the timber industry to carry on under such conditions. A similar remark is applicable to the mining industry, and without a reduction in the cost of living how can we expect men to accept lower wages? Unless there is a very big change in our legislation, and in our methods of administration, and unless we offer greater inducements for the development of the country, we are bound to experience even a greater measure of destitution than that with which we are now confronted. If one reads the history of Canada, New Zealand, and the Argentine since the termination of the war, he will find that to-day those countries are wealth-producing and prosperous. Yet, according to the statement of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> there are 20,000 unemployed at the present time in Sydney alone. </para>

                                <para>- The Government are not to blame for that. It has been stated in sworn evidence that labourers at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard have been earning as much as Â£60 and Â£70 per month, whilst other men were unemployed. I know of no greater disgrace than the history of the administration of that dockyard. </para>

                                <para>- It is quite possible to kill an industry. I think that this Parliament is fairly upon the road to killing itself, and it hasfully earned destruction. From this day onward I intend to do my utmost to force a dissolution. A successful immigration scheme must necessarily depend largely upon proper administration. I hope we shall have a far more efficient administration of the Government's immigration policy than we have had in connexion with our War Service Homes. The House would be quite justified in insisting upon general reports being presented to the Parliament from time to time in regard to the work that is being done by the Department. If we are to make a success of this immigration policy - and I feel it is essential to the development of the country - we should know exactly what is being done. Farm labourers are the class of men I desire to see brought here - men who are prepared to go into the country. To bring men here simply to be dumped into our cities is only to accentuate the unemployed evil, and to do harm to Australia. Many men so treated may return to the Old Country and give Australia a bad name. We should make a feature of bringing here men who will be prepared to go into the country, and, in the early stages of their sojourn here, we should find employment for them. The Parliament should insist upon quarterly progress reports from the Immigration Department, showing what <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> being done, and the regulations under which the policy is being carried out. If that were done, we should be able at once to correct any faults in the system instead of waiting for them to be discovered, as in so many other cases, by a Royal Commission. </para>

                            <para>.- I approach the consideration of this question from an Australian, and not from a party, point of view. My experience of the unemployed extends over thirty years, and I have also come in direct contact with many immigrants. As far back as 1888, I was medical officer on a vessel carrying 200 or 300 immigrants from the Old Country to Western Australia. Some of those immigrants were . suffering severely from tuberculosis ; but I was not permitted, on that account, to refuse to allow them to sail. I had only to certify that they had been successfully vaccinated. I made a second trip from the Old Country to Western Australia in the same circumstances, and found the same idiotic practice prevailing. I followed up some of these immigrant families, and discovered that tubercular troubles from which many of them were suffering gathered in their victims in the succeeding years. The danger of such persons being introduced into Australia has been largely eliminated since every intending immigrant to Australia is now examined, before leaving the Old Country, either by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> or one of his staff. </para>

                                <para>- Developments may occur on the voyage out to Australia. If we were wise, and had due regard to the well-being of future generations, we would insist that every new arrival, whether he came out as a saloon passenger or in the steerage, should submit to a medical examination. In the absence of proper medical supervision, serious diseases may be brought to the country, and we should insist upon thorough medical inspection, just as we have quarantine regulations designed to prevent the introduction of diseases of plant life. I differ from the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> who says that it is easy for a man to obtain employment. No honorable member receives more visits from immigrants than I do. I have had an office in Elizabeth-street north, for nearly thirty years, and immigrants and others in search of employment seem to experience no difficulty in finding their way up to me. The' right honorable gentleman said that he had no difficulty whatever in obtaining employment for a man who was wanting work. With his permission, I shall send to him quite a number of men whom I know to be unemployed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitehead,</inline> who has been appointed by the Victorian Government as Officer-in-Charge of Immigration, has offices at 555 Flinders-street. He has been in the service of the Government for many years and has my respect, but his opportunities to find employment are somewhat limited, and he has to send applicants to other places. The Town Hall authorities have refused to register returned soldiers for employment. They say that they have already on their books more than the number for whom employment can be found by them. . My life would be much happier if we had a properly organized, department to provide employment. If those honorable members who say that there is plenty of work in country districts will furnish me with information as to where employment is available I shall be glad to supply them with all the men they require. Unemployment is the curse of humanity. We are told that "the poor ye have always with you," and we always will have until we have just laws, It is because of the injustice of our laws that unemployment is permitted to exist. If a man loses a day's work, that day's work is lost for ever to the whole community. There are many men willing to work but unable to obtain employment, and the seriousness of their position is accentuated when women and children are dependent upon them. I have always held that having provided, by means of good organization, for the employment of those already in Australia, we should throw our arms out wide in welcome to the white races of the world. I do not know whether it is due to our petty jealousies or other reasons, -but it is undeniable that we do not do as well as some of the lower forms of life. Chu will never see in a shoal of fish some that are rolling fat while the majority are as thin as rakes, because the capital of a fish, like that of all animal life, is the food it' collects, and the harder it works the more it gets. </para>

                                <para>- I have" watched fishermen hauling in their nets, and it does take a keen eye to differentiate; but what I say is absolutely correct. So in a flock of birds you will not find a few so fat that they can hardly fly and all the others as thin as a rail. The ants and the bees are all employed, and their organization of the nest and the hive is much better than any system which humanity has contrived for the nation up to the present. We have twenty-three millionaires in Australia, but I guarantee that we have far more than 23,000 people who do not know when they will be able to pay next week's rent. No civilization is worthy of the name while one millionaire exists side by side with 1,000 people whom I will not call paupers, as I hate the word, but whom I may call modern  Christs. We  say that the woman as a citizen is equal to the man, but that is an absolute untruth. Any Australian who contends that a woman in this country is politically equal to the male is' saying what is untrue. If an Australian male marries a foreign woman she becomes an Australian, but if an Australian woman marries a foreign male she  loses  her Australian nationality. She is, therefore, not the equal of the male. I might draw an illustration from the terrible time of the French Revolution, as depicted by the Conservative writers. Whenever a daughter of the people married an aristocrat, it saved his life. Some of the very best citizens we have had have come from other countries. Any one who knows what has happened in Papua or New Guinea is aware that the Germans managed their part of that country much better than we  have done. Many of those Germans married Australian girls, and all their interests are here; yet, because they were unfortunately born in a foreign country - although they did not hold the opinions of their country - they are to be repatriated. I am credibly informed that before the Germans went to New Guinea to settle they were sent to Ceylon and other eastern countries where the cocoanut is grown, so that when they reached their new home they would understand the work, -and be all the better immigrants for that part of the German territories. If what the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has said is correct, and I think he will be able to back it up by evidence if necessary, then a serious mistake has been made. I cannot help thinking of the words which the late Daniel O'Connor, of New South Wales, used to repeat - " If I have a thousand friends I have not one too many ; but if I have one enemy the devil turns up everywhere." If each of the men referred to went back to England and became a circulating medium for statements detrimental to Australia, it would undo all the good done to this country by the greatest advertisement that Australia ever had, or ever will have - that is, the fact that the Australian volunteers went to the Front and were paid 6s. per day. They ought to have had more, but, at any rate, they received that amount as compared with the small pay received by men of other nations. </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth Government can in this matter do what the State cannot do - they can apportion immigrants to the State which is the most generous in its offers. The two States with the greatest potentialities in this regard are Queensland and, to a less degree, Western Australia. If those two States offer greater inducements to the immigrant than the others do, then the Commonwealth Government can do what no individual State Government can do. </para>

We want to fill up the enormous spaces of Australia, because we have only so far embroidered the edge Of the continent with cities. The vast interior is almost unknown. Thanks to the teachings of science, there is very little of that interior that cannot avail itself of water from the artesian basin. We possess the greatest artesian basin in the world. The Commonwealth Government, in alliance with the States, could convert into a closely-settled country the whole of the Murray River basin, with all its tributaries extending right up to Queensland. They could plant Renmarks and Milduras all along the two banks of the Murray for one-tenth of the money that we wasted in the bloodshed of the terrible world war. I hope that the Commonwealth Government, in association with the States, will do something definite so that wo can offer those who come here, as immigrants, a home. </para>

If they have reached the Old World, I sincerely hope that the Government will at once cable the whole truth about the business. What are the facts as to the responsibilities for introducing immigrants under the new movement? The Commonwealth Government can bring to Australia only people specially asked for by the States. They cannot bring to this country, under this scheme, a single immigrant unless he has been asked for and approved by a State. </para>

                                <para>- We could not bring people out until quite recently, even if they had wanted to come. In the second place,  when the immigrants arrive they pass to the control of the States for employment or for settlement on the land. The next most deplorable thing I know is that the great and wealthy State of New South Wales is the delinquent in the proper prosecution of this great movement. Speaking of the interests of all Australia, let me say that two States in particular, that is, New South Wales and Queensland, with their immense possibilities, ought to be the most attractive spots on the earth, and the State Governments ought to embrace every opportunity to get hold of prospective British immigrants. </para>

                                <para>- It is sad, and it is true; but an immigration policy is designed to help Australia to get back to her former position from the point of view of production. I am sorry to think that honorable members opposite are simply re-echoing the views of powerful outside organizations, which, for some reason, declare that we do not want immigrants in this country. </para>

                                <para>- Does the honorable member know that after last harvest, during which men earned big money, it was impossible for farmers to secure men for other urgent work,, even at a wage of Â£4 per week and keep ? The men had made their cheques for the harvest work, and were determined not to lose a single hour in getting back to the cities. The Western Australian Government have provided us with a splendid example of organization for the handling of immigrants. Only a few weeks ago about 1,000 selected immigrants landed in Fremantle, and were quickly distributed throughout the State. We want the same organization and the same co-operation in every State. It is deplorable that any State should stand out of the scheme, and particularly the two great wealthy States, which ought to be able to take immigrants  in scores of thousands. Every true Australian must be keenly disappointed at the thought that any State is not prepared to take opportunity by the hand in regard to our immigration policy. My honorable friends from New South Wales and Queensland should do a bit of missionary work in their own States and among their own people. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> raised the question of introducing the right type of immigrant, from a physical point of view, and spoke of men suffering from chronic diseases being allowed to come to this country. That is a thing of the past. At all events, there is not an immigrant now brought here that does not pass the most rigid medical examination. I am told that immigrants are of a finer type physically, and from a health point of view, than are average passengers. </para>

                                <para>- Notwithstanding our political differences, I regard the honorable member as a good citizen, who has reared a good family, and done good for the country. However, it is a heartbreaking thing for a man to break up his home in the Old Country and come here with the best of intentions and hopes, only to find that he cannot obtain employment. That is a dreadful position for a man to be in, as I know from personal experience. After my arrival here, if I could have afforded it, I should have gone Home again; and here, perhaps, I ought to say that that might have been a good thing for Australia. If the Commonwealth Government is going to raise another loan, which I understand is " on the cards," it ought to be a loan for public works, which would have the effect of inducing immigration and furthering the development of the country. </para>

                                <para>- That does not affect me. We must populate the country, but I am against immigration unless the immigrants can be provided with employment. The Government ought not to throw the' responsibility on the States, which themselves are in financial trouble. The Commonwealth can raise money more cheaply and quickly than any State can for the purpose of public works, and there certainly ought to be some steps taken in that direction. I do not blame the Government for the fact that there are 3,000 men out of employment owing to the cessation of work at Cockatoo Island, but such unemployment in one locality must certainly impress immigrants, and doubtless cause them to write home letters which will give Australia a bad name. Reproductive public works undertaken with loan money would prove an incentive to people to make Australia their home, and the responsibility in this connexion ought not to be thrown on the States. </para>

                            <para>.- I have no doubt that every member desires that the right class of immigrants shall come to Australia. Personally, I shall welcome here from the British Islands all the hardworking, solid, sober men and their women folk who will come. But what is to be done for them when they  arrive here? The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> beats the air when he asks the Commonwealth Government to do what he says has not been done. The Commonwealth Government has undertaken the work of recruiting for immigrants. It obtains from the States particulars of their requirements respecting number and classes, and acts accordingly. Some of the States have gone in for immigration wholeheartedly, and probably Western Australia would be better off if she stood by herself in the matter of immigration, but it would be a good thing to have an Australian immigration policy laid down, so that the whole Commonwealth would know where it stands. The conditions of the States vary. In New South Wales, for instance, settlement has proceeded apace for many years, and land cannot be obtained so easily as in Western Australia, where large areas are still unalienated from the Crown. The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> complains that no one has shown a way out of our difficulties. At the present time, persons wishing to come here from Great Britain under the immigration arrangements are examined by doctors in various parts of the Old Country, and prior to embarkation are examined again by doctors acting for the shipping companies. These examinations are designed to test, not only their physical, but also their mental condition. I think that I know more than any other civilian in Australia of the immigrants who have come here during the past few years, having been on every transport and other steamer which has brought out soldiers' wives and dependants, and I know that all immigrants before entering the country have been subjected to three medical examinations. We must all agree with the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> that it is necessary to prevent persons suffering with tuberculosis, cancer, or syphilis from entering the country. Thank God we have in some of the States laws for the lessening of those diseases, and it would be a good thing if those laws obtained in all the States. If the Western Australian Health Act operated throughout Australia, certain diseases would be almost eliminated within twenty years. If we get immigrants of the right class, they are worth doing the best we nan do for them. Are we doing all that we can for them ? In some of the States, we are. The honorable member for Melbourne said that even Western Australia could get more immigrants if it gave better conditions; but that State is getting all it wants, and is finding work for its immigrants. I do not wish to see artisans coming here who will remain in our cities; not that I object to the immigration of good tradespeople, but that too much of our population is now in our big cities. Every Act that we pass tends to drag population to the cities. In some of the States, immigrants can obtain land under favorable conditions; but that id not so in all the States, and the Commonwealth Government would do a good thing for Australia, even though it were necessary to borrow Â£20,000,000 for the purpose, in employing teams of the best bushmen obtainable to undertake the work of clearing and otherwise preparing land for settlement by immigrants and returned soldiers. . Under such a system, those who went on the land would be able to get returns straightway. </para>

                                <para>- I was comparing what is done in Western Australia with what is done in some of the other States, and suggested a way out of our difficulties in the matter of immigration. I said that the Commonwealth Government might borrow a large sum of money and allow it to be used by the States. I would go even so far as to say that there should not necessarily bo red-tape Government supervision of the system. If, in each State., three men with a knowledge of what was necessary and a desire for the progress of the State were selected to administer the system of immigration, the best results might be obtained. Much money that is at present spent in giving instruction to immigrants who desire to settle on the land might be spent to better advantage if it were used in the employment of men who understand the business to clear land and get it ready for intending immigrant settlers. If that course were followed we should be able to absorb our immigrants more speedily. During five years before the war no less than 250.000 immigrants came to Australia, and we never knew that they were coming, because they were absorbed as fast as they came. I believe that with proper management, if the same or a greater number were to come here within the next five years, we should scarcely know that they were here. It will be but a poor lookout if we have to depend on the natural increase of population to make Australia self-dependent. </para>

                                <para>- As I have a second edition running around, I can also claim to have done pretty well. I believe that the case which is responsible for this debate has been very greatly exaggerated. From what has been said, people might be led to believe that 800 dissatisfied and disgruntled immigrants are returning to the Old Land. That is not the case. To cry " stinking fish," whether in connexion with an immigration policy, industrial matters, or anything else, is a bad advertisement for the country. What each State should do is to follow the example of Western Australia. When immigrants arrive there they are met by a State official. Prior to their arrival the State official has obtained data which enables him in a great many instances to place the immigrants in employment. By this means, the bulk of them are absorbed. Those for whom employment cannot be found immediately are accommodated in an institution, where they are provided with good food and shelter and a means of communication with likely employers. Provision is also made so that no employer can browbeat a newly arrived immigrant into taking employment under conditions that are not in accordance with the laws of the State regarding industrial matters. Immigrants are safeguarded in that way. If newly-arrived immigrants contend that the State has not done everything possible for them there are other organizations and institutions to look after their interests. There is one organization in Western Australia called the Ugly Men's Association, which has done a remarkable amount of good. </para>

The association has been doing remarkably good work. The men forming it have been assisting the Government to settle immigrants in Western Australia, instead of complaining that it has done nothing, or has not done enough, and by running it down, indirectly running down Australia. If a similar organization were operating in each of the States their activities would tend to lighten our load in the matter of providing for immigrants. There is room in this country for a great many immigrants. I do not wish to see a man or a woman coming out here and working for a wage which our own people do not consider a fair remuneration for his or her labour. </para>

                        <para>I desire to call attention to the fact that some States which have not carried out the proposals agreed upon have been given an advantage over Western Australia, where an endeavour has been made to carry them into effect. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has said that a sum of money was given to the New South Wales Government with which to provide assistance for immigrants. Not one of those immigrants came out under the system agreed to at the Premiers' Conference. Why should a State that has not come into the scheme be given money to assist immigrants whilst Western Australia, which has carried out the scheme really well, should have to find all the money necessary to finance her operations? The State Governments should come together and formulate a scheme, undertaking to carry out their part of the compact, and let the Commonwealth Government do the recruiting. The State Governments should determine the number and class of immigrants for whom they can find em,ployment, and then each State should be allotted so much money to spend according to the number of immigrants it receives. </para>
                        <para>I think that the Acting Prime Minister has refuted the case put forward by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and that Australia has not had a bad advertisement out of the- incident to which he has referred..

                            <para>.- I am very much in sympathy with a great deal of what the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> said this morning. No good Australian would wish anything to be done that would be detrimental to this country, but in discussing any of these matters we should not forget that the truth can do no harm. We should never be deterred from facing the actual facts by being told that we are crying stinking fish. Nothing was more disheartening to me as a soldier during the wa.r than to read obviously false bulle-tins  from our own side. Curiously enough I found confirmation of what the honorable member for Hunter said this morning in a press article entitled,  "Unions  Appeal to France." It stated that the officials of the Sydney Trades Hall have decided to approach the representatives of the French Government with a request that the unemployed of Australia be employed in the French colonies, including New Caledonia. It  went on to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waite,</inline> one of the union officials, was putting forward a proposal that Australian workers should be sent to assist in the restoration of the devastated areas in France and Belgium. There is no doubt that immigration is a matter in which both the Commonwealth and the States must work together, and the diversity of the opinions expressed this morning is explained by the different conditions existing in the various States. I was very pleased to hear the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> and the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> speak, as they did, of their own States, but I know that there are unemployed in both New South Wales and Queensland. They do not represent only the element which is known as unemployable, for I believe there are many men in Queensland who are honestly willing to work if they can get the opportunity. They are not only in the cities, but are as far out as Charleville. On the general question of immigration I differ very much from the other members of my party, and, perhaps, I shall get into hot water for the views I am about to express. No one is such a dog in the manger as to wish to hold Australia in a selfish manner when there are openings for our fellow-Britishers in other parts of the Empire to make their homes amongst us. As a member of the Queensland State Parliament, I remember hearing the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowman,</inline> one of the most respected and trusted members of that Legislature, saying that the ideal immigration policy was to make a country's internal conditions so good .that people from abroad would be automatically attracted to it. That is my view. When our troops were returning from Europe,. I often heard women say that it was a pity that so many of our boys had been married abroad, and had brought wives to Australia with them, because that was not fair to the Australian girls. My reply was that the turn of the girls would come when Imperial ex-service men commenced to settle in Australia. I am not in favour of the present system of sending men to Europe to advertise for immigrants. I do not care who they are, or how they do their work, it becomes their business to boost, or unfairly advertise, their country in order to get immigrants in sufficient numbers to justify their own positions. In the old days we called them "scalpers," because they received a payment of so much per head. I do not believe in that system. If conditions were as they should be in Australia, plenty of men and women would come here of their own volition without the aid of showmen and lantern entertainments. ' We hear much talk of our empty spaces, but the fact of having .a little room for development and space for our sons to show their enterprise in the making of new homes and careers, is the finest asset Australia has to-day. Some honorable members quote enviously the large number of immigrants that are pouring into America. That country is welcome to them, for we read in the papers only to-day that the United States Government is taking steps to restrict the tide, and that trouble is being experienced because it already exceeds the proportions laid down by Congress. I want quality before quantity. We are told that our empty spaces are a great menace, and that we must fill them up. As a soldier I see them in another aspect. During the late war the white population of German East Africa, numbering only 5,000, held out in that vast country- until the armistice, whereas the German Empire in Europe broke into ruins. The thickest populated country in Europe, Belgium, was the first to be over-run and conquered, and Russia, with its huge numbers of people, collapsed in disaster and ruin. If Australia were fighting for her life, .Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne might fall into the hands of the enemy in a few days, but the men in the back country could keep their end up for years. Therefore, do not let us be frightened by this talk of empty spaces. Fill them up by all means ; but let .us not be stampeded by the threat of not being able to hold the country against an enemy, and for that reason sacrifice our principles, and be in a hurry to occupy the empty spaces with immigration in quantity rather than in quality. </para>

                                <para>- I do. When I was a member of the Queensland State Parliament I did not find it too easy a matter to get all the lands required . by intending settlers - the sons of farmers - who came to me. If we want a big population we must make some big alterations. For one. thing, we must do away with a great" deal of the red-tape that now is only too evident in the matter of land settlement. Yesterday the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> spoke about the Burnett lands. We Were still trying to open them when I was a member of the State House. I do not blame the Commonwealth Government in this respect, but' it is useless for the Acting Prime  Minister to shut his eyes and say there is no unemployment here. Bringing out people while we have unemployment in our midst is, as I interjected this morning, putting the cart before the horse! When we- learn that something like Â£80,000 was spent last year in Queensland on outdoor relief, we must realize that there is something very wrong. We must get down to bedrock and ascertain the cause of the present unemployment before we ask for immigrants. It is -not fitting that a member of the Federal Parliament should criticise or blame the administration of various State Governments. The honorable member for Hunter said that in. discussing this question he would keep it, as he always does in discussing any matter, upon a high plane, and I want to follow his example.  I know, however, that there is unemployment in Queensland, and I know many reasons for it, but I totally disagree, with the suggestion of the honorable members for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> and Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> that further Government loans should be raised to provide funds for developmental works which will absorb the unemployed. First of all, we ought to remove the wet blanket that lies over our own private enterprises. I am an opponent of State trading. We ought to open up the country, not by floating further' loans for Government works, but by welcoming capital, by restoring confidence in trade and industry, and by assuring the country's credit,' good name, and good faith. Country life ought to be made more attractive, at least equally as attractive as city life. The advocacy of this policy is one of the reasons for the existence of a Country party in the House. . Briefly, we  ought to look the question of immigration straight in the face, and without .any party feeling, realizing that we must abandon the policy of hiding in the napkin the talents handed to us, and discharge the trusts reposed in us by adopting a new spirit with the object of utilizing and developing our resources on better lines. </para>

                            <para>.- In discussing this vital question, we cannot shut our eyes to' the fact that we, a handful of people, own a country larger than the United States of America, and that it is not unnatural for our neighbours to ask what justification we have for adopting the dog-in-the-manger policy of not utilizing this great territory ourselves while resisting the demands of others to settle upon it. We did not win this country by war, or by purchase, but took it from its rightful owners because they were not utilizing it. What justification have we now for holding on to it for ourselves alone unless we make an attempt to fill it up with the proper class of people? The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> is wrong in saying that we are satisfied to allow people to come here without acquainting them of the conditions they are likely to meet with on their arrival. The class of men we want are those who will settle on our land, and they are persons who have not the opportunity that city dwellers possess, to gather from the press exactly what is said about the different parts of the world. Therefore, it is necessary to furnish them with information that will acquaint them with what they are likely to experience on coming to Australia, 12,000 or 13,000 miles from the country in which they reside. Therefore, the Commonwealth Government would do well to have proper and attractive literature prepared and circulated in the Agricultural districts of Great Britain, where we might succeed in inducing the right class of people we want to come here. There are about 400,000,000 acres of land unalienated in Queensland, some of it being as good as any to be found in other States. It only needs population of the right class. Many young fellows, second and third sons of farmers, who have been squeezed out for want of room in the southern parts of Australia, including Victoria, have taken up holdings in the Wide Bay district and gone in for maize-growing, dairying, &amp;c., with remarkable success. They could not be induced to return to Victoria. There is more scope for them in Queensland, where land can be got for Â£1 or Â£2 per acre equal to land in Victoria and other States now being sold to soldiers at from Â£40 to Â£60 per acre. If we could settle more of these soldier immigrants on land where they would not be called upon to ppy such a heavy rate of interest on their borrowings on land and on taxation, we would have a more contented body of settlers. I do not claim that the soldiers who have settled in Victoria will not make a success of their efforts - I hope sincerely that they will do so - but how much greater would be their success when settled on land in Queensland at the price at which it is available there? </para>

                                <para>- I should be pleased to take the honorable member through part of my electorate, where, in one place alone, there are 4,000,000 acres now grazing cattle, but excellently suited for closer settlement. I refer to the Burnett North land, through which the Assistant. Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> accompanied me quite recently. The Minister was astounded at what he saw. We travelled from 200 to 300 miles through country covered with grass1 foot to 3 feet high. There is no poor soil in it. Though there are 90,000 acres of scrub country, the soil on which that scrub grows is as good as any to be seen in any other part of the Commonwealth. It is mostly plain, lightly-timbered country, well watered with creeks. In fact, the average rainfall there for very many years has been  30 inches per annum. There is nothing to prevent a large population being settled on that particular area if a proper policy is adopted. When I was a member of the Queensland Parliament, the Liberal Government did all it possibly could to encourage people to settle on. the land, and under an Act passed at that time every man who acquired land had twenty-one years in which to pay for it. No repayments were required for the first five years, but interest and principal repayments had to be made up to half the purchase money to the end of twenty years, and the balance in the following year. A settler was advanced Â£200 to cover the cost of work he performed - Â£1 for Â£1 on twenty-one years' terms. He was also advanced 15s. in the Â£1 to enable him to purchase stock and clear and cultivate his land to the extent of a further Â£1,000. </para>

                                <para>- I believe you did in one direction. The legislation to which I have referred was passed for the purpose of encouraging the right type of settler to take up land in Queensland ; and if a similar policy were  adopted  by the States, working in conjunction with the Commonwealth, much would be done to remove the present difficulties. The  honorabe  member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Ryan)</inline> said that the Government of which he was a member improved the Act. Unfortunately, they created a good deal of dissatisfaction, and interfered with their land-settlement policy by refusing  to give settlers the freehold. Under the Act passed bv the Labour Government, land could be acquired only on perpetual lease, and under this policy men in other parts of Australia, and some from abroad, who intended settling in Queensland, were afraid to go on the land. I do not know whether there is any real need for the fears which exist in this regard, but our forefathers were always in favour of possessing the fee-simple. In Queensland we have 400,000,000 acres of unalienated land, and settlement would more rapidly expand if the fee-simple were given. In connexion with the North Burnett lands, an effort was made to obtain an advance of Â£2,000,000 from the Commonwealth Government; but one of the great difficulties confronting the authorities was the tenure on which the land could be secured for soldiers. </para>

If the State Governments were to adopt the present immigration policy of Victoria, many of our present difficulties would disappear. That is the system I am now advocating. </para>

                                <para>- If it were a question of reaching the coast by aeroplane, it might be, but business cannot be done in that way. There is no reason why Â£1,000,000 should be spent in cutting through Dawes Range when there is level country right up to a natural port of which this is the hinterland. I stress this point because I know that many of my friends in the south have  little  interest in Queensland and its possibilities. Honorable  members should realize that large areas of land are available in Queensland, on which men can set to work and make a good living if. we have good land laws and an adequate railway system. The proper course is for a Sta te Government to submit a workable scheme to the Commonwealth Government, and if the Treasurer can advance the necessary money the Commonwealth Government should assist. </para>

                            <para>.- At the outset I wish to make it clear that I hold the opinion that Australia must be adequately populated if it is to develop into the great self-contained country which we all desire to see it. That, I take it, is a statement of a common ground upon which all honorable members can meet. It is further held by all that a large portion of the desired new population must come from overseas, and that that immigration should be from the British Isles. Then, what is the gravamen of the complaint of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> who has been supported on this side of the House, and by some honorable members opposite and in the Corner - among the latter, notably, the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> ? The honorable member for Hunter complains that the Government is introducing immigrants in large numbers without making provision for them. </para>

                                <para>- It is not my habit to make or support a baseless accusation. The charge is that immigrants are being sent or brought out to Australia without provision having been made for their absorption here, and at a time when this country is already teeming with unemployed. It will be admitted by all honorable members that there is a tremendous amount of unemployment in Australia today. It arises largely from the closing down of great works - of mines such as Mount Morgan and Mount Lyell, and of Federal Government activities at Cockatoo Island in circumstances which I do not feel at liberty to comment upon, because of my membership of the Royal Commission which is now engaged in inquiring into the whole matter. I shall put before honorable members statistical details which I received only to-day regarding unemployment in this State, and I wish to add that the figures do not cover the full field of unemployment. My information shows that in the Brick, Tile, and Pottery Union there are 550 unemployed; bootmakers, 400; clothing trade, 2,100; rubber workers, about 800; timber workers,900; Victoria-Riverina branch of the Australian Workers Union, 5,000; carpenters (metropolitan area), 300; shop assistants and warehouse employees, 800; pastrycooks, 300; liquor trades, &amp;c., 400; building industries, 1,000; manufacturing grocers, 500; and fodder and fuel employees, 500. Besides these, I believe that a telegram has been received to-day from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vickers,</inline> secretary of the Coal and Shale Miners Organization at Wonthaggi, stating that 50 employees at Morwell have been paid off, and that all applications for further employment there have been refused. </para>

                        <para>I am sorry that some honorable members have seen fit to single out for special criticism New South Wales and Queensland, because Labour Governments happen to be in control there. It should not be  lost  sight of that New South Wales has nearly as great a total population as two or three of the other States put together. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to hear that, because I was under the impression that some honorable members had said that the conditions were due to the fact that Labour Governments were in power in New South Wales and Queensland. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has had committed to it the control of immigration. Immigration  does not consist solely of, or begin and end with putting advertisements in English and Continental newspapers and bringing immigrants out here. It also includes making provision for the newcomers when they have reached Australia.. It. is the duty of the Government to see that conditions are made so attractive, and the development of the scheme of immigration advanced to such a state, that when the immigrants have reached our shores they can be immediately absorbed. </para>

                                <para>- That suggests the raising of another loan. A Government cannot build railways for nothing. I take it that the honorable member for Moreton will be one of the principal contributors to such a loan. But I say that the Commonwealth Government, upon whom rests the duty of repatriating our returned soldiers and conducting a national scheme of immigration, must accept responsibility for providing funds necessary to open up those lands for settlement. </para>

The Commonwealth Government went so far as to send up a person to report upon these lands. The reason advanced by the Treasurer for the failure of the Commonwealth to provide the necessary money for this purpose is that he has not got it. That is the best of all reasons. If he has not got it he cannot provide it. But the obligation rests upon the Commonwealth to take a hand in the development of these lands. </para>

                                <para>- I hope that it will. The point is that Queensland has more of the goods to make available, and therefore the Commonwealth Government should not permit these lands to remain idle when they can be made wealth-producing. In conclusion, I desire to refer to the statement that immigrants are returning to Great Britain. The press has given us to understand this morning that a large number of immigrants are returning, because they are unable to find employment here. </para>

No matter to what party we belong, we are all concerned in the welfare of the country, and it would be unfortunate if party considerations entered into a question of this sort. I hope the Government will face the question as it ought to be faced, and see that the evil which is arising is put an end to once and for all time. </para>

                                <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has said that I would sacrifice the extension of this line to the North Burnett, for the purpose of settling returned soldiers or immigrants, merely because it does not exactly follow the route that I favour. I desire it to be distinctly understood that I have never opposed the construction of a line to open up the North Burnett country. I strongly advocated the building of the railway along the route proposed by a Queensland Liberal Government, and passed by both Houses of Parliament. The construction of the line to which the honorable member has been referring, however, was opposed by the best experts obtainable. The proposal made by the Queensland Liberal Government was varied by a subsequent Labour Government, and that variation, involving the scheme which the honorable member is now advocating, was condemned in the most exhaustive reports by the railway, land, and other experts. I have copies of those reports, and they are open to perusal by honorable members. The scheme which the honorable member has been advocating, was turned down on no fewer than four occasions by the Queensland Legislative Council. I make this explanation in order that it may not go forth that I am opposed to the opening up of the Burnett country. </para>

                            <para>. - The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> in drawing attention to this matter, has done good service to the public. Even if it be true that the number of immigrants returning to Great Britain is but small, it is well that we should meet the situation before it develops to such an extent as to lead to the return of large numbers, and the undoing of the work that a number of highly- paid Commonwealth officers have been endeavouring to carry out in Great Britain. The  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> said that the debate had done some good in that it had brought out the fact that the Labour party were not opposed to immigration. I think the debate has also brought out another important fact, since the honorable member for Dampier, who has been the bridge-builder for the Government in this Parliament, said that henceforth he was going to do his utmost to bring about a dissolution. I hope that the Government have taken a note of that threat, and that the newspaper people, who have been pointing out lately the inconsistencies of the. Country party, will keep watch over the actions of its  Deputy  Leader. If they do, I think they will find that, in making this threat, he was after all indulging only in hot air. </para>

                        <para>There may be a few followers of the Labour party who are so short-sighted as to think that we do not need to increase the population of Australia by means of immigration, but they are in a hopeless minority. I believe it is the feeling of the Labour party that the Government should, by every means in its power, endeavour to secure an increased population for the country that it governs. I and other honorable members of our party, however, take the stand that before the Government seeks to encourage immigration,' it should bring about such economic conditions as will lead to a natural increase in our population. Its first duty is to prevent the exploitation of the masses. It should try to remove the conditions that make it possible for us to have twenty-three Australian millionaires while hundreds of thousands of our people are compelled to live under economic conditions which lead to their practising the doctrine of Malthusianism. </para>

                                <para>- There are existing to-day, and have been existing for some time, conditions which compel many of the working classes to limit their families. The Government should remove the conditions which lead to that sort of thing. If they tried and failed - and this Government has not yet even tried to remove those conditions - I should be prepared to go further, and to endeavour to encourage a natural increase in our population by means of child endowments, so that people with families of three and over would not be pushed into the position of feeling it absolutely necessary to limit the natural increase. After those two things had been done, I would be prepared to agree that we should reach out overseas to try to bring a suitable class of immigrants to our shores. </para>

                        <para>Speaking generally, honorable members seem to be looking at this question from two different aspects. Some on the other side - and I am glad there have been exceptions) - seem to look at it from the aspect of bringing into this country numbers of immigrants for the purpose of flooding the labour market and injuriously affecting the conditions we enjoy, thus helping some of the main supporters of their own party. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> for instance, said that the mines were closed at Mount Morgan, Mount Lyell, and a number of other places. He did not put it in so many words, but he seemed to suggest, from the fact that those places were closed down at present, that by introducing immigrants those big companies would be able to find the necessary labour to carry on their, concerns. If that is the idea he has in mind, he must remember that the miners in the Old Country are not what they were some twenty years ago. To-day they are equally as militant as, if not more militant than, the miners here. He is making a mistake if he thinks that by bringing them here it would be possible to force the Australian miners to accept lower wages and worse conditions. If such a thing were attempted he would find that it did not have the effect that he desires. The honorable member for "Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> also - and I quote these things to show the idea behind the minds of certain honorable members in regard to bringing immigrants to Australia - said that in South Australia there was a shortage of labour, and that after the last harvest men who had been working on the harvest were offered positions at Â£4 per week and keep, but refused the work. </para>

                                <para>- I am trying to deal with the impression that the honorable member sought to create. " One swallow does not make a summer." I will grant readily to the honorable member the fact that after harvest some men can be found who desire to get back to town, and will not stay in the country. The impression I want to combat is that at the present time there is no unemployment in South Australia, and that if jobs at Â£4 per week and keep are offered, men cannot be got to take them. The honorable member can get all the men he wants in South Australia at that rate if there is any chance of continuity of employment. Many married men would go from our towns for those wages. </para>

                                <para>- The Treasurer is trying to draw a distinction between the men the Government bring out here and those who come out themselves. If people sufficiently independent to come here on their own account, paying their own passages, are in the position of needing such help as the right honorable gentleman has given or has offered to give, it seems to me to confirm the statement which was made in the press, and rather to show the necessity for the exercise of extreme caution and care in bringing people here. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad the right honorable gentleman has given the House information to-day, because it has to a certain extent removed our fear that the Government were not watchful, and were going to allow this country to be flooded as the large employers of labour might wish. The Treasurer said that a man with two children came to him for work. I am glad the Treasurer was humane enough, with the responsibilities of the Commonwealth on his shoulders, to think of a man who needed work, but he had to send that man away to another State to get the employment he wanted. The Treasurer previously said that there is in this country room and work for tens of thousands of men, but when it came to the handling of one case he found that he could not place a man in Victoria. </para>

                                <para>- I remember the Treasurer making that statement, and was glad about a week ago to read something similar in the newspapers. I do not desire to detract from the good work that Victoria has done, but some honorable members on the other side seem to want to propagate the idea that there is no unemployment in this country, and that, therefore, there is no need for us to be careful in bringing people from overseas. If we allow people to enter indiscriminately, we are likely to do an injury, not only to the people who are here, but also to those who come to us. In time, if that happens, it will reflect back on those who are overseas and who may desire to come here later. </para>

                            <para>. - The debate, I think, has done a great deal of good ; and the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will admit, I hope, that the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> did not launch the motion for the adjournment of the House in any bitter party spirit. The debate has cleared the atmosphere wonderfully, but it will be of little use unless the organization to promote immigration is going to be set in motion almost immediately. </para>

                                <para>- It seems to me that there is a lamentable lack of organization on the part of both the Federal and the State Governments in the distribution of these additions to our population ; and personally, I deplore that in a country like Australia there should be any talk about unemployment insurance, because it is a reflection upon our Parliaments,  and I am prepared to accept my own share of the. responsibility. It is extraordinary that in a territory comprising about 3,000,000 square miles there should be any cry about unemployment. It is my firm conviction that if we had a really good Tariff for the protection of our industries, there would be plenty of employment. I should like to bring under the notice of the Treasurer a striking article, entitled "The Migration of the Races," which appears in the last quarterly issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Round Table.</inline></para>

                            <para>The British Empire itself comprises the best of the unpeopled parts of the earth, and yet the bulk of its white inhabitants are still concentrated in a couple of small islands in the North Sea. In Great Britain alone there are nearly 360 people to the square mile, while in Australia and Canada, though allowance must be made for large barren tracts, there are less than three. The problem is not, however, simply how to transport people from countries which have too many to those which have too few. For one thing, even under the most favorable circumstances, the latter can only absorb a certain number at a time, and the rate varies with their respective conditions, which themselves are constantly changing, nnd often already as complex as those of the Old World. There are, moreover, elements which cannot, from their nature, be absorbed at all. The qualities that immigrants are bringing to their adopted countries to-day are, indeed, of supreme importance, for their children will be the great nations of to-morrow; and it is as true of a people as of an individual that the child is father of the man. The future of the world itself largely depends upon these third class ocean passengers. To attempt to consider the emigration question in compartments would be useless, for it is bound up with cosmic problems whose roots intertwine far below the surface, and they affect every people. </para>

                        <para class="block">The article goes on to deal with immigration as it has affected America, and points out that, notwithstanding, since 1917, restrictions, including a literary test, have been passed by the American Congress upon intending immigrants, of late years the wrong type of people have been flowing into that country. We want to be sure that we secure the introduction of a virile people into this young country, and we know that the most virile people in the world are those who come from British stock ; but in order to absorb thom satisfactorily we must so organize our land policy as to provide for more settlement, and we can best do that by cooperation between the Federal and State Governments. If we adopt such a scheme, there will be no need for full-page advertisements in the various journals of the Old Country, because Australia will be known for what it is - God's own country- to quote the words of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Seddon in his references to New Zealand. The article from which I have quoted states that in Australia, between 1861 and 1918, our population increased to the extent of only 800,000 by immigration, as compared with an addition of over 3,000,000 people by natural increase. We are all agreed that the best immigrants are the Australian babies. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> stated that because of our difficult social conditions people with limited incomes are limiting their families, but I think it will be generally admitted that the working people in every part of the world have the largest families. If the Acting Prime Minister thinks that the present scheme of immigration is not sufficient to meet all requirements, I can assure him that any assistance we on this side of the House can give him to provide more employment for immigrants, especially after insuring employment for our own people, will be readily given. I think that a committee of experts should be appointed to go into this question and present a scheme for the approval of Parliament. In this way, it is likely wo shall be able to do something that will be of benefit to the country. This debate has done a great deal of good, but it will be of no use. unless, as a result of this discussion, we can agree upon some workable scheme to guard against unemployment. In Germany, in pre-war times, if employment were lacking in one part of the Empire, it was found in another, and the Government assisted the workmen in transport and so forth. Germany was a thoroughly developed country, whereas Australia is undeveloped, and it is for us to make the most of our wonderful heritage. </para>

                    <para>My French neighbour tells me that a surveyor is coming here. He has bought 60 hectares. Whether the natives sold 60 'hectares or not, he has bought the land from another white man, and he claims, and will get, 60 hectares. He has leased the entire island of Uripiv, with the exception of the few acres owned by the mission. As it has passed from one white man to another, he holds his claim cannot be disputed. He says the natives will only own their houses and gardens. This will be done throughout the group. That it is unjust goes for nothing. Any land sold by either British or French Government holds good as a title deed. That means the death-knell of the natives. Can you not put the whole church on to pray for British annexation? lt suits the French that no Land Court should meet. The longer it is delayed the better. Meantime, the French will carry on with a vigorous and high hand. I have seen their claim to Uripiv, which includes every acre except that owned by the mission. The claims, having been resold from one white man to another, will all be upheld. My neighbour feels that he is in the right with me, and the case is hopeless unless the islands are annexed very soon to Britain. The Frenchman asked me to bring my title deeds to the surveyor, who would then take 60 hectares all up the valley. I only said I would show my marks and consult the lawyer as to the rest. I told him it was a legal matter, the land belonged to the church, and that I would take no responsibility. This man can seize Uripiv any time he likes. And there is this_to be said for the French, that they have paid cash for preposterous claims, and the newcomers in good faith expect full value. The price of cotton sent them mad with the idea of big fortunes. In the event of the New Hebrides not being annexed by Britain, the French will bring in labour. It may be  Tonquin  Chinese; it may be Japanese; but it will be a large and virile mongrel population. In the end, Australia will pay the penalty. I am told that, while Noumea sent 8,000,000 francs worth of trade to France last year, New Hebrides sent nearly 20,000,000 francs worth. Much of that cotton was grown by Britishers, or bought by Britishers from the natives. Cotton will still pay well this year. Another thing, the price the French pay for property in the Kew Hebrides just now sounds very big, as the exchange makes their money only half its old value. But if the Land Court sits in ten years, as the French expect, then the  chances  -are that the exchange will be par, and so properties will have a double value in law. Every year the Land. Court does not sit helps the French. They have all our title deeds studied. They seem now to be making a move to claim all land that we do not claim, and, as you know, their title deeds will cover more hectares than the New Hebrides land covers. The Condominium says natives are to enjoy sufficient land for their sustenance. We interpret that as a fair living. The French interpret that as a few breadfruits round a village, their yam gardens, and none of their coconut plantations. That means no clothes, unless they work for French masters, and no redress - worse than former Russian serfdom. I reported the case of a woman illegally recruited, without her husband's permission. A friendly Frenchman said, " You will find the French Government will allow that." The woman has not been returned. What is the use of a Condominium except to aid French aggression till such time as it is convenient for her to take the islands? Wc are in the position of dispossessed Koreans, with this exception, that the British here arc jointly responsible. And undoubtedly Australia will in the long run pay the penalty, for God watches. I do not think the French nation, with their decreasing population and increasing African interests, will, 100 years hence, own the islands; but if Australia does not act now, she will suffer then. </para>

                    is a prominent member of the Presbyterian Church, and he thus draws attention to the state of affairs in the Kev/ Hebrides. I rise for the purpose of asking the Acting Prime Minister whether he will have this matter inquired into, and, if the evils  suggested exist, make representations with a view to having them removed.

                    <para>.- I should like to add a few words to what has been said by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan).</inline> I visited the islands when we were removing the last  remnant of slavery in Australia, and I found that I had no need to criticise, though that was the intention with which I went there. I found that everything possible was being done to place the kanakas back in their old homes by Burns, Philp, and Company, and I did not see one single instance to which I could take exception. However, it seems to me that the Commonwealth Government are faced with a great difficulty. My experience of the traders led me to believe that they did not like the Presbyterian missionaries, but preferred those representing the French and Anglican churches. It has to be said, however, to the honour of the Presbyterian Church, that it gave their missionaries a good chance. On the average, the best paid men return the best work, and the result of a policy of this kind, under the Presbyterian organization, is that nearly the whole of the islands are under the control of the Presbyterian missionaries. The Presbyterian church prepares beforehand, for a missionary, a good house, with water and sanitary arrangements all complete. Speaking from memory, I believe the Presbyterian missionary is paid about Â£200 per year, with an allowance for every child. Every third summer he is given six months' holiday in order that he may visit the mainland of Australia, and every seventh summer he is provided with a second-class saloon passage to any part of Europe or North America, from where the original missionary, who was massacred, came. It is interesting to compare this treatment with that given to the French missionaries. Knowing how patriotic Frenchmen are, I asked one French priest when he was going to visit his beloved France, and I shall never forget his answer, " Moi, jamais!  Je reste  ici  jusqu'  a la mort" (I stay here until I die). That man's income was only Â£40 a year. In the case of the Anglican church I found there were missionaries who had had to pay a bonus in order to get their positions. The settlers there do not particularly want to come under the Australian flag; they seem to wish to remain under the British flag, for which I do not blame them, if they think they will benefit thereby. The traders I met did not care for the Presbyterian Mission; but honorable members must determine for themselves whether it was because the missionaries are fighting for the cause of humanity. </para>

                <para class="block">France in regard to the New Hebrides. The last war has removed many misunderstandings between the two peoples, and I trust that the lies which used to be in circulation about the French will never be repeated. With a common-sense man at the head of the British office, instead of some of the blatant fools who have been there in the past, much could be done. I think that an exchange of territory might be effected, France concentrating her colonizing energy upon Africa. As a member never will vote or voice of mine be used to cause ill-will between these two great nations, which are now more than brothers. Australia has a vast territory, of which only the fringe is populated, and which it will take, not 100. but 1,000 years to develop. The future of the New Hebrides, too, is a great one. But the war has made the nations and the peoples of the world nervy, and care and consideration will be necessary to prevent ill-feeling. I noticed that the French settlers in the New Hebrides generally had gardens, and grew their own vegetables, and that the English and Australian settlers, for the most part, seemed too busy seeking for dollars to worry about the appearance of their surroundings. I had over 100 landings at different places, and was always given a good welcome, and I found that the thirteen Presbyterian parsons of whom I had charge were a splendid lot of fellows. The Acting Prime Minister has my fullest sympathy, and I hope that by no word or action will the slightest friction be caused in this matter between Great Britain and France. </para>

I am informed that, just before leaving for England, the Prime Minister ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes)</inline> received a large deputation from the Presbyterian Church regarding the New Hebrides, and promised to look into their complaints when in London. That, however, is hearsay; I have not read the report of the meeting. I think it is rather a pity that these important questions should be raised without some intimation to the Government beforehand that it is the intention of honorable members to refer to them. This matter is brought before the House now, and I know nothing whatever about it that is fresh. I am not, therefore, iri a position to give a satisfactory answer. All I can say is that I hope that no friction will occur, and that we shall do our best to prevent anything of the kind. </para>
