                            <para>- The Commonwealth Government is pledged to pay a certain price - I forget for the moment the exact amount -for all cotton grown in the Commonwealth; but since it entered into this guarantee the organization for the encouragement of the production of cotton within the British Empire, which has its head-quarters in Great Britain, has guaranteed &#39; a still higher price, and, consequently, our offer lis for the time being inoperative, and no action is required to be taken by this Parliament at the present time. We are matching the position closely, and as it is the desire of the Government to encourage the growing of cotton in Australia, we shall take such action as the circumstances may warrant. </para>

A deputation, consisting of the honorable member, the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs), Senator Crawford, Senator Glasgow,</inline> and others, waited on me last week, and the same gentlemen have seen me on other occasions ; and I have promised that if and when the Government contemplates dealing with the sugar question, or considers that circumstances demand further action, it will consult the members of this Parliament who are directly interested before it formulates its policy. The honorable member may accept my assurance that that will be done. At the present time, these matters have not received the consideration of the Government; but probably some time next year they may require attention. Until then, nothing will be done. </para>

It is stated in the paper which I propose to lay on the table that the New Hebrides Company say that, failing immediate acceptance, they must deal elsewhere. I do not know that we are really concerned in the matter as a Government; but, as the offer has been made to me, I put it before Parliament, so that honorable members can share the responsibility of dealing with it. I now lay the paper on the table. </para>

                        <para>Australia&#39;s Interests in Newhebrides. </para>
                        <para>Since 1902 the Commonwealth Government has spent approximately &#163;134,000 in New Hebrides - &#163;22,000 for assistance to settlers in preparing land claims, &#163;4,000 in refund of Customs duties, and about &#163;108,000 on a steamer service. </para>
                        <para>Australia naturally gets the bulk of the export trade as a result of this latter expenditure. </para>
                        <para>Our main interest, however, lies in the fact that the natives of New Hebrides are decreasing, and labour must be imported. The French own the bulk of the land, and it is understood are anxious to import Asiatic labour. The presence of any considerable number of Asiatics so near Australia, especially as we pursue a policy of exclusion in our own island territories, would be embarrassing and possibly dangerous. </para>
                        <para>The French own 600,000 hectares out of a total of 1,200,000 hectares of land. The natives own about 522,000 hectares. </para>
                        <para>A French company known as the Societe Francaise des Nouvelles Hebrides is the owner of the 600,000 hectares above mentioned, and in addition has been granted trading concessions in the group. The company is willing to sell its property and trading concessions for 25,000,000 francs (about &#163;500,000). All the bases and ports except Port  Olry  form part of the company&#39;s land, and are susceptible of exclusive private ownership with unrestricted sea rights. </para>
                        <para>The possibility of the sale to British interests has been disclosed to the French Government, and it is stated that the transaction will meet with no objection on their part. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">On this point I cannot speak officially. </para>
                    <para>The purchase of this property by British interests would reverse the present position so far as dominant land ownership in the group is concerned, and such would pass from French to British control. </para>
                    <para>It is understood that Japan is pressing the sellers for an offer failing Australian acceptance. </para>
                    <para>On the 13th October a cable was received making an I offer to arrange payment by bonds maturing over five years - 7,000,000 francs maturing the first year, 3,000,000 the second year, 5,000,000 each of the three following years - bonds for full amount being deposited at time of purchase and maturing accordingly. It was added that if this offer did not suit, an endeavour to meet Commonwealth wishes would be made; but payment in francs was insisted on, or if in another currency in cash or security for which francs could be obtained now, in order to avoid possible loss of present advantageous exchange, which naturally greatly reduces the cost in sterling. </para>
                    <para>On the 21st October a cable . was received stating that the company was holding a general meeting on the 27th October, and would greatly appreciate any information available before that date. No reply to this cable has been made. A further cable in the following terms was received on 1st instant: - &#34;New Hebrides Company state that failing immediate acceptance they must deal elsewhere. Please telegraph. Private American now trying to negotiate.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The House may discuss the question to-day, but I am afraid I shall not be here, because I have to attend the Premiers&#39; Conference. The reason why I am opposed to the acceptance of the offer is that I do not think the purchase of the land would place us in the position suggested in the paper. Even if it would, whether the land itself is worth the money is a matter on which I am not able to express an opinion. I do not know the land. I know, however, that the Condominium, which it is proposed to continue, is most unsatisfactory. I shall make available all the information I hare. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. The Condominium would remain exactly as before. The point raised by the honorable member is a vital one. Labour laws have been the real cause of the trouble in the past, and even if we did acquire this land the control would remain exactly as it is. It is an integral part of the Condominium. I have no doubt that the missionary societies would strongly favour the purchase of this land by the Commonwealth, but the question is whether we would be able to get a good title for it. If honorable members desire it, I will have prepared a statement giving a legal opinion, for what it is worth, as to our position in regard to this land if we acquired it, but I doubt very much whether we would get a clear  title. All the titles to land must come before the Condominium Court. Honorable members know how that Court is constituted. ..If the natives said, &#34;We do not admit that we sold this land,&#34; and the Court held that their contention was right, I do not know that we could get a clear title. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member has said also that he is opposed to the purchase of the land, and since that is his view it might have been said of him later on had he failed to take this action, that he had allowed the Commonwealth to miss an opportunity to acquire this interest in the New Hebrides. The offer was made some months ago, and we should have been given a chance before this to consider it. As it is, an endeavour should be made to obtain an extension of the option for some months, so that Parliament may deliberately deal with the whole matter. I am not committing myself in any way, since it would be ill-advised to express an opinion on a proposal of which one knows practically nothing. We have not the information to enable us to discuss the merits of the question at this stage. All we know is that an offer has been made by a French company to dispose of certain vested interests in the New Hebrides. It is prepared to sell 600,000 hectares of land to us for &#163;500,000, but, in the absence of further information, we cannot deal with the offer. I rise now merely to protest against the Prime Minister&#39;s action in allowing this matter to remain in abeyance right up to the last moment, and then making it an urgent one. </para>

                        <para>.- In 1915 a Royal Commission was appointed at the instance of the then Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahon)</inline> to visit the New Hebrides, and make inquiries into postal matters generally.  Many  complaints had been made with regard to the manner in which Messrs. Burns, , Philp and Company were conducting the mail service. A voluminous report was prepared by that Commission, and from it a good deal of information may be obtained regarding matters referred to in the document now before the House. Before leaving for Europe the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisher)</inline> suggested that the Royal Commission&#39;s inquiry should take a wider area than that of postal services, and embrace any matters in the New Hebrides considered to be of importance; and the result was that the Commission presented two reports, which I suggest honorable members should consult. </para>

                        <para>. - Like the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> I have visited the New Hebrides, where a good deal of dissension and difficulty arises out of the Condominium, in the administration of which a Spanish gentleman was appointed Chief Justice for the settlement of land claims. If Australia is not content with the vast area within her own frontiers, and desires the whole of the New Hebrides, then by all means we ought to carry out this purchase. The area is 600,000 hectares, which, at2&#189; acres to the hectare, means 1,500,000 acres. Considering the climate, with the heavy rainfall and the richness of the soil, the amount involved does not mean an expensive investment. </para>

                        <para>.- It is som.ewhat difficult to deal now with the questions that have been placed before the Chamber, and I hope that some honorable member will move the adjournment of the debate, so that we may have an opportunity of discussing them on a future date with fuller information at our command. It appears to me that the main  question is whether theFrench company shall sell its rights and interests to the Australian Government, and we have very little information as to the real value of those rights and interests. For a considerable time there has been anxiety connected with the control of the New Hebrides. The Condominium has nob been a success, and during the last six or seven months there has been much correspondence in the newspapers, particularly in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> on the affairs of the New Hebrides. Apparently the question of the Condominium and that of general control was considered some time ago, and it is in this regard that Parliament feels some anxiety; perhaps, more than in regard to the purchase of the lands held by the French company. This purchase may be essential, of course, to proper control, but without the fullest information it is not possible for honorable members to form any opinion as to the value of the option, and what action should be taken. If the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> feels any anxiety about laying these papers on the table of the Library, I suggest that he might make them available to honorable members in his own office, so that any one feeling a special interest , would be able to peruse them. I feel quite sure that if this debate be adjourned, and the papers are made available as I have suggested, a good purpose would be served, the Government could then at any time afford us an opportunity of an immediate discussion of the subject. </para>

                <para class="block">For a number of years past a small fixed duty per gallon has been imposed on varnishes, and by that means we have built up, to some extent, the manufacture of low-grade varnishes. But, owing to the fact that the fixed rate represents an almost infinitesimal <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on the higher grade of varnishes, nobody attempted, until after the outbreak of war, to manufacture them locally. During the war considerable progress was made in this respect, and we decided to provide for an alternative <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty upon high-grade varnishes, that being the only effective method of protection. The mere increasing of the fixed rate of duty would not achieve that purpose, because it would provide too high a rate of protection on the lower grades of varnishes, but would not give sufficient protection on the higher grades unless it were made so high as to become an absurd impost on the lower grades. The only way to give satisfactory protection to both classes is to have a fixed rate of duty on the lower grades and an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on the higher grades. </para>

The Committee would be taking a retrograde step if it were to do anything to destroy what has already been achieved. If the manufac-&#39; turers of high-grade varnishes abroad care to come here and set up their works, as manufacturers of other commodities have done, good luck to them. The more experience of that character we can gain the better. </para>

                        <para>- I receive protests from all sides - from the manufacturers that the duty is quite inadequate for their purpose, and from the users that the duty is ruinous. Between the Scylla and Charybdis, represented by the opposing interests, the Minister  has to steer what he considers a safe path. The 25 per cent. duty formerly agreed to by the Committee is reasonable ; it certainly is not excessive. I willingly admit that it is a considerable advance on the fixed rate of duty, hut I repeat that the latter is simply a revenue duty on the higher grades of varnish, and does not produce the result for which we look. </para>

                        <para>- I should say that Great Britain sends us the bulk of the varnishes we use, but there is also a considerable importation from America. During the war large establishments for the manufacture of varnishes were brought into existence, and high quality varnishes are being produced to-day which in years gone by the local manufacturer could not attempt to make. The Committee would do well to adhere to the duties to which it originally agreed. </para>

                        <para>- During the general discussion on the Tariff I said that I would vote for any duty which I considered fair, and throughout the schedule I have been consistent in my attitude. I have not voted to impose duties on articles simply because they were produced in my electorate, but that influence has been at work in regard to the local manufacture of varnishes. We have heard all the high Protectionists in this Committee express the desire that the manufacturers should get a fair price for their product, hut I have heard very few say that they wished the. consumer to be supplied at a fair price. </para>

                        <para>- That time has lasted long enough. The varnish being made in Australia at the present time is sold at, say, 17 s. per gallon. The British varnish, which this item affects, is sold at 34s. per gallon. Therefore, the consumers will be penalized by every additional penny of duty we impose. If the fact that the price of the British article is 100 per cent. higher is not sufficient Protection for the local product, . the Australian manufacturer is not worth his salt. Some honorable members seem to think that it is our duty to make&#39; the imposts upon all imports as high as we possibly can. They are doing nothing to protect the users of varnishes. One statement has been made with the deliberate intention of injuring the reputation of imported varnishes. It has been said that the British varnish is thinned down after importation to a consistency of one in three. British varnish is left in vats for twelve or twenty-four months and then tinned in gallon measures and exported. It would be spoiled if any attempt were made to thin it down. I am told, not only by varnishing firms, but also by people who are excellent authorities on the subject, that it is not possible to do so. The only effect of increasing the duty will be to increase the cost of the best class of work. The Minister says that he is not in favour of having a fixed rate of duty on the better quality varnishes, but the Australian manufacturer should not require more than a fair handicap in the race of competition with the British manufacturer, whose output is absolutely necessary and is used on a great deal of Government work. A very unjust differentiation will be created by the adoption of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate on the higher quality varnishes. The oils used in some of the local varnishes are not of good quality. Any painter will admit that the linseed oil used at the present time is quite inferior to that which was imported in pre-war days. Quite recently I had the exterior woodwork of my house painted. I already had a 5-gallon drum of the old linseed oil, but the painter I employed used the ordinary linseed oil of the present time. In two months one would not have known that the house had been painted. </para>

                        <para>- The linseed oil used on  my job absolutely spoiled it. I had to go over it again with some of the oil I had in my 5-gallon tin. On another occasion I bought Australian linseed oil to oil the jarrah portions of my house, because jarrah is too good a timber to paint. In three months one would not have known that anything had been done to the lattice work. 1 had again to use some of my British oil to go over that work. The duty imposed should be sufficient to put the Australian article on a fair footing, with just a slight, advantage in the competitive race with the imported article, but the present proposal before the Committee is absolute Tariff madness. The local article which is claimed to be as good as the British article costing 34s. per gallon can be sold at 17s. per gallon, and yet the manufacturers want the duty increased. It is unreasonable. We are now building motor car bodies, which require the very best quality of paints and varnishes. If Australian varnishes are used in preference to British, the difference can easily be detected in three months. My contention is that if a man is anxious to do good work and is willing to pay 100 per cent, more for the best varnishes, that 100 per cent, increased cost should be quite sufficient to give the Australian manufacturer an opportunity of establishing the varnish-making industry. </para>

                    <para>. - No Tariffist can argue that this particular duty is necessary to make Australia self-contained, that general shibboleth used by high Tariffists being blown out in this case because all the raw materials necessary for making varnish have to be imported. In these circumstances, the imposition of an increased duty for the purpose of establishing an unnatural industry will merely tend to increase the cost of living. Otherwise those people who are engaged in polishing furniture and kindred occupations will be obliged to work with inferior material as against the better-quality article produced by firms elsewhere who have been established for centuries. This duty will not help Australia to build up a natural industry. - Therefore I shall vote in the direction of agreeing to the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

                        <para>- Influenced possibly by some considerations affecting his electorate, the honorable member certainly tried to induce the Minister to put a duty on the raw material for the making of varnish, and now he complains when the Committee seeks to give protection to the manufactured article. He is not consistent. He is like a lot of others who are staunch Free Traders on occasions and very staunch Protectionists when something affects them personally or affects their constituencies. My friend tells the Committee that the Australian varnish is of an inferior quality. No one would suggest that the Victorian Railways would be prepared to use anything cheap and nasty. The whole tendency in Government services in making purchases of stores is to get the very best. Yet this Department, having had the Australian varnishes analyzed hy chemists and subjected to very high tests, has accepted them in -open competition for use on railway work. </para>

Surely Australian varnish is not to be condemned merely because the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. FoleY)</inline> is not satisfied with the result which he obtained by putting oil on a house in Western Australia.

He said that Australian varnish is inferior to imported varnish because of the oil used in it. He found fault with the quality of Australian linseed oil. He said that that oil is not as good now as it was in prewar days. I do not know that the honorable member would recognise good varnish if he saw it. I admit that I would not, though I might be able to say whether a job done with a particular varnish was a good or a bad job. Bad workmen are accustomed to blame either their tools or their material, and the honorable member, after varnishing a house, possibly laying on the varnish as if it were whitewash, appears to have been dissatisfied wilh the result, and blames the Australian varnish for it. When he was speaking there was within the Chamber a gentleman who knows something about varnish, he being a. representative of a Victorian varnish company. This gentleman says that the local oil has been very regular in quality. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable member for Kalgoorlie would not admit it. He must have used imported, not local, oil, because, according to my information, the local oil has been regular in quality, and of a fair sample. The suggestion of the honorable member was that before the war the Australian oil was good, but that in pure cussedness the local manufacturers are now producing a poorer quality. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am surprised at the opposition to the duties on varnish. Varnish making is not a new industry; it is established in all the States, and gives a considerable amount of employment. I understand that upwards of &#163;1,000,000 is invested in the industry, and that its annual output is something like 800,000 gallons of varnish. With the necessary encouragement, the local manufacturers could supply the total requirements of the Commonwealth. </para>

Locally-made varnish is also used throughout our public institutions. We are justified in encouraging this industry. </para>

                    <para>.- I have no objection to protection being given to this industry, but surely the Committee might well discuss the amount of protection to be given. I do not know much about varnish,&#39; but I wish to see fair play. The Minister and the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> both evaded the point.We should not unnecessarily provide manufacturers with the opportunity of making enormous profits out of the public. The other day the Minister said that he had consulted various manufacturers regarding the duty on perfumed spirits. But I am afraid that he has been badly advised in regard to matters of this kind. The Minister discussed very fully the arguments advanced in opposition to the proposals iri regard to perfumed spirits, and stated that the information obtained by his Department was that the higher duties were essential. The manufacturers, he said, had been consulted. He also told us this morning that the manufacturers of varnish had been consulted. I propose to show by reference to a letter sent to the Minister by two of the largest manufacturers of perfumes here two days after the duty on perfumed spirits had been dealt with, that they were not consulted. </para>

                        <para>- It is interesting to note that honorable members opposite who favour high duties are not desirous of light being thrown on the subject. I have no personal interest in this matter, and the only information I have with regard to it comes from an interested source. I have here a circular from W. Harland &#38; Sons, and their agent here, who is naturally desirous of protecting his principal&#39;s business. In this circular it is pointed out that under the old duty, the amount payable on 93S gallons of varnish of the net value of &#163;1,023 would be &#163;117, whereas under the present duty &#163;281 would be collected. Is such a high duty essential? </para>

We should live entirely to ourselves, neither importing anything nor exporting our products. The honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr.Fenton) took up that attitude with regard to agricultural machinery, and we now have the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> expressing the same view with regard to the importation of varnishes. The suggestion is absurd. That &#163;281 should be collected by way of duty on varnish of the value of &#163;1,023 is preposterous. If local manufacturers cannot carry on without such an enormous duty it is time that they closed down. </para>

I hope the good sense of the Committee will lead to the acceptance of the Senate&#39;s request. Surely a duty of 15 per cent. under the British preferential Tariff is sufficient.

                <para class="block">It would appear that the Senate, when making this request, was not quite clear what its effect would be. I propose to  modify the request in a way which, in my opinion, will do all that is desired, and, at the same time, will not make the whole of the marble free that otherwise would he. The effect of my proposal is that white marble, imported in the rough, purely for statuary purposes and not for ordinary monumental work, will be admitted free. In this way our own marble quarries will be protected. </para>

                        <para>- I  see great danger in the honorable member&#39;s proposal, because it means that the Customs Department will have to follow every block  of imported  marble in order to ascertain whether or not it is used for statuary purposes. This Carrara marble  in the.&#39;  rough costs nothing for freight, being brought here as ballast. In South Australia there is quarried white marble quite equal to the best Carrara; indeed,  I  have a sample of the South Australian marble which is actually better than  that  from Italy. In South Australia there  are  two distinct white marbles, both particularly suited for statuary purposes; and  I  fear that, if the motion of the Minister is accepted large quantities of this white marble will be imported from Italy and used for other than statuary purposes. For instance,  a  large quantity of marble of this class is used in the making  of  tables. It was a request from the monumental masons of Sydney which induced a member of another place to have this marble made free, but I may  say that no  request of the kind came from any other State. I ask the Minister to reconsider his proposal. It is within  my own  personal knowledge that  a  company is being formed in South Australia  to develop  the white marble industry,  and  that already an order has been received for  12,000  table tops a year.  If  white Italian marble is admitted free,  the  Australian industry will go to the  wall. It  should be the duty of this Committee  to  develop an Australian industry like this instead of permitting the trade  to go to a  foreign country. </para>

A company has been formed for the development of these deposits with a capital of about &#163;10,000. In the past only about 1,000 tons of marble has been quarried at Angaston per annum, but this company will install machinery which will permit of an output of 2,000 tons per month. If marble is admitted free of duty for statuary purposes, that concession will become the thin end of the wedge for making a greater breach . in the Tariff wall. How can the Department be sure that marble admitted for statuary purposes will be utilized only for those purposes. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has evidently great faith in his Department. If we allow the free admission of marble for statuary purposes that will be an admission of the inferiority of the Australian commodity. I am not prepared to make any such admission. Anybody who has -seen the statue of Robert Burns on North-terrace, Adelaide, which is carved out of marble quarried at Angaston, will realize that that stone is eminently suitable for statuary purposes. If there are people who think that the imported marble is better than the Angaston article let them pay the duty imposed thereon. At times I have had qualms of conscience about voting for- the imposition of duties upon bread-and-butter lines, but nobody should have any such qualms about placing a duty on imported marble. I hope that nothing will be done to hinder the development of what will become some day a very fine industry. </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope the Committee will not accept the motion. I have no objection to sub-paragraph (1). I do not know whether it is of &#39;any use to put up a fight in behalf of -the primary producers in connexion with this item. One feels that he is almost beating the air in trying to get any relief for the man upon the land. We are like men butting their heads against a brick wall  -  we get no further and merely injure ourselves. The item, , as re-phrased by the Senate, is rather misleading. &#34; Sulphur, n.e.i.,&#34; would include sulphur for the manufacture of superphosphates, and it is in that connexion I am principally concerned with this item. &#34; &#91;Sulphur, volcanic, for manufacturing purposes, for which purposes sulphuric acid produced from pyrites or other sulphide- ores is not suitable,&#34; is not for the manufacture of superphosphates. I desire to read to the. Committee letters which have been forwarded to the Department from noted chemists, and also extracts from analyses which have been made.

                    <para>There have been interviews between the representatives of The Electrolytic Zinc Co. and this Company. -On behalf of the Zinc Company the statement has been made that it anticipates that after zinc sulphides are in use that this company will &#39;be able to obtain a gaseous form of sulphur suitable for making sulphuric acid, at the equivalent of i&#39;O per ton of sulphur. In other words, the Zinc Company anticipates it will do- the roasting, and the Phosphate Company will he in the position that it would be if it were paying &#163;6 per ton for crude sulphur. This company has offered to pay a deposit (or premium)  of  &#163;100 to the Zinc Company if it will legally guarantee  us  of that position for  a  reasonable term, or that this company will not be in any way prejudiced by the duties, but the Zinc Company has declined to enter into any contract. </para>
                    <para>I would point out that the Fertilizers Association and the Zinc Company has closely connected interests, and the directors of the co-operative  company,   which is not  a  member of the Association, feel that if the duties are passed, they will be forced into one or other of the following positions. That they will have to spend &#163;100,000 extra on plant,&#39; which means, a heavy levy on the primary producer who .must find this additional money ; or pay 20s. (or 50s.) per ton on 5 to 20 tons of crude sulphur per day. </para>
                    <para>In laying the above facts before you&#39; the directors of the company feel that while they can rely on your assurance of the 2.1st July last to permit no inequitable acts towards the co-operative company, the latest position  as  above should be made known to you. </para>

                <para class="block">In the first place the Phosphate Company is not guaranteed these concentrates, and, in the second place, if it were guaranteed them, it would be compelled to erect machinery to the value of &#163;100,000. The company has a registered capital of &#163;300,000, and it is not yet able to start operations. In order to erect the necessary plant to deal with concentrates, it will have to increase its capital to &#163;500,000. It is not prepared to do that. The Electrolytic Zinc Company cannot supply the Co-operative Phosphates Company with sulphur - because sulphur cannot be made from concentrates; they yield only a crude form of sulphuric acid. If we have to import- volcanic sulphur or brimstone, the primary producers of this country will be penalized to the extent of from 6s. 3d. to 8s. on every ton of superphosphates used in the Commonwealth. Before the war the farmers were able to get the superphosphates a &#163;4 7s. 6d. a ton. The price increased year by year until to-day it is &#163;6 3s. per ton, notwithstanding the fact that bags are only half the price this year that they were last year. It is said that this country should be self-contained, and that we should manufacture all the sulphur necessary for the purpose of making munitions of war, lest in the event of war we be not able to import munitions from abroad. </para>

                    <para>The term &#34;&#34;brimstone &#34; shoul J be used instead of the term &#34;volcanic sulphur,&#34; otherwise there is a probability of American crude  sulphur  being held by the Customs Department to he not of volcanic origin. It has not been geologically practicable to determine the origin of the American sulphur beds. The proportion of ten tons of superphosphate to one ton of sulphur is not applicable to this company. Under our proposed system of working it is eight tons of superphosphate to one ton of sulphur. The Electrolytic Zine Company is reported to have purchased 750,000 tons of zinc sulphides lying at Broken Hill from the British -Government, which had bought them for their zinc contents during war time, and is reported to have sold them at a considerable loss. Under the practice of the metal market it is improbable that either the British Government or the Electrolytic Zinc Company paid anything for the sulphur in these concentrates, as in that form it has no commercial value. It is unfair that the farmer should be made, by duties, to pay the Zinc Company for what it probably did not pay for itself. The sulphur must, in any case, be roasted, out of -the sulphides as a preliminary to treatment for the zinc contents. In view of the stocks of concentrates held at Broken Hill and elsewhere, it is improbable that .the miner will, by increase of work, reap any benefit for many years. There is an iron sulphides deposit inland in New South Wales: but, owing to the cost of transport, such iron sulphides can have nothing but a local value. </para>

                    <para>The British Board of Trade announces that it has instructed Broken Hill, to supply zinc concentrates, with the view of enabling British smelters to resume work. It also invites offers of concentrates, deliveries to extend over a period. &#91;Under the terms of a contract entered into between the Zinc Producers&#39; Association (of Australia) and the British Board of Trade, the Board was to take mp to 300,000 tons of zinc concentrates a year for a period of  ten  years after the termination of the war. Owing to the subsequent reductions in the price of zinc, the shipments to Great Britain were small, and although the concentrates -were paid for by the British Government, they were allowed to accumulate at Broken Hill. In September the Board of Trade sold 7:10,000 tons of these concentrates to the Electrolytic Zinc Co., Tasmania. Although no prices were stated, if. is understood that the British Government sustained a .serious loss under its purchase of Australian zinc concentrates. Under the contract deliveries of these concentrates to the Electrolytic Zinc Co. extend over several years. In August the British Government was stated to have 056,000 tons of concentrates stacked at Broken Hill. Private advice has been received in Melbourne that the British Board of Trade has decided to take deliveries of concentrates, and sell them at a loss to the British smelters, with the view to the re-opening of the smelters, and thus assisting to relieve unemployment. Up to date shipments of concentrates have been small, but instructions have been received to forward larger consignments.&#93; </para>

                    <para>Sulphur (as sulphur) is not commercially produced from pyrites, &#34;but when pyrites is heated sufficiently high in presence of air, the sulphur which is combined with iron in pyrites is oxidized by stages .to sulphuric acid  in the presence of water vapour and oxygen-giving compounds, the sulphur being evolved as  a  gas, and finally converted into sulphuric acid. Sulphuric acid .is used largely in the manufacture of superphosphate of lime. Sulphuric acid obtained from pyrites usually contains impurities, chiefly arsenic. Volcanic sulphur (free sulphur) lis used in processes of manufacture for making cattle dip, sheep dip, lime sulphur, sodium sulphide, and other products. Volcanic sulphur, or free sulphur, cannot be commercially obtained from pyrites. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">It all resolves itself into this: that the primary producers of Australia are to be compelled to adopt one of two courses. Firstly, they are to be compelled to use concentrates, and this they do not want to do because of the expense attached to the erection of a plant, which would cost &#163;100,000, and would probably not be running for the whole of the year. That would be a tremendous handicap to the primary producers. Secondly, if we cannot provide that amount, we shall have to pay duty equivalent to an impost of from 6s. 3d. to 8s. on every ton of superphosphate that we put out. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports and others have spoken of the machinery used on a farm, but the only rural machinery with which they are familiar is the intricate machine known as the wheelbarrow. The farmers have to pay duties on everything that they use. It is the imposts on a thousand and one things that, in the aggregate, must break their backs - as the last straw is said to break that of the camel. This may be said to be the &#34; last straws&#34; We have heard a great deal of the high cost of living, and of the dearness of bread; it is not the farmer who is responsible for either. For the dearness of many commodity it is the system of distribution that is chiefly to blame. I do not say that the millers or the bakers are making too much profit, or that the workers are getting too much; but when men are being paid &#163;4, &#163;5, and &#163;5 10s. a week for driving carts for the delivery of milk, bread, and meat - and there are a dozen of these carts delivering in every street of the city - the cost of the articles delivered  must be high. Everything that the farmers are now producing is being produced at or below the fair cost of production. That is true of wheat, wool, butter, cheese, hay, oats, barley, onions, potatoes, eggs, milk, and fruit. It has been contended here during the past day or two that higher duties are needed to keep our workers employed. I wish to see the workers employed, and wish them to get the highest wages that industries can reasonably be asked to pay. But I give members warning that the result of increasing the price of agricultural machinery by the imposition of high duties will be that the primary producers - particularly the growers of wheat, who have had a moderately good time during the past four or five years, and have put what they made into increasing their plants - will in future buy as little machinery as they can. There will be no boycott of the machinery manufacturers, but stern necessity will prevent the men on the land from purchasing more than they can help. Speaking with inside knowledge, I say that the farmers need not buy many machines during the next ten years. The old single - furrow and double - furrow ploughs and the 5 and 6 feet harvesters have been put on one side in favour of more modern appliances; but the farmers will not he able to continue to buy harvesters if they have to pay &#163;200, &#163;230, and &#163;260 each for them. The proposed duty on sulphur will increase the load on the men on the land, among whom are many returned soldiers. Is that fair? I ask our friends opposite not to feed the fat men - the big men of Broken Hill and other places - to the injury of the farmers. These duties will not benefit the miners, they will merely put money into the pockets of those interested in the big mining companies. </para>

                        <para>- As a user of superphosphates, I wish to get the best article at a low price. I think I use as much of this material as does the honorable member, and I am in a position to speak on the subject, although I do not represent a farming constituency. The honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> naturally, though not quite clearly, divided his remarks into two sections - the national section, in which he dealt with the economic effect of the duties, and the defence section, covering the advisability or wisdom of making the country self-contained in time of war. As for the purely economic point of view, I think there is no reason whv Australia, whose future will depend more on the wise use of artificial manures than upon anything else, should not encourage this industry. There are many things that have been done with or without the concurrence of the honorable member which are not so important. </para>

                        <para>- For many years Australia has imported superphosphates and sulfur for making them. Recently sulphuric acid has been produced in the country, and we are becoming more and more self-contained. I wish to see this process continued. As a result of the war, we authorized the Government to invest millions of pounds in partnership . with the Governments of the United Kingdom, and New Zealand in the mandated island of Nauru, and that pledges us to the support of the superphosphate industry. If we are wise we shall take our phosphatic rock from our own property. Knowing how important crude sulphur and crude sulphuric acid are for the conversion of phosphatic rock into superphosphates, should we be wise in allowing thousands of tons of sulphur to escape into the air from roasting works, to the destruction of all vegetable life in the surrounding country, when, by the application of modern scientific methods, we can arrest this waste? I was recently in South Australia, and saw the roasting work&#39;s which treat the ores from P&#62;roken </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has contended that because, for a considerable time to come, it is the metalliferous material from dumps that will be roasted, and not the newly-extracted ore, the mining industry as a whole will not benefit : but clearly, in the end, the mining industries throughout Australia will benefit in many ways. The more we make mining profitable by saving and using waste products, the better for all connected with mining; the greater the profits of those who have money invested in the industry, the higher and surer the wages of those employed in it. The future prosperity of low-grade ore deposits in Australia depends largely upon the selling to advantage of what have hitherto been waste products. </para>

                        <para>- It will benefit the mining industry to the extent of the value of the hitherto waste products that are saved. I have heard complaints of the manner in which the superphosphate companies of Australia treated the rural producers during the war : but an examination of the facts has convinced me that more generous treatment was never given to any group of men than was given to the rural users of artificial manures by those controlling the output of superphosphates. Had all those who were engaged during the war in manufacturing or in vending goods acted similarly, there would have been nothing heard about profiteering. The honorable member for Echuca complains that superphosphates are dearer now than they were before the war. Well, everything that is manufactured is dearer. Wages have risen, freights and charges dependent on the cost of wages have risen, and as wages and freight charges are both big elements in the cost of superphosphates, these are dearer now than they were before the war. That cannot be a matter of complaint. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely! An examination of the trade should convince any one that no impropriety has been inflicted upon consumers by the manufacturers. Every rise in price has been conditioned by a definite expenditure to which they were committed. I doubt whether there is more profit now, per ton of output, than was made before the war; indeed, I think there is rather less. There has been no profiteering. The higher price to-day, compared with pre-war rates, can be easily understood. Here is an important feature which the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> and those who think with him overlook : not far from the Australian coast we have huge deposits of phosphatic rock. If we can get the other necessary clements from within our own country, and can manufacture them in combination with that rock and so produce commercial superphosphates, we shall be making sure of essential supplies for our own growers. The matter of surety is just as important to the farmer as the question of price. Germany found that out during the war period.It is my belief that the chief compelling element at the close of the Avar  in Europe was the absence of superphosphates, for more than four years, in the German agricultural soil. Germany went down because tillage had become less productive, due to the absence of superphosphates. Germany was forced to her knees, apart altogether from the military position, by economic pressure, which sprang from restricted rural production and the consequent shortage of foodstuffs. Surety of supply is to Australia, isolated as she is, even more important than it was to Germany; for she, in her Continental situation, could smuggle at least some portion of her most urgent needs across her borders, oven in the most oppressive years of conflict. Germany imported no nitric acid during the greater period of the war. but she made her- own nitric acid, electrically, from the air. She did not quite secure the equivalent of her former mineral importations, but, by the application of modern scientific methods, she manufactured a substitute. </para>

                        <para>- It was not done, or intended to be done, in Germany as such. It was an emergency measure forced by stress of war conditions, and I am dealing with that phase of the argument in reply to the honorable member for Echuca, who said that without importing nitric acid we could not secure our own supplies of superphosphates. I desire to see the manure industry protected, and I want to see the sulphur industry established in Australia. I do not think one genuine argument can be advanced to show why the Committee should depart from its support of the policy enunciated by the Minister and decline to encourage the establishment of an industry which would represent a great national asset. The question concerning how far the Cooperative Phosphate Company of Victoria can be fairly dealt with under this duty is an important one, though not so important as the general issue. I accept the assurance of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> that the firms concerned in. the production of sulphur for manuria-1 purposes have given him a specific undertaking. </para>

This Committee, and the Minister certainly, would regard any such procedure as being unfair and invidious treatment. I have made individual inquiries concerning the attitude of the Electrolytic Zinc Company, and I have been assured&#39; - just as the Minister has been able to assure the Committee - that the manufacturers of sulphuric acid have  specifically  informed the Cooperative Phosphate Company that the latter would be accorded exactly the same treatment, and be subject to precisely the same conditions, as any other similar concern. </para>

The Electrolytic Zinc Company has given an assurance that the Co-operative Phosphate Company will be accorded exactly the same treatment as any other firm. The answer of the Co-operative Phosphate Company is that they do not wish to use concentrates for the reason that they would be involved in an expenditure of &#163;100,000 in respect of machinery and the like. It will, apparently, be news to the honorable member for Echuca that the other  manurial  companies advanced the same argument, and that the sulphur-producing concerns undertook to find the necessary money, and moreover, that they will do precisely the same for the Cooperative Phosphate Company. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in any Combine, and have no interest in any such concern, but I have conceived it to be my duty to find out how certain basic enterprises are working, and whether their activities may be calculated to benefit or injure Australian industries. If the. Electrolytic Zinc Company are willing to deal on exactly the same terms with the Co-operative Phosphate Company; and if, in respect of the use of concentrates by the latter there is difficulty in providing necessary capital, in regard to which the Zinc Company have intimated their preparedness to offer assistance along  the lines  of capital charges, surely that must remove tha objection from the stand-point of the co-operative concern. However, while it may overcome the individual objection, it does not do away with the general objection; the price of manures may be increased. But the offer, certainly, has effectually  &#34;taken away the main argument of the honorable member for Echuca-, that groups of companies are to get an advantage over one company. I do not think it wise that representatives of country interests should urge the weakening of the manure trade. Their best plan would be to advocate the manufacture within Australia of all the. superphosphate which can be produced, to meet the requirements of the farming community. I have a good deal of sympathy with the farming representatives to-day, when they see prices for their products falling, and perceive this Tariff confronting them in respect of quite a number of items. But what is required is a long-sighted national view. For example, honorable members of the Opposition naturally desire to support and extend this industry in all of the industrial centres where works are and may be established. So do I. So should honorable members of the Country party, for the reason that, using our own products, the effect would be to warrant surety of supply of requisite quality, which is essential to the existence of primary industries. What would be the alternative? We would start to import foreign sulphur, which would be chiefly Japanese brimstone. </para>

                        <para>- That may be; but whether supplies are procured from America or from &#34;Japan, the Australian policy should bet to use Australian raw products wherever possible. And until it has been shown to be a bad policy I shall vote for the imposition of duties which will encourage that practice without inflicting serious injury on any section of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - The subject under discussion is of the utmost importance! in the national interest, as well as individually to the primary producer. The Committee is dealing with an industry which Australia has had practically in her own hands for many years - that is to say, importations have been very small. Australian agriculturists were well pleased when the Commonwealth was given control over Nauru Island, but they have been somewhat disappointed to find that their , superphosphates cannot be secured any more cheaply to-day than in the past. </para>

                        <para>- I know that, and in any case we must turn to Nauru Island for our supplies. It is probably a matter of ten or twelve* years since we imported superphosphates from abroad. At any rate, very little of that product is being brought into Australia. In South Australia, the Wallaroo Company and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company have been recovering sulphur for some years. Other companies are following suit, but we are not getting sufficient supplies. The demand for superphosphates is growing, and must become even heavier. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Greene)</inline> has asked this Committee to accept the request of the Senate, the effect of which, in part, will be to- release from duty whatever quantities of sulphur may be required for purposes of manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- I am not troubling about that, because there is a way of making them honour the undertaking. When we first used superphosphates for whaet-growing in this country, and had to import supplies, we were called on to pay far more than we should have been asked to do, but that trouble was corrected by the Government of South Australia, and some of the State Governments, I believe, are . importing supplies for the farmers. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have listened with great interest to this debate, and think that the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has dealt exhaustively with the position. The Country party should be satisfied if they receive an assurance that the Farmers Co-operative Company will be treated the same as all other corporations. I know that the crude material with which they will be supplied will not be of much use to thom, but if they are assured of the same treatment that is given alt others, I do not think they need &#34; growl.&#34; If the companies dealt with brimstone or volcanic sulphur they would need an establishment for that purpose and would not concentrate. Honorable members of the Country party always seem to fear that local manufacturers are against the farmers. The Minister has said that the parties interested can meet and make arrangements to prevent the application of the duty on sulphur being too premature. If that is done, and an arrangement is made which will not bear harshly on any one, there will not be much room for complaint. I come now to the health side of this question. So far as the workmen are concerned, no greater disability attaches to the production of flour sulphur than is associated with the working of the concentrates. If I thought there was, I should take a stand against this proposal. I regret that it should be necessary for men to work in superphosphate establishments. The work, however, has to be carried out, and we must see that fair payment is made for it. The remuneration of the workmen in the industry is considerably better than it used to be. Those who follow dangerous or unhealthy occupations should be well paid. My desire is that the men in this industry shall receive adequate wages, and the farming section should not complain if- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is never tired of telling us that the farmers have to take the world&#39;s parity for their produce and to pay for the protection . of secondary industries. The local manufacturer of superphosphates has protected the farmer, and my endeavour is to secure the same result from every protected industry. The Farmers Co-operative Company should be protected, and I hope that it will secure the whole of the superphosphate trade of the Commonwealth. If the arrangements made prevent the co-operative company from being penalized, no exception can be taken to this proposal.It is necessary also to see that the application of the duty will not operate harshly on those who are using flour sulphur. The position is an interesting one, and if the Minister&#39;s scheme succeeds he will have achieved, in respect of this particular item, what is absolutely scientific Protection. I hope that he will carry out this proposal in a way that will benefit the whole community. </para>

                    <para>.- I approach this item with all seriousness, because there can be no question that it is exceedingly foolish, in a country like Australia, to levy a duty on either manures or their component parts. I have to congratulate the Combines and those who are interested in this industry on having obtained the able advocacy of the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> They have thus brought into this Chamber a very powerful gun to be used in their interests. Prom time to time in the board rooms of big companies in our large cities various enterprises are discussed. There were working difficulties associated with the Broken Hill concentrates, and the English owners of those concentrates suggested that they could be properly treated, and their various byproducts extracted, provided that the assistance of a protective duty were secured. Who is to pay this duty ? The manufacturers of manures will pay it in the first place, but will pass it on to the farmer. We have the same procedure in regard to many new industries. Duties imposed for their protection are borne by thp man on the land. No one will contend that the farmer in Australia is too prosperous, and the spoon-feeding of this particular industry will have a serious effect on the whole Commonwealth. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> told us how Germany had found it necessary to produce manures in order to make the. country more productive. Any one who brings into this country a cheap bag of manure confers a benefit on the whole community;  any one who makes it difficult to do that is an enemy to the country&#39;s best interests. I agree that the manure manufacturers acted fairly during the war period ; they recognised the peculiar position in Australia. They experienced great difficulty in delivering phosphatic rock and sulphur to their various works, and the shortage of shipping added to their costs. But I ask honorable members to appreciate the facts. The farmers in Western Australia paid before the war &#163;4 2s. Gd. per ton for superphosphates. I do not think that anybody can say that any of the men upon the land in that State, whether growing root crops, fruit, or grain, were over-prosperous. On account of the extra cost of freight- and other things during the war, the price rose to &#163;6 15s. per ton; but that high price, which was the result of abnormal conditions, continues to-day, and the farmers are paying it, notwithstanding that the prices of .primary products are falling steadily, so that most of them are below the pre-war prices and many are below the cost of production. The use of superphosphates for growing wheat and other grain has revolutionized Australian production. That is the means by which we can add to the production of, not only wheat, but everything that comes from the cultivation of the land. It pays even the dairyman to apply superphosphates to his grass hinds. It would be a fine thing for the Commonwealth to make cheap manures available. We could then extend production for the benefit of all. The State Governments have recognised the importance of cheap artificial manures, and in Western Australia they are carried on the railways at the lowest ry tes in the schedule. The State Government realize that the bread cast upon the waters in this way will return to them after many days. The Committee by this impost is asked to allow the farming community to be further penalized. If the companies that are extracting sulphur &#39; are so important to Australia, let the whole people pay to help them by means of a bounty. I like to hear those honorable members who are farming in the cities of Melbourne and Sydney talk glibly, about the importance of the sulphur industry to the farmers. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> referred to the quantity of artificial manure he uses; I guarantee that it is not enough to bury himself in. He asked where would the Australian farmers have been during the war but for the locally-produced artificial manures? What a ridiculous question!. The whole of Australia depends on primary production, and when . that ceases, Australian settlement will revert to a few scattered villages and whaling stations. I do not know what the Committee will tax next. An effort is being made to tax out of existence every form of primary industry. This item and a later co-related item - manures - should be free of duty. The benefit which would result would not only go directly to the primary producer, but indirectly to the whole community. No other factor can be regarded as of greater importance than the factor of increased primary production. Any person who sends cheap manures to Australia confers a greater benefit on this country than on the country from which the manures come. Lands which cannot be profitably cropped under natural conditions can be made profitable by the application of artificial manures if they can be obtained cheaply. If the farmers are deprived of cheap fertilizers, Australia will retrogress. I desire to move that the Senate&#39;s request be amended to provide that sulphur or brimstone required for the manufacture of superphosphates be admitted free of duty. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but a doubt has been expressed as to whether the agreement exists or not. We should be very chary about doing anything liable to injure the manufacturers of manures in this country. They have stood up to their obligations very well, and have turned out a first-class article, and are entitled to our support if they continue to produce a good article at a reasonable price. But honorable members in the corner are afraid that, as has been the case in almost every other matter affected by this Tariff, the primary producer will still be obliged to carry a heavier burden. </para>

Any one who has watched the progress of this Tariff through the Committee must recognise that the tremendous bulk of the burden imposed by it has been placed on the man who grows the raw product, and not on the man who manufactures it into the finished article. We simply want an understanding that the producers of manures will continue to treat the farmers as they have done in the past, and we want it in such a form that there will be no doubt concerning it. </para>

                        <para>- Unless the orchardist prospers the orchard implement maker and the fruit-case maker cannot prosper. The smaller apple crop in Victoria this year partly accounted for the lack of employment in the hardwood saw-milling industry. The fruit-grower bears more burdens than almost any other class in the community. He not only takes his own share of the general duties, but is also called upon to pay duty on the raw material of the orchard implement maker. He is burdened with increased cost of cases and increased freights. He suffers more than do others in the community by the increased price of sugar. He is at the mercy of frost, hail storms, droughts and wind-storms, and also numerous pests. The only means by which he can cope with these pests is by spraying with arsenate of lead. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boardman</inline> contends that the fruit-grower ought to be able to purchase any kind of spray, and should not be unduly penalized for using the imported article. I am not an apple growing expert, but fruit-growers tell me that they have used the local article, in many instances with disastrous results. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member says that the fruit-growers bear more burdens than any other section of the community; they certainly do bear a very fair share of them, and their troubles are mostly pests, some native and some introduced, for which they must have the very best sprays. Some people say that the locally produced article is good, but others, with very wide experience, do not care to say so. They are much in the same position as the men who dip sheep. When we were debating the duty on sheep dip, some honorable members contended that the locally-produced sheep dips met all requirements. Others, for good reasons, declared that they required imported dips. </para>

                        <para>- It is all a matter of what pays one best. The fruit-grower has not a very great margin to work on, and he must use the spray which pays him best in keeping his orchard clean. So far imported sprays have proved better than the local makes. Senators did not take the bit in their teeth in this instance, but, after considering the subject very carefully, decided that Australia would benefit more by having clean fruit trees than by the establishment of one or two spray factories. All along this Committee has been giving the benefit to a few at the expense of the many. The fruit industry has recently attracted many maimed men who are unfit for other occupations. Men who have partially lost their sight or have been gassed have become fruit-growers. All these men are to be heavily taxed for the sake of a few persona in the cities. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 wish to draw public attention to a matter about which I have spoken privately to the Postmaster-General. A returned soldier, who was employed in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department for upwards of two years as a mail-driver, complied with an advertisement asking him to go up for examination as a motor driver, and, while qualifying, he broke his arm. When his arm got better, the Department told him there was no more work for him - a shabby way in which to treat a returned man. I have approached the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in Sydney and the Secretary of the Department here, but they can. do nothing in the matter. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see that this man is reinstated, if only in his temporary position. </para>
