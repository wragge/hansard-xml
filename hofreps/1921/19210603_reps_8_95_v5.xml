          <para>. -  It is my melancholy duty to intimate to the House that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Page, one of our most respected and best beloved members, died this morning. The news comes like a bolt from the blue, and gave me the greatest possible sense of shock when it was told me. Happenings like this cause wonder as to what life may have in store for us. To see a man stricken down at the height of his power and in the plenitude of robust health gives us pause, and makes us realize how slender, after all, is our hold upon life and its opportunities. Edmund Burke; speaking in the House of Commons on an occasion like that on which we are met here this morning, in language far better than that in which I can clothe my thoughts, said of a deceased member- </para>

        <para class="block">There can be but one sentiment in this chamber to-day, that of unfeigned sorrow for what has occurred. ' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> was without a single enemy. At the height of our most bitter  controversies we always felt a deep respect for the man who is no longer with us. I am not sure that I did not like him best in his moments of excitement. He was ' a man who loved his country intensely, and loved his fellowmen, serving them with every atom of .his strength and with the whole devotion of his mind. There are few finer characters than that of Jim Page. </para>
        <para>In one sense we can scarcely be sorry for him. He lived a full, well-rounded, useful life, serving his country in almost every possible sphere of activity. As a citizen he built up for himself a character for good repute, and won material success ; but never for a moment did he forget those less fortunate than himself. He served his country not only in the paths of peace, but also upon the battle-field. We all know something - of his career as a member of this House. It is that by which he is remembered best. I was a comrade of his for twenty years, and I do not remember a time when I had not the greatest respect, esteem, and good-will for him ; I am sure every other honorable member felt in the same way towards him. All we can do this morning is to bow our heads in the presence of this mystery, and bow our wills to a higher will, hoping, as I believe most profoundly that, although he has passed to "where beyond these voices there is peace," he still lives on, to do useful work in some other and better sphere.

          <para>.- I rise to second the motion of the Acting. Prime Minister, and to indorse his remarks about our deceased friend and comrade. It falls to my lot to express the profound regret, not only of his own colleagues, the members of the Commonwealth Labour party, but of all the State Labour parties and of the whole Labour movement throughout Australia. He was a close personal friend of mine for many years, and I mourn his loss as' that of a very dear comrade, .who stood by me in many a hard-fought fight. We all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> was a staunch battler for Labour from its earliest days, and took a large part in blazing the track which led to its success in many spheres. As the Acting Prime Minister has said, he held the respect not only of his supporters but also of his opponents, because he was a fair fighter, and always played the game. It is but a few hours since he was with us, bright, cheerful, and full of fight. Yesterday afternoon, when an adjournment motion was spoken of, he interjected, " I will give you an adjournment to-morrow." He has given it to us, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy</inline> Speaker! Such happenings as this should incline us to: think more kindly and generously of one another in political life. - The sudden mess of his death makes us realize what frail creatures we are ; it should certainly make lis feel humble when we are shown how, truly, in the midst of life we are in death. Words fail to adequately express my feelings on this occasion, and I content myself with extending my sympathy to his son and other relatives in their bereavement. </para>

          <para>.- It is with the deepest regret that I rise to support the motion moved by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> Although I have not been many years in this House, I have been here long enough to greatly appreciate the qualities of our departed friend. I think I am speaking not only for every member of the Country party, but for every honorable member of the House, when I say we admired his wonderful spirits, jovial nature, and yet earnest devotion to the principles he espoused. As the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has said, the late member, though a great fighter, was always a fair one. The news we have received this morning is tragic and astounding. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> was here with us yesterday full of life and vigour, and to-day we know that he is no more. I must content myself with, in a somewhat feeble manner, indorsing the remarks of those who have preceded me, in the hope that our words may bring some comfort to those whom our deceased friend has left behind. </para>

          <para>. -  I entered this House at the same time as the late, member did, as a member of the same party, and from the same Sta'te, and the House will bear with me while I say a few words in reference to his tragic death. The late member and myself have not always followed the same political lines, but I am pleased to say that the friendship between us was never disturbed on that account. We remained the best of friends, and, indeed, it would have been difficult for any man to quarrel with James Page. As I know from experience, he was a man ever ready to extend help where it was needed. In my mind's eye, I see him sitting opposite as he did yesterday, full of life and vigour ; no one could for a. moment have anticipated that the hand. of the grim reaper was so shortly to be placed upon him. To say that I specially regret his death is but to very inadequately express my feelings; and I can only, as one who knew the deceased gentleman intimately, give my support to the motion submitted by the Acting Prime Minister. We cannot but feel somewhat pleased that we did not resolve on an all-night sitting yesterday, for otherwise we might, for the second time, have had a tragedy within the walls of this chamber. ' My regret is deep and sincere at the death of  a man for whom I had the greatest possible respect, and between whom and myself there was a friendship which nothing could break. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> recently suffered a great bereavement in the loss of a sister, to whom he was greatly attached, and I think that that occurrence may, perhaps, have had its share in precipitating the sad occurrence of last night. </para>

          <para>.- May I be permitted to indorse the sentiments expressed by previous speakers. From the time I entered, this House, I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page,</inline> both as colleague and as close friend; and I remember the good advice and valuable assistance he. was ever ready to give me. I always admired <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> for his big-heartedness Whatever differences of opinion there may be from time to time in connexion with the performance of our duties, no one was quicker to forget and forgive than our late friend. He was full of the milk of human kindness, always generous in his endeavours to assist others; indeed, it seems to me that he lived to better the lot  of all with, whom he came in contact. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> lived a useful, political life, both State and Commonwealth. He worked in the interests of the community ; and whatever our political feelings may be, we respect a man who has the courage of his opinions, and is prepared to stand by them, irrespective of consequences., I do not think we could have a man of finer character than the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page.</inline> Like other public representatives, I have in my time met many men whom I admire, but I can say, without the slightest hesitation, that no man stands higher in my estimation than did the late James Page. As a friend, I shall certainly miss him while I -remain here, and I think he will be missed by all honorable members. I remember how full of life and fight he was last night, when an all-night sitting was anticipated. I am glad that an all-night sitting did not occur; and I venture to express the hope that we shall, as far as possible, dispense with such  sittings as very trying to the health. As I have said, our deceased friend last evening was full of fight, and said to me, " Charlton, I will be with you until tomorrow ; I w'ill see you through as far as this fight is concerned," plainly showing that at that time, so far as he knew, his health was all that might be desired, and that he was anxious to continue here and do his duty in this Chamber. Then to get the startling news this morning that he had been found dead in his bed was a blow to every one of us, a shock which none of us expected to .receive. I realize the great loss that his death will be to our movement, and how difficult it is to replace a man of his calibre. I extend my sincerest sympathy to his relatives and friends in the great bereavement which they have sustained. </para>

        <para class="block">I say a few words in tribute to the memory of one of my oldest friends. The late honorable member was a friend of mine for more than thirty years, and it was a terrible shock to me this morning to hear from the Acting Prime Minister that he was dead. It is impossible even now for me to realize that it is true. I can only regard it as a mysterious visitation qf the beneficent Deity, when I remember that I was sitting alongside him last night about </para>
        <para class="block">II o'clock, he being full of health, spirits, hope, and brightness. The news this morning is one of the most dreadful calamities to me, as it must be to every member of the House, and I venture to say to the whole of the people of Australia. When I first met our good friend he was then,. I think, a shearer, and I was a struggling squatter in the far NorthWest of Queensland. In those days I had pushed sheep out beyond what were then considered the bounds of civilization, and it was a favour to get shearers to come and shear sheep' so far out. The late honorable member and myself were always friends from the beginning. 1 can remember the first great shearing strike taking place just thirty years ago, and the second shearers' strike in 1894. This much I will say, that, whatever side men fought on in .that, struggle, they fought as men and as gentlemen When I mention that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> was one of the leaders of the shearers, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> was one of the three leaders of the squatters - the " Triumvirate " as they were called - in those days, honorable members will realize the truth of what I say when I apply the words of the good old Book - " There were giants in those days." That struggle was fought out without the slightest bitterness .on either side, and possibly that circumstance was largely due to the presence of such men a3 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page.</inline> I recall, also, the first Federal election, at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> was a candidate. Although he was opposed by a well-known squatter, I was one of those who supported him even in those early days. After that election, inspired by whom I do not know, some articles antagonistic to him were published in the local paper, and I am glad to think that I wrote, to the <inline font-style="italic">Western Champion</inline> at Barcaldine and told my friends there that in my opinion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Page was, amongst all the members of the House, the best supporter of the whole of the people who lived in the western parts of Queensland. I could say much more about my old friendship with him. For sixteen years, during the life of this Parliament before I had the honour of being returned, whenever I desired to come to this Chamber, the only man to whom I ever sent my card was our late' lamented friend. I have always looked upon him as my greatest friend, an.d as the best representative for the last twenty years that the people who live far back, away from the benefits, the amenities, and delights of city civilization, have ever had in this House. I desire to join in this tribute to the memory of one of my oldest friends, and one' of the bravest and most loyal men that the Empire has ever known. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to add my tribute to the memory of my mate, Jim Page. Open-hearted and big, physically and mentally, reminiscent of the western plains which he loved so well, there was never a man down-and-out in. the west of Queensland who sought his assistance in vain. . No matter whose the quarrel, no matter whose the fight, Jim Page could always be found on the side of the man on the lowest rung of the ladder. He pioneered the fights of the Australian Workers Union in Western Queensland ; he pioneered the fights of the Australian Labour party; and he was known and loved, particularly out there, but also generally throughout the length and breadth of the land. He was one of the big men of Australia, and one whom we could ill afford to lose. He was cheery of disposition, and intensely loved a practical joke.  He  was the life of our party, and he loved to come into the room and get three or four of us to join him in singing one of the many songs for which he is responsible. It was only last night that he began to sing one of them as he sat on the front seat on this side, but when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> looked at him, he at once desisted. There was no fun in which he would not join. He was like a big school boy coming into our room - always good tempered, and we can ill afford to lose him. The Australian Workers Union, the Australian Labour party, and the nation generally will find it, indeed, hard to replace Jim Page. </para>

          <para>.- May I, as one of the few remaining original members of this Chamber, be allowed also to add my word of tribute to the memory of the late honorable member for Maranoa? He has been through all these years a very intimate personal friend of mine, and I feel his loss most deeply. To me he was always the <inline font-style="italic">beau ideal</inline> of those who have come from the Old Land to help to build up the fortunes of Australia. He started at the very bottom, and worked Himself up, by sheer force of character and the admiration of those with whom he came in contact, into the high and honorable position in which death found him. He always lived a strenuous life, and the manner of his death is probably the one which he would have desired. There have been many who have already entered this Chamber and have left it for one reason or another. Many more will yet come, but I feel sure there will never enter within its walls a finer type of man than Jim Page. </para>

          <para>.- As one who, perhaps, knew our late friend more intimately than many other honorable members, I should like to. add my tribute in support of the motion. I think the best side of his character was the' fact that while he forgot the unpleasant things done to him, he never forgot those who did him a kindness. It may be said of him that he was a person brimful of humanity. He always stood out for a fair deal. He had many fights, but no enemies. For many years, our departed comrade discharged the onerous duties of the office of Whip of our party. How arduous and exacting those duties frequently are none can better testify than one who, like myself, has undertaken them. He applied himself to their discharge with the utmost zeal and efficiency, and with the same warm-hearted enthusiasm he devoted to every aim of the great cause he loved so faithfully and served so well. God rest his soul! </para>

          <para>- Before putting the motion I should like to add a few words as a tribute of sorrow on my own behalf and on behalf of the staff of this Parliament at the great loss we have sustained in the death of the honorable member for Maranoa. I had known him ever since he became a member of this House. I had been associated with him politically in many ways and had always found him, as has been said by honorable members to-day, a man of most generous impulses, and with a big heart. It is only two days since he came to me in this chamber, and with tears in his voice offered me his sincerest sympathy in the bereavement which' I have recently suffered. My heart went out to him more than ever then, as it had on other occasions when he tendered me his sympathy in formerbereavements. I say, in all sincerity, that  no  one deplores his low more than I do, and I hope that his relatives may. be given the strength to bear the great load of sorrow which the Almighty has placed upon thom* </para>
