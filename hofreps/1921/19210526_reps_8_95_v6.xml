                        <para>-  Yes, and the evidence gathered so far shows that American prunes are being dumped into this country at a price which would give the producer less than1d. per lb. The inquiry;  however, is not complete. We are endeavouring to complete it as soon as possible, and if the first impression is borne out, I shall ask the Committee of Ways and Means to take suitable action. </para>

                        <para>Lake agreed to purchase a banana plantation and he paid all the money he could on it. He has been in occupation for some time. He made application to the Soldiers&#39; Settlement Board for an advance, and his application was recommended in March last, and his papers marked accordingly. Before the advance of &#163;547 was made, the Board was advised by the Commonwealth Department not to make any more advances to applicants desiring to purchase freehold land, until after the end of the present financial year (June). </para>

                        <para>- The statement read by the honorable member is not correct, because the Commonwealth Government has not at any time asked the Queensland, or any other State, Government to refrain from purchasing freehold or other land. The Commonwealth Government undertook to provide the money necessary for the settlement of soldiers on the land, and agreed upon quotas of men and money for each State, this agreement being come to at two conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers. Financial provision has been made by the Commonwealth Government during the present year for the settlement of soldiers by the&#39; Queensland Government, and every claim made by the State which has been in order has been paid by us. </para>

Regulations are in force which enable us to review certain proposals, but their object is certainly not interference with American capital and enterprise in this country, which we rather welcome. I have to learn that any disability has been placed on any American company here. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that it will not be debated. I propose merely to say what has been done. Honorable members will recollect that an arrangement was made by which the Government was to pay certain gratuities to all who had rendered war service. We were to pay ls. 6d. per day to every member of the Naval Forces and to every member of the Australian Imperial Forge who went on active service outside Australia, the period for which payment was to &#39;be made being from the date of embarkation of each man to the 28th June, 1919. It was arranged, too, that we should pay a gratuity of ls. per day to each man who had enlisted for active service but did not embark, and the maximum period for which this gratuity was to be paid was six months. To carry out these obligations it was estimated that &#163;30,000,000 would be required, and as that was considered at that time a&#39; sum that would strain the financial resources of the country, having regard to our other heavy war obligations, it was decided to issue bonds bearing interest at the rate of 5i per cent., free of taxation, and redeemable in 1924. The original understanding  was  that this would be a three years&#39; .arrangement, and that the total amount involved would be &#163;30,000,000, but it seems to me now that when all  liabilities  have been met in connexion with the issue of these bonds the expenditure wik, be within &#163;28,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- We have about as much. as we can manage now. The bonds .actually issued to the 30th April represented &#163;25,831,936. Some claims have not yet been lodged-why, I do not know; perhaps some soldiers or dependants do not intend to lodge them. Others -have been lodged, but have not yet been determined. All sorts of complications arise, even in so simple a matter as determining who is the rightful claimant. Sometimes there are two claimants for the same bond. Many other phases of the kind are being investigated by the Board set up for the purpose . A great many claims are only now being sent in. But I should think that another &#163;2,000,000 will cover the balance of our liabilities. Of the &#163;25,831,936 worth of bonds issued, cash payments have been made by the .Government through the banks to the amount of &#163;6,000,000. In .addition, cash payments have been made directly by the Government totalling &#163;2,276,372.&#34; Other bonds have been cashed by employers, traders, life assurance companies, and others, to a value of &#163;5,136,799. The total cash or cash equivalent received by the soldiers and their dependants to the end of April amounted to &#163;13,413,171. The bonds still held. by soldiers and dependants, total &#163;12,418,765. It. will be seen, therefore, that of the total bonds issued more than half have been already cashed. The Government have all along continued the practice&#39; of cashing bonds in necessitous cases, ,and for soldiers wishing to marry. </para>

                    <para>I know -that some cases are most difficult and complex, and for a variety of reasons. </para>
                    <para>In all, 320,000 gratuities have been issued, of which 170,000 have been already cashed. I hope the bulk of the holders of the remaining 150,000 will continue to held their bonds, for I cannot help feeling, as I have said all along, that those who do hang on to them will be glad in the sequel that they did so. The bonds are returning good interest, the income from them is tax free, and I am quite sure that any soldier who can hold&#39; them will be glad that he did so. At the time the bonds were issued, certain requests were made to the Government for the payment of cash, and an arrangement was made by which &#163;6,000,000 worth would be cashed immediately through the bank?. We promised, further, to liquidate another &#163;10,000,000 worth by the end of the present month. We placed first in the category of those who are to obtain cash out of the &#163;6,000,000 provided by the hanks widows of members of the Forces, and next in order of preference come widowed mothers of unmarried deceased members of the Forces, mothers of deceased members if they were dependent on the deceased members, blind or totally and permanently incapacitated members of the Forces, members who married after discharge, and persons found by the War Gratuity Board to be in necessitous circumstances. All other classes of persons were to be paid by non-negotiable bonds maturing not later than May, 1924.The Government also undertook that a further sum of &#163;10,000,000 would be provided in &#39; May of this year. The moment I realized our liability for May, I set to work to try to move off the bonds as safely as possible, taking all the care we could to insure that the soldier was not dealt with unjustly in the cashing transactions. I do not pretend to say that some soldiers have, not &#34;fallen in.&#34; I know only too well and regretfully that they have done so. But we cannot avoid all these happenings whilst human nature is what it is. We have done our best to prevent the, soldier being &#34; taken down,&#34; and I believe with very successful results, on the whole. My idea was to get out as much cash as possible in anticipation of the obligation falling due this month, and the result is that at the present moment nearly &#163;14,000,000 worth of cash is in the hands of the soldiers or dependants. </para>

                            <para>- We propose to determine priority of need in the same way as we have been doing all along. After having discussed the whole matter with the representatives of the soldiers, they agree with me that we cannot get a better tribunal than the one which we already have. Criticism has, of course, been levelled against them, but they have carried through a task of great complexity and difficulty, and, upon the whole, have carried it through with striking success. One reason for that is that all the members of the War Gratuity Board are themselves returned soldiers, and therefore may be expected to be in sympathy with those who are claimants for this cash. General Wisdom, who was the  President  of the first War Gratuities Board, is at present the administrator of New Guinea.  His  administrative experience at the Front stood him in good stead. In addition to being an able man possessed of plenty of good common sense, he has had all the experience of a soldier, and knows the psychology of a soldier, and all these things, I have no doubt, helped him to make the cashing of these bonds the success that it was upon the whole. The position, therefore, is that when an additional &#163;2,000,000 has been found we shall have discharged the promises we made to the soldier in full. Indeed, we shall have more than discharged what was in our minds at the time those promises were made. Then, the idea was that there would be about &#163;30,000,000 worth of these gratuity bonds issued, and the estimate that &#163;16,000,000 worth of them would be redeemed by the end of May was based upon that issue. We propose to give the soldiers &#163;16,000,000 cash, notwithstanding that the bonds actually issued will really fall &#163;2,000,000 short of the original estimate. I have no need to occupy further time. That is the proposal which we are making. It has been approved by the executive of the Soldiers&#39; League, with whom I have been a good deal in consultation, as well as by as many more members of the Forces as I could get into touch with. They all agree that out proposal represents a broad and generous discharge of the obligations which we incurred to the soldiers at the time these bonds were originally issued. I hope that when the ?16,000,000 worth of bonds has been redeemed we shall be in a position to redeem still more of them should the occasion require it. I hope, however, that very little more will be asked for by the soldiers before the maturity of the bonds, because I profoundly believe that those who hang on to them will, in the end, be both proud and glad that they did so. </para>

                            <para>.- In the early part of the session I took action with a view to bringing under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation the position in regard to war pensions and other allowances which are administered under the Repatriation Act. Since then no improvement has taken place. I would have included in my motion the question of the administration of War Service Homes, but for the fact that in connexion with that administration in New South Wales, a report is to be placed upon the table of the House in the near future. Upon that account I refrained from the action which I had contemplated. The matter which forms the subject of this motion is one of considerable importance, because it affects a very large section of those men who were in the fighting-line, and who, when leaving Australia, were promised that ample provision would be made for them in the event of their suffering any disability, either of a permanent or a temporary character. Yet, to-day we find that there are hundreds of complaints from returned men who are partially, or in some cases wholly incapacitated, because their pensions have either been reduced or discontinued. I remember reading the debate which took place in this chamber when the Repatriation Bill was under consideration. Upon that occasion it was pointed out by honorable members upon this side of the House, and particularly by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> that the transfer of war&#39; pensions from the Old-age Pensions Department to the Repatriation Department would prove very unsatisfactory to the soldiers themselves. I also recollect the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> moving to recommit that measure for the purpose of reconsidering this phase of the question.  His  motion was defeated by only nine votes, clearly demonstrating that at that time there was not a very large majority in this chamber in favour of transferring war pensions from the Old-age Pensions to the Repatriation Department. Since then it has been amply proved that the transfer was a mistake. The change has in no way reduced the cost of administration. As a matter of fact, the administrative costs under the Repatriation Department are greater than they were under the Old-age Pensions Department. In the latter Department we had officers who, by reason of long experience, knew exactly how to handle the claims of applicants for pensions. These officers were also very sympathetic with the claimants. They understood precisely how to deal with old people and with our soldiers. When the war pensions were transferred to the Repatriation Department a considerably increased staff had to be employed. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. I am altogether dissatisfied with the way in which the clerical work of the Repatriation Department is performed. Most honorable members have a large correspondence with that Department in connexion with these matters, and my own experience is that when it forwards replies to my communications it frequently omits to name the township in which the particular applicant concerned resides. . I have, therefore, either to keep a complete list of the names of the applicants who are communicating with me, or else to request the Department to forward me the address of the particular applicant whose claim is the subject of  a departmental letter. One &#34;would naturally expect that the Department upon receipt of such a communication would immediately forward the address of the soldier in question. But instead of doing so it merely sends a formal acknowledgment of the request with an intimation that the matter will be given consideration. Then, probably in three or four weeks time, another letter from the Department will come to hand. Upon the last occasion that this matter was discussed, we were told that the House had taken away from the Government the power to deal with this particular Board. </para>

                            <para>- It is my intention to do so. I emphasize that it is the State Board which is causing the trouble. Instead of following the lines laid down by the Pensions Board - so permitting local medical men, or medical officers appointed by the Government in various districts, to make periodical examinations in order to ascertain the state of a recipient&#39;s incapacity - the New South Wales State Board appointed a medical officer from Sydney. Here is where the mischief comes in. He goes out into the country and examines various former soldiers who have been in receipt of pensions. He makes his investigations, asks such questions as he may deem necessary, comes to certain conclusions, and testifies thereon that So-and-so is now only two-thirds, or one-third, incapacitated, and that his pension should be accordingly adjusted. </para>

                    <para class="block">The wording of the section testifies beyond doubt that when this Parliament was dealing with the subject of pensions it sought to make the whole matter as clear as possible for the guidance and assistance of the administering body. Rather than that it might be said that the Act was in any way ambiguous, Parliament deliberately inserted the words - resulted from an occurrence happening during&#39; the period he was a member of the Forces, and, in the case of incapacity, the nature and extent thereof. </para>
                    <para>When previously addressing myself to this subject, the Minister desired me to bring forward particulars of specific cases. I did so, and I wish to add now that of those which .1 indicated one has been settled satisfactorily. The person concerned has been paid right back, and in full. In connexion with others, however, the State Board has refused to reverse its earlier decisions. I wish to draw attention again to the case pf a man named Schubert. The Board has intimated that it cannot  see its way clear &#39; to alter its former decision, because - in effect- the man was for four: months in camp in Australia and only a little more than one day in the trenches in Prance, after which he became afflicted with gout. The Board added that it is plain that such affliction was not occasioned by the man&#39;s participation in war-like operations. The comment is attached that Schubert received the same kind of food while he was in camp in England as he would have had if he had been at home.  His  pension has been taken away, although he cannot work and has a family to keep. Does the section say that before a soldier may become the recipient of a pension he must have been struck down by a bullet or by a shell fragment? I repeat  that it is framed in most definite language: &#34;an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces.&#34; Let me put it that I am eligible, and that I have offered my services. I am examined by the official medical officers and am passed. That is to say, I am presumed to be fit for active service abroad. If, after having passed the medical test, and having gone into camp, I develop some ailment and am unable by reason thereof to go overseas, and, following my discharge, I am unable to take up my usual employment, is my family to starve? Am I not entitled to say that - from whatever cause, known or unknown - my disability occurred after I had offered myself and had been accepted by my country for service in its behalf? Does not section 26 most clearly and specifically cover such a case, and the case of Schubert also? This man actually went to England and France. He reached the trenches. </para>

                            <para>- Maybe o so; but that is an entirely different matter Once a man has been accepted, the Government must take the responsibility for his care; it is an inescapable obligation, and it was never intended that the definite terms of the Act should, or could, be so twisted as to render the Government free of liability. I guarantee that if a vote of the people were taken the unanimous answer would be that, after a man had offered his services, and had been accepted, if any hurt or ailment accrued, his care and support should become the nation&#39;s obligation. </para>

                    <para>I have still another case, that of a man named Amos, who is married and has five children. He has informed me that it is impossible for him to do a day&#39;s work; and it is a fact, I understand, that he has not done a day&#39;s work since his return. He was at one stage in receipt of the full pension, but the medical officer sent up from Sydney examined him and certified to the Board that he was not totally incapacitated. He is now regarded, therefore, as being only two-thirds incapacitated, and his pension has been proportionately reduced. Seeing that the man cannot work, it is self-evident that he is totally incapacitated. While he was just as fully incapacitated as he is to-day, Amos was receiving the full pension. I appealed to the Board to review its decision, but have been informed that it is not able to see any reason to make an alteration. I wish to refer now to the case of a man named Taylor. The following letter from the  chairman  of the Repatriation Commission, addressed to myself, and dated 24th May, 1921, gives the particulars- </para>
                    <para>William R. Taylor, 2426, Private, 36th Battalion. </para>
                    <para>With reference to your representations to the Acting Minister regarding the case of the above-named, I have to inform you that careful consideration has been given to this case by the Commission, and, in view of the medical evidence, it cannot be considered that <inline font-weight="bold">Ms incapacity</inline> is the result of, or was aggravated by, his military service.  -His  service record shows that a fortnight after he disembarked in England he was admitted to hospital, and he was almost continuously in hospital up to the time of embarkation to Australia. Moreover, according to his own admission, his condition was pre-existent. Under the circumstances, he was liberally treated in having been paid pension of one-half of the maximum rate from 15th July, 1917, to 27th January, 1021, and the Commission regrets it cannot approve of continuation of payment. </para>
                    <para class="block">In this case it is said that the applicant admitted that the complaint was pre-existent; but if the man was affected when he was accepted and went overseas, his illness became more acute, and, as he cannot now work, there is no justification for the Government breaking away from the promises made. We said at the outbreak of war that if the manhood of our community came forward and enlisted we would stand by them; but now, on the least possible pretext, the Government are endeavouring to get away from their obligations. I admit there may be malingerers, and if there are some who are deliberately endeavouring to obtain a pension on false pretences, they should be dealt with, because they should not take advantage of the concessions which the Government are providing for men who have actually been disabled. If men are able to work they should be prepared to do so; but, on the other hand, if some are incapacitated, or partially so, as the result of war service, and they were passed by the medical examiner, the obligation of attending to them until restored to health is resting upon this Parliament. </para>
                    <para>Another case has been brought under my notice, but as the person concerned is in the electorate of the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> I forwarded the communication to him for attention. I am mentioning the matter, however, so that honorable members may be aware of the position. The man, who is named Skillicorn,  is a miner by occupation, and states that on his return from the war he was granted a pension. Like an honorable man,&#39; when he had recovered sufficiently, he notified the authorities that he was able to resume his occupation, and requested them to discontinue his pension. A short time after he had resumed employment his old complaint returned, and he was as bad as ever, with the result that it was impossible for him to work. He found that the trouble which arose at the war had returned, and he applied to the Board for a renewal of the pension, but it  absolutely  refused to grant it. </para>

My complaint is that the State Boards do not send the complaints to the Commission, and the Minister is not in a position to be conversant with the facts. I am not in any way blaming the Minister, because I know of no man who has worked harder in the interests of the soldiers than he has. The Minister, however, will have to take control of this matter in order to see that his officers carry out the intentions of this Parliament. </para>

These men opposed me at the last election ; but I am fighting for what I think are their rights. During the great crisis in 1914 and the following years, when men were being asked to go to the Front, we offered every inducement to those who were prepared to volunteer by saying that we would stand by them and see that their interests were protected. We said that they should not want as a result of their patriotism; but, although&#39; the war has only been over for two and a half years, the returned soldiers are beginning to realize that they are almost forgotten. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I am endeavouring to prevent it. I want honorable members who made promises to our fighting men to abide by them. I made promises in this Chamber in common with other honorable members, and I am going to see that they are carried out. I sincerely regret that there is a tendency to forget these men who did so much for us during that trying period. It does not reflect to our credit when we realize what is. actually occurring. Even to-day we hear much of patriotism and the freedom we enjoy under the British flag, but the very men who have been prating about their loyalty are not prepared to stand behind the soldiers who went forth to preserve our liberty. On every hand inducement was offered to men to go to the Front, but now it seems that their noble efforts are to be forgotten. The men are beginning to see the true position, and it is up to this Parliament to do something to rectify their wrongs. We can only create loyalty by making the masses contented and happy, but that result will not be achieved if we are constantly taking advantage of those who sacrificed so much for our liberty. We told them that they would have to endure hardships, but that when they returned it would be our duty to see that their wants were provided for. Are Ave to ignore our promises? I trust this House will do its duty, and that the Minister will take the whole matter in hand. I do not wish him to send these complaints on to the Commission, but to personally investigate them, and set up some standard for future guidance. It is the duty of the Minister to let the State Boards and the Commission know that .this House will not allow them to take advantage of the soldiers simply because they were not struck by a bullet or shrapnel. If men were accepted for service, and are now unable to follow their usual occupation they should be provided for. There are some instances in which -men who are performing light work are receiving one-half or two-thirds of what they did previously. In any case in which a man is unable to  do any work, he should be given the full pension. I ask the Minister to give this matter &#39;his very serious consideration. I hope that he will give the Commission and the State Boards to understand that Parliament is deeply concerned with the interests of the soldiers, and expects them to administer the Act which it passed, and that unless they do so they must give way to persons more competent to carry out the job. </para>

                            <para>.- I have much pleasure in supporting the motion moved by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> I believe that honorable members generally are agreed that the .present method of .administering pensions is absolutely unsatisfactory. As one of those who voted for the appointment of the new Commission to deal with pensions, I want to say that, if I had the opportunity to-day, I should be very pleased to put the members of the present Commission out of office, and to restore the administration of these pensions to those who previously carried out the work. It really appears to me as if the majority of the present Commission seem to think that it is their duty to cut down every pension they can, with a view to saving money, and without consideration for the rights and justice of the cases of different individuals. </para>

                                <para>- I am &#39;afraid that I must adhere to that statement, because I intend, to bring under notice one or two cases in which the action taken by the Commission seems to indicate that they must have had some consideration of the kind in mind. I wish to refer to some of the &#34; T B &#34; cases of men in different sanatoriums. I refer, first of all, to the case of James P. Cooke. This man enlisted and went to France. While at the Front, he was sent into hospital, and it was discovered that he had this fearful disease of tuberculosis, and he was sent back to Australia. He was put into a sanatorium, and it was there recognised that he was entitled to a pension.  His  health improved, and he was allowed to leave the sanatorium.  His  pension was&#39; continued for a time after he left the sanatorium, and then it was suddenly reduced, and he was granted &#163;1 per week. The reason given for reducing his pension was that he had suffered - and this was admitted - from what is medically termed empyema. This really means an abscess on the lungs, for which an operation is performed, the pus is let out, and the abscess removed, but a scar is&#39; left on the body. Every one conducting a medical examination of the man must have seen this scar, and, by making inquiries, could have found out the cause of it. However, the man was passed as medically fit, .and went to the Front. </para>

                                <para>- I do not doubt that. He was passed by the medical officer as fit for active service, but now, apparently, because of the operation of which the scar is evidence, this man&#39;s pension &#39;has been cut down to &#163;1. This is given as a sort of act of grace, and this man suffering from this awful disease, which requires all the nourishment he can get, is now asked to exist on &#163;1 per week. It is an absolute scandal upon this Parliament and upon every one responsible for the work of repatriation that mou should be treated in this way. Like others similarly afflicted, this man is trying to keep life in his body as long as he can, and he is confronted with, the knowledge that his inability to obtain sufficient nourishment reduces his chance of living.

I should like to say here that I join with the honorable member for Hunter in admitting that the Minister does what he possibly can. My complaint is that the cases to which I refer indicate that there is some one outside more powerful than this Parliament in deciding questions of this sort, which should be decided by us. The lesson is that honorable members should, in future, be very chary about handing over to the control of any outside Commission or Board matters which should be left in the hands of Ministers who may be controlled by the Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- No, but it would be very much more satisfactory if the administration of these matters were under his control. I have to refer to two other cases, those of Messrs. Shaw and Sinclair, which are somewhat similar to those to which I have already referred. It was not denied, in either of these cases, that the men, prior to being passed by the examining medical officer, had suffered years before, and there was a suspicion that they had suffered from this complaint. There is no suggestion that the medical officer was deceived or that the men attempted to deny the facts. He passed them as medically fit; they were enlisted, went through all the camps, and went away from Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, and they were cheered. They came back, and to-day are suffering from this complaint; but the Commissioners say that they were suffering from it before they went to the war, and refuse to give them a pension. In effect, the Commissioners wipe their hands of these men, and leave them to live as best they can. &#34;When we were appealing to the able-bodied men of this community to enlist, every man who offered his services was cheered, as the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> has said, and men were allowed to leave for the Front only after competent medical officers had certified to their fitness. The two men to whom I refer, in common with others who enlisted, were examined, not once, but on several occasions, and were submitted to a final examination just &#39;before they embarked. How, then, can it be said that they were suffering from tuberculosis before they went away? They received a pension for a little while after their return, and were then informed that it would no longer be payable to them. &#34;What is the reason for this treatment? Is it that the Commission are out to save money by treating returned soldiers in this scandalous manner, or is it because they have not a proper appreciation of what were the views of this Parliament in passing legislation with the object of doing the fair thing by our men who went to the Front? </para>

                        <para>I propose now to refer to the case of a man named Bromley, who does not come under the &#34; T.B.&#34; category. He enlisted, was passed as fit, and went to the Front. While there he met with an- accident, went into hospital, and ultimately was returned to Australia. On his discharge, he was given a pension, which, later on, was reduced, and finally was stopped on the ground that he was fit to follow his usual occupation. The actual facts are that as soon as Bromley was able,, after his return, to get about, he  Was  given employment at the Keswick Barracks. He was suffering from spinal trouble, and could not stoop; but the work allotted to him at the barracks did not involve any stooping, and he was able to carry on. While at the barracks he received a pension. Owing to the gradual reduction- of work at the barracks, Bromley left, and got another job where he had to stoop, The consequence was that he was taken ill, and went into the Keswick Hospital. Before he went there, however, his pension had been stopped on the ground that he was able to follow his usual occupation. He remained in the hospital for months, and, although he is out to-day, he is told by medical men that he must always wear a spinal jacket, and on no account do any work which will involve his stooping. And yet the authorities say that &#39;he is fit to follow his usual occupation, and refuse to give him a pension. </para>

What are likely to be the feelings of a man who is treated in this way? Those responsible for such treatment have no compassion. Their sole object is apparently to cut off as many pensions as possible. They seem to think that by making reductions in this way they are carrying out their duty. I do not think they are, and will join with others in an effort to force these gentlemen to realize what the Parliament wants them to do in the direction of carrying out effectively the duty of Australia to those who fought for it. </para>

                            <para>.- The &#34;Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> said a few moments ago that I was one of the most favoured members of this House. As to that, I can only say that I realize that one can get nothing but of the Departments by running hostile to their official chiefs. If a man cannot get anything out of t.hem when he has the influence of the Minister behind him, then there is absolutely no chance of obtaining redress. If honorable members generally get no more satisfaction from the Departments involved in this matter than I do - notwithstanding that the Minister says that I am one of the most favoured of members - then God help them!&#39; In my twenty years of parliamentary experience, I have not known a Department to show a more callous indifference to the requirements of members than that shown by the Departments dealing with war pensions and war gratuities. One can write letter after letter to them, get the support of the Minister, and yet not obtain a definite settlement. I have written to the Minister, obtained his support, received from him an acknowledgment of my letter and a statement that it has been sent on to such-and-such a Department, but month after month has gone by without any definite settlement. That has frequently been my experience. Here are two cases that are typical of dozens with which I have had to deal. The first relates to a man whose position is very much like that of the returned soldier to whom the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> has just referred. He was called up and asked why he did not enlist. He said he was not able to go to the. Front; that he was physically unfit, inasmuch as he had an hereditary complaint. He was passed, however, as fit, went into camp, developed the complaint to which he had said he was liable, and asked to be paid off, but was kept there for nearly two years. He was finally paid off because he could not stand up. To-day that man is a derelict, living on the charity of his friends, and can get no relief from the Department. I agree with the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that the responsibility for the proper treatment of these men rests with the Government themselves. This man told the authorities that he had an hereditary complaint, but he was told to come up, was passed as medically fit, and sent into camp. I am concerned, not so much with the decisions arrived at by the Department from time to time in regard to various cases, but rather with the delay in dealing with matters submitted by honorable members. Surely when I address a letter to the Department, I am entitled to an answer. If I write to the Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> in regard to a particular case I at once receive from him a letter to the effect that the case has been sent on to such-and-such an officer to be dealt with. But there the matter ends. I wait month after month, but hear nothing from the Department. Finally the man concerned comes to me and asks what I am doing in the matter. I reply, &#34;I wrote to the Minister months ago, got an answer from him, and wrote to the Department, but no settlement of the case is forthcoming.&#34; Then I have to go through the whole procedure once again. The Department seems to absolutely ignore the cases submitted to it by honorable members, There is one more case, which is typical of dozens. A woman whose husband was killed at the war had adopted a child from a few weeks old, and she was told by an officer that if she complied with the conditions of legal adoption she could get a pension for it. This the woman did, and was duly given a pension ; but it was suddenly cut off, and no reason given. I wrote to the Minister on her behalf, and the case was sent on to the officials, and I received an acknowledgment of the receipt of my letter. But no reason was given even then for depriving this woman of her pension. Why are not definite answers given to communications of the kind ? Apparently the Minister then forgot all about the case, but finally a letter came to say that the woman should inform the Department as to which officer it was who told her to legally adopt the child. How could the woman tell which officer it was <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> What does it matter who gave the woman that information ? The fact remains that she complied with the conditions, and yet the pension is cut off. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, when an honorable member writes to the Minister about such matters there is no definite answer. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member has been long enough in Parliament to be able to answer that question himself. Only this morning a gentleman came to my door with a letter from the honorable member, in which &#34;My dear Anstey&#34; was informed that the honorable member had sent this man along, and hoped that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> would do all he possibly could for him. I have done so, and yet the honorable member asks a question like that! Some of these men and women have been writing to the Department for twelve months without receiving any answers.Under the circumstances, to whom can they go but their parliamentary representative, who, however, is equally unsuccessful in extracting anything definite? These people then give up the matter in despair; and what is the result? The member loses their votes; and what more important loss could there be? I can only say that if I do not get some satisfaction - if, in reply to complaints, I continue to get the same old answers to the same old story from the same old crowd - I shall move the adjournment of the House every day of the week, and every week of the month. </para>

                                <para>- They have no chance; but such appeals ought to be unnecessary. I receive letters nearly every week complaining that, for reasons not given, pensions have been suddenly taken away. One man, who is a cripple, has five children to maintain, and yet his pension has been suddenly taken away. The Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> may laugh, but if he were in the position of&#39; that cripple he would laugh &#34; on the other side of his mouth.&#34; I have had a number of hard cases brought under my notice, and, in the absence of any satisfaction from the Department, I propose to move the adjournment of the House daily, devoting a day to each case. I do not accuse the Minister of not attending to my letters, because only last week he rectified a particularly deserving case that I placed before him. Nevertheless, it is a scandal that unfortunate widows, who are deprived of their pensions, have to write to me, or some other members, and ask them to move the Minister in order that they may get their rights. The present state of affairs shows that there is something wrong. Why are these pensions cut off? The other day a widow wrote to me to the effect that, after her husband was killed, she was given a pension of &#163;2 per week; but early this year that pension was cut down to &#163;1, and no reason given. There is no doubt that it is the system that is bad. I could now submit to the Minister half-a-dozen fresh cases which he could not refuse to consider. </para>

                                <para>- The weather is too cold for any crisis. The honorable member who interjects is jocular, but there is no man in the House who is more sympathetic with these unfortunate pensioners than himself; and surely if there is one section of the community to whom we owe consideration it is this. I have no hesitation in saying that there is not an honorable member who is not strongly of opinion that some change is necessary; and we ought to insist on something being done. We ought not to talk of creating a crisis. This is not a party question, and the Minister is thoroughly sympathetic, as we know from the efforts he made at the inception of the repatriation scheme. At the same time, there are unfortunate people who cannot obtain clothes and food for themselves and their children, although promised that they would be looked after, and they have been crippled and ruined by the war. I invite the Minister to look into matters for himself, and then inform the House that there is to be a change. I do not know that the officials in charge are unsympathetic, but, if not, they have a curious way of showing their sympathy. If these officials cannot efficiently carry out their duties, there are many men in the community ready and able to do so. </para>

                                <para>- Let us have some system other than the present one. Many people apply for and receive invalid and old-age pensions who are not entitled to them, and, at the same time, there are many deserving unfortunates who are unable to get pensions. The whole question of pensions ought to be tackled by the Government. Unless the Government give the old-age and invalid pensioners enough to keep body and soul together, something will have to be done which the Government will not find very pleasant. I have no desire to make any threats, but I urge the Minister, whose heart, I know, is in his job, to give the people to whom I have been referring some satisfaction. Let ns go back to the  old  system, or adopt any system but the present one, which is rotten  and  unsatisfactory all round. </para>

                            <para>.- I join with those honorable members who say that a considerable change has been noticeable since the alteration in the system of administering the pensions. I also indorse the statement that once a man was passed by the proper medical authorities and sent overseas, from that moment the Government accepted the fullest responsibility for his future welfare, whether the decision as to his medical fitness for service was right or wrong. No doubt other honorable members have received, as I have, numerous letters complaining of f aulty &#39; administration of the Pensions Act, the frequent excuse for refusing to pension being that the injury received was not due to warlike operations. I may mention the case of a Gurkha, a steady,  hard-working  man, married to a white woman, and with a family of three children, whose injury the Department declared was not due to the war. As a matter of fact, that man had never had a day&#39;s illness in his life before he went to the Front. After being in the trenches for about, six months, he was blown up one day and was injured in the abdomen by a piece of the falling timbers. Since then he has frequently been vomiting blood. Upon representations being made to the Department he was subsequently allowed a pension of 7s. 6d. per week and a few shillings for his wife and children. Whether his pension was reduced because he is a coloured man I cannot say, but, at all events, there was an admission that his injury was due to war-like operations, though he has been denied full pension rights. I may also quote the case of a man who had an injury to the knee of many years standing, but prior to the war it was practically all right, and he was passed for active service. As the result of excessive marching and hard work in the trenches, his knee gave way again, and it is now contended that as the injury had been sustained prior to the war, his claim for a pension cannot, be entertained. I could recite case after case in a similar strain, and I have no doubt that honorable members on both sides can do the same. I know of a consumptive boy who contracted the disease on active service, and for the last six months has been looking in vain for a convalescent home in New South Wales. I had a letter from him only this week stating that he was obliged to return to his own home because he could not get into a Government institution. </para>

                                <para>- I know of another man who was injured during the war and whose pension has been stopped. He has a wife and three children, and he is now living in one of the war service homes. He has no income at all now, and does not know what is going to happen. On his behalf I have put in at least four or five independent medical certificates, including one from the doctor who passed him for active service. This man is now living on the charity of his neighbours. </para>

                            <para>.- I rise to support the motion that has been submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Charlton).</inline> Though I do not wish to repeat the instances given by honorable members who have already spoken, of soldiers injured on war service not being sympathetically treated, I desire to point out that this lack of sympathy and consideration for returned soldiers is not confined to the Pensions Department. It seems to be general through the whole administration of the Repatriation Department ; and with other honorable members who have spoken, I think it is time the Government took drastic action to remedy the present state of affairs. Things have come to such a p&#39;ass that it is an absolute scandal in every direction. Honorable members are being inundated with letters from returned soldiers, or widows of deceased soldiers, in connexion with their claims &#39; for pension privileges. They say that they are being starved of the amount of pension due to them, and which this House considered they were entitled to receive. On the other hand we have evidence that the small saving made by interfering with the comfort of these people, who deserve our best sympathy and proper treatment, is wasted in other directions. When I had the opportunity of speaking a week ago in regard to the assets that would remain to the Commonwealth in connexion with the expenditure incurred in building war service homes and settling soldiers on the land, I was asked to give definite instances of actual waste, the cause of which is exactly the cause of the trouble in regard to pensions, and that is lack of proper organization. Undoubtedly if the administration of war pensions had been left in the hands of the Department which had been accustomed for many years to deal with pensions, the results would have been much more satisfactory. In the same way if the building of war service homes had been left to people who had been building homes for workers in the various States we would not have had the evidence of waste that confronts us to-day. I 4want to point out the lack of sympathy displayed towards soldiers who desire to obtain homes for themselves, and to urge that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> should seize the earliest opportunity of effecting a complete change in the whole method of the administration of the War Service Homes Department. Indeed, the opportunity presents itself now by reason of the fact that there is no War Service Homes Commissioner. The Minister told us, in speaking on this subject last week, that about &#163;10,000,000 had been spent on the building of these homes, but when we examine the way in which the money has been spent, and the return from the expenditure, we are met with evidence such as appears in a paragraph in this morning&#39;s press, informing us that of fifteen houses built at Maryborough, Queensland, by the War Service Homes Commissioner eight are not utilized by soldiers, but are let to others. </para>

                                <para>- People always gain by experience. We, on this side of the House&#62; do not profess to be perfect. But I have risen particularly to refer to one or two instances of inefficient administration. Members could speak for hours on the general disorganization of the Department without making any progress; but as we are constantly being invited, when discussing grievances of this nature, to bring specific cases under the notice of the Minister, I shall direct his attention briefly to two. A soldier, who had  had  considerable service overseas, returned suffering from heart trouble, shell-shock, and fits. In the Caulfield Hospital he was subject to frequent fits, but was discharged from the institution without a pension. When he made a claim for pension rights, the generous Pensions Department opened their hearts to the extent of giving him a miserable 10s. per week for himself, a wife, and two children, although he was totally unfitted to follow his pre-war occupation. Another case is mentioned by a lady who wrote to me on the 14th May from a place in the Corio electorate. I do not mention  her  name, because it is not fair to persons who write in this way  that  their distress should be advertised. I have here the case of a soldier&#39;s widow, who was for a time receiving &#163;5 9s. per  fortnight in pension and allowances, but, under the new regulation, which has been administered very drastically of late, she gets only 27s. 6d. per week, or &#163;2 15s. a fortnight. In a letter that I received from her this afternoon, she thanks me for the interest I have taken in her affairs, and tells me that her husband died of pneumonic influenza after being sent back from overseas as medically unfit, and she goes on to say that unless the Department comes to her assistance, the home, or, as she terms it, the hut, built for her try her deceased soldier husband must be sacrificed. She cannot keep the wolf from the door, feeding and clothing herself and her children on the miserable pittance she gets from the Department. I may be chided by the Minister for having mentioned this case before taking it to him, but complaints of this kind are general among honorable members. There should be no need to go to the Minister with these grievances. What is needed is sympathetic administration, and the sooner the work is intrusted to persons having a little of the milk of human kindness in their composition, the better it will be for those whose cause we champion. </para>

                            <para>.- I join with other honorable members in voicing discontent and dissatisfaction with the administration of the Repatriation Department. The Minister is sympathetic, but, unfortunately, he puts too much reliance on certain officials, and, apparently, takes their word for everything. I acknowledge that in several cases I have got satisfaction from him, but in others there has been considerable delay, and, in one instance, nothing has yet been done. In this last case, an unfortunate soldier was drawing the full pension for a little while, and was suddenly deprived of it. Within a fortnight he claimed an invalid pension. Honorable members know how difficult it is to obtain that pension, unless the applicant is absolutely incapacitated. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. This man has a wife and five children. He appealed to the Department, but it was three months before his first letter was answered, and for that time he and his family were starving. I then wrote to the Minister, and got from him an immediate reply; but there was a further delay of three weeks. Finally the man was told that he was suffering from a pre-war injury, and was not entitled to a war pension. Now, those who volunteered for active service had to undergo a stiff medical examination, not once, but a number of times, and there was a final examination just previous to sailing. This man must have been in pretty good health to be accepted by the authorities. I do not know whether he went beyond England, but he was certified to by the doctors in Victoria as medically fit when he left Australia. Had he been suffering from any complaint previous to enlistment, the doctors who examined him should have discovered that fact. This man was willing to do his bit, and, of course, if he had suffered from rheumatism prior to enlistment, the trouble would have become worse in camp here, and would have been further increased by the life on board ship. But the man was accepted as fit, and no doctor can now say definitely that he had rheumatism before he enlisted. A doctor can merely guess at what may have been the original state of things. There seems a desire on the part of some doctors to cut down the war pensions as much as they can. I asked by interjection a little while ago if the Minister had instructed the doctors to do this, and he said that no such instruction had been given. </para>

                                <para>- I accept the Minister&#39;s denial. Some of these doctors are exceeding their duty. I know of a case in which a soldier who was getting 42s. a week had his pension reduced to 28s. a week on the word of a lady doctor, practically without examination. She said to him that pensions would be a thing of the past very shortly, as the Government could not afford to pay them. </para>

                                <para>- In the Ballarat district. I do not know why the Department has appointed any lady doctor for this work. This lady&#39;s remark showed that she has little sympathy with returned men. Weeks have gone by, and they are still waiting for a further examination; but they will have to wait months unless definite action is taken with the Commissioner or the  Deputy  Commissioner of Repatriation. Not long ago the allowance of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Young</inline> was reduced. She has a sickly daughter, who . sometimes earns as much as 30s. a week, and she lost a boy in the war. The Department, in a letter to her, had the impudence to suggest that this girl could help to support the mother. </para>

                                <para>- It was a callous suggestion to make. Another widow, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Lewis,</inline> who lost a boy in the war, had her allowance cut down. She gets a pension of 30s. a week, and 2s. 6d. for a girl of thirteen. A son of eighteen also lives with her, and the Department told her that it was the duty of this son to help to support his mother. He is a good son, but a boy of eighteen does not earn very much. It is all very well for an official who is being paid &#163;1,500 a year to make these suggestions; but it should not be forgotten that we promised the soldiers who went away that their widows and mothers would be given a fair and square deal. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. We made a grave mistake in the drafting of our Pensions Act; but the Act should be administered more sympathetically. Probably in this case the Department would say that, because the boy who was killed was not earning more than &#163;1 a week at the time of his enlistment, he was worth only 15s. a week to his widowed mother, it being forgotten that had he not answered the call he would to-day be earning &#163;4 or &#163;5 a week, and be worth so much more to her. I hope the Minister will give consideration to these cases. </para>

                        <para>Now in regard to vocational training. A number of men who were being trained at the Ballarat School of Mines have been ordered to Melbourne. They are nearly all of them partly incapacitated, and most of them are married men. They are learning the trade of carpenters&#39;, and I believe that 90 per cent. of those trained for that work have proved efficient. Now, in order to centralize everything in Melbourne, these men are being ordered to Melbourne, almost at a moment&#39;s notice. They are to receive a miserable 25s. a week to maintain them while completing their training here. The Minister is surely opposed to this centralization policy. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. I appealed to the honorable gentleman in regard to a soldier who was ordered to Melbourne, and he countermanded the order. About nine returned men, who are buying homes in Ballarat on the instalment system, and who lived there before the war, and would, had they not volunteered for active service, be now in comfortable circumstances, are told to break up their homes, and go to Melbourne. The  Deputy  Commissioner has notified them that their sustenance allowance will cease on the 9th June unless they comply with this instruction. We have at Ballarat instructors as good as any in the metropolitan area. </para>

                                <para>- We have. It was shown at the meeting last night that 95 per cent. of the men turned out from the local schools have proved efficient, and that they have made &#163;5,000 worth of material which has been sold for the benefit of the Repatriation Department. If the men cannot get at country centres training as good as is given in Melbourne, the Department should be prepared to make the small financial sacrifice involved in sending an instructor from Melbourne. I do not agree that the soldiers cannot get proper training at Ballarat. &#39; If, however, the Commissioner or the Industrial Training Committee puts that argument before the Minister, I hope he will order that an instructor be sent from Melbourne. I ask the Assistant Minister to have the fullest inquiry made into individual cases, and also to call the chiefs of the Department together and give them a lecture, telling them particularly to deal with appeals a little more readily than they are doing at present. When a man- lodges an appeal against the amount of money paid to him the matter should be finalized within a fortnight. I feel sure that instruction from the Assistant Minister to the head of the Department and the doctors to be a little more sympathetic in their dealings with incapacitated soldiers will have a beneficial effect. </para>

I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without making it clear to the Minister that I am quite in accord with the protest which has been voiced by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and others who have spoken on this motion. It is astonishing to me that action similar to that which has been taken to-day has been necessary at least three times this session. I am surprised that the Assistant Minister has not been able to do something to, at any rate, modify the grievances that are constantly brought before him. The fact that protests have been made from every part of the House is proof that there are good grounds for complaint. Of course, the Assistant Minister realizes that honorable members are not animated by any desire to attack his administration; they have said that they have found him hardworking and full of sympathy for the soldiers. But the House cannot be satisfied with that: We must have a change quickly, for I am afraid no Government could survive for long attacks such as are being made on the administration of the present Government in respect of soldiers I rose to emphasize two matters in particular. I hold that the question of whether or not a man suffered incapacitation from warlike operations should not be considered when dealing with his claim for a pension. With other honorable members, I say that if, .after a man was passed as medically fit for active service, he became incapacitated either in warlike operations or after his return from abroad&#62; there should be no inquiry as to whether or not the trouble was existent prior to enlistment. </para>

                                <para>- Possibly it is not, but the administration could be more sympathetic than it is. If the Assistant Minister agrees with the House generally that once a man has been accepted for war service the Government must shoulder their responsibility in regard to his incapacitation, I need say no more. These cases should be rectified at once, because they are the subject of general complaint, and I agree with the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> that no medical man can say definitely, in a large number of cases, whether or not the cause of incapacitation was pre-existent. </para>

                        <para>Another trouble arises in the determination of persons who may be considered dependent upon a deceased soldier. Other honorable members have mentioned that the claims of mothers of deceased soldiers for pensions have been refused because the soldiers had not been contributing towards the support of their mothers before they went to the war. The cases of these mothers are amongst the hardest of those dealt with by the Department. </para>

                                <para>- One honorable member has already effectively argued that a young fellow who was, say, eighteen years of age when he enlisted would probably be earning very little, and his parents might not, at the time, need his help. Even though he was not contributing to the maintenance of his parents then, it is reasonable to suppose that he would be doing so if he were alive now and five or six years older than  when he enlisted. The provisions of the Act governing these claims should he administered more generously, and regardless of whether or not the deceased soldier was contributing towards the keep of his mother before he enlisted she should be entitled to a pension if she is in need of it. </para>

                        <para>In regard to the general question of pensions administration, I admit that I supported, the Bill to place under the control of one Department all activities relating to soldiers. I thought that by this change soldiers&#39; affairs would be administered more effectively and more economically. However, the responsibility for the change is immaterial; the fact remains that the administration of pensions by the Repatriation Department is not what it should be, and there is no reason why the evils complained of should not be corrected. In the first speech I made in this House I complained that certain soldiers were not receiving the pensions to which they were entitled, whilst other persons who were not entitled to pensions were receiving them. At that time war pensions were administered by the same Department as controlled old-age and invalid pensions, and even in those days we had ground for complaint. Shortly after the publication of that speech I received a letter from the Commissioner of Pensions asking me to cite cases in support of my allegations. I immediately cited the cases of several soldiers and dependants who had been refused pensions to which I considered they were entitled, and I am glad to say that in most cases adjustments were quickly made, and the persons concerned received their dues. The Commissioner then invited me to mention persons who were in receipt of pensions to which they were not entitled. I replied that I was not prepared to do that. I did not consider it my duty to tell the Department of parents who were drawing pensions although they were not in need of such assistance. I remember that one case that I brought before the Commissioner was that of the mother of a deceased soldier; he was eighteen and a half years of age when he went to the Front, and the mother was sixty-five years of age and the father seventy-one years of ac;e. The mother was told by the Department that she was not entitled to a pension because she was not dependent upon her son before he enlisted. As a matter of fact, the parents were assisting the lad to pay for his education, and it was unfair of the Department to raise the question of dependence. That was realized ultimately, and the mother received her pension. I hope that this is the last occasion upon which the House will require to take action to expose the administration of soldiers&#39; pensions. I do not often make threats, because I realize that a threat must be carried out if the maker of it is to be respected. But I repeat that no Government can long withstand criticism such as has been hurled against the present Ministry on several occasions in regard to the administration of the Repatriation Department. </para>

                            <para>. -  I have been requested by the Repatriation Committee at &#34;Wagga to bring before the House an extraordinarily hard case. Having regard to the seriousness of this complaint, and in order that I may have more chance of having it dealt with effectively, I shall forgo the remarks I intended to make on other &#39;subjects and concentrate wholly upon it. Briefly, the facts are. these: The woman concerned was living with her family of three or four children, the youngest of whom was a little girl aged about one year and ten months. This woman deserted her husband and family in the most callous fashion for another man, and when the war broke out two of her sons enlisted. One of them was killed at the Front, and after his death a question arose in regard to the allotment of his war gratuity. The woman applied for the payment of- the gratuity to herself. The Repatriation League at &#34;Wagga took a very active part in endeavouring to secure its payment to the little girl, who was living upon the charity of a woman in the neighbourhood. The child&#39;s father had died in the meantime, so that she was practically an orphan, without any means of support. This matter was put before the Board, whose lack of sympathy I am wholly at a loss to understand, because when it was called upon to decide between the woman who had cruelly deserted this little girl and the child herself, it decided in favour of the former. In opposition to all common, sense and to all the dictates of humanity, it gave thewar gratuity to the mother. </para>

Upon that occasion, I submitted an amendment to the effect that the administration of war pensions should be allowed to remain with the Department then administering them. Had that amendment been carried, none of this trouble, on which the motion for adjournment has been <inline font-style="italic">moved</inline> to-day, would have arisen. Our war pensions were taken out of the hands of a sympathetic body and handed over to officers who are dealing with the claimants for those pensions most unsympathetically. </para>

                                <para>- No. I admit, however, , that the Minister for Defence and the Minister for the Navy possess discretionary powers in regard to the settlement of the &#34; other allowances &#34; which are mentioned in the motion of the honorable member for Hunter. As a consequence, little or no trouble has been experienced in connexion with those allowances. In Western Australia there has scarcely been a complaint in regard to them. When this motion was launched by the honorable member for Hunter, he referred in a very gentlemanly way to the many persons who during the progress of the war had waved flags, and who generally indulged in a perfect frenzy of patriotism. He. spoke also of the promises which were made to the men who enlisted. In Western Australia I took a prominent part in a recruiting campaign, and I frankly admit that from almost every platform I told the people that the best which we could give them was not too good for. those&#39; who volunteered. I still hold that opinion. But there is no party in this House which has a monopoly of that view. There are just as loyal men on one side as on the other. I can only speak for my own State, but I am bound to say that the people of Western Australia, not only talked patriotically, but worked patriotically, with the result that they contributed &#163;1,750,000- more than &#163;3 10s. per head of the total population - to assist our returned soldiers. Until the Repatriation Commission took over the administration of pensions every case which came up for review, after an application had been refused, was passed on to me for investigation. I am not prepared to say that those who are administering pensions today are hard-hearted. Neither can I say that the medical officers with whom I have come into contact are at all callous. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt; and, with respect to  a  great many cases, I am sorry that political influence  has  been brought  to  bear. It is not fair that one member  of  Parliament, who may have  a  strong political &#34;pull,&#34; should be able to show that he can get things done, while others equally active in the interests of their constituents, and equally sympathetic towards returned men, cannot secure similar results. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> remarked) with respect to review and investigation of cases of complaint, that they ought all to be settled within a fortnight. I assure him that that could not be done, since inquiries, one way or another, often take much longer.Irecall an instance to show that particulars of cases, as they are made public in pursuance of a policy of criticising the pensions administration, will not always stand investigation. The circumstances of a certain family w&#39;eTe taken up prominently by the press in my State, under such headings as, &#34; Scandalous treatment of a soldier.&#34; It was my task to make inquiries, and I found that the family was getting &#163;6 2s. 6d. from governmental sources. Yet, before leaving for the war, the head of that family had never earned so much per week. Every case has to be dealt with on its own peculiar merits. In my opinion, there should be  a  committee of review established in each State, or in each district among  a  number into which every State should be cut up. The task  of  such committees should be to investigate every case of complaint. Thus there would be brought about what honorable members desire. The committee&#39;s &#39; should have the right of reference, not only to the Commission, at headquarters, but to the Minister also. That would insure that every person got a fair deal. </para>

A pension is assessed after the examination of the complete medical records of a soldier abroad, and at home upon his discharge, and afterwards by personal examination by the departmental medical officer. The soldier has the right of appeal to the State Board, and a further right of appeal direct to the Commission, and the latter body has scope of reference to the highest medical authority in the land. I mention these details to show that the Government have provided machinery for the reasonable assessment of pensions, and &#39;have fortified themselves and the Commission by power of reference to the best medical advice available. I wish to say here that, during the whole of the war period and since, the Government have been under a deep debt of gratitude to the Australian medical profession. </para>

                                <para>- I believe it is. Almost every honorable member who has spoken to the motion has expressed the opinion that if a man was accepted for active service his fitness has been proved, and he should be entitled to a pension if incapacitated. I find in some instances that there is some justification for such a request, hut honorable members must remember that that is not the law. If there was a pre-existent condition which has been aggravated by war service allowance is made for that aggravation; but a returned soldier is not granted a pension as a right because a pre-existent condition was not observed at the time of his enlistment. That is the chief cause of complaint against the administration. I have noted all the other cases mentioned, and I shall, as I did on a previous occasion when cases were submitted, pass them through the Department, and ask for an early decision. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think I can be charged with inactivity or lack of sympathy in the matter of pensions, because I have endeavoured to do my best in the interests of returned men, even if it involves working through day and night, as I have done for months past. I shall place these complaints before the Commission for the purposes of analysis, and direct that close investigation shall be given to the statements made to-day. I have been pressed in certain directions to agree to some of the requests, but to do so would mean amending our existing legislation. At present there are in existence 222,398 pensions, and to amend the law and alter the incidence of pensions would be a very serious matter, involving heavy financial obligations. I can, however, promise honorable members that every endeavour will be made to continue to sympathetically administer the Act, even if it means Ministerial intervention. At this juncture I cannot promise to introduce amending legislation, but I shall bring the points raised by honorable members before my colleagues with the idea of giving assistance. </para>

I have no objection to the amendment which the Minister has now moved, but I think it should be withdrawn until we hear his reasons&#39; for taking articles out of sub-item  a  which were previously included in it. </para>

                            <para>.- I cannot profess to have a knowledge of the importation of goods, and I wish that some members of the Committee who possess that knowledge would look into these proposals to know how they affect the trading of the country. Prom information placed at my disposal, and from the attitude of the Minister, I am led to the conclusion that there is almost an absolute disregard of how the Tariff proposals affect the importation of various articles by the public. They are so mixed up in different items as to make the administration of the Tariff very difficult for the Customs Department and for the public, and necessarily, on that account, more expensive for the people generally. It seems to me that throughout this Tariff the Minister has accentuated this difficulty. I know that his desire is to make the Tariff more complete, but it is possible to go too much into detail, and I must say that all the other Tariffs I have read appear to me to have been framed with far greater simplicity than this. I point out, for instance, that if a person imported a knife,, fork, and steel in a single case, it would be found that each of the articles is placed for duty under three different items. That is carrying detail to an absurdity. Most of the articles covered by the items now under consideration are imported for purposes of manufacture, and the Minister desires that they shall be admitted free of duty, but he has transferred some of the items to other items in the Tariff under which they will be dutiable. In the case of small articles of this kind I think that is not justified. I move - </para>

                                <para>- I do not intend to press my amendment, because the information given to me may not fit in with the departmental ideas. I am sure that the Minister realizes that I am not trying to embarrass him, or, in this case, to increase or reduce duties. What I am fighting for is the simplification of the Tariff, and that, I believe, will do a great deal of good. It would assist importers in passing their goods through the Customs. There are grave difficulties to-day, and they are increased by the form in which this Tariff is presented. I should like  to have my amendment on record, though, if the Minister explains that it cannot be accepted,I shall be prepared later to withdraw it. </para>

                            <para>.- We have made a number of alterations in classification that have been due to one of two causes. Either we were taking out of the free list certain articles which we considered should be dutiable owing to the fact that their manufacture had been established in this country, such as clasps, slides, buckles, and certain buttons, or they were considered necessary as the result of the experience of the Department in handling certain goods. Necessarily the Department gathers experience in the working of the Tariff. </para>

I am quite sure, from the many talks I have had with my officers over a number of those things, that when we come down to actual details, it will be found that there is a good and sufficient reason for every alteration made. I do not mean to say that the Department is infallible. We may have made mistakes in some instances. </para>

                            <para>. - Many of the articles in the item under review are required for what has become a very important business in Australia, namely, the manufacture and trimming of ladies&#39; hats. The Minister has put these goods under an item where they will be dutiable at 15, 20, and 30 per cent., because the manufacture of two or three of them has been started in Australia. I remind him that two or three of these articles are no earthly good for the millinery business. </para>

                            <para>.- I desire to press this matter a little further. Under the departmental by-laws the Minister has taken the power to deal with dutiable goods under item 404, under which &#34; Materials and minor articles as prescribed by departmental bylaws for use in the manufacture of goods within the Commonwealth&#34; are free if imported from Great Britain. .&#34;Nearly all the articles included in my amendment have been so dealt with. Although, this Parliament may place a duty on certain goods, the Minister, by notice in his weekly Tariff circular, can transfer them to the free list. Later on he can, if he thinks fit, transpose them once more to the dutiable list. The question of whether or not an article should come in free should rest, not with the Minister, but with the Parliament itself. The alteration qf the wording of the item in connexion with buttons, i am advised, is merely a simplification. I am told that, at the request of the Chamber of Manufactures and the metal interests, we are to have a proposal for a duty on buttons. I shall deal with that proposal when it comes before us. As to my amendment, I am advised that - </para>

Any man who ventures to set up a factory in one of our cities, it seems to me, may get his raw material free of duty, whereas the man in the bush has to pay duty en all that he requires. Is that to be the policy of the Government ? I fail to see why it should be possible for a man who can bring pressure to  beaT  on the Department or the Minister to get his goods in for manufacturing purposes duty free, while the man who is not prepared to stoop to that sort of thing has to pay duty on all that he requires. </para>

                                <para>- Almost wholly. The Minister has made many alterations, acting sometimes, no doubt, on departmental recommendations. It is natural that many alterations should be required, but my contention is that a decision of the Parliament placing any item on the free list or making it dutiable should be varied only by the Parliament. Seeing that nearly every item I have included in my amendment has already been dealt with by the Minister under item 404, I shall certainly press it. </para>

                            <para>. - It seems to me that we have reached a stage in our history when it is considered reprehensible for an honorable member to advocate any cause but that of the manufacturers. There is something radically wrong with the present situation, seeing that we are expected to give every attention to the claims of the manufacturer, and to pay no regard to the protection of the consumer. The man who has to carry the burden is not to be considered. I am in agreement with the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> in regard to the framing of this Tariff. In nearly every item we see a reference to departmental by-laws. It seems to me that in the circumstances it is unnecessary for us to discuss the Tariff. Why not hand over the whole schedule to the Minister and his officials, and let them deal with it as they please ? The honorable member for Dampier is also right in his statement that, the Tariff is altered from week to week without the knowledge of the Parliament. The Minister has power to make alterations. He can put dutiable articles on the free list and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline></para>

                                <para>- I am finding fault not with the Minister, but with the Parliament for giving the Minister power to make such alterations. What is the use of our passing a Tariff if the Minister or one of his officials may alter it at his own sweet will? As the honorable member for Dampier has said, the man who can bring pressure to bear on the Minister may have articles required by him for manufacturing purposes placed on the free list, while the poor, struggling man in the country who has no influence has to pay a duty on everything. Why were the small lines to which the honorable member has referred taken out of the item under which they fell in the old Tariff? If the Parliament imposes a duty on any article I am convinced that it will he prepared to remit that duty where satisfactory reasons can he shown for doing so. I do not believe in a &#34; one-man show,&#34; but that is what we are getting under the departmental by-law in regard to this particular item. </para>

It is easy for me, after my long experience in Healing with the Tariff, to appreciate how that item works out, but I can quite understand that it is difficult for any one without that experience to grip it in the same way. There are a vast number of articles which come under various classifications, and are dutiable under the Tariff. Item 404 confers a special power which Parliament deliberately placed in the hands of the Minister, and it reads as follows : - </para>

                                <para>- We shall deal with coal-cutting machines when we come to them; they fall under a different item altogether. Inasmuch as Parliament deliberately gave this power to the Minister with the intention that it should be used, surely we are not to go on collecting the duties when the intention of Parliament was that these articles should be free? It would be utterly impossible to enumerate and set these out in detail - as no one can tell what minor articles would be covered ; the matter has to be determined when a case arises. That is done under item 404, and it is done in the consumers&#39; interest. If we collected the duty on a variety of goods, none of which can be made in Australia, the manufacturer would naturally have to pass it on, and, as I say, the action, when taken, is deliberately in the interests of the consuming public. I cannot see to what the honorable member is objecting. </para>

                                <para>- The position is that Parliament has included hundreds and hundreds of articles in some of the group items of the Tariff. It would be impossible to enumerate them, and so we have a large group of lines under n.e.i., which very often covers goodness knows what. The object of item 404 is that where articles are dutiable under the Tariff, and the articles are not made in Australia, the duty may be taken off; and if the manufacture of the articles is established, the duty is automatically imposed. There has always been such a provision in our Tariff. </para>

                            <para>.- In the case of tubes for bicycles, side-cars, and so forth, the Minister says they can come in free under item 404. I point out, however, that Parliament has said there shall be a duty on such tubes. Where articles have been classified, they should be dutiable in the category in which they  are  placed in the Tariff - all should be free, or subject to a duty as prescribed by the Tariff. </para>

                                <para>.- I am wondering whether the Committee think it necessary to have the slightest information when new proposals are put before us. The Minister has introduced an amendment to impose a duty on certain buttons, but has not given us the slightest information regarding it. Under the circumstances it would be as well for honorable members to know that the Associated Chamber of Manufactures met last week and came to the conclusion that this is a good time to ask for more duties. That chamber has sent out circulars, of which I have been able to obtain copies, suggesting that nearly everything that can be made in Australia ought to be made dutiable in the future. It has sent out word suggesting, in this case, duties of 30 per cent., 35 per cent., and 40 per cent., drawing attention to the fact that the great bulk of buttons used for the uniforms in the various public Departments are imported free of duty, whereas they could all be produced in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I really do not care what the duty is. I merely want to have this objection removed if possible. I am advised that the Inter-State Commission <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> appendix to report No. 193) received a request from the Australian Weaving Company for increased duties on galoons only up to 32 ribs to the inch. This was afterwards withdrawn and an amended proposition substituted asking for this increase on certain fancy galoons only. The present proposal set out in this item covers infinitely more ground and is a vexatious interference with the local manufacture of apparel, besides imposing a higher rate of duty on ribbons, otherwise identical with those in item 106b and increasing the difficulties of classification. If the Minister says the amendment will render the item unworkable, I shall not press my request. </para>

                            <para>.- There are several persons in Australia who dress locally-produced poultry feathers and down. Then there are also local ostrich feathers which are prepared for use. For this reason we have retained the duty, which is not very high, on undressed feathers, and have considerably increased the duty on dressed feathers. The former will protect our own growers of feathers, and the latter will protect the person who imports undressed feathers and dresses them locally. The duty on dressed feathers has been increased by 5 per cent. British and 10 per cent. general. </para>

                            <para>. - Many might be inclined to think that the artificial flowers industry is not worth encouraging, but it is an important source of employment to many persons in Australia. The local makers have great difficulty in getting a footing. They cannot expect the importing houses to help them, and unless they can deal directly with the retailers they are in a very peculiar position. Unfortunately they do not get that assistance which they need from the retail houses. At present large quantities of Swiss artificial flowers are imported, but as Switzerland has never been noted as a country which manufactures these articles, we are of the opinion that they are German flowers. I hope the Minister will consent to increase the general Tariff by another 5 per cent. I have seen women&#39;s hats in milliners&#39; windows for sale at about &#163;1 10s. each. The straw in one of these hats would be worth about 6s. wholesale, and the artificial flowers on it about 4s. 6d. wholesale, but the price of the article is increased considerably because of the number of hands it has passed through. The wholesale people may possibly pay 1s. per dozen for sprays, but by the time they are fixed in a lady&#39;s hat the price is possibly increased by 300 per cent. The importance of this trade is not generally understood. There is an establishment in my electorate making artificial flowers, and employing about sixty hands but in New South Wales the business is on a much larger scale. I have with me some samples of the flowers produced by local makers. I have brought these samples to show what can be done in Australia. </para>

                            <para>.- The Minister has not told us why he has increased these rates from 25 per cent, and 30 per cent. Has he done it by way of acknowledging Australia&#39;s obligations to the Mother Country, or does he wish to prohibit the importation of the finery and flimsiest that the working girls and women of this country like to buy?

                            <para>.- The duties set out in sub-item a of item 110 are practically the same as those in the last Tariff. I notice that in one line the words &#34; Coats, girls&#39;,&#34; are substituted for the words, &#34; Coats, children&#39;s.&#34; I do not know how a distinction can be drawn between a child&#39;s, a girl&#39;s, and a woman&#39;s coat. But I rose to ask the Minister why there should be a duty of so much per article and an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty as well. Would it not be simpler to increase the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, and to get rid of the piece rates? </para>

                                <para>- These are what are known in the trade as &#34; maids&#39; corsets.&#34; Even for these, all the material used is imported, and I am told that to make proper women&#39;s corsets here it would be necessary to import skilled work-people as well. Therefore, I think that the rates of duty on corsets should not be increased. A duty on corsets is a class duty; it is a duty falling upon women as a class, because all women wear corsets. My lady buys a very expensive article, and other -women buy according to their means, but all use imported corsets. If local manufacturers had made any considerable attempt to produce corsets, I would be prepared to give them all the protection possible, but at present they are not making any progress in this industry, although several attempts at establishing it have been made. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> in proposing to give increased protection to the manufacturer, is placing an additional burden on every woman in the country. </para>

                            <para>.- This discussion confirms me in the opinion that, in the interests of a great many people, there should be representatives of the opposite sex in this Parliament to assist us in the discussion of matters of this kind. I have been informed that, despite all that has been said as to the wonderful opening existing in this country for the establishment of the corset-making industry, there are at the present time only 175 people engaged in it, receiving a total wage of &#163;507 per week. I have here a list of the constituents of corsets, and it proves that the whole of the materials for the industry have to be imported. The people who style themselves corset manufacturers have in the past produced only .about 5 per cent, of the corsets required to encircle the graceful forms of our ladies. The bulk of their output is brassieres, a form of bust bodice, and children&#39;s corsets. There are also certain higher-class corsets, made from silk and satin, to which I cannot refer under this item, but I think careful inquiry would disclose that only .a very small percentage of the corsets required by the ladies of Australia is manufactured locally. Can the Minister furnish the Committee with any information to justify the increase of the Tariff from 10 per cent, to 40 per cent. British, and 55 per cent, general? </para>

There was no considerable manufacture of corsets in the Commonwealth. It is quite true that a certain number of expensive corsets were made locally, but the corset most generally worn by ladies was not made in Australia.

                            <para>The Commission is of opinion that this industry presents greater claims for consideration than some of the industries already enjoying substantial Tariff assistance, and that it is anomalous that it should receive different treatment from that extended to ordinary apparel. Compared with many articles of apparel, it involves a greater amount of labour, and, further, it is of advantage in the boxing, labelling, and printing, which are necessary for marketing the article. There is no reason why the claims of the corset manufacturers should not have equal treatment to that already extended to other manufacturers of  apparel </para>
                            <para>The Commission therefore recommends that item 106 (b) in the 1908-1911 Tariff, namely, Corsets, ad val., 15 per cent, general and 10 per cent, preferential, be omitted from the Tariff, and that corsets be included in item 106 (a), apparel and attire n.e.i., 40 per cent, general and 35 per cent, preferential. </para>

Anticipating- that this item would be subject to some criticism, I made it my business to acquaint&#39; myself with the facts concerning the present extent of manufacture in the Commonwealth, and the prospects for the future. During the last twelve months, over 18,000 dozens of  ordinary corsets have been manufactured in Australia. I have seen a large number of girls and women engaged in making corsets, and there is no question that the industry is being carried on on commercial lines. </para>

                                <para>- It is true that one factory in which I saw the actual operation of corset manufacture is owned by a firm which makes brassieres as well, but there are two quite distinct factories. Corset manufacture is carried on very extensively. I know that one large factory is now being established in Sydney in a six-story building, which is to be devoted entirely to the manufacture of corsets, whilst another large firm is making preparations to start manufacture in the Commonwealth. It is indisputable that, although this duty has been in operation for only a short period, the industry is in a fair way to become well established. I have followed the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission, which cannot be accused of having suggested any duties that were not really warranted. I assure the Committee that the corset-making industry is being established on sound commercial lines, and that within a short space of time the local manufacturer will be able to cater for practically the whole of the Australian trade. </para>

I have taken this action because I wish to ascertain whether it is the desire of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to obtain revenue from this particular item, or whether the duty upon it is intended to be protective in its incidence.

                                <para>- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has already informed us that le has visited an establishment in which they are being manufactured upon a large scale. I, too, have seen it. The company engaged in this industry are erecting a large building, which they intend to extend as opportunity offers. The Minister has also stated that other large corset manufacturers propose commencing operations in Australia. &#39; They intend to follow the example of the manufacturers of other commodities overseas, who have intimated their intention to establish businesses within the Commonwealth. I was one of those who thought that this could not be done. I am glad to know that my opinion was not well founded. &#34;We have been told that the proposed duty will be a sex tax. But the duty under the old Tariff was merely a revenue duty, whereas this is a protective duty, which will encourage the manufacture of corsets in our midst. I do not pretend to be a better judge of a corset than is any other honorable member, but I claim to be quite as good a judge. The article which is being locally manufactured is an extraordinarily good one, as anybody conversant with the drapery trade will admit. As a matter of fact, the more expensive style of corsets has been manufactured in Australia for many years. Ladies who could afford to pay &#163;3 3s., &#163;4 4s., or &#163;5 5s. for a superior article have always been able to obtain it. But the present is the first attempt which has been made to manufacture corsets for general female use. The question which we have to determine is whether we desire that Australia shall become a manufacturing country. I am a Protectionist, and I want to see these goods manufactured here upon an increasingly large scale. </para>

                            <para>.- I think we are now quite satisfied that the object of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> in proposing a high duty upon corsets is for protective and not for revenue purposes. But, in my judgment, the duty will merely be a revenue-producing one for many years. It will be a very long time indeed before corsets will be manufactured in Australia to the extent that is necessary to supply local requirements. </para>

                                <para>- That is a very small matter. My point is that most of the materials required in the manufacture of corsets will have to be imported, and imported free of duty. I wish-, also, to stress the fact that the women of Australia will be obliged to pay in the future considerably more for their corsets than they have done &#39;hitherto, on account of the duty which it is now proposed to levy upon them. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> estimated value of the corsets imported into the Commonwealth during the year ended June, 1919, was &#163;875,000, and the estimated value of the corsets manufactured within the Commonwealth represented only about 3 per cent. of our requirements, or a total value of &#163;26,000. As a local industry, the manufacture of corsets has never been a success. </para>

                                <para>- Oh, yes, it has. But the corsets manufactured in Australia have been made chiefly for abnormal figures, and also in connexion with surgical cases. These must necessarily be made from measurements, and that class of corset has been manufactured locally. But no record has ever been kept of the value represented by these manufactures. The present price of corsets is something like 100 per cent. more than it was before the war. During the year 1919-20, nine months of which was covered by the Tariff of 1914, and the remaining three months by the present Tariff, the duty collected upon corsets amounted to &#163;65,200. That period comprised nine months under the 1914 Tariff and only three under the Tariff of 1920. Had the duty been in force for the full year, the amount collected upon corsets from the United Kingdom would have been &#163;99;166, and from the United States of America and Canada &#163;41,981 - a total of &#163;141,147. Canada and the United States of America, by the way, are about the only sources outside the United Kingdom from which corsets are imported. The total value of French corsets  for  the same period under review was only &#163;394,  and of Belgian corsets &#163;217. Added to the total of &#163;141,000 which I have just mentioned, there is always the 10 per cent. put on by the Customs Department, which involves another &#163;7,000. Then there is to he superimposed the importer&#39;s profits. He adds a further 15 per cent., and in addition there is the retailer&#39;s profit on the amount paid in duty. Honorable members should realize what all these increases mean to the women of Australia when paying for their corsets. </para>

                                <para>- Either the Minister&#39;s eyes have been shut or he is talking nonsense. It will be the same old story as during the war. The local manufacturer, behind this protection, will put up his prices as near as he can to the cost of the imported article. The total amount involved in the importation of corsets for 1920, including the 15 per cent. added to the duty by the importer, is about &#163;170,000. That is the extra gum which Australian women had to pay. It is of no use to say that the industry when started in Australia can immediately supply the demand. It has to be built up gradually. There is the important factor of the hygienic characteristics of the modern corset, and it involves grave consideration to any one undertaking local manufacture. The main reason, I suppose, why so large a proportion of the imported corsets comes from the United States of America is because greater attention is given there to the matter of hygiene. The <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Australian</inline> of 5 th May remarks, regarding corsets, that &#34;the ever-changing fashions demand the assistance of the artist and the expert to produce a beauty of form and deportment to coincide with the mode of the moment.&#34; This is well put, but the writer should have taken into consideration the vital point of hygiene. Almost every woman in civilized communities wears corsets, and has done so for generations, so that there has evidently been some natural and physical reason for their universal adoption. This being so, it is imperative that the health and comfort of women should be safeguarded by expert and scientific manu facture. It stands to reason that such skilled manufacture can only be obtained at its best by long apprenticeship and acquired dexterity, and that, in evolving new fashionable shapes, the assistance of medical surgery must be invoked for the featuring &#39; of successful and healthful models. In the journal which I have just quoted, it is also stated that one-third of the local output at present - that is, after some years of work in the local factories - is discarded and sold at reduced prices as such. This shows that the Australian corset manufacturers, to gain their experience, have to supply a large number of corsets to the feminine public which cannot, from the very fact of present manufacturing inexperience, conform to hygienic standards, thereby constituting a menace to the healthy motherhood of the community. Women buy the corsets that suit them best, and their own instinct advises them that the corsets which are most comfortable to wear are most suitable to their health in every respect. I repeat that experience is necessary for the manufacture of the type of corset which women ask for to-day. </para>

A certain line of corset was retailed before the war for 5s.11d. That same article was sold retail during the war period, but before the imposition of high duties, at . 9s. 6d. It has been sold, since the high duties were imposed, for 12s. 6d. - an increase of a little more than 100 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- But here the increased duty proposed is from 10 to 40 per cent. It is not fair to ask our womenfolk to pay for the experience being gained by a few local manufacturers in the course of their blundering along for a number of years in the effort to turn  out a corset of the type fashionably demanded. My desire is to secure the fullest degree of protection for the United Kingdom as against the United States of America. I do not care what duty may be imposed on American imports; but, so far as British corsets are concerned, the duty should be 10 per cent., or, at the highest, 15 per cent. </para>

                            <para>. -  The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> knows more about mines and mining than about ladies&#39; corsets. He has made some remarkable statements which indicate, as a matter of fact, that there is the possibility of a valuable industry being established in Australia. He failed to hit the point at which he aimed when he drew <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> comparison between the prices of a few years ago and of to-day. This was chiefly due to the fact that the type in fashion nowadays is utterly different. There has been a marked change in the character of this particular manufactured article - a difference which has had to do with hygiene. Apart from that altogether, however, women of to-day are asking generally for a very much superior article. And the very fact that it is a superior class of corset which women want nowadays makes the item as reasonable a one for protection as any other fancy article. I will cite, as an illustration, made-up imported costumes. A few years ago these were imported in huge quantities. However, the local manufacturer was given sufficient protection to establish the industry in Australia on an extensive scale. There is no reason why the same results should not accrue from a reasonable protection in connexion with the manufacture of corsets as have resulted by imposing a duty on costumes and other articles of attire. Encouragement should also be given to the establishment of the industry in Australia, because boxed corsets, being light and bulky, add considerably to the cost. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> said that a six-storied factory had been erected in New South Wales. No one is likely to establish  a  six-storied factory in Sydney, where the land values are very high, unless there is  a  reasonable prospect of success. It must  be  admitted that a good deal of skill is required in the manufacture of modern corsets, and men who put their capital into costly buildings in Sydney and elsewhere will not be operating long before they will be able to produce an article quite as good as the imported. I admit that the Minister is asking for an extravagant rate, and if it is similar to that charged on costumes I shall support it. I cannot understand why this important industry was not established in Australia before, and I feel quite sure that the Committee will be prepared to give it the protection to which it is entitled. </para>

Those engaged in the industry are keen business men, and know that if they do not produce a good article they will be unable to sell it. I may remind the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that ladies who can afford to purchase the best type of corset do not purchase the imported article, but have them made to order by local manufacturers, whose operatives work under favorable conditions. Probably manufacturers have to import some of the raw material, but that cannot be used as an argument against the establishment of the industry, because when we commenced building we had to import lead, and slates, and other necessaries. When we first undertook the construction of locomotives it was said that they would cost considerably more than if they were imported, and every argument which has been used against the corset industry has been brought forward at different times in connexion with others. It is quite true that the business people of York-street, in Sydney, and Flinders-lane, in Melbourne, are endeavouring to get honorable members to keep the duties as low as possible. What for ? Not to enable them to employ more, but to keep themselves in a nice, comfortable position. The Minister is taking a step in the right direction, and we should endeavour to encourage this and similar industries by imposing a Tariff which is sufficiently protective. Every honorable member was asked on the hustings whether he was a Free Trader or a Protectionist. I said I was a Protectionist, because I wanted <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> see Australia self-contained, and I am now acting up to that promise. During the past twelve months manufacturers have been building up industries on the understanding that these rates would remain. </para>

These duties have been enforced for the period I have mentioned, and as large sums of money have been invested in buildings, on machinery, and in training staffs, it is unreasonable to suggest that the rates should be reduced by one-half. </para>

At the request of the honorable member for Maranoa, he again put the question to the Committee, and the honorable member subsequently moved an additional sub-item o after 110b had been passed. Since the proposed sub-item 110c has been defeated,. I take it that the whole of item 110 has been dealt with. </para>

I admit that when the  Chairman  called item 110 there was a discussion as to whether it should be put as a whole, and the Minister rose and said he had no objection to the sub-items being put separately if the  Chairman  did not object to that course. The  Chairman  had no objection, and sub-item 110a was put. Discussion arose upon it, and it was carried. Then sub-item b was put. </para>

There may be some reason for this differentiation, but it seems to me that the duty on gloves used in connexion with arduous labour should be lower than that on gloves that are really a luxury. </para>

The hat industry has been carried on here for many years, and although I have not been able to obtain any statistics in regard to it, I understand that it is on a remarkably sound basis. I am told that the Denton Hat Mills have done exceedingly well. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; and I believe they have taken full advantage of the market. My observations will apply also to sub-items c and d, which deal with fur-felt hats and caps and sewn hats. Having regard to the time during which the industry has enjoyed a substantial measure of protection, I think it should be able to stand under the old rates. It has not been shown that there is any necessity for these increased duties, and I can see no justification for an increase. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member will find that I have not raised the duties fixed under the Tariff qf 1914. The reason is that in the interim local hat manufacturers have been able pretty well to cope with the whole of our trade. That being so, I thought it desirable that they should be left in that position. </para>

                                <para>- There is considerable local competition. Before the war we were importing something like &#163;250,000 worth of fur, wool, and felt hats annually. During the war local manufacturers were able, and have been able since then, to take care of the greater part of that trade. The only class now being imported to any extent is the better make of fur hats of very high value. Even that branch of the trade is being catered for by a new factory which has been established quite recently in the electorate of the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Biley).</inline> I believe that factory is now turning out practically as good a hat as is produced in any other part of the world. In the circumstances, I think it desirable to allow the duty under the 1914 Tariff to stand, at all events, for some little time to come. </para>

When I asked the shopkeeper for a Denton hat, he produced one, and although it was only about one-third of the price asked for the imported article, it was, in my opinion, quite as good.

                            <para>. - I should like to ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> whether he has given any consideration to the desirableness of improving the position of that branch of the industry which is making straw hats, and all forms of plaited hats or bonnets. Many persons in Australia have been engaged in all forms of straw hat manufacture. Competition from abroad is now becoming very keen, and those interested in the local trade have only lately discovered the peculiar position in which they# are placed. They approached me some little time ago with regard to the matter, but were rather late in putting it before the Department. If we can produce information showing the necessity for increased protection in respect of this branch of the trade before the Tariff goes to the Senate, will the honorable gentleman give us an opportunity to put that information before the Committee ? </para>

                            <para>.- The matter to which the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> has referred has recently been brought under my notice, but I have not had time to look into it. If, as the result of further investigation, we find it necessary to recommit the item in order to deal with the question, we shall certainly do so. I may remind the honorable member that quite lately we have taken action to assist that branch of the industry- which he has in mind. For instance, only to-night we have placed on the free list the straw braid which straw hat-makers use. We have also taken other action in the same direction in connexion with several items to assist the tra..! e. I am not. sure whether it is possible to do what the manufacturers are asking in regard to hoods, which are included in the sub-item, but if we find it necessary to bring the matter up again later on we shall do so. </para>

Has he nothing to say in regard to the duty on fur hats? We have in this Parliament honorable members who are never tired of attending big loyalty meetings in the Town Hall or Empire Day celebrations, and saying, most fervently, &#34;God bless the Empire.&#34; With a sob in their voices, they talk of the wonderful Empire of which we form a part, and refer with particular pride to that dear old Free Trade country, England. But when it comes to showing some practical preference towards the &#34; dear old Mother Country,&#34; it is represented by a duty of 24s. per dozen on hats. I do not care how much the duties are raised against the foreigner. The hat mills here, particularly the Denton Mills, are paying exorbitant dividends, and yet we find high duties imposed in their favour from Tariff to Tariff. This duty against British hats amounts to prohibition. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> was only stating the truth when he told! us that when he went into a shop he was shown imported hats for which exorbitant prices were asked. I have been offered an imported hat, for which the price quoted was &#163;4 10s. I should want a suit of clothes for that price. </para>

                            <para>.- I think that the honorable member for Maranoa is perfectly right in what he says. A factory has been established in New South Wales which is producing hats of better quality than those imported, but there is a prejudice against them because they are Australian-made. If we can kill that prejudice by excluding imported hats it is a step in the right direction. </para>

                            <para>.- This it-em includes cotton hose, and I have noticed that in previous Tariff debates honorable members, no matter what their political faith might be, have many times expressed the opinion that this commodity is rated too high. The argument has been used for years in Australia, as on the present occasion, that these duties are formed for the purpose of building up industries. But when the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> was Minister for Trade and Customs he admitted that no cotton hose was made in.&#39; Australia. In the 1914 Tariff cotton socks were free under British preference, with a 10 per <inline font-style="italic">cent,</inline> duty under the general Tariff, but under the present Tariff the British duty is 30 per cent. I am quite with honorable members who desire to see industries established in this country, but if cotton socks are not manufactured here there is no industry to encourage; the consumers have to pay the duty every time, arid these in the present instance are the families of the lesser-paid employees. </para>

On the gold-fields of Western Australia recently a wages award was given on the extra cost of living, included in the extra cost being that of the clothing of the children of the workers. The lower-paid men have to clothe their wives and families in cotton hose, for the price of woollen goods is almost prohibitive. </para>

In any case, that arrangement has been entered into only within a few days, so that if this item had been debated a fortnight ago the argument of the honorable member would not have applied. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> yesterday said that his heart never went out for one moment to the manufacturer, who was his last consideration. In this case the honorable member has no manufacturer to consider, but only the persons who have to pay for cotton hose. </para>

                                <para>- I give the honorable member credit for knowing everything that is to be known, but I know that the moment a duty is imposed on these goods we shall have them dumped into Australia by the same people who sent them here before, and the extra price will have to be paid by those least able to afford it. So far as Japanese goods are concerned, we have nothing to fear from them in Australia. They had their chance during the war, and I defy any honorable member to prove to my satisfaction that anything good ever came from Japan. Their productions are the cheapest and shoddiest that have ever come into this country, and, so far as they are concerned, I am content to leave that duty where it is, but I think 30 per cent, on British goods is too much. </para>

                            <para>.- I hope the Committee will not take serious notice of the statements made by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> about the dangers of dumping, because this Tariff has been in operation for about twelve months, and dumping could have been indulged in during the whole of that time. What has been the result of the Tariff ? Is it not a fact that a great number of manufacturers have established important businesses in Australia ? The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> the other day produced some very good samples of stockings and socks which had been manufactured in &#39;his division. </para>

                        <para>Mr.CONSIDINE.- If that is so, I want to know what is the cause of all this industrial unrest throughout Australia. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> informed the Committee this evening that the poorer paid workers in his division were obliged to wear cotton stockings, and in order that they should continue to do so he wants, not to improve their working conditions, but to make cotton goods cheaper. I have no desire to do that. I want the standard of living so raised that the workers of Australia will not need to wear cotton socks. I would prefer that they should wear the woollen article. I want to see every worker in this country in a position to wear the very best material that is obtainable. </para>

                                <para>- If they did in my division what they did in the honorable member&#39;s,, no doubt I would not be here, and so I do not agree with the honorable member&#39;s line of argument in that respect. But I am sure that if he goes back to Kalgoorlie, and tells the workers that he worked overtime in this House in order that they might be enabled to continue to wear cheap cotton socks, it will not contribute much to the success of his future election campaigns. Naturally, he does not want the attention of the workers in his division to be drawn to the fact that he is anxious that their wages shall not be increased to such an extent that they need not be compelled to continue wearing cotton socks, and that he is endeavouring to bring their prices down by a reduction in the Tariff. On the other hand, we hear him talking about dumping. The Protectionist argument is that dumped foreign goods ruin the local manufacturers. The honorable member cannot have it both ways. He complains about the high price of cotton socks and when, by interjection, I asked him how wages were fixed, he confessed they  were  determined by  the  cost of living. That has been my contention  Tight  through this debate on the Tariff, and so the honorable member&#39;sadmissionproves the soundness of my argument that the worker&#39;s wages  are  fixed on the cost of the duty-paid articles. Does the honorable member contend  that  if the cost of living were reduced wages would  remain  at their present level? As a matter of fact, cotton socks, as one item of expenditure  for the  working man, would be considered by an ArbitrationCourt or Wages Board in arriving at a cost-of-living estimate, and to  that  extent it would influence  the finding.  Therefore, does it matter very much to the working class whether we have a Tariff of 100 per cent, or no Tariff at all? The great mass of  the workers  at any time only receive what is  the  average cost of living. </para>

                            (Melbourne Ports) &#91;10.14}. - A fortnight ago I visited ft factory in New South Wales, and was informed that the company were able to supply 4,000 dozen pairs of socks and stockings in three days. We also have, at Hawthorn, Melbourne, an establishment that can produce 200,000 pairs of cotton socks per annum. These businesses have been started under the new Tariff. I can show two pairs of cotton hose, one manufactured in America, and retailed at. ls., lid., and the other manufactured in Now South Wales at a wholesale price of ls., leaving a margin of lid., or nearly 100 per cent., which ought to be sufficient to cover all wholesale and retail profits. The American article is not as good a hose as the stockings made in Sydney; but the. wholesale, houses of Australia, wittingly or unwittingly, retard the progress of local manufacturers by the exorbitant price they demand for passing on the article to the .public. A .profit of 6d. ought to cover all wholesale and retail profits on an article which is turned out by the factory for ls. I can also produce a pair of stockings made in Victoria. The quality is excellent,, but I cannot quote the price. These samples I have .ought to. convince honorable members that cotton stockings can be made in Australia; I was surprised at the quality of the articles produced&#39; in the. New South Wales factory. I want&#39; to point out to the &#39;ladies that the wholesale and retail houses are robbing, thom by the prices th&#39;ey are charging for so-called silk stockings. . Artificial silk -stockings&#39;, made in Sydney,, are sold to the wholesale houses for

                            6d. per pair; but I saw the same stockings&#39; marked at the retail prices of 82s., 6d. and 2ns. a .pair in Sydney. While we. insist&#39; on &#39; the manufacture of these articles in Australia, we ought also to be given power to deal with those who make undue profits out of the consumers.&#39;
