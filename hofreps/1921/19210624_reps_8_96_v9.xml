                        <para>- The information desired by the honorable member is being obtained, and will be made available as soon as possible. Meantime, I suggest to my honorable friend that he should clarify the first question a little. For instance, does he mean it to include applications for new appointments and new positions, because the tendency nowadays is to regard every position which is filled under the terms of the Public Service Act, and which has to be advertised, as an additional appointment ? I therefore suggest that the honorable member should make it quite clear whether his first question relates to new appointments or to appointments under Statute. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Bill proposes the grant of a month's supply, with one exception, Viz., that it provides for three pay days instead of two, as in the case of an ordinary month. We are doing this moire as a precaution than anything else. These three pay days bring us up to the 4th August, and as we do hot quite know when we shall get through the Tariff and consequential legislation next month, I have thought it well to add this extra day's pay to the month's Supply. ' I hope it will be quite clear that all the rest of the Bill refers to one month, and that only wages for three pay days are included in the proposal before us. </para>
                    <para>There are one or two reasons why I ask for a month's Supply at the moment. This is one of those occasions when we have to get Supply, before the end of the year. Ordinarily we need not get Supply until the time comes for paying the wages well on to the middle of the succeeding, month. In this case, however, it is the end of the year, when all votes are cut off automatically ; until we get Supply, therefore, we cannot legitimately spend sixpence in the new year. This Bill, it will be seen, differs from ordinary Supply Bills in that we have to come to the House -and get authority before the year's end, so that services and payments may continue in an orderly and regular manner. ' There is another reason why I am limiting it to one month's Supply. I think that before the Government ask for three months' Supply, which will be requested before the Budget is introduced, the House and the country may fairly ask me "for a review of the general financial situation. </para>

                            <para>- No. I am not now in a position to make such a financial review with any usefulness or accuracy. The year is not yet closed ; revenue is still being received in large amounts, as is always the case in the last .month. Of that1, however, I shall have something to say in a moment. To attempt a general review of the various operations now would be purely guesswork; I should be working in the dark, and, in all probability, I should quite innocently mislead the House in some respects. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>And there is a' further consideration. A general financial debate now would be rather unfortunate, as an interruption to the consideration of the Tariff, which is dragging just a little. I hope we shall be able to dispose of this -Bill to-day, and bring our consideration of the Tariff to a conclusion quite early. It would, therefore, be better to take the course I propose this morning. It would not be fair to ask honorable members to vote three months' Supply without knowing what the financial situation of the country is. It is a carry-on vote, with only one or two exceptions, which I proceed to give. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members will see that there is an unusual amount for a month for the Postmaster-General's Department, and  I  should explain that included in that amount is an item for oversea mails, which has only now been brought to final account in London. This is really  a  remanet of the war period. It will be remembered that when the war broke out our mail services were smashed up, and we had to get our letters carried as best we could, largely in boats subsidized by the Imperial Government. During that period there was an extraordinary increase in the correspondence conducted between here and London, amounting, I think, to from about 128 per cent, to as high as 525 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that would be the reason. We had to get the mails away with as much regularity as possible, and the item is due to the adjustment of the poundage rates which  have just been made in London. After many interviews and much discussion we had a bill (presented to us by the Imperial postal authorities for £321,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oxenham</inline> was in London the other day, and he, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> tackled this subject with * the Imperial postal authorities, with the- result that the amount has now been finally fixed at £200,000. It is that amount which .swells the postal item over its normal size - it is an exceptional item of the kind. That reminds me that the item has been made to do service in Australia by some people who are anxious to economize. ' It has been made to appear, for instance, that this represents a saving which could be effected in the Post Office. If the report of the Economies Commission is looked at, it will be seen that it says that, if this indebtedness were forgiven by the. Imperial Government, it would be a saving. . But. we are not being let off in that way, nor do we -desire to be; we can pay all our legitimate expenses arising from the war, and this item includes , the bedrock of our liability in respect to these mails. </para>

                    <para>Then there is the rather large 'item of the Treasurer's Advance amounting to £750,000. That will be required largely next month for the adjustment of accounts in connexion with our London ships. I think that the payments in London which' we shall be required to make in July will be well over £320,000 for those big refrigerated ships now nearing completion. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say. When these ships were ordered, the same course had to be taken as in the case of other ships ordered at the time; no shipbuilders would tender for them just as house-builders re used to tender for buildings a little while ago, and they have been constructed on a percentage basis. The ships will, be expensive, because refrigeration is expensive. Those ships are all highly and fully refrigerated, and, when completed, will prove most valuable to our primary producers. Thus it is necessary to have, a rather large vote on account of Treasurer's Advance. I have nothing further to add at this moment, except to express the hope that honorable members will be a' little patient until we get the accounts for the financial year closed.. I promise that when they get the accounts they .will see evidence of very substantial economy having been effected, fmd very substantial savings in the expenditure of our revenue; In my judgment, the finances, from the Treasury point of view, are in a' very healthy condition. The revenues 'are- coming in well, and the outlook, from the Treasury point of view, is not nearly so serious as it is attempted to be made by some people outside. </para>

                        <para>.- In view of the Treasurer's statement that this Bill is only to provide temporary Supply, and that later he will make a financial statement, which will permit of a general discussion of the finances, I do not intend at this stage to speak generally upon the financial position. As the Government are desirous of getting this Bill passed to-day, so that the discussion of the Tariff may be resumed on Tuesday, and as many honorable members wish to take this opportunity of bringing before Ministers grievances which they were precluded from discussing yesterday, I shall occupy as little time as possible. I propose to deal with the position at Cockatoo Dockyard. The men formerly employed there have been out of work for many weeks, and I am assured that so desperate is their plight that public subscriptions are being taken up in Sydney to relieve the distress amongst them. Those men were employees of the Commonwealth Government. Work at the dockyards ceased at the instigation of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith),</inline> I understand, and certain reasons for that action were alleged. A Royal Commission was appointed, which, after taking evidence for some weeks, recommended that, in view of the distress existing and the necessity for finding employment, work should be recommenced at once on the <inline font-style="italic">Mombah</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide.</inline> That investigation was considered urgent, and the Commission were asked to report as quickly as possible. They did so, but up to the present moment no attempt has been made to recommence operations at the island. This is a serious matter, and requires consideration by the Treasurer. I am informed that there is some trouble about the transfer of the dockyard from the Navy Department to the Board recently appointed to control shipbuilding. But that is no reason why work on those two ships should not be recommenced. The work is waiting, the men are unemployed, and the Commission have reported that the construction may proceed pending the transfer of the administration to the new authority. </para>

                            <para>- The new Shipbuilding Board was appointed in May. Surely the arrangements for transfer could have been advanced sufficiently far by now to allow of work on those two ships being recommenced. There has been too much delay in connexion with this matter, and it is unfortunate that we should be faced with the present condition of affairs. If effect had been given to the report made by the Public Accounts Committee in . 1915 - several Governments have been in power since, and I am not blaming any particular Government - we would not be in the present unfortunate position. The Committee submitted recommendations in regard to administration, stores, accounts, and other matters. I shall quote but one finding, which, if it had been given effect to, would have obviated the subsequent losses of stores and defalcations - </para>

                    <para class="block">If the Government had followed out the Committee's findings the dock would have been placed on a proper footing. It is useless for Committees and Commissions to inquire into these matters, and make recommendations, if no notice is taken of them. The Public Accounts Committee went to considerable trouble to investigate the affairs at Cockatoo Island, and, after giving due consideration to the evidence, submitted a comprehensive report, which, however, has not had consideration by the Government. In consequence there is chaos at the Island. The same trouble as existed in 1915 is in existence to-day. At that time it was the Navy Department's administration of the Island that was the cause of the trouble. </para>

                            <para>- To 1915, when the report from which I have quoted was presented. To-day there is just the same trouble in connexion with the dockyard. A Board was appointed in May last to administer the affairs of the island. We are now nearly through June, and the Board has not yet taken over control. I do not know why. Honorable members are left in the dark in this matter. It should be a simple matter for the Board to take over the administration of the island from the Naval Board. If the Naval Board is to be . superseded, it should be at once, and the new Board should set about finding work for men who were Government employees. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I have said that the men who were employed on the island were in the employ of the Commonwealth Government, and, in the circumstances, we are strictly responsible for work being found for them. The Treasurer might very well give instructions to the Board to commence work next week on the two vessels to which I have referred, so that the men now unemployed may be given something as soon as possible for the support of themselves and their families. There are over 3,000 men now unemployed who were previously employed on Cockatoo Island. They are now struggling against poverty, and the sooner something is done to enable them to earn a living for themselves and their families, the better it will be for the credit of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>There are one or two other questions to which I intend to refer, and I shall deal first of all with the necessity for increasing the amount of the old-age pension. I wish the Treasurer would give the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> an opportunity to submit his motion dealing with this subject. If we had an expression of the opinion of the House on the question whether the old-age pension should be increased, Ministers could then be guided by that opinion. No matter how difficult the financial position may be, I feel sure that the people throughout Australia would like to see the old and infirm receiving something more by way of pension than they are receiving to-day. In view of the increased cost of living, the present pension is quite inadequate, and should be. increased. I again express the hope that the Treasurer will give honorable members an opportunity to discuss the. question. </para>

                            <para>- There are two matters outstanding to which the Treasurer should give attention pending a report from the Taxation Commission. There is, first of all the amount of the exemption. No one can argue that to-day an exemption of £3 per week is sufficient in the case of a married man with a family to support. The exemption was fixed in 1914 when the purchasing power of the sovereign was almost double what it is today. That being so, there is a clear necessity for an increase in the amount of the exemption. With a declared basic wage of £5 16s. per week, it is not fair that a man with a family of three or more, should be called upon to pay income tax on £156 per year. </para>

                            <para>- This is a matter to which I have given close attention. The Act was introduced by a Labour Government, and it is known to honorable members that I was always opposed to the exemption being fixed as low as £156. Since the income tax was imposed circumstances have so changed that it is now absolutely necessary that the exemption should be raised to something like £300. I am aware of the difficulties which the Treasurer has to face, but he must surmount them in some way, and we must obtain revenue without imposing taxation upon people which they cannot pay. </para>

I know the load which the Government have to carry today as a consequence of the war. They are still obliged to pay money out in connexion with it, although the war has ceased for some years. I still say that the income tax exemption should be taken into consideration as early as possible to prevent the continued imposition of taxation upon persons who cannot afford to pay it. </para>

I brought up a? number of cases of the kind on more than one occasion, and it is unnecessary that I should now quote the letters I have received. I am notsatisfied.with the latest replies from the Department in connexion with those cases. I have just received replies in connexion with four cases, which have been further investigated by the Board, and probably by the same medical authority who previously reported upon them. I have contended that some medical authority in the district in which cases arise should be appointed, instead of the medical authority in Sydney for the. purpose of examining soldiers who complain that they are not being properly treated. If a returned soldier is genuinely incapacitated and unable to follow any employment, he should be getting a pension. If he is able to do his work properly, he is not entitled to a pension. </para>

I have asked the Minister on different occasions' to give returned soldiers the right to be examined by some doctor other than the doctor attached to the central office in Sydney. The cases to which I have referred have been reconsidered and in almost every case the reply I have received is that the man's trouble was pre-existent before enlistment. </para>

                            <para>- I submit that when we accepted men for active service abroad on the reports of medical men in the employ of the Government, the Government must accept responsibility for the condition of those men as a consequence of their service abroad. That is the whole point. If honorable members are satisfied that that contention is sound, these men should be paid the pensions to which they are entitled. I am told that their trouble was pre-existent before the war, but they went abroad, and some received pensions on their return. It was admitted then that they were entitled to pensions. It has been only since last year, when the change was made in the administration of pensions, and the Repatriation Department appointed a doctor in Sydney to examine the men, and7 would not accept the reports of local doctors, that men have had their pensions reduced or cancelled. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member. I say -that no honest Government can permit that sort of thing to continue. I have previously mentioned the case of one returned soldier in the electorate pf the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> whose letter I sent on to the honorable member. I have received a reply from the Department in connexion with the case, to the effect that the trouble the man is suffering from was pre-existent before the war, consequently, he cannot be given a pension. This man went to the war, and on his return was granted a pension. He gave up his pension because he had improved sufficiently in health to go to work. After working for some time his trouble came on again, and he -found that he could not continue working. He then applied to the Repatriation Department to restore his pension, as he found that he was unable to work. It shows how honorable the man was. He did not wish to malinger on the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>Surely we do not propose to allow the officials of the Repatriation Department in New South Wales and the departmental medical .officer to decide these matters when we know that these. men were passed as fit to serve abroad, that many of them went into the. fighting line, and that their condition .is no better to-day than it was when they returned and were granted pensions. Yet, upon the report of a doctor just appointed, their pensions have been stopped. This is a. burning question. I have brought it up many times, and I shall continue to do so, because, after the promises I made to the men who went away and fought for us, I am in honour bound to do everything I possibly can for them. I went on the platform and did all I could in my little' way to secure recruits, and in doing so I made promises which I am going to stand by as long as I am in this House. I hope the Government will not permit the Re-"  patriation  Department to exercise unhampered control in respect to men who are entitled to every consideration at our hands. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> is a painstaking man, and no one could work harder than he does; but we must take care that he watches every move made by those under him. He must rise to the occasion and take hold of the reins himself, and say " So and so must be clone." </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that the Government must accept the responsibility of providing for those incapacitated sol- 1diers whom they accepted for service abroad, and who are now unable to provide for themselves, unless it can be shown that upon their enlistment certain vital facts were suppressed by them. If a man made absolutely false statements upon enlistment, of course a- certain amount of responsibility must rest upon him; but the Government must not endeavour to get away from their responsibilities and the promises they made in this regard. </para>

                            <para>- But we can consider the others later on. We must consider the case of our soldiers first. I do not care about dealing with individual cases. If I find that trouble is caused through the interpretation of an Act or a regulation, I prefer to demand the amendment of that Act or regulation, and in this case I would like to see the Act amended to give to every aggrieved returned soldier deprived of his pension the right of appeal, and in order to provide for the appointment of others than Government officials upon the Boards to whom the control of these matters is now intrusted. A distressing case brought under my notice is that of an elderly man with a wife and five children, who, by his pioneering work upon the gold-fields was inured to all sorts of hardship. He enlisted and got as far as Egypt. He did not get to the Front because, owing to the inoculation treatment against typhoid, he became distressingly bad and almost insane. Members of Ugly Men's Association, of Perth, have built him a nice little home. At first he was given a pension, but later on the Department was anxious that he should undergo further medical treatment. Owing to his bad state of health, he would not do this, and the Department, in order to try to force him to do so, recommended that his pension should cease. At least, the papers in the case, which I have seen, indicate that the pension was stopped, not for that purpose, but on the ground that some disease was latent in the man's system prior to his enlistment. At any rate, the Department was evidently trying to shirk its responsibilities in connexion with this man. At an earlier stage the wife suggested that she should learn midwifery, so that she could earn something with which to provide for the children, but the Department said that her duty was to look after her husband, who was absolutely helpless, and on this account a pension had been given. But that pension has now been withdrawn and there is apparently no right of appeal. The Government should seriously consider the question of amending the Act and regulations so that sympathetic treatment, may be displayed to every man who offered his services during the war and was accepted. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Country party will offer no objection to the granting of the Supply covered by this Bill, because we know that it is absolutely essential to provide for the public services of the Commonwealth, and because we consider that the Tariff should be disposed of before the House enters upon an intricate financial debate, although we are fully alive to the fact that the condition of our finances has a most important bearing on the future welfare of the Commonwealth. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has fully explained his reasons for asking for not more than six weeks' Supply on this occasion and presuming that it is the intention of the House to adjourn until about the end of September, it will be necessary for the right honorable gentleman to ask for further Supply before we adjourn. But before further Supply is granted I hope that this Parliament will insist upon Excess Estimates being brought down and passed. The greatest power that this Parliament possesses is that of the control of the purse, which the Government have ruthlessly defied by expending large sums of money without authority, and the time has now come when honorable members should assert their rights and demand the fullest control of all expenditure, and the fullest particulars of all unauthorized expenditure. It is useless for information to be furnished to us twelve months or more after the time for effective criticism has passed. Therefore, we are justified in demanding, at this stage, that the Government must bring down Supplementary Estimates before they are granted further Supply. I feel very strongly on this matter, and I think we are justified in asking the Government to bring down Supplementary Estimates at a very early date. Since the last Estimates were passed, many new and important appointments have been made, and substantial increases in salaries have been granted without reference to Parliament; I believe the salaries of some officials have been increased from £500 to £1,000; and, if we are to be guided by the information appearing in the public press and the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> large increases have been made in salaries of other officers. I am not suggesting that they were not justified, but Parliament should have been consulted. New Departments have been created without the approval of Parliament, and the attitude of the Government in this direction is one that is not likely to meet with general approval, because Parliament has not been consulted. </para>

Certain amounts appear in our debt and in those of the States, and, therefore, appear twice. If we deduct about £50,000,000from the amount stated by the honorable member, we get the net Australian debt. The land settlement expenditure this year appears in our obligations as our debt, and it is also shown in the State figures as their debt. Those deductions must be made to arrive at our actual net debt. </para>

                            <para>- If it is necessary later to borrow £2,000,000 to cover money raised on Treasury Bills, the position will be very unsatisfactory. It is clear that further borrowing will be necessary to enable the Government to carry out their obligations, and it is obvious that State and Federal Governments are equally desirous of trying to beat each other in their efforts to squander our national inheritance. One has only to look at the statistics to realize that abnormal borrowing is going on, both by State and Federal Governments, and that we are likely to be involved in heavy obligations. Unless we cry a halt in the near future the position will be exceedingly grave. I am sure that if the Treasurer were a free-lance, no one would be more emphatic in denouncing what he has previously termed an "orgy of extravagance." </para>

                            <para>- I quite realized that when the Treasurer was delivering his Budget speech, and I trust that with the enormous sums which are being obtained from the people of Australia by means of taxation, we shall be able to pay off each year a very fair proportion of the loan money obtained for what cannot be regarded as reproductive work. In 1911 the State and Federal taxation per head of population was £4 3s. 10d.; in 1914, it was £4 14s.; and in 1920, £10 13s. 9d. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it would. But if Australia continues to borrow, and if she goes on spending money in the future as she has done in the past ten years nobody will be willing to lend more. For this year the; taxation per head of the people - State and Federal, direct and indirect - will be in the neighbourhood of £13. There has been a considerable, increase in indirect taxation through the Customs. From that source alone the burden per head will be equivalent to about £6. It is absolutely necessary that we should live within our means. If we are not careful a receiver may be put in charge here. </para>

                            <para>- I am facing the facts. Many loans must be converted in the near future. Our war loans are short-dated. War gratuity bonds are repayable in 1924, and the Government will be compelled to borrow a very large sum to redeem them. We need money for the development of this country. Taxation must be increased. Not only are the war gratuity bonds redeemable three years hence, but there is a sum under the heading of War Loan totalling £42,000,000, which will be redeemable in December; 1923. A further enormous item of £77,000,000 has to be redeemed at the end of 1925, and £87,000,000 in 1927. Within the next five or six years there is a grand total of £209,000,000, plus war gratuity bonds;- to- be redeemed;' and, according to " the present* condition of the money market, we shall have: to pay  higher rates  of interest.

                    <para>Mi-. GREGORY.- Between the present, date and 1927 the States will he required to redeem more than £150,000,000. Much of that money was borrowed at rates of interest as low as 3, 3i, and 4 per cent., and these must be redeemed at higher rates. There must necessarily be. increased charges upon revenues, State and Federal. I do not wish to be considered pessimistic, but I do not think our revenue next year will be anything .like as great as for this year.. During the present term we have' secured more than £32,000,000 from Customs sources. Nothing like so large a sum will be gathered next year. </para>

                            <para>- This year has been abnormal. I do not think the Treasurer will look, next year, for greater returns by way of income taxation - that is, unless he decides to increase the taxation percentage. We desire to bring about taxation reform with a view, particularly, to making , the burden more equitable in respect of primary producers. To bring that about, the rate per head' of the population will have to be raised. I am justified in assuming that, with an increased interest bill, and with decreased revenue, further taxation is inevitable. </para>

                    <para>Then there are new obligations to be faced. Mandates have been issued to Australia regarding the Pacific Territories. Possibly the Treasurer can inform honorable members of the huge sum which our new responsibilities will involve. The Government should make clear their intentions concerning Papua. They should announce the proposed form of administration, and furnish an estimate of the cost of controlling the Pacific territories under the mandate. </para>
                    <para>The cost of the Public Service is rapidly increasing. It is urgently necessary to call a halt. The Economies Commission has furnished reports. There have been inquiries into soldiers' home construction, and into the Cockatoo Island </para>
                    <para class="block">Dockyard. The administration in all these cases has been shown to "be so faulty that, iri ordinary times, it would have meant the dismissal of the Government. The Government must take full responsibility for their administrative acts. If they appoint persons to important positions, and it is found that those officers have been guilty of grave maladministration or carelessness, or that there has been undue expenditure, the Government alone must '- take the responsibility, and the House should insist upon them doing so. Our demand is that there shall be a return to constitutional government. In war-time we were quite satisfied to give the full responsibility to the Government, and' they were quite justified in taking it, but now that the war is over we must have a return to the old system of responsible government. We want economy and an efficient administration . of the Federal. Departments. Notwithstanding what the Treasurer has said, to my mind we have had neither economy nor efficient administration. It will be for the right honorable gentleman, when presenting his financial statement- to the House, in September next, to prove clearly and unmistakably that his administration has been sound and that the Government is determined to follow a sound financial and administrative policy which will insure the future prosperity of Australia. I feel satisfied that the Treasurer will make every effort in that direction, but, from our experience we cannot help coming to the conclusion that in many instances the administration has been exceedingly faulty and grossly extravagant. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no desire to traverse the Estimates laid on the table by the Treasurer, although I hold that the system tinder which we demand the redress of grievances before granting Supply is an estimable one. These are all bread-and-butter propositions, and I congratulate the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> on the optimistic view of the situation which he has adopted. This is hot a time for pessimism, especially in view of the fact that the Treasurer is on the eve of floating a new loan. It is undoubtedly true that public -expenditure has been piling up-, and that there have been instances of faulty administration, but we must not forget that in many other cases' we have an exceedingly good administration, and while we rightly criticise some public officers, we should thank God that wo have so many capable men in the Service. </para>

Over twenty years have elapsed since the establishment of the Federal Capital in New South Wales was promised the people of that State, but the Melbourne faction, "although' in a minority in both Houses, seem to be able in some mysterious way to <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> pull the strings as to delay the honouring of the compact. Last year, after a lengthy de bate, and a strenuous fight in both Houses, it was decided that the building of the Capital should be proceeded with. That Was the decision of the Parliament, notwithstanding that we had the big guns and the machine guns of, the Melbourne newspapers turned on us, but after a fair and square fight, what happened ? </para>

                            <para>- As tha honorable member says, the Melbourne newspapers would not "take their gruel," and in some strange way the Government seem to be influenced not to proceed with the building of the Capital. The minority in this Parliament is able, apparently, to override the will of the majority. In both Houses there is a majority in favour of our going on with the building of Canberra. The question is not a party one, and representatives of all the States are backing the project. That being so, I' want to know why the definite promise made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is not being carried out. We have had twenty years of .delay. Prior to the passing of this year's Estimates, we had spent about £1,000,000 on the Federal Territory. That money had been expended on the resumption of land and the construction of works. The Treasurer himself admitted the other day thai) the land resumptions had proved quite satisfactory, since they were returning over 5 per cent, on the money so expended. </para>

                            <para>- No. The land in the Federal Territory has been leased in large grazing areas, so that we cannot expect to obtain from it such a' return as would be secured if it were leased in small settlement areas and town blocks. Why is the Ministry failing to get a move on? It was decided last year that we should proceed carefully and cautiously with the building of the Capital. Shortly after that decision was arrived at, the Prime Minister and tha Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> visited the Capital, and the Prime Minister, pointing to certain spots,, said, "Build the hostel here," and " Build the halls here. Get a move on <inline font-style="italic">I"</inline> What has been done since then? We have been told by the Minister to-day  that the plans are under consideration. Is the Cabinet the proper body to decide whether the plans are correct in detail? We have a Public Works Committee - au antagonistic one in some respects so far as this question is concerned - to which all works involving an expenditure of over £20,000 must be referred, and these plans should have been submitted to it long ago. </para>

                            <para>- Representatives of Victoria, who are under the whip of the Victorian newspapers,' take a provincial view of this question. I am astonished that the honorable member allows himself to be jumped on by the Melbourne press. He professes to be independent, but has a curious way of showing his independence'. I wish to know why the promises of the Minister have not been kept, and why the instructions of the Prime Minister have not been carried out. If I do hot get a satisfactory reply, I propose to cable to the Prime Minister next week, asking for his opinion on the matter. The big battalions are for Canberra. Why, then, should the Minister take so much notice of the noisy minority in which men like the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> are so prominent? Why is progress at Canberra so slow ? The laying of the f foundations of a few cottages, and the cutting of a few trenches, is not compliance with the instruction of Parliament, which voted £150,000 for expenditure- on Canberra during this financial year, and intended that the money should be spent. If all or the greater part of that sum has not been spent by the 30th of the present month, it will be evidence of incapacity or insincerity on the part of the Government. The Minister cannot side-track us in this matter, because the Canberra Vigilance Committee is composed of a majority of the members of this House, and a majority  of the members of the Senate, all .parties being represented on it. It cannot be said that artisans are not to be got for building operations at Canberra; because there are many unemployed in the country. Then, too, there are soldiers looking for land, and there are thousands of acres of good country in the Federal Territory unused. We must be told more than that "the Cabinet is considering what shall 4)e done." Those of us who have had experience of Ministerial office know that such an answer is merely an excuse for delay. </para>

We know that the Treasurer, as an advocate of the Capital proposal, and has don his best for it, but the present inaction must cease. Business men and others are asking me when will land be available within  the Territory, so that they may erect shops and take up farms there. I do not -blame the Minister within whose Department the administration of the Federal Capital matters lies, but he must be held officially responsible, because nothing is being done. No dou'bt his officers are kept always busy, and this being so, some matters may be allowed to slip, but Canberra affairs cannot be put aside any longer. All over Australia persons are asking why we are allowing public works which have cost £1,000,000 to 'Stand idle when the expenditure of another £1,000,000 would produce a splendid return on the whole outlay.' </para>

Then probably the Treasurer will tell us one of .these days how much the Government intend to spend there during the next financial year. There are hundreds of men possessed of plenty of money who are "anxious to build houses at the Federal Capital.

I fail to understand why men who returned to this country incapacitated, and were paid pensions, in some cases, of a' couple of guineas per week, have now had their pensions reduced, although there has been <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> material change in their physical condition. Why is this so? The reduction of the pensions has been made, not merely in the case of ex-soldiers, but in the case of the widows and mothers of deceased soldiers. </para>

                            <para>- Let me give one case in support of my statement. I called attention to this matter some weeks ago, though I did not then mention any names. Upon that occasion I stated that soldiers' widows who were receiving £2 Pe]. week by way of pension had been cut down to £1 per week. I have since been informed that in one case the pension has been restored from £1 ls. per week to £2 2s. per week. That being so, I am tempted to mention other cases of a similar character. But honorable members ought not to be required to do that. </para>

                            <para>- I maintain that the Post Office should not be made a revenue producing Department. The imposition of high postal rates is a stupid policy to adopt. In the near future, it will be shown that these high rates spell less revenue. I moved in this House upon one occasion for the adoption of penny postage, and I also had the honour of proposing a similar motion at the Postal Convention across the seas, and I know that in every country in the world in which rates have been reduced to1d. the revenue has overtaken the deficiency thus created within the short period of three years. Consequently I hold that the imposition of increased charges will be productive of a falling revenue. The Postmaster-General, it is true, represents a country constituency, but he has better opportunities for clearing up postal troubles in his own electorate than have private members. I know that when I was Postmaster-General I cleared up many such troubles within my own constituency. I ask the Treasurer whether he cannot squeeze something out of the revenue for country mail services? Cannot he give an extra £100,000, or £200,000, or £500,000 for services to those who reside in our backblocks, and who enjoy none of the comforts of civilization? Why not give them an opportunity to have a daily mail service, so that they may be kept in touch with civilization? </para>

                            <para>- I am merely stating the cost of the Commission as alleged by the newspapers. Unfortunately, I do read them. I do not think that they are liars all the time, but I affirm that the Government would get from the heads of the Taxation and Treasury Departments better advice upon the subject of taxation than they are ever likely to receive from any Commission. It is absurd that business men should be required to make taxation returns in order that they may be robbed by two Departments. Let us have only one Taxation Department. If the Treasurers of the States and the Commonwealth met at a round table conference with their officials and discussed this matter, they ought to be able to settle it in an hour. The existing duplication of functions seems to be criminal. An almost similar condition of affairs obtains in respect to the Electoral Departments. I am aware that in two States of the Commonwealth, namely, South Australia and Tasmania, one electoral roll is used for both State and Federal elections. Why cannot that practice be followed in New South Wales? </para>

                            <para>- I should like to deal with other matters; but I realize that the day's sitting is short, and that other honorable members desire to speak. I hope, however, that the Government will take notice of what has been said in regard to invalid and old-age pen sions,and will give an opportunity for the discussion of the proposal I have on the notice-paper. These invalids and old people, as the facts disclose, are not getting enough to keep body and soul together, and, surely, this country is rich enough to "do the decent thing" by them. I shall defer until another opportunity any further remarks in regard to Canberra, but I do urge that some steps should be taken, at the earliest possible moment, towards the construction of the railway from Yass to Jervis Bay, which would not only be keeping the compact made with New South Wales, but also afford employment, and prove profitable to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- There is no new principle involved in the Bill now before us, nor does it propose further public expenditure, beyond the provision of funds to pay our public servants. Under the circumstances I shall not attempt to deal with the financial position, though this will have to be thoroughly examined, with an effort to ascertain whether We can meet the responsibilities with which we shall be faced for some years to come. There is, however, one matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> or, in his absence, the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith),</inline> and that is the dismissal of men from Cockatoo Island and Garden Island. It might be thought that because Cockatoo Island is not in my electorate it is injudicious on my part to make any particular reference to the position there at the present moment. Garden Island is, however, in the electorate of East Sydney, and I think I am only voicing the opinion of the majority of people in Sydney and the State generally, when I say that the recent discharge of employees was most unwarranted. It would seem that the Government are endeavouring to cut down expenditure, and thus put themselves in a position to show a surplus at the end of the financial year; but I do not think that such a policy would be applauded even by those bodies outside who are protesting against " extravagance." In my opinion, the Government have shown marvellous' incapacity in dealing with this problem of Cockatoo Island; indeed, I do not remember an episode in public life that more warranted' the use of strong language. In the present state of affairs, not only here, but all over the world, it should be the earnest effort of every one to. prevent unemployment; and from that point of view I regard the Government as censurable for their act in discharging employees at Cockatoo Island. It would, appear that owing to some misunderstanding the members of the Naval Board intend to hang on as long as possible to their jobs. </para>

I was told on Saturday that the Government do not intend to. re-employ these men- until' after the- 3.0th June, the end of the financial year j and this idea, is supported by the actions of- the Government.

                    <para>There is another matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer, namely, the mail service between Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and the New Hebrides, on which a large number of people on the islands are entirely dependent. The present contract, under which £12,000 per annum is paid to Burns, Philp and Company, for a mail every two months, expires- on the 31st July next. The boat now used is not large enough for work of this kind, "and, moreover, prior to the war, there was a sailing every fortnight. The people on these islands depend for their clothing and other supplies on the mainland, and, therefore, there is the advantage of reciprocal trade. I do not wish to refer to the Condominium question, but it will sooner or later have to be settled, because the present dual control may prove inimical to the interests of Australia. The mail boat has to leave -cargo on the wharf at Sydney, and the passengers who travel by her have to sleep on the tables of the saloon and on the floor. I have received- communications from shippers in Sydney, and from people on the islands, in regard to the accommodation provided, but I am not permitted to use names, because, in the. case of the shippers, they might be more persecuted than they are at present. My object in mentioning the matter is to urge on the Government, the necessity of seeing that these disadvantages are remedied when the next contract is signed. These islands would make splendid health resorts for the people of Australia, for there are no better sanatoria in the world. Napoleon once said, that the. British are a nation of '' shopkeepers,"- and it is: in:that spirit' that. I call attention to the urgency for a proper mail service in order that there may be trade between the British " shopkeepers " of the. islands- and the " shopkeepers" of the "mainland. The islanders are unfortunate in having - nobody to ventilate their grievances except myself. I am the only member of this Parliament representing the Pacific Islands, but the: people there know that they have a live representative; and they will use me as much as they. can. to try to get from the Government an under* taking that the company, who receive £12,000 per annum for- a steamer service to the islands, shall give, a better service than is being given at present: I suggest to the Government that there should , be a separate service between the mainland and Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands, and another service for the New Hebrides.. I may -remind the Scottish members of this Committee that there is a large number of Scotchmen in- the New Hebrides. The Presbyterian missionaries there have interviewed me on this' subject; they do not desire to make a political question of it, but they are anxious that the Government shall know, the way in which the contract is being carried out. Burns, Philp, and Company have had the contract for a long time. I have suggested to other companies that they should run services ' to the islands, but they will not entertain the suggestion unless I get from Burns, Philp; and Company an assurance that they will not resent these other" companies attempting to make a contract with the Government. They all appear to be in a Combine. Burns, Philp, and Company have wonderful influence with certain members of the Government; I do not suggest that Ministers derive any pecuniary benefits from 'the company, but Burns, Philp, and Company are given advantages which, I am sure, other companies cannot get. They are well known to certain members of the Ministry. That is why I am not satisfied with merely Writing to the Department. This contract is controlled by the Prime Minister's Department, and not by the Postmaster- </para>

                        <para class="block">General. Honorable members would be surprised if I were to give them instances of the treatment meted out to the people: on the islands- I give them my assurance that I am speaking the truth, for the actions of the company are so bad as to require no exaggeration. Both the freights and passenger fares are too high, and yet people cannot get accommodation on the boats. Goods intended for the islands are left on the Sydney wharf, and when the boat reaches Norfolk and Lord  Howe Islands it is already loaded with goods for some distant port in the New Hebrides, and will not take any further cargo. Prior to the war a boat called at the islands every fortnight; to-day the population of the islands is greater than it was then. Lord Howe Island is 445 miles from the mainland, Norfolk Island 950 miles, and New Hebrides still further distant. Yet a large number of men from all those islands served at the war, and many of them died on the other side of the world, The Commonwealth will have to take greater interest in the islands than it has done in the past, because if we continue the present policy of paying no regard to them, all sorts of races will settle there, and they will be occupied by a piebald population of Chinese,' Japanese, and other nationalities that do not mingle with white people. Australia ought to have a mandate over the New  Hebrides, and the Presbyterian Church has asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to approach the French Government with a view to .ending the Condominium and placing the islands under the control of a race that will protect the natives, as the British have done in all their colonization schemes. Of course, mistakes have been made by our people, and men have done wicked acts, but on the whole we have proved ourselves worthy colonizers and fit to have charge of coloured peoples. An improved mail service would cost the Commonwealth nothing. If I were on the Treasury bench I would have one of the Commonwealth steamers put into that trade, and it would not only develop a profitable traffic, but would be of great benefit to Australia. Even if the service yielded no profit, the very fact of the islands trade being brought to the mainland would be of great indirect advantage, perhaps of greater advantage than the mere addition of a little profit to the revenue. The present mail contract will expire on 31st July, and I hope before a new one is entered into, the matter will receive in the Department that attention that it deserves. I could have written to the Department, on the subject, but I feel that no interest would be taken in the letter. For that reason I prefer to place my views on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> copies of which I shall send to the islands in the hope that they will stimulate some of my Scotch friends there to rouse the Government to a sense of their duty.. If they improve this service as I have suggested, the people will indorse their action. </para>
                        <para>I desire to ' support the remarks made by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> in regard to soldiers' grievances. In Sydney I have been christened " The Soldiers' Champion " ; in fact, if men can get no redress at the Department, the officers send them to my home. I shall mention one case to illustrate the grievances that are brought under my notice. A man who served for either four or four and a half years at the Front lost half of one shoulder, and has one useless arm.. He called at my house, and, as I always do with soldiers, I sat him in the best chair in the best room. At his request, I re- moved  his coat, because he was unable to do so, and when I saw the extent of his injuries I could not understand why he was allowed only a half pension.  His  papers contained a statement that his injuries represented the after-effects of the war. What is the good of half a man? He has a wife and four children, and one-half of him is useless. </para>

                            <para>- If I were an employer of labour, and that man applied to me for a job, I could not engage him; how could I send half a man -to do a plumbing job at a customer's house? Nor would I be allowed to enter on my pay-sheet that the small amount that' man could .earn was the wage of half a man. The pension at present allowed him is ridiculous. The departmental officers give me their confidence to a great extent, and I know that financial stringency is the principal reason for the treatment of soldiers in this way. If the medical officers and others had been told that the Government had no money, and that, therefore, they were to do their best to deceive the soldiers out of their pensions, they could not do their job more zealously than they are doing it to-day. I and several honorable members on this side went on to the public platforms during the war, and asked for recruits to come forward in the country's hour of need. We appealed to the sympathy and patriotism of men, and under- took that we would take care of them and their dependants, so that they would never want. And if 'the country were properly governed, nobody would want. Now we are doing as the barons and landlords of old did after the wars. Many a penny or threepence I have given to the Crimean veterans, and I vowed then that if ever I had the opportunity I would take care that no man who had served his country as a soldier should be obliged to beg in the streets. To-day we are not treating our soldiers very much better than the Crimean veterans were treated. That is the opinion of people in all classes of society. The whole community is agreed that these men performed their duty faithfully, and have a right to be well cared for now. Those who remained in Australia, and whose wealth was protected by the efforts of the men who went to the war, are under an obligation to ameliorate as far as they can the condition of soldiers who have returned in any way incapacitated. We shall be deserving of the greatest censure if we do' not look after the interests of the men who have suffered for their country. It is to be hoped that it will not be necessary for me to make another appeal like this. If the Government will not move in the matter, I hope that some other Government will be found to take their place, who will not be unwilling to give effect to the desire of the people of this country that our returned soldiers should be treated well. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to-day to refer at length to the financial position. I am satisfied with the statement made on the subject by the  Deputy  Leader of the party to which I belong. There are one or two matters to which I specially desire to direct attention. One was mentioned by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> this morning. He referred to the case of a returned soldier residing in a township on the border between his electorate and my own. This man has been treated very harshly. I refer to" his case because it is typical of a number of cases which have been dealt with by the Department concerned in a most unsympathetic way. The man to- whom I refer has a wife and family, and, according to the Returned Soldiers and Sailors League of his district, he is a very fine type of man,'who likes to be independent. When he returned to Australia from the war he was granted a pension. Thinking that he was in a fit condition to take up work he voluntarily surrendered his pension, and went to work at his occupation as a miner.  His  branch of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors League has assured me that he made desperate attempts to continue to work, but found that it was impossible to do so. He then applied to have his pension restored to him, and the Department has consistently refused his application, on the ground that the trouble from which he is suffering was present, if not active,- before he went to the war. Even if it is a fact that the seeds of his present trouble were in the man's system before he went to the war, his unhealthy condition must have been aggravated by war experience. </para>

                            <para>- There can be no question that he was given the pension because he had done his job, and we had promised that he would be treated in a proper way when we passed the legislation intended to benefit returned soldiers. Since that legislation was passed a new spirit seems to have animated the administration of the Pensions Department, and returned men are not now receiving the sympathetic treatment which was extended to them, soon after the close of the war. The legislation passed by this House for the benefit of returned men was entirely satisfactory. Its early administration was in the main satisfactory, though some unsuitable men were appointed to give effect to it. During the last . six months or more the administration has been tightened up in a very harsh way. The case of the man residing » at Greta, to whom I have referred, is a good example of how unfair the Department can be to a man, who not only tried to do his duty on the field of battle, but after his return surrendered a pension granted to him, and went back to work for his wife and family. Now that he finds himself unable to continue at work his application for the  restoration  of his pension is refused. Wo can look for nothing but ill-feeling amongst returned soldiers if this kind of administration is to be allowed to continue. These very bad cases are causing many returned soldiers throughout Australia to wonder if they were wise in doing what they have done for this country. Men who went to the Front in good faith have come back to Australia with their ideals enlarged and their desire to do their duty as citizens strengthened. They know that the representative Parliament of the country promised that they would be given reasonable consideration on their return. Many of  them  are not only suffering themselves, but their wives and children are also  suf-faring,  and when they are treated in the WaN 1 have described it is no wonder that a feeling of unrest is growing up amongst them. I appeal to the Government to remove some of the more serious grounds for their complaints. The security of this country depends to a very large extent on the satisfaction of the men who fought for it. No one will deny that we owe them a debt which we can hardly hope to repay. For the maintenance of the principles of democratic government as they are known in this country and throughout our Empire, we should do our duty and fulfil the promises made to our returned men. </para>

                    <para>There is another matter which I should like to mention. I have already dealt with it in various ways in this House. I refer to the way in which taxation is being imposed on the primary producers of this country. I have a case to submit to honorable members, which indicates the grossly unfair treatment which is being meted out to men  who  are doing their best to open up new country in Australia. I have received the following letter from a man who took up a selection in the back country : - <inline font-style="italic">lie</inline> Federal assessments on my income for 1918-10. - Included in my income for the year ended 30th June, 1919, was £8,608, received by me on the sale of my settlement lease, and I was assessed on £5,832, the net balance after the deduction of £2,776, cost of improvements effected by me. The lease was procured by me at ballot in January, 1914. The land is, perhaps, known to you. At the time when I acquired it the land was practically waste, and was infected with noxious weeds, pests, and growths, including pear, and had been begging for years. Alt different periods during my occupancy I was obliged to borrow money to clear the place, ,pay labour, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c.</inline> I borrowed £500 from one person and £2,000 from another, and after ten years' strenuous labour and much self-denial I had so far cleaned up and developed the block, 5,937 acres, to enable me to effect a sale as abovementioned. The amount of interest paid by me on money borrowed to improve the property was £125 to one person and £360 to another, or a total of £485, and I paid £215 to the commission agent for effecting the sale. Do you think it advisable to make a test case of this? No doubt other men on the land have been and will be mulct in heavy taxes on their labours, and unless matters are altered will be deprived of the fruits of their industry. </para>
                    <para class="block">This man went on to his block prepared to work his .way and make his land valuable. It was overrun with prickly pear, and worse than useless, because it was a menace to the surrounding country. He put in eight years improving the property, and, having improved it, he made a profit of about £5,000 by its sale; and then the .Taxation Department assessed him at £5,832, the difference between the price he -got for the land and the amount he had actually paid for improvements, and made out his income tax to be £1,597 14s. That was not that man's income. If the amount on which his tax was assessed had been spread over the eight years during which he had occupied the land, it would represent a taxable income of £573 per annum, without any amount being deducted for expenses. This man -was taxed on the whole amount in a lump sum, and, consequently, had to pay a very much higher rate of tax than he would have been called upon to pay if assessed on his income each year. The Taxation Department had no right whatever to charge this man income tax on what he got from the sale of his land. I have appealed to the Department on behalf of this man and can get no consideration for him. We are told that when in special cases we cannot secure reasonable treatment for people who appeal to us we should bring their cases before this House. I have mentioned the case of a returned soldier, and the way in which a man who has put in years of labour in improving the value of land has been treated. I put these cases before the Ministers concerned in the ordinary way without, securing redress, and I bring them up here now in the hope that when the attention of the whole of the Ministers and of the House is directed to them something will be done to redress these grievances. </para>
                    <para>There is another matter to which I should like to refer, and which was. very  forcibly dealt with by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> before the adjournment for lunch. . I urge that it is quite time that this Parliament honoured its obligations in regard to the building of the Federal Capital. As the honorable member for Eden-Monaro has said, the money spent there is not' lying idle, because the Federal Capital Territory is improved thereby as an asset. There is some return from the Territory, because much of it is t leased to graziers, but in no sense can it be said that it is returning anything like what it should.. Canberra is at present in the condition of a property less than half improved. No man in possession of a property would leave it unimproved, or if he had the money to improve it would not improve it up to a paying stage. Canberra as it stands is a bad business proposition, and it is a very grave' reflection on us that we should alios*' that magnificent Capital site - for it is a magnificent site - to remain in its present state. </para>

Would any man buy a property without inspecting it or knowing something about it? No one would be expected to spend money on a proposition he knew nothing about; and those who know nothing about a project ought to take the advice of those who do. There are many honorable members who know Canberra, and they see value in it as a business proposition. It is a reflection, not only upon our business capacity, but also, upon our honour, that the agreement concerning the Capital should be unfulfilled, and that the magnificent area we have there should be lying in an unfinished state of development. . </para>

                        <para>. -  I can assure the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> of my anxiety to help him in regard to Canberra. He has laid down a proposition - "Canberra or. the country.'' I will join with him in utilizing every effort that lies in my power to secure a dissolution, for the purpose of submitting to the. country the question of any further expenditure on Canberra at the present time. I hold that it is criminal at the present juncture to squander money there. The honorable member says that it is very desirable to spend money there at this juncture. I call it wasting or squandering it. If the honorable member is in earnest in his slogan, "Canberra or the country," I am with him all the time in contending that, at this crucial state of our affairs in regard to our finances, the people should have an opportunity of saying whether or not money should be wasted at Canberra. The honorable member complains, perhaps .with justice, of the conditions applying to the payment of old-age pensions, and urges the necessity for further expenditure on postal services. If he is prepared to join with me in stopping all further expenditure at Canberra and in getting the money which he thinks ought to be' spent there applied to satisfy the wants of the old-age pensioners and of the Postal Department, again I am with him. </para>

                            <para>- The merits of Canberra are not in dispute at the present juncture. They may be more than equal to those of Dalgety, they may be of a very high order indeed, but the question at issue now is whether the country has the right to squander money at Canberra at a time when the people are crushed with taxation. When we are suffering direct taxation to the extent of over £20,000,000 and indirect taxation to the extent of over £30,000,000, when enter* prise is stifled, and when the burdens of taxation are overwhelming, Australia cannot afford to waste any money in this direction. If we could afford ;the expenditure, if taxation were normal, and if we were relieved to some extent of the vast and unproductive burden of debt of over £400,000,000, I would join with the honorable member in carrying out the undertaking given in regard to the establishment of the' Federal Capital at Canberra. The honorable member, and also  the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> has drawn a herring across the track -by talking about our honour being involved, claiming that we are in honour bound to carry out a so-called solemn obligation. No- one disputes the right to have Canberra built at a time when we can afford to do so. No- one repudiates the selection of Canberra as the Capital site, but we dare not forget that upwards of £2,000,000 has been practically sunk there, for which 'there is little to show, and that while the country is paying 6 per cent, interest on its loan moneys, the return for the money spent at Canberra is only lj per cent. The position really is, that the more money we expend there the greater will be the loss sustained, and this expenditure is sought at a time when the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, with his tongue in his cheek, is demanding economy. </para>

                            <para>-- I have heard of the fanatical proposition which has been circulated through the press and otherwise, that it is proposed to erect a hostel and conference hall at Canberra. I understand that a conference hall is to be erected to provide a meeting place for the proposed Convention; but I submit, with very much humility, that in the various capitals there are halls and proper hotel accommodation which are in every way suitable for the purpose. I know that after the proceedings of the Convention have terminated that the hall can be converted into a picture theatre, as mentioned by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)..</inline> The alluring prospect before us, therefore, is that Parliament is being called upon to authorize the reckless expenditure of money on a picture theatre at Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- I have no objection to moving pictures in their proper place; but Canberra is not the proper place at this juncture. The Federal Capital site was designed by the best brains in the world, and I believe in the permanent work proceeding steadily in  keeping with the money available. That is a proper and legitimate way to work; but that is not the policy of the Government, because they intend to erect a number of shelter sheds, and certain temporary accommodation in order that we may ostensibly be temporarily housed at Canberra. Whatever expenditure is incurred on temporary accommodation is absolute' and deliberate waste, and I, therefore, repeat my challenge to the honorable member" for Eden-Monaro, because we should have the right to say whether money is to be wasted or not. </para>

                        <para>-. -  I desire to make one or two observations upon the matter referred to by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> who said it was criminal to squander money on Canberra. Every one will agree that it is criminal to recklessly expend public money when there is no prospect of a reasonable return. But it is a very different' proposition for the House to consider a carefully studied scheme for carrying out what, after all, is undoubtedly a fundamental obligation under the Constitution. There is no getting away from that. I remind the honorable member that before the- last election the Government distinctly announced that it -was their intention, as the war was over, to carry out their obligations. The then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> did,, as the honorable member says, institute an inquiry by officers of the Treasury, who obtained information, not from the Works Department only, but from all Departments, as to the expenditure that would be necessary to transfer the Federal Capital. - On the information supplied, the late -Treasurer estimated that an expenditure of  £3)250,000  would be necessary, but he also indicated that he expected not more than:  £500,000  to  be provided by private enterprise. He also said - </para>

                    <para class="block">After submitting this estimate the Minister said a Committee would be asked to inquire into the cost of the Government fulfilling their promise, and. a Board of experts has been appointed. That inquiry is in progress, and the Government have already been advised as to certain necessary works. We have already acted upon certain recommendations of the Advisory Board. Some of the expense - that has been incurred has been on the advice of that body of experts, and every penny of the expenditure can be justified. The honorable member for Kooyong represents the anti-Canberra section; but, notwithstanding that, he says that he desires to stand by the Constitution. That being so, the suggested transfer to Sydney of the Capital is mere camouflage. The honorable member intimated that he does not dispute the merits of Canberra, so the objection to the fitness of the site goes,  It has been said from time to time that the water supply at Canberra is inadequate; but advice has just come to hand from one of the most expert engineers in the Commonwealth-, that after thirteen years of careful examination concerning the supply from the </para>
                    <para class="block">Cotter River, it is found that it is capable of supplying 70,000,000 gallons per day from a regulated flow, or enough to meet the requirements, of a population of 700,000 people, consuming100 gallons each per day. It is declared by the same engineer that the supply from the Cotter River is one of the purest in the whole Commonwealth. When the honorable member says that there is no dispute as to the merits he is right; but as he has never been there, he only knows that by intuition. We must remember that up to 30th June, 1920, £1,738,000 had been expended, and of that amount £740,000 had been spent on the resumption of land. The estimates of receipts for the current year are about £35,000, which includes rates collected for municipal purposes. I think that will be regarded as a very satisfactory return, particularly when we take into consideration the fact that the value of the lands is being continually added to by improvements. The honorable member for Kooyong forgets that we have the Crown lands of the Federal Territory free of cost. What is going to be the rent roll of the city area when 15,000 people are settled there? I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that the rents that will be paid will go more than a long way towards defraying the interest on public buildings required for Government offices. I ask the honorable member to estimate the rent-roll in a city accommodating 15,000 people. Today we are paying £25,000 a year for the offices we are occupying in Melbourne, and which will not be required when the Seat of Government is transferred. What capital is required to produce that amount of interest? It will provide more than the cost of the public offices required in Canberra in the beginning. The honorable member says that the money spent has been wasted; but I ask him to visit the Federal Territory and see how the money is being spent. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Kooyong wants to know how the money generally has been spent. The sum of £255,000 has been expended on water supply. The reservoir is already completed, and the most modern pumping" plant in the Commonwealth has been provided. The water is now laid right to the city boundaries, and practically only awaits reticulation throughout the area. The powerhouse is one of the most modern and best-equipped in Australia. The output of the brickworks is unsurpassed for quality in any part of the Commonwealth. Roads have been made; and I assure honorable members that there has been no serious waste upon them, or on any other of the works undertaken in the Federal Capital. For confirmation, I look confidently to honorable members who have visited the Territory and made investigations in an impartial spirit. The honorable member for Kooyong is right in saying that while capital is lying idle it is a loss. If he had £1,000,000 lying idle, would he not try, by the expenditure of; more money, to make it reproductive? If the honorable member were to analyze the sources of expenditure indicated by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> to which reference has been made, he would gain a clearer and fairer estimate of the whole situation. Does he think, for example, that the public servants who take up their residence at Canberra will be housed rent free? Does he not realize that they will be required to pay rent for the houses they occupy? The honorable member overlooks that, in regard to the expenditure estimated by the honorable member for Balaclava to be made at Canberra, almost every penny in the Territory will be productive of revenue one way or another. Of course, the public buildings, including Parliament House, will be a charge upon revenue in that they will be availed of for the transaction of public business: But it should be taken for granted that the inhabitants of the Federal Capital will pay rental for their residences. Many, no doubt, will live in their own homes, just as they do to-day in Melbourne, Sydney, or elsewhere. Another point which should not be overlooked is that a large portion of the buildings to be provided will probably be carried out by private enterprise. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Kooyong has asserted that the Capital transfer will probably cost £10,000,000. I invite him to give me the names of the persons who furnished him with the estimate, and to supply me with the details on which the total is based. I shall be prepared to submit them forthwith to the Advisory Board, with a request for immediate investigation into the authenticity of the figures. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has had it proclaimed all over Australia, with the large-lettered assistance of the press, that the present Federal Capital scheme is going to. cost £10,000,000 . If he wishes the public to accept his estimate, he must be prepared to furnish the Government and the people with particulars. If the city is to cost £10,000,000 we can form an idea of the value to Melbourne by its retention here. There are 10,000,000 reasons why it should stay here. I suggest at the present stage that the matter of total cost be put oh one side. The Advisory Board is now engaged in the task of reporting upon the existing data and the works as they are to-day, and of indicating to the Government what works already begun are necessary to be completed; and, further, of laying down a scheme for progressive development, with a view to the occupation of the site at the earliest practicable date. The presentation of this important report will be facilitated in every way, and the document will be laid on the table of the House. I am sure that it will be a fair and accurate estimate of what the Capital scheme is likely to cost. The actions of the Government have been right and proper. Before launching upon a scheme for any extensive works at Canberra, they authorized the drafting of a progressive plan of development to permit the gradual transfer of governmental activities to the Federal </para>

Three groups of. these have been started. Twenty cottages are being erected upon the civic centre) known as the Ainslie centre; and a progressive, report, dated 22nd June, indicates that twelve of the twenty cottages are practically up to the roof-plates. Three have the roof timbers upon them, as well as other advanced work. Excavations and foundations have been made in respect of the whole of the remainder in that group. In the power-house group, of ten . cottages, three are now approaching completion. Foundations have been laid for three others. At the brickworks'* group, comprising another seven cottages, foundations and excavations have been completed in the case of six, and brickwork is proceeding. In every instance, the undertaking is advancing steadily. The brickworks have been started again, and there is being consumed a weekly total of 35,000 to 40,000 bricks in the cottages, to which £10,000 has been allotted. The joinery works and pipe-making plant are in operation also. The honorable member for. Kooyong said he would raise no objection if the money at Canberra were being spent on roads and permanent improvements. I wish to say that £12,760 is being spent upon roads. The railway line has been completed from the power-house to the civic centre. In addition; £2,700 is being spent on tree planting within the city area. A further amount of £10,000 is to be laid out upon extensions of water supply, drainage, electric supply, and so on. There are at least 220 men at this moment engaged upon works at Canberra, and they will continue to be busy there for the next three or four months at least. </para>

Those luxuries may be found in fashionable city suburbs; but, in a working centre, such as Canberra will be, there will be no such fantastic schemes as he has in mind. The idea under Government consideration is not for the authorization of some' barn-like building for a picture palace; but the intention was to have a structure so reared that it would constitute portion of the tern'porary Parliament House.- It must be remembered that, to erect the permanent Parliamentary Building in the Federal City will take time, since it will be a structure in every way worthy of the site. The present idea is to get to Canberra at the earliest possible, date, and, therefore, the Government are perfectly justified in contemplating some df the buildings to be erected of a temporary character. Honorable members will see that the Government have endeavoured to fulfil the constitutional obligation with due regard to economies. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with interest to the statement made by the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> as to the . work which is being done at. the Federal .Capital. 'Over twenty years have elapsed since the agreement was made that the Federal Capita] should be established in New South Wales, and Parliament, as a -body of honorable men, was expected to carry out that agreement without delay. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> has said that we should wait for the return of normal taxation before we attempt to build the Capital. He might as well have said that we should wipe out the compact altogether. I am sure he will agree with me that  it is time we ceased to be parasites on the State of Victoria by occupying this splendid building without paying the State Government any rent for if. We have not even attempted to improve the Parliamentary Reserve at the northern end of this building. I have sought to have it beautified and set apart as a children's playground, but it still remains a waste space, the like of which is not to be found in any other city. I thank the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chapman)</inline> for the strenuous fight- he has put up in support of the building of the Federal Capital, and my experience of him convinces . me that he will stand by his guns! The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> once said there was a way by which the Federal Capital could be built without costing the country a penny. I agree with that view. We have only to follow the example set to  us by the people of the little island of Guernsey in building their market in the early part of last century. At that time it was difficult to borrow money in London, and -it was decided to' issue 5,000 £1 market scrip notes for the payment, of the brickmakers, bricklayers, stonemasons, carpenters, and others employed in building the market. The market was no sooner built than every stall in it was let, and by means of the revenue so derived, together with whatever moneys could be set: apart .by the municipal, council, the notes were quickly paid off. Every year as many notes as could be redeemed in this way were burnt, and in ten years the people had for all time a revenue-producing asset for which they had actually paid nothing. The same thing could be done in connexion with 'the- building of Canberra. It is idle to talk of the Federal Capital costing £10,000,000. If that sum had been expended by the State Government in building premises in Melbourne while the city was yet in its infancy, what would be the present rental value- of such buildings? Considerably over £250,000 has been wasted in building unnecessary division walls in Collins-street alone. If this city had been built under a Board of Control, such as we hope to have supervising the building of the Federal Capital, those division walls would have been done away with, with the result that thousands of pounds would have been saved in respect of labour, and much valuable land would not have been wasted. </para>

                    <para>Our taxation, we are told, is equal to £12 per head of the population, whereas before the war it was only £4 per head of the population. But has the wealth of the country contributed to the cost of the war in anything like the proportion of the population of Australia who offered their lives to the cause. Over 70 per cent, of the men of military age volunteered for active service, oyer 40 per cent, were accepted, and over" 33 p6r cent, actually went to the Front. Can we say that 33 per cent, of the wealth of the country has been contributed to the payment of our war debt? </para>
                    <para>Coming to the question of economies that might well be effected, I should like_ to know why we require a High Commissioner and six Agents-General. Let us sell Australia House, London. No one can say that it has been, of any service to us, or that we have reaped any benefit from the appointment of a High Com missioner. I am not casting any reflection on my late leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Andrew</inline> Fisher, whose actions as High Commissioner were absolutely hampered by the Government. 'I have asked actors, doctors, lawyers, commercial men, and others who have been to London what good the High Commissioner's office is doing, but have never heard that it is serving any useful purpose. Instead of a High Commissioner and six State Agents-General, we should have commercial agents in London, pay them a commission by way of salary, and " sack " them in the event of their sales not being satisfactory. </para>

I lived in London for four and a half years, and when I desired to secure an appointment as medical officer on an emigrant ship bound for Western Australia it was to the Agent-General for Queensland that I had to apply. Then, again, we have seven State Governors and a Governor-General. If the people had a right to vote on the question, all such offices would be abolished. We also have seven second Chambers of Parliament. They are unnecessary. Likewise, we have seven Chief Justices, seven different systems of income tax - two varying systems operating in each State - and seven different land Taxation Departments. Is it not idiotic ? If the - people had the power of the referendum, the initiative and the recall, they would decide these matters and so save the Government many a long and weary debate in Parliament. </para>

                    <para>I thank the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> for the splendid work he did while Acting Minister for Repatriation. While recognising the difficulties associated with the control of that Department, I can only, say, after many years' experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu's</inline> administration, that" I could wish a better and kinder man were at the head of it. Honorable members" will recollect the fight I put up on behalf of the returned soldiers engaged in making Anzac tweed, and the unjust statements made in this House, on behalf of the Minister, in reply to my allegations. I am proud to say that every statement I made at the time in regard to the Anzac tweed industry has been fulfilled. The men to-day are earning £5 a week and upwards, whereas under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Millen's</inline> scheme they received only £2 2s. per week, less the amount of any pension that was paid to them. As the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. "West)</inline> has said, when we were asking men to enlist we promised them that their wives and families would be well looked after should anything happen to them, but those promises have not been kept. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> speaking in another place some time ago, said an allowance would be made in respect of only four children in every family, and when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> asked what would be the position of a man who had eight children, he was told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that that would be the man's own responsibility. That was not in keeping with the promise that I, and hundreds of others, had made from the recruiting platform. The men also were not fairly treated in the matter of life assurance. Every American soldier who went to the Front, whether he liked it or not, was insured for £1,000 at a cost of £8 6s. 8d. Here a policy for £1,000 would have cost a soldier £152 7s. 8d. </para>
                    <para>There is only one other matter to which I shall refer. I hope that before the question of the continuance, or otherwise, of the Wheat Pool is definitely decided we shall be allowed to take a vote upon it. My desire is that the Wheat Pool shall be continued. When the scheme was first introduced I was very hopeful with regard to it, and am glad to say that -my hopes have been fully realized. I once asked an old school mate of mine who has a thorough knowledge of the growing and marketing of wheat, what would have happened if, during the war, there had been no Wheat Pool.  His  reply was that the big grain merchants  of Australia would have exported as much as they could get away and would have bought as much as was required for local consumption, and that as to the rest, the farmers might have been able to obtain ls. per bushel for it. It was the pooling of the wheat that saved the farmers, and I shall certainly vote  for  the continuance of the Pool. </para>

No city elsewhere of the size of Melbourne is so lightly taxed, our rate being 2s. 3d. or 2s. 6d. in the £1. European and American municipalities have to pay for the upkeep of police, for which our citizens pay nothing.

As we »have twenty-three millionaires, something like fifty-six semi-millionaires, and twice, that number of quarter-millionaires, the rich of this country might well contribute/ if hot 30 per cent, pf their wealth, which was the life offer of those who fought for Australia, at least 20 per. cent., and thus wipe 0if the war debt which new is a curse to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth Government was represented on the Central Wheat Board by a member, and latterly had charge of the financial arrangements in connexion with the handling of the wheat. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> not only gave the guarantee to the farmers, but undertook the control of the shipping practically, and everything incidental to the business was under Commonwealth control. The Acting Prime Minister knows that. Consequently, as the honorable member for Gwydir suggests, it is only the Commonwealth Government that could arrange for a general inquiry into the whole conduct of the wheat business. The farmers are interested in knowing whether, in future, there is to be a Pool or not. The day before yesterday, in reply to a question asked by me, the Acting Prime Minister said, " All I have said myself was to express the hope that the growers of wheat would be able to look after themselves, and, if possible, relieve this Government of the. never-ending trouble of being a party to the control of. these various undertakings." He thus admitted that the Government is a party to the control. The Government cannot shirk responsibility for the action of the Prime Minister in regard to this matter. </para>
