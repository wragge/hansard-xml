                        <para>- I do not see my way to  do  what is suggested, because I do not. think it would be proper to take that course. It is for each Government that accepts President Harding&#39;s invitation to say what form  of  representation it will adopt. I should be very glad if something could be suggested somewhere in the world which would lead to the representation  of  the various political parties for the consideration of the matter, which, in its essence, is non-party, and of wide-world interest. </para>

During last year some 40,000 yards per month of tweed were supplied from the mills, but this year the quantity has been cut down to 15,000 yards per month, although the demand for the cloth is increasing, because of the popularity of the material that is manufactured . </para>

                        <para>- There is a regulation governing the matter - I am not sure that it is not of very recent date - but it does not prohibit the printing of newspapers in a foreign language. What it does is to require the printing of an English translation in parallel columns with whatever may appear ina foreign tongue. Had I known that the question was to be asked, I would have furnished myself with the regulation. We do not object to the printing of newspapers in a foreign language, but we object to the printing in Australia of anything that our own people cannot understand. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>In 1918 the Government decided that persons of enemy origin who were applying for maternity allowances or invalid or old-age pensions should, in addition to fulfilling the conditions required by law, possess the three following qualifications: - (a)Residence in Australia for ten years prior to the outbreak of the war ; (b) Pre-war naturalization; </para>

                        </list>
                        <para>The Government has now given further consideration to this question, and it has been decided in the case of invalid and old-age pension claimants to waive the condition that claimants&#39; naturalization should have been effected prior to the war, and, in addition, to dispense with any residential qualifications other than those already contained in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. </para>
                        <para>In the case of claimants for maternity allowances, the requirement of pre-war naturalization has been waived ; but it will still be necessary for the claimant (or her husband if. he was of enemy origin) to have been naturalized prior to the birth of the child in respect of which the allowance is claimed. The qualificationoftenyears&#39;residencepriorto the war will no longer be insisted upon. </para>
                        <para>If will still be necessary for claimants of enemy origin to satisfy the authorities as to their loyalty. </para>
                        <para>This decision will take effect as from 9th July, 1921. </para>

                        <para>-Can the Acting Prime Minister inform the House when the payments will he made in connexion with the Wheat Pools, from that of 1915-16 to the last of them? There have been grave delays in the payments in connexion with the old Pools; but, I understand, all the States have now completed their returns, and the holders of scrip are desirous of knowing when payments will be made? </para>

                        <para>-IamafraidI cannot tell the honorable member. There is some difficulty, I understand, in regard to the realization of the assets connected with the old Pools, and some difficulty in connexion with the bonds of some of the wheat that is sold. As to cash obtained in the ordinary way, I understand that that has been cleared up long ago, and that it is the realization of these assets that is causing the trouble and delay. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment that has been moved by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> This, it seems to me, is the vital part of the whole Bill. The Tariff Board is to be appointed to prevent Australian manufacturers in protected industries taking undue advantage of the duties recently passed by this House; and charging unnecessarily high prices for their products. We had last night a very long discussion on the constitutional aspect of this question. It seems to me that we can sweep aside the constitutional question, and achieve our object in a very simple way. We should place upon the Australian manufacturers in all protected industries the onus of seeing that the goods produced by them are available to the public at reasonable rates. By way of illustration I would refer to what has been done by the Australian Dried Fruits Association, which is engaged in a protected industry, and has been very successful. The Association fixed the price of its produce for local consumption, but found, some years ago, that although it had fixed a reasonable price to the retailer, the retailer was charging exorbitant prices to the public. The matter was discussed at its annual conference, with the result that it now fixes, not only the price of its products to the retailer, but the price at which the retailer shall sell to the public. </para>

                        <para>- No. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Dampier covers my suggestion. It would throw upon the manufacturers in our protected industries the onus of showing that their goods were made available to the public at reasonable prices. We need not set, out in the clause what steps shall be taken by them to achieve that object. We have simply to place upon them the onus of taking such steps, failing which they may suffer a reduction or abolition of the Protective duty enjoyed by them. If we did that I am convinced that they would find means of giving effect to our desire in this direction without any legal pressure being brought to bear upon them. This sort of thing is done everyday. That international enterprise, the Ford Motor Company, for instance, fixes the price to the retailer, and also the price at which the retailer shall sell to the public. </para>

                        <para>- I have evidently stirred up a hornet&#39;s nest by what was quite an innocent remark. I shall withdraw my reference to the Ford Motor Company, and say merely that the procedure outlined by me is frequently followed. By throwing this responsibility upon manufacturers in protected industries I believe we may, in some measure, be protected from the rapacity and greed of those who show a tendency to take undue advantage of high duties. The contention of honorable members of the Country party in the course of the recent Tariff debate was that the high duties imposed on many commodities had opened the door to commercial dishonesty, and proof of the soundness of that contention is afforded by the introduction of this Bill. The Tariff schedule, however, has been passed by the House, and as Democrats we are prepared to abide by the decision of the majority. There is still one ray of hope left to us with the creation of this Board, provided that it is required to do what the honorable member for Dampier proposes. </para>

They would  produce their invoices, proving, let us say, that they were selling to the retailer at a reasonable rate, hut under our amendment something more would be required of them. They would have to show, not merely that they were selling their goods at a reasonable rate to the retailers, but, if they desired to retain the existing duty, that these goods were reaching the consumer through channels that would not profiteer. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, they must all bo in the same boat. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Dampier on behalf of the Country party will meet the situation. It was argued last night that we had not the constitutional power to do what we are aiming at. If that is so, then the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> and the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> were right when they said that the wastepaper basket was the proper place for this Bill. If the clause is amended as proposed by us it should do some good. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment sets out that any complaint that the consumer is being charged unfair prices for protected articles shall be inquired into. Surely that is plain enough. I advocate the principle that we should place upon Australian manufacturers, in return for protecting them from outside competition, the onus of showing that the goods produced by them under protective duties are available to the public at reasonable rates. I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

                    <para>.-&#39; The extraordinary attitude taken up  by  honorable members of the Country party on this amendment brings me to my feet, because they lay down certain propositions which, so far as I have been able to gauge their actions in this House, they honour more in the breach than the observance. They lay down the proposition that consumers must get their commodities at reasonable rates, and that there should be legal provision to that effect. </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable member ought to have, done so. Any one who aspires to be  deputy  leader of a party should be prepared to lay down a proposition to which he will adhere. I propose to show that the attitude of the honorable member is ridiculous and cannot commend itself to this House, much less to the public. I agree that there should be legal provision in order to give effect to the proposition that consumers should he able- to get goods at reasonable rates. For that reason I supported the amendment of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> that the Bill should be recast to provide that primary producers and genera&#93; consumers should - obtain manufactured articles at reasonable rates, while, at the same time, those engaged in industries should receive proper conditions and fair wages. </para>

                        <para>- We were defeated by the votes of honorable members in the Corner, who now contend that they want to do something effective in the same direction. I desire to show that they prevented us from being able to do anything to see that the consumer got a manufactured article at a reasonable rate. They do not intend to secure that now. Certainly, the move which they have made cannot effect such a purpose. The proposition of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> means giving a free hand to those who may choose to form combines or monopolies to do exactly what they like. The honorable member would impose an obligation upon the manufacturers of articles in Australia to see that those to whom they sold retail the goods at reasonable rate. But he gives the manufacturers , absolute discretion concerning the persons to whom they may sell. That is the very thing we want to prevent. We desire to insure that manufacturers shall sell to every person who is willing to pay a reasonable price for their goods; and the conditions  governing a reasonable price must be laid down by the law. Once we affirm the principle that the manufacturer may sell to whom he desires we establish the very conditions of which we have most to complain. A striking example  was  given last evening when  an-  honorable member related the case of a retailer in a country town who was* a shareholder in a certain factory, but was unable to buy the goods which it produced in his own town, and had to send to Sydney for supplies. </para>

                        <para>- Nor do I. We want to end it. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> has prepared an amendment which, I think, will prevent any such state of affairs as that continuing. But my main objection to the amendment under discussion is its absurdity. The only power that Parliament has under the Bill is the power to reduce or remove the duty. If one retailer is selling an article at an unreasonable price it is very unfair to remove the duty, and so take away protection from manufacturers who may be selling to retailers, who are distributing at a reasonable price. It is of no use to destroy the whole industry in that way. </para>

                        <para>- In effect, that is so. Possibly, there are good reasons, since I wish to be fair. Perhaps it does not pay the manufacturers to be distributors also. It may be that an agreement entered into with the wholesale houses to undertake distribution proves as profitable to the manufacturers as undertaking distribution direct; but I ask the Minister . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to make it incumbent upon the manufacturers of a protected article to see that that article is available for distribution to the entire trading community. The only penalty I would impose is that provided in this Bill. If the manufacturers are to continue to benefit from the protection which has been afforded them, their goods must be made available to the whole trade. In the woollen mills, there are two profits. If one profit will secure distribution, instead of the two, why should it not be possible to conduct activities in that manner? I know, of course, that there are practical difficulties. It has been a matter of grievance to the retail trade that they have not been able to go to the manufacturers direct and pass on the benefit to their customers. I am asking for more than the mere power of inquiry by the Board. </para>

                        <para>- I am not asking for price-fixing, but that the Government shall make really effective the penalty which it is possible to impose under this Bill. The way to do that is to say that goods shall be made available for sale to the entire trade. I am not asking the Minister to provide that every factory shall be a distributing agency for its own goods, and send travellers all over the country. But I do ask him to provide that those goods shall be available to the whole trade. The manufacturer could be told that if his goods were not supplied to the consumer at lower prices the duty would be reduced or removed. That is the only penalty for which I ask. </para>

                        <para>- I am disappointed with the view expressed by the Acting Attorney-General, because this matter affects the public interest very  closely. A close corporation acting in restraint of trade does not deserve protection, and I should have fought the Tariff very keenly indeed if I had not thought that we could insure that goods manufactured under a high Tariff would be distributed to the people with less intervening cost. If that is legally impossible, we are apparently restricted to the power of getting the Board to inquire and report to Parliament. The intention of the Bill seems to me to be that the inquiry shall not go beyond the factories. </para>

                    - I am advised that it is extremely doubtful that we have such power. When a trade is carried on entirely on competitive lines, the consumer, generally speaking, is not charged too much for his goods, but when there are close corporations and rings, and trade arrangements which prevent free competition, the consumer probably is charged too much. The clause, as drafted, enables the Minister to refer to the Board of Inquiry, and report,

                    <para>. - I do not think it matters whether the amendment is carried or not; and if it pleases the members of the Country party, they are easily satisfied. After all, it simply means that the Board will inquire and define what are unnecessarily high prices, and then report to this Chamber. We know how the parliamentary machine works, and months, or years, may elapse without anything being done; it certainly does not mean cheap goods for consumers. The only proper method would have been to test our constitutional powers by adopting the amendment of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Fen ton).</inline> The members of the Country party, who have taken up hours with their camouflaging amendments, were those who voted, practically in a body, against that proposal. If that amendment had been agreed to, the High Court would be given another opportunity of. deciding the constitutional question, and, in view of the recent decision, there was every reason to believe the constitutionality of the amendment would have been upheld. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, or the cow itself. It has been said that the manufacturer controls the industry, but in 99 per cent. of cases the manufacturer has no more to do with the disposal of his goods than I have. My father was a manufacturer in New South Wales for forty-four years, and he never controlled the selling of his goods. On the contrary, every retailer controlled him ; it was the retail houses which told him where he had to sell. There is not a manufacturer in New South Wales who has any more to do with the selling of his goods to the consumer than has this House. </para>

                        <para>- Even if there were a report that a retailer was charging more than he had a right to do, what power would this Parliament have to act? If the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, or any other of the big controlling influences, sells at an exorbitant rate, we have power to wipe out the Protection, but when a company sells through five or six subsidiary channels, the public ultimately may have to pay 500 per cent. above the manufacturing costs. What could this Parliament do in such cases? If there is any doubt as to the accuracy of what I have just said in regard to the percentage ultimately paid by the public, I am prepared to bring proofs next week. </para>

                        <para>-But the cost is added to because the goods go through so many channels. When the Tariff was under consideration, we&#39; were told by Queensland representatives that Queensland timber, sent to Melbourne, was first handled by the man who distributed it to the various yards, and charged21/2 per cent., and then&#39; distributed by the yards to the builders at a cost of 25 per cent. If we add the charges made by the builder and others until the timber reaches the consumer we find about 100 per cent. added to the cost of production in the forest or at the mill. </para>

                        <para>- I understand the Country party to argue that if a dairy farmer knows that a retailer is selling his milk at an unreasonable price he need not supply that retailer with any more. But can any one say that there is a dairy farmer anywhere who ever says where his milk shall or shall not be sold? The whole business is controlled by the distributing agencies. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has expressed my idea of what it is possible to do in the way of insuring that goods are distributed to the public at reasonable prices. We are told, however, by the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> that what is proposed cannot be done under the Constitution. Unlike many other lay members, I do not profess to be able to interpret the Constitution better than the High Court has already done. There is an old saying that a man who is his own lawyer &#39;has a fool for a client, and although we may interpret the Constitution to out own personal satisfaction we are not likely to do so in the way acceptable to the Court. We are, therefore, face to face with trouble directly we endeavour, by Act of Parliament, to insure that goods are sold at prices that will give satisfaction to the public generally. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that, and therefore agree with the Minister and others who say that the amendment of the honorable member for Dampier cannot be effective.  His  object is the same as that of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> though the methods differ, and the members themselves differ in their views of our power to enforce what they think should be done. If the Minister&#39;s proposal is as near as we can go towards attaining our end, I shall support it; but I should like a closer definition of &#34; restraint of trade.&#34; The Board might make inquiries as to, among other things, the conduct of a certain manufacturer,- whether it might reasonably be considered in restraint of trade, and might report to the House on .the subject, and we could then debate the question here for weeks and for months without coming to a satisfactory conclusion. The difficulties of doing so are illustrated by the discussion on this clause. It appears to me that, although we wish to do what is right, we -shall probably not attain our ends by this Bill, or -by any other. However, I am willing&#34; to give the method a trial. The inquiries of the Board, and its reports to Parliament, will be wholesome in their effect; but whether the methods of distributing manufactured goods can be regulated, and penalties imposed for the charging of unreasonable prices, is another matter. I have grave doubts on the subject. If the Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs think that the suggestion of the honorable member for Wakefield is impracticable and unconstitutional, I shall not support it. But, in my opinion, it is the best that can be done, and goes as far as we can go under the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>. - We have discussed this matter with the Solicitors-General,&#39; and he agrees that there is the grave doubt about the constitutionality of the amendment of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> Ministers: desire that the fullest investigations should be made into everything directly or indirectly connected with the Tariff, so that no one may take undue advantage of the Tariff. The honorable member proposes that any complaint that a consumer is being charged unfair prices for protected articles shall be investigated. But suppose that a Sydney merchant were selling an agricultural implement, manufactured under the protection of the Tariff, to a farmer in the Wagga district, and that the farmer complained that he was being charged an unfair price for that implement. If the Board made an investigation, and called upon the merchant to answer its- questions, he, like in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, in a case in which a Royal Commission wished to obtain evidence some time ago, would say, &#34; I shall not reply to your questions, and you cannot- compel me to do so, because I bought the article in question within the State, and sold it within the State. No Customs duty was collected on it, and the transaction was wholly a State matter, with which you have no constitutional power to interfere.&#34; In those circumstances, the investigation might not be possible. </para>

                        <para>-Parliament should not; in Federal legislation, assume powers and a jurisdiction that it may not possess: But we have tried , to meet the honorable member, and also to meet the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr.Richard Foster). The protection of industry and the general regulation of distribution throughout the community are two distinct matters. There is no power to deal directly with distribution, and the honorable member for Dampier has asked us to deal with a matter concerning which serious doubts exist. The honorable member for Wakefield contends that a manufacturer should, in effect, be willing to sell his goods to every person who is ready to buy from him. But it is conceivable that a concern might wish to gave distributing costs by making arrangements with outside firms. Some of the big companiesinAustralia are providing their workmen with goods, and saving the cost of distribution by buying direct from the wholesale merchants. This Parliament could not impose on any individual, as an express and positive duty, that he should do what the honorable member for Wakefield suggests, because it cannot dictate to an individual in any State to whom he shall or shall not sell. If a woollen manufacturer were making a trade arrangement, resulting in higher prices being charged, the Minister&#39;s proposal would permit an investigation. He is willing to widen the scope of inquiry. It is the consumer who is entitled to make the complaint. He may say, &#34; I was charged an undue price for the goods which I purchased, owing to some arrangement, agreement, or understanding which had that result &#34; ; and an investigation may be made into that complaint. The honorable member for Wakefield wishes to interfere in a case such as that in which a man in a country town applies to a manufacturer to buy his goods, and cannot get supplies, al though he finds that the . manufacturer has arranged to sell to other persons,, and, as the result of that arrangement;the would-be purchaser finds that he has ultimately to pay, buying indirectly, unreasonably high prices. </para>

                    <para>.- We are right in endeavouring to protect the consumer in every possible way, and the amendment of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> opens the way to doing that. In my opinion, the proposal of the Minister would not remedy the charging of unduly high prices, because the manufacturer of the goods may not be responsible for the prices charged to the consumers of them. I recognise the constitutional difficulties in -the way of the acceptance of the amendment of the honorable member for Dampier, but there is always a difference of opinion among lawyers, both in this Chamber and outside, as to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. When the last appeal was made to the people to agree to  certain amendments in the Constitution, there were constitutional lawyers, who urged that the Parliament already had the power to do that for which those amendments of the Constitution were sought. The Acting Attorney-General {Mr. Groom) has said that he has discussed this amendment with the Solicitor-General, and that both are convinced that it goes beyond our constitutional authority. There are other lawyers who take a different view, and it seems to me that we could do no harm by giving the consumer the benefit of the doubt. The amendment simply provides that the Board shall be called upon to inquire and report as to any complaint that the consumers are being charged unfair prices for protected articles. I approve of the amendment, whereas it seems to me that the suggestion made by the Minister amounts merely to a repetition of something already appearing in the clause. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that it is difficult to control prices throughout the States. We cannot exercise the control we desire unless we have a uniform fixation of prices throughout the Commonwealth. We can, however, throw upon manufacturers the onus of showing that they have set up a system of distribution that will avoid exorbitant charges to the consumer. During the Tariff debate it was suggested that high duties might give rise to monopolies and combines, but if the people of Australia have to deal with a combine it is better that it should be within the Commonwealth, where we can control it, rather than overseas, where we could not hope to control it. We have to make the best of a bad job, and I am inclined to think that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Dampier will show the people of this country that we are sincerely anxious to protect the consumer. Where complaint is made that unfair prices are being charged, the Tariff Board, under the amendment, would be called upon to investigate and report, and on receipt of its report it would be for the Parliament itself to determine whether or not the protective duty affecting the industry concerned should be reduced or abolished. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Throughout the Tariff debate, when we suggested that the imposition of high duties would mean increased cost to the consumer, it was pointed out again and again by honorable members on both sides of the House that the Tariff Board would be able to take action to insure that reasonable prices were charged for the products of protected industries. The Minister said that legislation would be brought forward to protect the consumer from unfair prices. That legislation is now before us; but in submitting this amendment, apparently, I have touched upon a very sore spot. I do not think it would have been out of place had I asked that the Board should have power to inquire into the collection and distribution of moneys for the purposes of Tariff reform, or how such funds have reached various political ogranizations. </para>

                        <para>- I was not referring to the honorable member or his party when I alluded to this question of distribution of moneys collected for the purposes of Tariff reform. But I cannot help realizing the extent to which three or four big organizations in this country have been obtaining control during the last three or four years, and the great danger attaching to such a development. We are told that it is impossible, under the Commonwealth Constitution, to take action similar to that for which provision is made in the Canadian Tariff Act. That Act contains no reference to &#34; restraint of trade,&#34; but provides that if there is anything in the way of a combination or arrangement- </para>

                        <para>- We have had before us the balance-sheet of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which shows that, although the mine was closed down for two years, its net profits in respect of all its activities over a three-year period, amounted to &#163;1,800,000, or &#163;600,000 a year. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> slipped a duty throughtheCommittee late one evening, and we did not have time to consider it. I do not know whether he realized at the time what would be its effect, but it was subsequently reported to us from Perth that, under that duty, &#163;18 per ton was being charged on 14-gauge wire. That was an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. If we found any company taking the fullest advantage of the protection granted them, and making enormous profits by charging unfair prices, surely we should be able to call upon the Board to make inquiry and report ! </para>

                        <para>- I am not afraid of that. It is the duty of every member to try to protect the consumer. Honorable members have been doing their best to aid the manufacturer. Now, having put him on a good wicket, they should insure fair play for the consumer. I believe that my amendment will tend to effect what is necessary, although it does not go as far as I could wish. But I am disappointed with the Bill. It contains next to nothing, after all the fine promises of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- The Board will have to determine whether a gentlemanly agreement came within the various qualifications of restraint of trade which the honorable member has mentioned, and it might determine that it did not. I think it is better to adhere to the wider language employed in the clause as drafted. I have no objection to the amendment which the honorable member suggests, but I think it -will have the effect of limiting the clause. </para>

                    <para>. -  The addition of the specific words ending with &#34;general&#34; in the amendment which the honorable member for Dampier has suggested would, under the ordinary rule of interpretation, refer back to the preceding words and imply some action in the nature of conspiracy or combination. That is the doctrine of <inline font-style="italic">ejusdem generis.</inline> The clause, as drafted, covers any restraint of trade whether by conspiracy, agreement, combination, or individual action. The word &#34;conspiracy&#34; means several persons acting together with a certain intention. Agreement and arrangement &#39; also suggest a number of persons, but restraint of trade might be an individual act. Suppose that one company has a monopoly of the manufacture of certain goods, there could be neither conspiracy nor agreement, and the honorable member&#39;s suggested amendment would probably enable that company to escape. </para>

I heard a gentleman say the other day that cloth produced at a woollen mill in Geelong was sold in Flinders-lane at 12s. per yard, and re-sold to tailors in Geelong at 32s. per yard. That discloses an exorbitant cost of distribution, and I am informed that tailors in Geelong are unable to get any of the cloth locally manufactured for making up into suits, and I know that the same difficulty is experienced in other centres where woollen mills are operating. </para>

                        <para>- If the amendment is carried, a number . of consequential amendments will be necessary, and Ave can easily deal with cases of that character. We can refuse to allow a manufacturer to accept an offer for the whole of his output. This Parliament particularly desires to assist the woollen industry, and at the same time give an opportunity for the locally-manufactured article to be sold at reasonable prices to the consumer. I understand that to-day not one mill will supply a tailor with any quantity of sloth he requires. The amendment, if agreed to, will compel the manufacturer to sell to any tailor any quantity of cloth not less than &#163;50 in value. I realize that it might not be fair to compel a mill to sell a length of cloth to an individual - although the difficulties in the way of doing that are not very great - but I can see no objection to one portion of a manufacturing establishment being set aside to supply the distributing trade. </para>

                        <para>- The only financial aspect I see is that from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent., and in some cases 150 per cent., profit is being made by those who handle the cloth between the factory and the user. It is not the manufacturer who gets the very high profit. If any woollen mill sells less than a certain quantity of cloth it is boycotted by Flinders-lane. </para>

                        <para>- I do not ask the manufacturer to sell to an uncertificated insolvent or to give credit to the small purchaser. All that I require is that he shall be prepared to sell, and that means to sell for cash. The more we examine the matter the more we are forced to the conclusion that uneconomical methods of distribution are largely at the root of the high cost of living. For instance, one baker&#39;s bread cart will arrive in a street to deliver bread to one house, and then depart for the house of another customer half a mile away. Ten minutes later another baker&#39;s cart arrives to serve the neighbour of the first customer, and so on. In regard to boots, the retailer makes a profit of from 8s. to 12s. per pair on a pair of men&#39;s boots. Yet the retailers are not becoming wealthy, because there are so many shops and such a large number of people employed, who are only working two or three hours a day, that big profits must be made. The amendment provides an opportunity of dealing with one phase of distribution, particularly in regard to clothes. It will compel the manufacturers to at least supply to distributors. It is true that the Board can only report to the Minister any infringement of the law, but my intention is that interference with the duty shall not be the only penalty. By that method we might seriously injure fifty millers who were prepared to observe the law, and I therefore desire to provide for severe fines and penalties. </para>

                    <para>.- There is certainly much to be&#39; said in favour of the amendment which has been submitted, but there are great difficulties in the way of carrying it into effect. The whole trouble is our system, or lack of system, in distribution in all our industries. In the woollen industry the position is very difficult indeed, and the only way of overcoming it is by extending the industry. The supply of woollen garments is very small as compared with -the public requirements. If we manufacture only 20 per cent, of the public demands, and supply the 80 per cent, by means of importations, we make it possible for one set of tailors to be given preference over another, some being compelled to pay British prices. </para>

                        <para>- A specific case has come under my notice in New South Wales. In York-street, Sydney, which is the Flinders-lane of that city, one warehouse was taking about 10 per cent, of their requirements from local manufacturers at 10s. a yard, importing the balance from England at 45s. a yard. Instead of supplying the local tailors with the Australian article, and, perhaps, giving preference to one set of tailors over an other, they lumped the two classes of cloth together, and sold it at an average price of 42s. I admit that the difference between 10s. and 42s. seems a big profit, but when we consider that the warehouses remitted 3s. a yard on the imported article, the price is not so large. </para>

                        <para>- Something like that, but the total profit is not great. I commend&#34; that plan, because it avoids the giving of preference to one set of tailors as against another. I hope the time is near when Parliament and the people will co-operate to establish more woollen mills, for these would prove a veritable gold mine for this country. If that were done, we should be able to reduce to a large extent the excessive  cost of clothing in Australia to-day. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot see my way to accept this amendment. I have inserted a provision which enables the Tariff Board to inquire and cover the whole of the ground that is covered by this proposal. The Board by that provision has power to inquire in regard to anything done by a manufacturer that results in an added cost to the consumer ; consequently, I say the ground is covered. All the Tariff Board can do is to inquire and report, and it can report to the House in regard to such matters  as come within the proposed amendment as they can in regard to -the other matters. It then rests with the House to determine whether a case has been made out for a reduction in the duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire. to point out the fallacy in the argument of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> that his own amendment already covers the ground. Of course, if that be so, there is nothing more to be said - it does cover the ground. My point, however, is that it does not. The amendment that has been inserted by the Committee deals with manufacturers who act in such a way as to put up the ultimate price to the consumer. </para>

But it cannot be said that the manufacturer is acting in such a way as to ultimately raise the price to the consumer. It could not so raise the price; the people doing that&#34; are the Flinders-lane merchants. </para>

                        <para>- In such a case the manufacturer would certainly be justified in selling; but a manufacturer with goods in stock at his factory must not refuse to sell direct to the small retailer. The circumstances are to be discovered during the inquiry. It may be discovered, for instance, that he is justified in refusing to sell - that he has not the goods or has to supply them to some one else. The whole genesis of his reason for refusing would be laid bare, and we could act or not as we thought fit. It does not mean that because he refuses to sell he is necessarily penalized - that depends on circumstances. The honorable member for Ballarat simply desires the Board to have power to- conduct an investigation. Is there any reason why the Board should not have that power? The Minister has not shown that his amendment covers the same ground, while I submit that I have clearly shown that it does not. The honorable member for Ballarat has made it clear that his amendment would serve a useful purpose in the direction of investigations conducted by the Board. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment, or, if he does not, I hope it will be approved by the good sense of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- The object of the amendment is to make it practically impossible for a manufacturer to refuse to, sell goods to the value of &#163;50 at current market . . rates. If that is not the intention of the amendment, why is &#39;it proposed ? There is this objection : The Tariff has been passed for the encouragement of local manufactures; but the problems of distribution within the country are entirely another matter, and it would be unwise to assume a jurisdiction in regard to them which does not expressly belong to this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a Tariff matter at all. Distribution within a State---buying and selling - is essentially  a matter for the State authorities. What we have to do is to ascertain whether local manufacturers are taking undue advantage of the protection given by the Tariff. If it is complained that they are doing so, the Bill provides for an investigation, and, should that investigation show that there is just cause -for complaint, this Parliament may, if it thinks fit, remove or reduce duties, and subject the offending industry to the competition of the world. </para>

The intention is not to deal with isolated cases. To pass a Bill to do that would be like using a steam hammer to crack a nut. The real danger against which this Parliament has to guard is the association of manufacturers who are protected by the Tariff to prevent the public getting a fair deal, and the Bill contains machinery for that end. </para>

                    <para>. -  A shopkeeper may be stocking imported articles of a certain kind, and articles of the same kind which have been manufactured locally, playing off the imported against the locally manufactured goods for his own advantage. To safeguard against that we might prohibit those who stocked locally manufactured articles from&#39; selling imported articles, but that is hardly practicable. The tailors, for instance, would object to it. The proposal of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> may be called crude, but it would be effective if it could be applied. Of course, it would not be fair to say to a manufacturer, &#34;You must sell &#163;50 worth of assorted goods for the same price proportionately as &#163;50,000 worth.&#34; A man giving an order for &#163;50 worth of cloth would toe ordering about . sixteen suit lengths, and these the manufacturer would have to cut from sixteen different bales, and it would not be unfair, therefore, to allow him, at least, 10 per cent, more on such an order than he would get on a bulk order very much larger, and perhaps entirely for one class of goods. </para>

                        <para>- The community is prejudiced, not by the profits made by the&#34; manufacturer, so much as by the profits made by the distributors, 100 or 150 per cent, often being added to the manufacturers&#39; prices. But it being the desire of the Committee to make Protection of benefit to Australia, we should do our best to frame legislation which will secure this end. The Minister has made a suggestion which has been criticised by certain honorable members, and other members have made suggestions which have likewise been criticised and regarded suspiciously. This, of course, is natural. I, myself, am always suspicious of suggestions emanating from certain quarters, my motto being, &#34; Beware of the Greeks when they bring gifts.&#34; What we need to do is to get down to bedrock, and ascertain what our constitutional powers in this matter are. This is a&#39; question that will have to be tested in the Courts. It is not too much to insist that the manufacturers whose industries we protect shall deal fairly with the public, and sell small parcels to small men. We shall always have small men in business, and their interests must be considered. At the same time, it is bulk production and distribution that reduce costs. If I thought that the Bill did all that was desirable for the protection of the community,  I  would accept it; but the Minister, if he desires to study the interests of the community as they should be studied, should, with the aid of his officials, endeavour to devise some method of making operative the suggestion of the honorable  member for Ballarat. We shall not have a perfect Tariff until some such suggestion is applied. Personally, I am a Prohibitionist. I would keep out all importations that might compete against a protected industry, and I stood alone at one election, so far as my own party is concerned, on this point. In my opinion, this debate has been protracted uselessly. What we need is a provision that will protect the consumer, and the suggestion of the honorable member for Ballarat, if it can be applied constitutionally, would help to do that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RICHARD</inline> FOSTER (Wakefield) &#91;2.53&#93; -I think that the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> should accept the statement of the Government. I am as desirous as he is that our manufacturers shall sell openly to those who apply to them for goods ; but it would be impossible to enforce the amendment literally. Our mills are limited in number and capacity, and cannot supply the demands of the local trade. You could not, therefore, compel a man to sell &#163;50 worth of goods if he had already customers who were unsupplied. All that we are likely to get out of the Bill is an inquiry and a report. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and should meet the honorable member&#39;s wishes. When Parliament receives a report from capable men, it will be in a position to take what action it may think right. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CHARLTON</inline> (Hunter) &#91;2.55&#93;.- In my opinion, the amendment is essential. We have been saying for a long while that it is necessary to clip the wings of the middleman as far as possible, and the  amendment would have that effect. I do not see how the constitutional question arises. It is not as if we were interfering with trade. We simply say that the Board shall have the right to inquire- into certain matters which are affected by the Tariff. If a factory which is enjoying the benefit of protection given to it by this Parliament refuses to supply an order for &#163;50 worth of goods, or more, sent to it by any firm or individual, the Tariff Board will be able to inquire the reason, and, on its report, Parliament can deal with the matter. The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> endeavoured to make it appear that that Would be a contravention of the Constitution, but I do not agree with him. We are not proposing to fix the price of any commodity. All we say is that protected manufacturers shall not refuse to supply an order for the value of &#163;50 or more. Of course, if a1 manufacturer had not the goods, he could not be penalized. If we are to keep faith with the people, we must do all that is possible to protect the consumers. </para>

                    <para>.- It would be improper for me to make a second-reading speech now; but I would point out that everything that I said on the second reading has been justified by the Ministerial attitude towards those who have suggested amendments in -this clause. I said that the Government did not intend to do anything, and its conduct to-day shows that the Bill; and this clause of the Bill, are merely so much camouflage and deception. The Bill does not provide for anything being done, and the clause, of course, makes no provision  for any exercise of power. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> has moved an amendment providing for an inquiry into certain facts. It may be that we have no power to do anything; but there is no reason why there should not be an investigation, or why publicity should not be given to the results of it. I cannot see any objection to that. If time has been unduly occupied in the discussion of the amendment the fault rests with the Government, since it refuses to agree to a simple proposal  that the Tariff Board shall be empowered to investigate ordinary questions of trade. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> says that there are certain manufacturers who for a variety of reasons will not sell direct to the retail dealer. There arc many typical cases. For instance, a storekeeper in Castlemaine may desire to purchase blankets from the focal manufactory, but he cannot do so. The blankets made in that factory are sent to warehousemen in Flinders-lane,  so that the local dealer has to pay Melbourne &#34;blood&#34; money plus the cost of. returning those blankets to the town where they are manufactured, and where he proposes to sell them. In Sale and Bairnsdale there are large storekeepers who are prepared to buy direct from many of the big manufactories in this country. In no case,  however,  are they able to do so. The storekeepers must pay- &#34; blood &#34; money to the selling agencies in Flinders-lane. The Government object to any inquiry into these matters. They object to the public knowing the extent to which this practice is being carried on. They refuse to permit any investigation upon the ground that, even when such an  investigation  had been made by the Board, they would have no power to do anything. There is no reason why in the public interest, however, such matters should not be investigated and full publicity given to the findings of the Board. I believe that the Government have power to deal with all such cases. They are prepared- to permit inquiry into the prices charged by manufacturers who directly exploit the public, because they say they can deal with them per medium of the&#39; Tariff. It is well known, however, that in very many cases the main instrument of exploitation is the selling agency associated with a manufactory. If the Government take up the attitude that they are powerless to deal with such practices, then I say that the Bill is a delusion, a sham, and a mockery. It is a sort of &#34;rich uncle from Fiji &#34; piece of legislation. There are some big manufactories in this country which purport to sell direct to the public. Their goods are produced in one part of the building occupied by them, and in another part of the same building very often there is a selling agency carried on under a different name, although its directors and shareholders are the directors and shareholders of the manufacturing company. The company sells its products to the selling agency at a profit of 5 per cent., and that distributing agency in turn sells to the retailers at rates that insure enormous profits. The profits are then divided between them. In other cases, as,&#39; for instance, in the boot industry, there are manufacturers who have their own retail shops, and make their profits, not in the factory, but in the retail trade. They may make a loss in the actual work of production, but they make big profits through their retail agencies. The Government say that they can do nothing so far as these selling agencies are concerned. If that is so, then they might as well put the Bill into the waste-paper basket, because there is not an exploiting manufacturer in Australia who cannot evade the provisions of the Bill as it stands by the simple method of establishing a distributing agency to which he will sell at a reasonable price, leaving the selling agency to make the requisite profits. This attitude on the part of the Government shows that the Bill is a mere piece of camouflage. The Government propose by it to establish a Board and create a staff at a cost of thousands of  pounds  in order to permit of inquiries that will not touch the selling agents, and can be absolutely of no advantage to the general public. Some one has said that there are some manufacturers who are prepared to sell at reasonable rates. &#34;We know that there are certain manufacturers who are prepared to break away from rings and deal fairly by the general public. But they are bound hand and foot by the limitations that the rings can impose - by the boycott which these rings can bring tn bear upon them. Yet the Government would say to such manufacturers, &#34; We will take away from you the protection which the Tariff affords.&#34; It is absurd to say that the Government can deal with those who are exploiting the public only by taking away the protective duties and so penalizing the innocent as well .as the guilty. When the Government take up that stand they show they do not want to do anything. I am not speaking as a partisan or in condemnation of the present Government alone. I have made the same complaint regarding a Government behind which I have sat. Years ago, when I was supporting a certain Government .that was proposing to appeal to the people to agree to certain amendments of the Constitution, a doubt was first raised in my mind as to our constitutional powers being as limited as they were said to be, by hearing the present Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, who were then in Opposition, constantly reiterating the statement that the Government could do whatever they wanted to do if they chose to exercise their existing powers. It was such statements that roused in me the spirit of investigation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> who was then the representative of Angas, also claimed that the Government could do whatever it desired to do in the way of protecting the people from exploitation. There never was a Government, no matter how limited its constitutional power, that could not do what it wanted to do. What a Government may not do by direct legislation it may yet achieve through its various instrumentalities. The Government have unlimited power to license, and can impose licensing conditions. They can use the instrumentalities of Government to prevent exploitation just as they have used them against Tattersalls. Any institution or enterprise which is conducted to the detriment of the public can be dealt with effectively through the instrumentalities of Government. It can be deprived of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities of communication. </para>

The Government cannot deal with a case of butter as they can with letters addressed to Tattersall&#39;s; but they can control the instrumentalities of transport, and in that way deal effectively with every great industry that is being carried on in a way that is detrimental to the public interest. The Government can go further. They can create a public opinion and expose exploiters to public odium. There was never a Government that could not devise a means of doing what it wanted to do. There was never a Government that could not make an individual bend to its will. </para>

                    <para>.- Earlier in the day I pointed out that, in my opinion, it was necessary to have in the Bill a provision that would do exactly what the amendment moved by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> is designed to dp, but the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> intimated that we had not the constitutional power to legislate in that direction. Since two or three days had already, been devoted to the discussion of the constitutional aspect of this question, I said I would not debate it, but the Government have not satisfied me that there is no power to give effect to this amendment, and I do not think any harm will he done by making it. After all, it will only mean that where a manufacturer refuses to sell to people in the trade who desire to buy directly from him inquiry may be made into all the circumstances. The only argument I have heard against the amendment is that where certain manufacturers are not in a position to supply direct to those who may desire to deal with them such a provision as this might operate harshly. After all, we are not going to judge to-day whether the whole of the manufacturers in any particular industry are in a position to do what we desire. The Board&#34; will inquire and report to this Parliament, and the final determination of the whole matter will rest with us. I see no harm in the amendment, and shall support it. </para>

                    <para>. - If the clause were so amended, the procedure would fee rendered unworkable. The Board must report in- regard to quite a number of things; for example, concerning the matters dealt with in the preceding section. If the Minister had to bring everything before Parliament before he could move, and had to get the House to agree, he would be invoking Parliament every day. With respect to certain things, such as increasing or decreasing duties, the Minister may not act without the consent of Parliament; but to ask Parliament to decide upon everything such, for example, as the determination of the value of goods for duty under section 160 of the Customs Act - would be looking for altogether too much. </para>

But, since the reports of the Board would come before the Minister, and, through him, to the Executive Council, there should be ample time for the Government to consider what action to take, and then to simultaneously introduce the schedule and produce the report&#39; of the Board. </para>

                    <para>.- According to this clause, upon a certain date the Tariff Board must compile its annual report for Parliament. During the last week of the year the Board might agree to make certain recommendations to the Minister in regard to the increase or reduction of duties. It is essential that such matters be kept absolutely secret until the moment when it becomes necessary to take action in Parliament. The Board must be in agreement with the Minister; and, if the two authorities are agreed that it is in the public interest that a recommendation be withheld, then it is only right that provision should be made to that end. </para>

                        <para>.- It is my intention to oppose the third reading of the Bill. I was very interested to read in this week&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Australian and Mining Standard,</inline> which has been a great champion of the High Tariffists, a paragraph which, in pointing out the advantages which will accrue from the proposed Board, states that Parliament in building up the new Tariff has been working wholly in the dark. It is one of the most amusing statements I have ever read. In championing the proposed Board this journal shows clearly that this and previous Parliaments have been imposing duties without the slightest knowledge of what the effect of them would be. Now that the Tariff has been dealt with we can surely defer this proposal for some time, and endeavour to save a little money. I do not know that the Board will be particularly useful, although if the Minister appoints a good Board it may be of some value. I prefer no Board, but if we are to have one I desire one responsible to Parliament rather than to the Minister. This Bill merely provides for the appointment of a Ministerial Board. Therefore, I ask the House to reject the third reading. </para>

The tendency of the people today is to prevent the building up of new Departments instead of increasing them; as we seem to be doing almost every day. The Board, constituted as it will be, will have no effect as far as I can see beyond providing cosy billets for some of those who are now seeking employment. </para>

                        <para>.- The principal debate on this Bill was concentrated on clause 14, because of the difference of opinion amongst members as to the effectiveness of the provisions for preventing unfair dealing on the part of manufacturers, but as to the purpose of the Bill as a whole, I am hopeful that the Board will prove beneficial, and be the means of saving the Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum. In the Tariff which we have just passed there are some anomalies, and it will be the duty of the Board to inquire into and report upon the duties which we have imposed, some of which may be found insufficient and ineffective, and others far too high, and detrimental to other industries. For that reason particularly I shall support the Bill. Like other honorable members I am hopeful that the Board will be effective in eliminating the unfair dealing of manufacturers who are amply protected with the consumers. The Board will bo a useful body, I believe, and the cost will not be so great but that it will be amply repaid by the work the Board may be able to do within even the current financial year. </para>

                        <para>.- I have not had a chance of discussing the Bill in Committee. On the&#39; second reading I said that I was not enamoured of the Board, but if it was properly constituted and worked in the right way it might be capable of doing great good to the people. In dealing with the Tariff, which involves so much to consumers and the people engaged in industry and commerce, there is big scope for useful work. When the Tariff was first explained to Parliament by the Minister we were told that this Board was to be created, and a great number of the duties were passed with that in mind. Therefore we would be stultifying ourselves if we rejected the Bill now. I believe there is a good chance of the Board working economically, and at the same time conferring considerable benefits upon the community. If the working of the Board shows that it is not an effective instrument it need not be continued for any length of time. It is not, like the &#34; Old Man of the Sea,&#34; hung about our necks for ever. One feature that appeals to me is that Parliament may be able to act quickly while the conditions reported upon by the Board still obtain. Having the recommendations of the Board before it a body like Parliament ought to be able to say promptly what is the fair thing to do in the circumstances. Having supported the second reading of the Bill, I feel that I am only consistent in voting for the third reading. </para>

The Minister would be well advised to withdraw it, and reintroduce it on a subsequent occasion. Less than a fortnight has elapsed since it was first introduced, and the minds of commercial men throughout the Commonwealth have not had time to concentrate upon it and formulate concrete opinions. I hope that even yet another place will see fit to take such action as will enable this House to have a further opportunity of reconsidering the whole question. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know; but it seems at the moment as though we should take up the whole of Tuesday on the preliminary stage of the Bill I have mentioned, and some proposals which the Minister, for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has to make. If, however, the whole of Tuesday is not taken up by that business, we shall deal with Supply. As to the War Service Homes, my impression is that the matter might very well be discussed on Supply. </para>
