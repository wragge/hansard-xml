                            <para>- Australia, of course, first, last, and always. Those four nations are now, I hope, like the four-leaved shamrock - in the closest and happiest connexion. What my mother taught me over half-a-century ago is as true to-day as when she uttered it. She, an old Somersetshire woman, to whom I owe everything, said, &#34;Remember, my hoy, that, cruelly as Ireland has been treated in the past by bad laws, there are more poor people suffering in England than in Ireland, because there are more poor in England.&#34; </para>

                    <para>-I wish to draw the  attention of honorable members to a printer&#39;s error in to-day&#39;s notice-paper. It occurs in Order of the Day, <inline font-style="italic">No. 2,</inline> Government business. I was considerably astonished and perturbed, on reading the notice-paper this morning, to find set down, as an Order of the Day, the resumption of a debate on a motion beginning &#34; That this House approves of the execution of the Prime Minister.&#34; But, when I had recovered my normal equanimity, and had read further, I saw that the motion was for the approval of the execution &#34; by the Prime Minister&#34; of an agreement relating to wireless communication. Were the Order of the Day called on in the form in which it stands on the notice-paper, it might occur to some honorable member to move, as an amendment, the omission of all the words after the words &#34; Prime Minister,&#34; and, should the House carry that amendment, and agree to the Order of the Day in its amended form, the position of the right honorable gentleman might be extremely uncomfortable. </para>

                        <para>- During the period that Caulfield Hospital was controlled by the Department of Defence, the property was offered to the State Government ; but, so far, the State has not indicated whether it is likely to acquire the property. The transfer of the control of the hospital from Defence to the Repatriation Department has in no way cancelled this offer. There is no intention of closing the Caulfield Hospital as long as it is necessary for the number of soldier patients requiring treatment. In the event of this number diminishing sufficiently, treatment on the existing lines will be provided, under an agreement with the Alfred Hospital, in absolutely separate wards, and in complete segregation, the Department paying a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> rate per diem for maintenance. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; the result being that it has been decided that there is no necessity to appoint women to this Board. It may be mentioned that some time ago State censorships were instituted in South Australia and Tasmania for the express purpose of checking the work of the Federal censorship. Two married ladies were appointed to each Board. These Boards, in order to justify their existence, were particularly careful in the scrutiny of films passed by the Commonwealth film censorship. Yet, out of over 10,000 films passed by the censorship, the South Australian Board only condemned two, and the Tasmanian Board only condemned the same number out of a total of 4,500. This proves conclusively that the censorship&#39;s work is satisfactory when tested from a woman&#39;s stand-point. </para>

                        <para>- It has always been one of the principles of old-age pensions, under State and under Commonwealth laws, that there shall be deductions from pensions both in respect of the capital value of property and in respect of the income. If the deductions were made in relation only to capital, or to income, it would probably be necessary that the rate of deduction be increased so-as to make it equal to the combined rates of deduction under the present law. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of this Bill is to relieve certain conditions existing for some time past in the Arbitration Court, and which have been the subject of considerable discussion in this House and elsewhere. The Act provides for the appointment of Deputies to assist the  President,  but the provision in the Act in practice has been found to present such difficulties as to make it, in effect, inoperative. The Bill remedies this by substituting an alternative which it is confidently expected will enable the Court to overcome the congestion that now exists. At present Deputies may be appointed to assist the  President  of the Arbitration Court, but, like the  President,  they must be Justices of the High Court or Judges of a Supreme Court of a State. Diligent effort has been made by the Government to obtain the services of Justices of the High Court or Judges of a Supreme Court of a State, but without success, and, as a result, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, the  President  of the Court, has been left without assistance. Business has become so congested that the  President  has declared that it is impossible for him to carry out his duties properly unless he has that assistance. Early in the year he had cleared the list of cases before him, and he anticipated having no difficulty whatever in dealing with the work that was likely to come forward, but this has proved to have been too optimistic a view. The  President  must have assistance; Deputies cannot be obtained as the law stands. Under the Bill there will, it is anticipated, be no difficulty. Clause 2 of the Bill now provides that the Government may appoint as Deputies gentlemen who are barristers or solicitors, and the term of their appointment is to be whatever term is expressed in the instrument of appointment or, if no term is set out, then a term which coincides with the unexpired portion of the term for which the  President  of the Court has been appointed, which in this case is about six and a half years. This provision will enable the Government to appoint gentlemen who are not Judges, but who must be barristers or solicitors, as Deputies to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers to clear off the business before the Arbitration Court, and relieve a congestion which has, to those who believe in the legal settlement of industrial disputes, created a position full of danger to the community. If I am asked why the selection is confined to barristers and solicitors, my answer is that, as originally drafted. the clause made the field of selection wider, but the  President  of the Arbitration Court expressed the view that as points of law continually arise during the hearing of cases before the Court, the limitation as now provided in the Bill was necessary. It has been therefore amended accordingly. The Government must pay regard to the wishes of the  President  of the Court, for whom these men will act as Deputies. Two of the other clauses of the Bill have been inserted as the result of representations made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> Clauses 3 and 4 amend section 18a of the principal Act in such a way as to provide that where an award is made, and a party to that award assigns his business, or it passes in some way to another, then that other shall be hound by the award in exactly the same way as if it had been made against him. But this applies only in cases where an award is made before the assignment takes place, or the business passes; it does not apply in cases where, although a plaint is filed, the award has not been made. I have only to add that this is a provision which is doubtful constitutionally, although the Court the other day declined to express an opinion on its validity. It is an amendment to which, in its very nature, no one can take exception; it is an eminently proper thing to do in the interests of the preservation of industrial peace. But I wish to make it perfectly clear that we do not say that it is constitutionally valid; ou the other hand, the Court, as I say, has expressly declined to declare it invalid. </para>

                            <para>- That is a suggestion made by the  President  himself. The present provision necessitating three Judges in the first instance delays the Court unduly. It is still thought necessary not to place the vital question of hours in the absolute discretion of any one individual ; but it is proposed to effect this by giving a right <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> appeal to three Judges. That certainly will enable the business of the Court to be carried out more speedily . The definition of standard hours <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> one that has been suggested by the Judge himself to remove any ambiguity; and I do not think honorable members can take any exception to that. It is now set out quite clearly what the standard hours of work in any industry really mean. The amendment clears up a doubt which was in the mind of the Court, and of many people; and for that reason I think it is quite unobjectionable. The two important points are - first, the appointment of Deputies, and, second, the substitution for the present provision that all applications involving a change of hours shall be determined by three Judges, the procedure under the Bill whereby one Judge may hear them, subject to appeal. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not desire to speak at any length on the Bill, because I concur largely with what the Prime Minister has said as to the necessity for the amendment of the Act. There is a good deal of congestion in the Arbitration Court, due to an insufficient number of Judges. The Prime Minister stated that the difficulty in this regard is due to the fact that he has not been able to get Judges of the High Court <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> occupy the position of Deputy; consequently it is proposed to amend the Act so that barristers or solicitors may be eligible. When the Prime Minister is making appointments it will be well for him to take into consideration the experience of men who have practised at the Bar in connexion with arbitration, or who have, in any other capacity, acquired a knowledge of arbitration work. It is not every man, whether barrister or otherwise, who is suitable for a position of the kind; he requires experience of the particular work in hand. </para>

                            <para>- With the amendments of the Act as set forth in clauses 4 and 5 I am in hearty accord; they are absolutely necessary if arbitration is to succeed. The very fact that, when a party to a dispute transfers his business to somebody else, the business does not come under an award, weakens, and may, indeed, nullify altogether the effect of arbitration. When a man purchases a business he seeks all particulars in regard to it, and if he knows that there is an award of the Court affecting it, he takes that fact into consideration. As the law now stands, unions may not get the benefit of an award, and the position is also unsatisfactory to other employers in an industry affected. The same! remarks apply to clause 5. and both clauses refer only to awards that have been given, not to plaints awaiting hearing. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it will. Section  18  of the Act provides that the hours of. labour must be determined by three Judges. We, on this side of the House, were very strongly opposed to that, and sought to defeat the clause. The amendment now proposed in clause  3  seeks to obviate the necessity for having the hours determined by three Judges, in the first place, by allowing them to be decided by one Judge. But it gives power to either party to the dispute to appeal to a Court consisting of three Judges. One can hardly imagine a case in which one party will not appeal, an  2  this provision must lead to considerable dissatisfaction and delay. The Prime Minister would be acting wisely if he were to agree to eliminate section  18,  altogether and allow one Judge to deal with the question of hours. Clause  3  will not do what the Prime Minister desires it to  do,  because either party will be able to appeal against the decision of the one Judge,  and,  consequently, an industry will remain  unsettled  pending the result of that appeal. This must have the effect of continuing the congestion that exists to-day. It would be far better to allow this question  of  hours to be decided by one Judge as  it  was prior to the last amendment of the Act. Clause  3  will surely lead  to  two hearings of the case, and that must  involve  delay instead of giving expedition. I personally desire to help in the passing of any proposal that is for the benefit of the process of industrial arbitration, but I say frankly that if I had to choose between the present law, which requires hours of labour to be determined by three Judges,  and  this proposed amendment, which provides  for  an appeal, much as I dislike the existing law, I would prefer  it to  the amendment, which must lead  to  two hearings  of  almost every case. </para>

I, like the Prime Minister, have had a good deal of experience of industrial arbitration, and I say that in almost every case&#39; one&#34; side or the other will appeal. That cannot lead to, expedition. No doubt it will help <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers if one Judge can deal with the question of hours in the initial stage, but under this power to appeal every case will be re-opened and heard a second time. I ask the Prime Minister to carefully consider this matter. I think he has endeavoured to provide a remedy for the present congestion in the Court, although it is, perhaps, a little belated. The Bill is necessary, and, excepting clause 3, 1 am heartily in accord with it. </para>

                        <para>. - I think every honorable member must agree as to the necessity for some amendment of the. existing Act that -will relieve the congestion in the Arbitration Court. But we should be very careful that in amending the law we do not make confusion worse confounded and get so deeply into the bog that we shall not be able to extricate ourselves very quickly. I was pleased to hear the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> 6ay that he does not like clause 3. I expressed my view in regard to the fixation of hours last year. I think the hours to be worked in an industry are not a matter that  can be decided very satisfactorily by a mere hearing in Court under existing conditions ; they should be dealt with in a scientific manner and on physiological grounds. But the danger that is to be apprehended from clause 3 is that the award of the one Judge will operate pending an appeal to the three Judges. For instance, one Judge may decide that Forty-four hours shall be the working week in an industry; that award will become operative ; three months later the three Judges may decide on appeal that forty-eight hours per week shall be worked, and we shall then have great difficulty in securing the observance of that award by reason of the fact that for three months the employees have been already working the shorter week. In those circumstances, I agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that the working hours should be settled at one hearing, and we should adhere to the principle of having this matter decided by three Judges. The fact that this Bill will give power to the Government to appoint  Deputy  Presidents will, to a large extent, obviate the delay which has occurred in the past. If no other endeavour is made to amend clause 3, I shall propose certain amendments to provide that the award in regard to hours, like the judgment of any other Court, shall not be operative while an appeal is pending. </para>

                        <para>.- I am pleased that the Prime Minister has introduced this Bill. He told us that the first clause had been inserted at the request of the  President  of the Court <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Justice Powers),</inline> and he advanced reasons as to why the appointments to the offices of  Deputy  Presidents should be restricted to barristers and solicitors. T should like the Prime Minister, if he can do so, to tell us what were the reasons given by the  President  of the Court for limiting the choice to these professional gentlemen? I do not agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that the granting of the right to appeal will appreciably prolong the settlement of cases. There will be appeals in some cases, but not in all. There may be appeals on the question of hours. I do not know why a man should have the right to appeal from the decision of all other tribunals but those of an Arbitration Court. </para>

When an appeal is made, the shorthand notes of the evidence taken at the original hearing will be available, so that very little additional evidence need be called, and the questions in dispute can be settled very quickly. When a question has been dealt  with on appeal, the settlement will he more permanent than some settlements are now. </para>

                        <para>.- The Bill adds one more measure to the long list of amendments of the conciliation and arbitration law. In its main purpose it will be welcomed by the members of the Labour party, and by those outside who are interested in industrial activities, especially the workers in those activities. The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> myself, and others have spoken in this Chamber quite recently of the unfortunate congestion of work in the Arbitration Court. That the Court is not staffed to an extent that even approaches adequacy has been the cause of grave unrest and dissatisfaction among wage-earners. It has been a public scandal that a high Judicial Tribunal, such as the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, should be so ridiculously understaffed as to be unable to discharge the functions for which it was created. I ventured to say in this- place, not very long ago, that there was strong evidence for the supposition that the Government had determined, rather than destroy the Court deliberately, Ministers  being pledged to support arbitration, to allow its business to drift into confusion and chaos, and that things were rapidly tending to that unhappy climax. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> in replying to my complaint, did not, by arguments or figures, endeavour to answer my contention ; he merely denied, indignantly, the facts that I had put before honorable members. &#39;He said that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had already sufficiently answered the contention that there was any desire on the part of the Government to destroy the Court. It would have been much more becoming of the Minister had he made some explanation of the fact that the  President  of the Court <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Justice Powers)</inline> had recently declared it to be impossible for him to carry on the work of the Court unaided. It would have been more fitting -had the Minister made some answer to my allegation that the cases now awaiting hearing are twice as many as when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins was forced to retire from the position of  President.  Instead <inline font-style="italic">oV</inline> doing that, the honorable gentleman by a general denial endeavoured to convey the impression that I had spoken loosely, and without regard to my responsibilities, or the facts of the case.- If there were wanted any further proof that I was entirely right in the matter, it is afforded by the Bill, whose terms are an acknowledgement that what I and other members have saM lis accurate. The Bill empowers the- Government to appoint a number of  Deputy  Presidents, who for&#39; all practical purposes will have the same powers and duties as the  President,  in order to cope with the rush of work in the Court. I think that that provision is on right lines. The choice of  Deputy  Presidents will no longer be limited to the Justices of the High Court, which is well, because the feeling of those Justices towards the Government in this matter is quite apparent, and none of them would accept the position of  President  or  Deputy President  of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. </para>

                            <para>- The seat is a most uncomfortable one, and the work is most difficult and trying. For a number of years I had the deepest sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, who has given much of the best period of his life to the perfecting of a system of arbitration. Whatever bias some persons may have against him, I think that no one would deny that he brought to bear on the questions with which he has had to deal distinguished talents and extraordinary skill and patience. The proposed  Deputy  Presidents need not be members of the High Court Bench, but they must be barristers or solicitors, or barristers and solicitors, of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State. That provision leaves a fairly wide field of choice, and at that I do not cavil. But it is curious, and worthy of comment, that while we have taken all sorts&#39; of care to prevent barristers and solicitors from appearing in the Court, we take equal care to prevent the position of Judge from being filled by any others than those of the legal profession. There is some point in certain of the remarks of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> when viewed in the light of historic facts. We exclude more or less learned gentlemen from appearing in the Court, though, as I have suggested, very often their presence might expedite and simplify procedure; but we say that no others shall be eligible to preside over it. </para>

                    <para>The next matter of principle in this Bill is the provision for an Appeal Court and the abolition of the requirement now existing that a full Bench of three Justices shall deal with an application for an increase or reduction in hours. The Bill, it is true, abolishes that requirement, but curiously enough it reinstates it, in another and more vicious form, by creating a Court of Appeal. Although one Judge may decide the question of an increase or reduction of hours, his decision is subject to an appeal to the  President,  sitting with two  Deputy  Presidents. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has rightly pointed out that if there is one thing more than &#39;another on which industrialists and those who sympathize with them have insisted it is that in matters of arbitration there should be no right of appeal from the direct and simple decision of one Judge. As I pointed out on another occasion, no person was more insistent in his objection to a Court of Appeal than was the Prime Minister himself at one time.  His  objection was well justified, because the existence of such .a Court is an invitation to appeal, and such an invitation will be accepted in nearly every case. Thus we have not got rid of the objectionable feature which Labour so strenuously opposed when this matter was last before us, namely, the necessity of having a cumbrous Court of three Justices to deal with the question of a decrease or increase of hours. Instead of getting rid of it this Bill makes the avenue to that cumbrous Court longer and more difficult. When we go into Committee I shall be found in opposition to that provision. </para>
                    <para>Another matter worth mentioning at this stage is the proposal to make awards resultant from agreements applicable to successors in and transmittees of any particular business which has been bound by the Court, if a business can be bound by it. The Prime Minister, in moving the second reading of the Bill, said that the clause in question was of doubtful constitutionality. Whatever may be its relation to the Constitution it is of very doubtful practicability. The intention, however, is wholly wise, and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is to be congratulated upon bringing the matter forward and having such a provision for what it, was worth inserted in the Bill. This is by no means the first time that we have considered the principle in this Chamber. It is already law so far as regards the ordinary award. It is now proposed to make it law in the special case. There is, however, the very old principle that no person can be bound by the decision of a Court in respect of proceedings to which he was not a party, and although the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition rightly points out that the transmittee or assignee of a business takes over that business at his peril in so far as the obligations relating to it are concerned, I think that the principle that a man may not be bound, by a decision given in proceedings to which he was not a party is likely to create difficulty and to make it impossible to apply our good in&#62;tentions in this regard. It would be difficult even if a business were transferred and assigned in good faith, but where an assignee takes over a business, as he will do, with the special purpose of evading his obligations under an award, it is more than likely that he will be able to do so in such a way as to successfully evade such obligations. It is not for me to suggest the ways and means by which he will possibly do so. I understood the Prime Minister to say that this provision would not apply to businesses that had changed hands after a plaint had been filed but before the award relating to it had been made; but that it would apply to businesses that had changed hands after the award was made. I suggest to the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> that that curious statement is worthy of explanation. After a plaint is filed, and before the award; is made, an assignee or transmittee has some chance to come in and be a party to the proceedings. After the award is made he has no such opportunity. I am therefore at a loss to understand why we should expressly ex- elude those who have an opportunity to come in before an award is completed, whereas we intend to apply the provision with certainty to those who afterwards take over a business. </para>
                    <para>I shall not further delay the second reading of this Bill. I record, with some satisfaction, that the Bill, so far as it goes, is an answer to our repeated complaints. It is a very tardy and, apparently, reluctant concession of what we have asked for; but we are grateful for it. I think that the Government, although somewhat late in the day, has acted, under pressure, with very great wisdom in not allowing Parliament to go into recess leaving industrial conditions as they are at the present time. </para>

                    <para>One commentary may well be made. Over and over again we have been charged with disloyalty to the determinations of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Over and over again men, both outside and inside this Parliament, have been charged with flouting the Court and having a desire to uproot it. My position is quite clear. I am not an enthusiastic believer in the Court. The Prime Minister seems to think I am, and has suggested that my interest in it is professional rather than political. I leave the taunt with no further comment, because it is hardly worth more. Apart altogether from that, I am not an enthusiastic believer in the principle. I rather believe that in these later days men can do, by organization, co-operation, and loyalty to each other, everything that we thought it was necessary to have an Act of Parliament to accomplish. All they want is a proper spirit of comradeship in order that they may get justice in the bargains that they make with their employers. That being so, I arn not slavishly devoted to the policy of conciliation and arbitration. But, the Court being in existence, and the workers showing an even extraordinary readiness Co come under its jurisdiction, I can only repeat that it was, an act of gross political indecency on the part of the Government to prevent the Court from discharging its functions. This, the latest amendment of the Act, coming although it does at the close of the session, is to be entirely welcomed, and I think it will be fraught with very good results. </para>

                        <para>.- There are three principles embodied in this Bill, and in regard to two of them there is apparently very little dispute. I confess, however, that clause 3 causes me some concern. The original provision that any plaint involving the question of an increase or decrease of hours should be heard by a Court of three Justices is a fair one. I recognise the force of the objection raised by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that by making this amendment of the Act and providing for a Court of Appeal we shall not expedite, but rather delay, the giving of decisions in such cases. Instead of having in each case one application to one Court, we shall have two applications to two Courts. The objection raised by the Leader of the Country party must also be borne in mind. He has pointed out that in the interval between the making of an award relating to hours of employment and the hearing of an appeal in respect of it, that award will operate, and that if the appeal should result in the award being set aside a great deal of difficulty may be encountered in enforcing the Appeal Court&#39;s decision. On the other hand, I understand that in quite a number of cases that go before the Court the question of hours is only a minor consideration, but that the whole of the remaining questions involved in the plaint have to be held up until a Court of three Justices can deal with that minor matter of hours. </para>

                        <para>.- I am in accord with the provisions of the Bill, except clause 3, which, although it purports not to limit the operations of the Arbitration Court, will permit of their being delayed in a manner that will not provide facilities to the parties who are asking for awards. The last amending Bill provided for the appointment of two Deputies to sit with the  President  of the Arbitration Court and deal with the question of hours. The Labour party strongly opposed the measure, because, from the beginning of arbitration, one Judge had always dealt with this matter, and dealt with it satisfactorily. It was only when pressure was brought to beaten the Government by the employers&#39; organizations that the Government consented to make provision for three Judge. to deal with this question; but, after having passed an amending Bill through Parliament in order to absolutely prevent the Court from dealing with the matter, Cabinet refused to appoint the two additional Judges. As a consequence, the question of hours could not be considered for nine months. The Bill provides a further amendment of section 18a, which will enable an appeal to be lodged from an award delivered by one of the Deputies. The difficulty in this regard will be this: No appeal can be heard until at least some time has elapsed - it may be&#39; three months - and in the meantime employers and employees will become accustomed to the new conditions provided in the award, and if the employees are satisfied with the hours it fixes, they are not likely to accept a varied award as made by the Appeal Court. In any case, there is no power to compel them to do so. This &#39;provision for appeals from the awards of Deputies will prove not only costly to the parties, but also cumbersome. The Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> suggests that no award should come into operation until three weeks or a mouth after delivery, during which time an appeal may be lodged. But that would simply make the process more cumbersome and unwieldy. </para>

                            <para>- I am in agreement with any method that will investigate, from a scientific or social stand-point, the question of the hours of the workers ; but the trouble is that, although our Government may investigate such a question, they will not go any further in the matter. For instance, they have already declined to carry out the recommendation made by a Commission, comprising representatives of the employers and employees, which was appointed to investigate the question of the basic wage. If a Commission were appointed to deal with the question of hours from a health point of view, or to consider how long men can work, what speed they can attain, and what their productive power may be under varying conditions of work, I am afraid that the Government would not carry out any conclusion arrived at. Similar investigations have been made in America and Great Britain, in the latter country notably by Lord Leverhulme, who is of opinion that, after a man works for six hours, his productive power declines so that it does not pay the employer to work him any longer. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that they do in some instances. I would welcome the appointment of any tribunal to settle the question of hours, but if it recommended that the working week should be forty-four hours, I am sure that the Government would not accept the finding. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was amended in order to provide for the appointment of two Deputies to deal with hours of work, the Government displayed extraordinary reluctance in respect to making the appointments, and I hope that if the Bill before us is agreed to the Government will not similarly hang up the appointment of further Deputies, at any rate, not for another nine months until another deputation of employers&#39; organizations waits upon them. If the Government would appoint two Deputies for the unexpired term of the  President  of the Arbitration Court,  namely, six and a half years, and another two Deputies for at least three years, the congestion now existing in Court would be very quickly overcome. But it would be a fatal mistake to take Justices from the High Court or a Supreme Court, and ask them to arbitrate in respect to a couple of cases only. I hope that care will be exercised in the type of men selected to fill the positions. There are many men in the Commonwealth with long experience of arbitration matters who could do the work with conspicuous ability, and I have not the slightest doubt that if such men are chosen the present congestion will be considerably lessened. I opposed the passage of the Industrial Peace Bill, but I believe that the provisions of that measure which enable the parties to disputes to come together in councils and local committees could be applied with advantage to the arbitration system. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not bring employers and employees together under an independent chairman for the purpose of settling a dispute. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. A compulsory conference can be called upon the application of one of the parties, but that is about the only provision in the Act which meets the position that I am putting forward, that employers and employees ought to be able to come together, as they can under the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act. I am sure that if similar provision was made in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act there would not be the congestion which now exists in the Arbitration Court, and that a great number of the cases which now occupy the time of the  President  of the Court would be disposed of by the parties themselves. </para>

                        <para>.- &#91; regret that this Bill has been brought a in at such a late hour of the session, and that it is not possible for us to deal with the principal Act. &#34;We have had a lot of work this session, and possibly the Government have not been able to give the matter sufficient consideration, but it is time that we came to some definite conclusion in regard to the powers of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The expense to which the community is put in connexion with the hearing of claims before this Court is preposterous. The Constitution states clearly that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court can deal only with disputes of an Inter-State character, but there is hardly a calling of any description in the Commonwealth whose employees are not endeavouring to bring it within the purview of this Court. We have the anomaly of State Courts dealing with certain industries, and having their awards  overridden by those delivered by the  President  of the Commonwealth Court. Some persons are constantly demanding the amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution to enable the trouble in this regard to be overcome, but I am sure that it can be done more easily in this Chamber by clearly defining the industries that are to come within the purview of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. </para>

For how long is it proposed to appoint these Deputies ? </para>

                        hughes  (Bendigo- Prime Minister and Attorney-General) &#91;12.38&#93;.  -  I quite appreciate what the honorable member has said, but some security of tenure must be offered, and it should not be so short as to afford no inducement to responsible and suitable men to accept engagements. I quite see that in these days, after the Washington Conference and the settlement of the Irish question, we can never know what may occur; still, I think there is &#34; life in the old dog yet.&#34; Industrial disputes will not readily die out. I believe that the business of the Court will require this assistance for a good long while, and, therefore, subject to what the Committee may say, I am of opinion that the Government ought to have power to appoint these Deputies for the unexpired balance of the President&#39;s term. If the Committee desire a shorter period, let us take a vote.

                        charlton  (Hunter) &#91;12.40&#93;.- In the second-reading debate reasons were given why this clause should not be included in the Bill. As I explained, I and others on this side are really opposed to this clause, and to section.18 of the principal Act, and I think it would be as well if the Prime Ministerwould, as he has power to do, propose that that section be eliminated, thus leaving the matter of the standard hours to one Judge. This, I think, would meet with the wishes of all who are interested. After all, prior to the last amendment of the Act, which was made when the times were considered to be abnormal, one Judge performed this duty, and I see no reason why we should not revert to that plan. If we agree to the amendment of the Act now submitted it will result in prolonging the hearing of cases, because there will always be an appeal from one side or the other.

                        <para>- That is the very argument I used in support of my view on a former occasion ; there have been very few cases determined in that way, but there may be more in the future. Possibly out of the sixty cases now pending some twenty or thirty may have reference to hours, and if these cases are heard before one Judge, with the right of appeal, that right will surely be availed of, thus involving a rehearing and additional expense. </para>

                            <para>- As the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> pointed out, it is possible that a decision by one Judge to reduce the hours to forty-four may on appeal be reversed, and forty-eight hours made the rule. Such a reversal cannot fail to give rise to a good deal of dissatisfaction, because men are not likely to be willing to return to forty-eight hours after having worked for some time on a basis of forty-four. Altogether, I think the Prime Minister would be acting wisely if he deleted this clause and allowed one Judge to settle the matter; otherwise, this Bill is badly required, and will have my support. </para>

                        <para>. -  I shall be very glad to meet the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> in any way, because I am certain that his desire is to attain the very object the Government has in view, namely, the smooth working of the industrial machine. It is undeniable, of course, that two questions stand out as the main causes of industrial disputes - one is the question of hours, and the other the question of wages, though, of course, there are others. But the honorable member is wrong in supposing that the great number of cases heard before the Court now have reference to hours. While wages are ever, as it were, trying to adjust themselves to a new level, hours, until quite recently, seemed to have found a settled and .permanent basis. For many years in this country, after the principle of the eight-hour day had been established, things apparently were on a satisfactory footing. If ten cases come into Court, it is quite wrong to say that all have relation to hours, though there may be six or eight of them, and these might be settled by arrangement between employer and employed. However, the best answer to the honorable member&#39;s argument is the fact that the  President  of the Court, with all his experience, says that if we insist on maintaining three Judges, as now, he cannot go on; and the remedy he suggests is that now before the Committee. </para>

                            <para>- What I understood was that the  President  was of the opinion that if three Judges were required in order to settle hours, then he could not carry on unless these Deputies were appointed. I admit that I had not seen the  President  to speak to since last January, but we then discussed the position of the Court generally. He wished to know whether it was our intention to create any more Tribunals under the Industrial Peace Act. On that point the Judge desired certain assurances, which I gave him. Now we have his assurance that the proposed amendment will be of very great benefit, and the Court will work more smoothly and expeditiously. The hours of labour ought not to be continually in a state of flux, so that no one. knows from one day to the other what is going to be the standard in Australia. It would be a very good thing if some Court laid down, once and for all, what are to be the standard hours for a period of two or three years at least, and thus put, an end to this uncertainty and confusion. No one man can settle all industrial details in Australia; indeed, I do not think that one man- should have the right to do so. No one is a more stalwart supporter of the privileges or rights of tie people than I am, but I do not admit that forty-eight hours  k  too much for men. In all but a few industries, which can be counted on the fingers of my right hand, it fs not too much. As to mining, I do not offer any opinion, but I can say that in some mines forty hours may be far too much, in others not enough. But the great bulk of the workers of the country are engaged in work that I myself could do in a forty-eight hour week without fatigue; and what I can do others can do, and probably better. For men engaged in rock chopping, sewer mining, mining at great depths or under bad conditions, and some other strenuous occupations a working week of forty-eight hours may be too long, but by and large it is not too much. The honorable member for Hunter has suggested that after one Judge has awarded a week of forty-four hours there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth if, as a result of appeal to the three Judges, the .workers have to revert to a forty-eight hours&#39; week. That would be only natural. But the point I wish to make is that if I, as one of the   Deputy  Judges, awarded forty-eight hours per week, and an appeal were lodged, I would  suspend the operation of the award until the appeal had been heard And in 99 cases out of 100 that will be done. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member can get such an .amendment carried through this .Committee I shall have no objection. I think any Judge will decide that while his award is the subject of an &#39;appeal its operation should be suspended. Whilst I desire to meet the wishes of the honorable member for Hunter, I reluctantly have to refuse his request that this clause should be struck out. </para>

                        <para>.- I urge the Committee to hasten slowly, or the title of the Bill may become a  misnomer, because the effect of the measure may be, not to conciliate and settle industrial disputes, but to create continual strikes. The Minister may suggest that what I desire might be done by regulation, but I think it would be better to deal definitely in the Bill with the subject of appeals. Personally I am opposed to the giving of the right of appeal in arbitration matters. An arbitration finding should be &#39;final in regard to the case that is dealt with. Generally an arbitration award is a compromise, and that compromise having been arrived at, effect should be given to it. If the right of appeal is given, there will be no end to the decisions; a case will be taken from Court to Court, until ultimately it is won by the party having the longer purse. While it may be possible to arrange for appeals from decisions regarding rates of wages, I am satisfied that no system providing for appeals from findings on questions of hours would be satisfactory. If one Judge decided that the hours worked by a set of employees should be forty-four per week, and on appeal, four months later, it were held that forty-six or forty-eight hours should be worked, there would be a strike against the enforcement of the judgment of the higher Court. In no case, moreover, could a finding in respect of hours be made retrospective. I would prefer to allow to stand the provision to which we  agreed  last year rather than have it altered in the way suggested, unless an award be made inoperative if appealed against until the appeal has been heard. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and therefore I would prefer the law to stand as it is. The question of hours is so important that if we are to continue our present unscientific way of determining it, there should be three Judges to hear any case in which it arises. If, however, we dealt with it in the way in which it is beginning to be dealt with in all large manufacturing countries, that is, on a scientific physiological basis, the evidence that would be brought should be sufficient to enable one Judge to give a satisfactory decision; one that would satisfy not . merely those immediately concerned, but also the public. </para>

                            <para>- I would apply it to the basic industries. In certain outdoor occupations it matters little whether a man works a couple of hours more or less in a week, but in indoor industries, especially in certain trades and manufactures, employment for more than a certain number of hours per week has been proved by the experience of the last seven years to affect detrimentally, not merely the output of the workers, but their general health and civic fitness. This Parliament has for months been considering a Tariff to encourage manufactures, and it is therefore the more important that means should be provided for properly determining questions of hours and conditions. We know what is being done in this direction in Great Britain, in Germany, and in the United States. During the war there was appointed in Great Britain the Health of Munition Workers Commission, whose work has since been taken over by the Industrial Fatigue Research Board, whose function it is to do what we in Australia are asking Judges to do, namely, to determine facts which are ascertainable only by scientific investigation. Fatigue is not to be judged merely by the sensation of tiredness. As has been proved during the past seven or eight years, it manifests itself by a diminished output. That is the first sign of overwork. Several big manufacturing concerns in Great Britain are employing continuously at big salaries scientific investigators, whose work it is to determine the number of hours for which each particular employee can best be kept at his job. In this way it is being found possible in many cases largely to reduce running costs by not working men after their output begins to decline. In rural occupations the health of the workers is not affected detrimentally by a slight extension of hours, but in big city workshops, where men are attending to machines, fatigue develops more quickly. In such occupations the application of some scientific method is desirable for determining the number of hours than can best be worked. At the present time the question of hours is settled on the mere <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of a Court before which little scientific evidence has been placed. The proper settlement of the questions of hours and conditions will have a decided effect on the national health. For the present I should like to see the settlement of these matters intrusted to a Court of three Judges, without appeal; but I hope that in the near future methods closely analogous to those which are being employed in other parts of the world, particularly in connexion with big manufacturing industries, may be adopted. The Commission of which I have just spoken says in its report that - </para>

                        <para>.-I hope that the Committee will reject the clause. One reason for voting against it is the fact that the learned legal luminaries in the Chamber have expressed greatly differing opinions as to its effect. To my mind, the last explanation of the Prime Minister in regard to it was as clear as mud. I have had experience of industrial litigation, and I have always found it to be the general feeling of employers and employees that there should be no right of appeal, because what is needed is finality. Parliament has already referred to three Judges the decision of the question of hours. To that I do not object. What is now proposed is to allow one Judge to determine an application respecting the number of hours to be worked and to give a right of appeal from his finding. That will mean the trying of the same case twice over, when there is already the machinery by which it can be settled in the first instance. The Prime Minister says that the provision has been put before Parliament because the  President  of the Arbitration Court thinks tha.t the method proposed will expedite business. I realize that that gentleman was appointed to the position he holds because of his special fitness and ability, and I have the greatest respect for him ; but even Judges are not infallible; and I think that he suggests a course which would mean two hearings of a case instead of one, and would create great dissatisfaction, because, as a general rule, the loser of the first hearing, whether employer or employee, would be sure to appeal. It would be better to let both sides know that if there isa question of hours to be settled there is a Court of three Judges available to determine it. Let us not provide for an appeal which is unnecessary, and which should be avoided in the settlement of industrial disputes. </para>

It is known colloquially as the Commonwealth Coal Control Act, and is, technically, an exercise of powers conferred by the War Precautions Act Repeal Act. Unless this Bill is passed the existing measure will expire on 31st December of this year, but the coal proprietors and the miners desire an extension of it for another year, and, in pursuance of that generally expressed desire, I am moving to continue the legislation for  the  period named. </para>

Section 7 provides that the War Precautions Regulations controlling the registration and activities of companies and -firms operating within the Commonwealth shall continue until the end of the present year. This Bill will extend their operation until 31st December, 1922, but not in their entirety, because it is proposed to limit their applicacation so far as they affect firms, a matter which can easily be dealt with by the various State laws dealing with the registration of firms, and to continue the regulations for the extended period so far as they relate to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. </para>

Under the WarPrecautions Repeal Act 1920, it is an offence to register in Australia any company with capital partly or wholly subscribed outside the British Empire, except with the consent of the Treasurer. Since the beginning of the current year, authority has been issued for the registration in the Commonwealth of twenty-seven foreign companies with a total subscribed capital of, approximately, &#163;13,500.000 sterling. The bulk of this capital has been found in the United States of America. Seven of the companies, with a subscribed capital of about &#163;3,500,000 sterling, have been established to carry on industrial and productive operations iu the Commonwealth, two to conduct fire and marine insurance business, and eighteen to carry on trading operations. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, we are leaving the registration of firms to be dealt with by State laws. All we propose to do now  is to continue the regulations so far as they relate to foreign companies and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. The . Treasury and the Crown Law Department have for some time had under consideration the question of submitting to the Commonwealth Parliament a comprehensive measure dealing with company law under the present constitutional powers. But at this stage it would be impossible to bring such a big Bill before the House. We are now simply asking for an extension for twelve months of the Commonwealth control over these corporations. In the meantime the matter of exercising more complete control over them can be taken into consideration. </para>

                    <para>The other part of the Bill deals with the repeal of section 19 of the War Precautions Act Repeal Act, which requires the agents in Australia of all overseas companies and firms to furnish particulars regarding the business of their principals to the Collector of Customs in the State in which their chief place of business is situated. These particulars include the name, address, capital, and balance-sheet of the company or firm. But under the Companies and Firms Acts of the States all companies and firms carrying on business in Australia in their own names are required to be registered, irrespective of whether their head offices are established in Australia or abroad. The effect of section 19 has, therefore, been to require companies and firms already registered in Australia to be practically re-registered with the Department of Trade and Customs. This obligation has imposed a great deal of trouble on firms, and strong objection has been taken by British companies, especially to the provision requiring them to furnish particulars of their financial position to their agents in Australia for submission to the Department of Trade and Customs. Having given consideration to these representations, the Department found it practically necessary to suspend the provisions of the section, and in. the circumstances they have come to the conclusion that it would be better to repeal it. The Bill provides for its repeal. </para>

Provision was made that, on a request from the member so resigning his seat, the issue of a writ to fill the vacancy should be delayed until after the declaration of the poll of the election he was contesting. It was not provided that if he did not succeed in winning the Federal election his seat in the State Legislature should be kept for him, but that defect was remedied in 1917, when the State law was amended by the following provision: - </para>

                            <para>- There are, however, two States in which the Bills have been reserved for  His  Majesty&#39;s Assent, presumably on some constitutional ground. Our Electoral Act made the provision that a State member desiring to be a candidate for the Federal Parliament must resign his State seat fourteen days before the nomination; and the Bill before us maintains that position. I should like to draw attention to one or two anomalies that may arise under the legislation of the States; and here I may say that I am satisfied that this Parliament has the constitutional right to make any electoral law it desires. </para>

                            <para>- No; the disqualification is exactly the same as before. However, let us suppose there is an election for the Federal Parliament, and that there are three candidates, one, the State member who has resigned his State seat, the retiring Federal member, and another candidate nominated&#39; from outside. Let us further, assume that the outsider wins, which, of course, is quite probable; and then what is the position? If there- happens then to be a vacancy in the Parliament of the State, the Federal member is not eligible to contest it because it is given back to the man who had resigned to contest the Federal seat,&#34; and did not succeed. Let us take another case. We have heard a great deal of talk about parliamentary salaries, but I venture to say that &#163;875 a year in New South Wales, the allowance of a State member, is infinitely better than- &#163;1,000, the allowance of a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. Let us assume that certain , members of the New South Wales Parliament decline to contest a seat in a Parliament which meets in Melbourne, against which city there is much complaint because of the climate, and so forth, and because they regard &#163;875 as a member of the New South Wales Parliament as preferable. One State member, however, may favour Melbourne, and decide to contest a Federal seat. He may win it, but if he is defeated, his State seat remains to him. The whole position is ridiculous. However, I shall not &#34;stone-wall1&#34; my own Bill, but simply move the second reading. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot put them right by means of this Bill. Although the States have passed the legislation described, I do not think that we here are doing right in preventing State members from, being candidates for this Legislature. When I was a member of the State Parliament in New South Wales, I had no desire to become a. Federal member, but my constituents requested me to do so, and, thereupon, I resigned my seat, throwing all into the melting pot. Had I been a, member of a State Legislature I should have opposed such legislation as they have passed in this connexion, but, at the same time, I submit that we are not justified in retaliating with a drastic measure of this kind. </para>

I can quite understand a Federal member on the platform opposing State legislation of the kind, but beyond that I think we ought not to go. If State members desire to compete against me, they are welcome to do so, and if they can succeed they will have been perfectly justified. </para>

                        <para>.- I regard the action of the various State Parliaments in making it possible for their members to contest Federal seats and yet retain their State seats, as not fairly playing the political game, and as. indeed, a very dirty action. However, two wrongs do not make a right. I am satisfied that we will act unwisely, and place ourselves in a false light before the people of Australia, if we pass this Bill. THe measure increases the disqualification on men who desire to stand for election tr this Parliament, and I doubt whether that is constitutional; but whether it <inline font-style="italic">i?</inline> constitutional or not, I am opposed te legislation of this character. We cannot, have the avenue to our National Parliament obstructed in any way. </para>

We are not really concerned with the motives that animated the action of the State Parliaments except in sofar as that action may directly concern our own powers and duties. Whenever an opportunity offers I shall widen rather than restrict the avenues which permit candidature for membership of this Parliament. I hope I shall never be a party to restricting the right of any individual to come here. I do not propose to examine the motives of the State legislators, and I do not intend to vote for a Bill which, apparently in a paltry spirit of retaliation very unbecoming the Australian Parliament, intends to rid members of this Parliament of any competition. We can afford to welcome competition from whatever source it comes; and if members; of the State Legislature desire to stand for this Parliament, it is their affair and not ours. This. Bill, however, is very much our affair, and I shall oppose it. </para>

                        <para>. -  I point out to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that the law of the Commonwealth since its inception, or, at any rate, for the past fifteen years, has been that a member of a State Legislature who wishes to offer himself for election to the Commonwealth Parliament should resign his seat fourteen days before nomination. There has been a concerted move on the part of the State Parliaments to undermine by covert means that legislation. The Commonwealth &#39;Parliament now proposes to assert its undoubted right to prescribe the qualifications of those who seek entrance to it, and to preserve the conditions which have existed until now, without question, so far as I have ever heard, by the electors of the Commonwealth or of the States. I have taken part in many political campaigns, in some as a principal, and I have never been questioned by an elector as to the power which the Commonwealth has maintained almost from the beginning in this matter. The arguments which led to that provision being placed in the Commonwealth Electoral Act are as sound now as they were the day they were passed by this Parliament. What we are asked to do to-day is not to make a new law, a &#34;retaliatory&#34;  ora&#34;  mean and paltry &#39; &#39; law, as the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> describedit, but to preserve the law as it has prevailed throughout the history of the Commonwealth. There is one phase of the question, to which attention may be called. When the electors send a man into the State Parliament, it is to do State work. How can any one justify the contention that a man so elected to discharge State duties may throw over the State electors and contest a seat in the Federal Parliament, thus depriving the State electors who originally elected him of the right of pronouncing judgment on his conduct ? It is our duty to preserve the rights of the electors rather than the rights of State members-. If the Commonwealth Parliament thinks that that restriction should be removed, it is the authority to remove it. But we should resist, with all the power we have-, any attempt on the part of StatePaliajnents to prescribe the qualifications of candidates for this Parliament. That, undoubtedly, is the right solely of this Parliament. </para>

Four of the six State Parliaments have made provision that although their members may resign in order to contest Federal seats, their State seats shall remain vacant until the Federal election is over. If a State member, who has resigned, is not. successful, he automatically returns to his seat in the State Legislature. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the State Parliaments have made the seats of their own members safe according to State laws, and have endeavoured to, at the same time, keep within the four corners of the Federal law, so that, if a State member who contests a seat is successful, he can hold the seat. A number of members of this House, and, I dare say, many of the outside public, inferred from the question I put to the Prime Minister that I wished to deny the right of the State member to have his seat safeguarded while he contested a Federal election. That was not my policy, and I intend to vote against this Bill. I did ask the Prime Minister if the State Parliaments made provision for their members to contest a Federal election without forfeiting their State seats, he would be prepared to make provision for Federal members who desired to contest seats in the State Legislatures, to have their Federal interests safeguarded in the same way. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to put before the House two phases of this proposal. It is clearly laid down in the electoral law that no person can occupy the dual position of member of  the  House of Representatives and member of the Senate, and that principle was embodied in the Commonwealth electoral law, which provides that a State member must resign his seat fourteen days before nominating for a seat in the Commonwealth Parliament. That is,I believe, a wise provision. All the State Parliaments have passed certain legislation, not identical, but of similar purport, to allow State members to retain their seats while they are soliciting the suffrages of the Commonwealth electors. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> know that a resignation which is not to have effect is not a resignation. Under the electoral laws of both the States and the Commonwealth, immediately a resignation has been received by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> if it is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> the seat of the retiring member is declared vacant, and any qualified person in the community may then nominate for the vacancy. But that is not what is proposed under the new State laws. The resignation is to be a mere formality. It is to be held in abeyance by the Speaker; if the State member who is contesting a Federal seat is successful, effect is given to it; if he is not successful, he simply resumes the seat which he occupied before he nominated for the Federal Parliament. </para>

This Bill does not impose any new disability; it is simply giving affect to the Constitution, which requires a State member to resign <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> his State seat fourteen days before nominating for this Parliament.  Another  unfair advantage will be given to the State member over other possible competitors for the same seat in the National Parliament, and from personal experience I know what the effect will be. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> is in the fortunate position, financially, of representing a metropolitan constituency, an election for which does not involve much travelling or expense. But I ask him to consider the vastly different conditions  in  a country electorate, where electioneering involves  :ravelling hundreds, and in some cases  thousands, of miles by railway and other means. If one of the candidates is a State member, he will hold a railway pass, and that&#39; will give him an unfair advantage over his competitors. A candidate who is neither a retiring member of this Parliament nor a member of the State Parliament will have to pay his fares wherever he goes. </para>

                            <para>- The Railways Commissioners call upon a defeated candidate a few days after an election to return his pass, so that it may be given to his successor. A member who resigns his seat has to return his pass immediately effect is given to his resignation. I think it would be unfair to place a handicap ,on men contesting Federal seats, especially in large country electorate?, where a great deal of travelling has to be done. In my view, we should give effect to the intention of the framers of the Constitution, and make it impossible for a man to be at once a member of a State and the Federal Parliament. </para>

It seems to me that the measure is a saving-of-seats proposition, and has been rightly described as the &#34; S.O.S.&#34; of the Government. The people should have the widest choice iu electing representatives to this Parliament. I always realized the injustice when a Government worker, being required to resign my position to contest a parliamentary election; it is an absolute restriction to the attainment of a higher degree of public service and citizenship. I will, as far as possible, endeavour to remove all such barriers. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not in favour of restricting the choice of the people in the election of representatives to this Parliament, and, therefore, I shall vote against the Bill, even though the State Parliaments may have found a way of circumventing the intention of the Federal authorities that a State legislator should not be a candidate for Federal honours. As a sportsman, I wish the field to be as wide as possible, because the greater the competition the more valuable the victory. If I am defeated by an opponent who is a member of the State Legislature,  obviously my  services  have not been altogether satisfactory to the electors, and I must bow to their decision without complaint. But if I am chosen against the competition of a State legislator, my victory is the more meritorious. In Tasmania, when a vacancy occurs in the State Parliament, a by-election is not held, but a recount is made of the votes cast at the last general election, and the next man on the list is chosen to fill the vacancy. We have  there group electorates, each returning six members, elected by preferential voting on a system of proportional representation, and the seventh man is chosen without a contest to fill any vacancy arising through the resignation or death of any <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> the elected members of a, group. Therefore, it seems to me that the proposed legislation will not do what it is intended to do, because, if a State member stands for a Federal constituency and is defeated, he will have the right, although he has resigned his State seat, to take it again, being preferred before the candidate next below him on the poll at the previous State election. But, in any case, I desire, as I have already said, that the &#39; people shall have as wide a choice as possible. The proposed legislation seems to me retaliatory, and likely to be resented by the States. It may create a feeling between the members of the State and Federal Parliaments which we do not wish to create. </para>

                    <para>Parliaments may have done, we should not follow a bad example. In Tasmania, under the proportional system, members are elected in groups, six for each division. At one time, when a* State member resigned his seat to contest a Federal constituency, he accompanied his letter of resignation with a request to the Governor in Council that the State by-election which the resignation would render necessary should not be held until after the Federal election. Then, if he lost the Federal contest, he had a chance of regaining his State seat. But as it was found that the frequent holding of by-elections tended to upset the balance of representation secured at the general election, it was decided not to hold by elections, and to fill any vacancy with the candidate next on the poll after the six which had been chosen for any group. </para>
                    <para>In no circumstances, therefore, is the retiring Federal member given a chance&#39; to contest the State seat. We are not here, however, to serve our own personal interests. We have to take a broader view of these matters. It might be very convenient for us personally to render it impossible for A, B, and C, who have seats in the State Parliament, to run against us. A State member certainly has a great advantage over, a Federal member if he chooses to take* opportunity by the hand. Those of us who represent distant States have to be away from our electorates for mouths at a time while the Federal Parliament is in session. On the other hand, a member of the State Parliament is constantly moving amongst the people, and it is very easy to put forward the suggestion that the Federal member is rarely in his division. The fact that the Federal member is attending to his duties in this Legislature is often overlooked. I have no reason to complain, because I have not suffered in that direction; but I know that the seats of many Federal members have been undermined in their absence. Having regard to all the facts, however, we cannot properly cut into the broad, general principle that the people should have the widest choice in the selection of their representatives, and for that reason I cannot support this Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- Before setting out briefly the grounds on which I oppose this Bill, I wish to congratulate the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chanter)</inline> on the excellent case he has put up on behalf of those who support it. I cannot say that I agree with the statement made by him, that this is really an attempt on the part of the Government -to safeguard the rights of the people, and to observe the spirit of the Constitution. In my view it is a deliberate attempt to debar members of State Parliaments from entering this House, and would, therefore, restrict the choice of the people. As the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Making has said, this might well be called &#34; A Save Our Seats Bill,&#34; and I hope that it will be rejected. I am not going to cast a vote to restrict the choice of the people or to impose any obstacle in the way of a member of a State Parliament who desires to offer himself for election to this</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Legislature. There are a great many excellent men serving the people in the smaller sphere of State politics. If they desire to enter the Commonwealth Legislature, or if the electors desire that they should represent them here, those men should have the right to submit themselves to the will of the people without having to resign their State seats. If that were not allowed, then the people might be deprived of the services of such men in both State and Federal politics. I regret that it .should have been considered necessary for the State Parliaments to pass an Act requiring, any of their members who proposes to stand for a Federal seat to put in a &#34; make-believe resignation.&#34; It should be unnecessary even to &#34;make-believe.&#34; The Commonwealth Electoral Act should be so wide as to enable State members to contest Federal seats without resigning or pretending to resign their membership of the State Parliaments. A member of a State Legislature could not be returned to this House unless a majority of the electors in the division for which he stood determined that he should represent them. </para>
                    <para>The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> in moving the second reading of this Bill, said that members of the New South Wales House of Assembly were receiving &#163;875 a year, and were really in a better position than are members of the Commonwealth Parliament, who receive &#163;1,000 a year. I recognise that from a financial point of view they are better off; and, while I admit that &#163;1,000 a year is an insufficient allowance for a member of this Legislature, I do not think that any member of Parliament has sought election merely because of the allowance attaching to membership. I am convinced that the majority of the members of the State and Federal Parliaments have sought election only because of a sincere desire to serve the people. We may not all look at political questions from the one stand-point; but I do not think the members of either the Federal or any State Parliament have been moved to seek election merely to secure the allowance attaching to membership. One honorable member  has said that it might be advisable to provide for members of this Parliament contesting seats in the Legislatures of the States without having to resign. I do not think, however, that any member of the National Parliament would willingly retire from Federal politics for the sake of entering a State Legislature. If there are any who would do so, no obstacle, such as resignation from this Parliament before seeking such election, should be placed in their way. An important point was touched upon by the honorable member for Riverina, when he pointed out that State members contesting a Federal seat receive their parliamentary allowance up to- the date of election, whereas as soon as this House is dissolved, Federal members cease to draw their allowance, although their Federal duties continue up to the very day of election. That is not an argument in favour of this Bill; but it is certainly an argument in favour of a further amendment of the principal Act, so that Federal members shall be paid up to the date on which they go out of politics, either voluntarily or by the will of the people. I feel sure that the good sense of the House* will prevail, and that this Bill will be rejected. I am convinced that its sole aim is to prevent members of State Parliaments from standing for election to the Commonwealth -Parliament without running the risk of losing their State seats. This is not, as has been urged, a Bill designed to carry out the spirit of the Constitution or. to protect Commonwealth rights. It springs from a spirit of retaliation, and its object is only to safeguard the privileges of members of the Federal Parliament by restricting those of members of the State Legislatures. </para>

                        <para>.- T propose to offer a few observations with regard to this Bill, which gives rise to a question with which we shall be faced whenever the next general election takes place. A man who enters into competition with others, whether it be in business or in sport, should be satisfied with a fair handicap. If a man, in his desire to represent the electors, would impose an undue handicap on his competitors, he is not fit to hold a seat in Parliament. Under the State law any person holding an office of profit under the Crown is not eligible for election. For instance, a member of the Public Service must resign in order to contest a seat. Honorable members talk of &#39;the honour and glory attaching to membership of a State Parliament ; but it seems to me that the recent State legislation, under which a State member may seek election to the Federal Parliament without resigning his seat, is about the most &#34;one-eyed &#34; and &#39;hungry law of  which I have heard. If a member of. a State Parliament desires to enter the Commonwealth Legislature, or the Parliament of any other State, he should be prepared to give his opponent an equal opportunity. Both should start off the one mark. The State member should resign, just as a public servant is required to resign his position before he can be returned to a State Legislature. It is just as well that we should analyze the so-called &#34; broadness of mind &#39; &#39; which some honorable members have said is displayed in the State legislation bearing on this question. No one can honestly say that it has been&#39; passed because of a desire on the part of the State Parliaments to widen the choice  of the people. Its sole object is to give State members an advantage over others seeking election to this Parliament, and at the same time to make a close corporation of the State Parliaments. I can well understand the Opposition being almost unanimously in favour of such legislation, because months before a general election they have a pre-election ballot, and know who is to be their candidate in each electorate. </para>

                            <para>- Then, in fairness to the honorable member, he should not be entitled to oppose him without resigning his seat in the State Parliament. The honorable member might vote to-morrow to bring about the defeat of the Government, and if he were successful, with the result that a dissolution took place a fortnight hence, surely having taken that action in all good faith, honestly desiring to do the best for the people, he should not be opposed by a member of a State Parliament who has done nothing to risk his seat, and who, if defeated, would continue to sit in the State House. My opinion is that if a thing is worth having it is worth fighting for, and that a State member who wishes to stand for a Federal division should be compelled, first of all, to resign his membership of the State Parliament. Under the pre-selection system adopted by the Labour party they know in every case who is to be their candidate, and are thus able to direct all their forces against his opponent. That, however, is not the position of every party. We might have a case in which the retiring Federal member was opposed by a State member and a man not in politics. If the outside man were elected, the State member would continue to sit in the State House, and the retiring Federal member would be the only person disadvantaged. Thus it is clear that the State Parliaments are not willing to give Federal members a chance to fight on equal terms with them. A State member seeking election to the Federal Parliament should have the courage to resign. I am not supporting the Bill because I wish to restrict the choice of candidates for Federal seats, but because I wish to put all candidates on an equal footing. When I was fighting the Kalgoorlie byelection twelve months ago, there would have been a dozen members of the State Parliament willing to contest the seat, except that they did not have the courage to resign their State seats. If a man has not the courage to resign a seat in the State Parliament to contest an election for the Federal Parliament, he is not fit to occupy n. place in this Parliament. All my life I have been preaching equality of opportunity, and I propose to vote for it now by according my support to this Bill. </para>

                        <para>. -  I oppose the Bill. I know that, looking at it from a personal  stand-point, I should support it; but I have good reasons for my attitude. One reason that is uppermost in my mind is that the action taken by the State Legislatures - and in the Bill before us - is, as it were, the - scum that comes to the surface in the political copper, revealing some of the inner selfishness which is so manifest in political circles. Why should we do wrong because the States do so? The other day the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> was blaming the press for bringing politics into disrepute, and there was a certain amount of truth in what the honorable member said. But such spectacles as we have confronting us today certainly do more than anything else to bring politics into disrepute. On the one hand, members of State Parliaments are engaged in an endeavour to make bettor jobs possible for themselves while risking nothing; and on the other hand we, who are holding fairly good positions in this Parliament, are seeking to do exactly what the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> said just now the State Parliaments were attempting to do, namely, to make their Legislatures a close corporation. Such, spectacles also tend to make the electors become more and more apathetic, because of the all too-evident selfishness displayed by those they send hero to represent them. &#34;We often hear people say, &#34; You are only there to get* what you can make out of your position &#34; ; and if we seek to make our positions safer by preventing the fullest competition we shall always expose ourselves to such an accusation. It is said that if this Bill is not passed, the action taken by State Legislatures will make it easier for members of State Parliaments to be elected to the Federal Parliament. But I am rather inclined to support the Bill for that very reason, although my personal opinion is that we do not want in this House new members who. have been in politics for a considerable time, and that it is an advantage to have fresh men coming in who are not adepts at camouflaging their real opinions and steeped in political cunning. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; and I am pleased to see that the Queensland Government has tackled the question of the Upper House. I hope that the New South Wales Government will follow suit. I am looking at the matter, however, from the point of view of a South Australian. The Commonwealth, Parliament is the National Parliament. Neither the Queensland nor New South Wales Legislatures can be so regarded. It is an expensive and difficult matter to fight a Federal election, particularly  a3  I had to do on the last occasion; pushing my  &#39; bike &#39; &#39; through a huge electorate. I oppose the Bill because I can see that it prevents Labour men winning the smaller districts represented in the State Parliament, and ultimately using their gold passes to enable them to fight the larger Federal seats. I can see more Labour men coming into this House by this means. Honorable members opposite have the money to enable them, to fight elections; Labour men have not the money to enable them, to do so. Here will be their opportunity to fight Federal seats. Across the chamber the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has interjected that a Minister of the Crown in South Australia has been chosen to oppose me at the next election, the suggestion, of course, being that this gentleman will continue to draw his Ministerial salary whilst he, is contesting the seat. I do not claim that this would be fair, especially as during the two months&#39; campaigning I will receive no parliamentary allowance. In any case, it would be but further evidence of the selfishness of the. State Parliaments. But I have already had to fight, two Ministers of the Crown, and I do not mind fighting a third. At any rate, I do not propose to do&#39; anything to limit the choice of candidates for the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                        FOWLER  (Perth) &#91;4.251-- I do not wish to approach the proposition submitted by the Government in any personal spirit, and I think I shall be free  from the charge of doing so, because it is a very weak argument to .put forward that a. member of the State House is in a. better position than is a member of the Federal Parliament in fighting a seat for this House. If a member of the State Parliament has the right to come forward and fight an election against a sitting member of. a Federal House, I do not think he is likely to .commend himself to the electors by hanging on to his State seat while undertaking to win a Federal seat also. A State member with any spark of honour or fairness in him would resign his seat if he wished to fight fairly and squarely a Federal election, for one reason as much as another, because he would feel that the electors would resent his coming forward as a candidate for a Federal seat while he was still a member of a State Parliament. I do not think that any member of the Commonwealth Parliament would be in the slightest danger of being beaten by a candidate who, being a member of the State House, could fight the election without first having to resign his State seat. However, I want to try to find the principle underlying the Bill. The Electoral Act states that certain persons may not sit as members of the Federal Parliament, and are nob even eligible to nominate as candidates. It is proposed that a member of a State Parliament shall be allowed to nominate for election as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, but no one suggests for a moment that any member of a. State Parliament, while still holding that position, should be allowed to: enter the Federal Parliament. It would be preposterous to suggest that a member of a State Parliament could also&#39;, while holding that position, come into this Parliament. My principle, therefore, is simply this: that if a person is not eligible to take a seat in this Parliament, he is not eligible to contest an election for this Parliament. It is a. piece of hypocrisy to say that a person disqualified from taking a seat in the Commonwealth Parliament should be allowed to contest an election for this Parliament, or even to nominate as a candidate for such an election. The position is so obvious that there is no getting away from
                        <inline font-style="italic">h,</inline>
                        and to pretend that our existing Act limits the choice of the public is sheer nonsense. John Smith, member of the State Legislature, is as free as any one else to contest a Federal seat if he resigns a position, which makes it impossible for him to get into the Federal Parliament, even if lie is elected, until he does resign. It is undoubtedly a self-imposed restriction. If a man chooses to hang on to a position which makes him ineligible, why on  earth  should this Parliament be asked to open a door to him that Ave do not open in every direction

                        There are certain persons who are not eligible to sit in the Federal Parliament. For instance, a bankrupt or a criminal is not allowed to nominate. If we desire to be consistent we certainly ought to give such persons the right to nominate.

                            <para>- Quite so; I concede that there are good and worthy men who become- bankrupt through no fault of their own, and whose membership would probably be an advantage to any Parliament. But we exclude bankrupts, not only from Parliament, but from contesting a seat. If we allow a person any special privilege, simply because he is a member of a State Parliament, we have no right to refuse to any constituency the right to select, if they chose, a bankrupt, for instance. There is only one way of deciding this matter, and that is to say that a person who is not eligible to sit in this Parliament shall not be eligible to contest a seat. But it is proposed to say to a man, &#34; No, you are not eligible, under certain conditions, to sit in this House, but you &#38;re still eligible to nominate and contest a constituency&#34;; and that is an absurd and impossible position. We must do one the ug or the other. The present law is sometimes evaded in practice. I know of cases in which a State member, holding a secure position, has  resigned, a dummy taking his seat until after the Federal contest. If that candidate happens to he defeated, he takes his old State seat ; the dummy, who is &#34; under thewhip,&#34; has no alternative but to do what he is told, sliding out. It will be seen that there are ways of evading the Electoral Act as it stands. </para>

                        <para>.- I understand that in some of the States, if not in most, while State members propose to safeguard themselves in contesting Federal seats, they do not extend the same safeguard to their own State public servants in the case of State elections. A State public servant must resign his position if he wishes to become a candidate. Before this Parliament accedes to a proposal to allow State parliamentarians to hang on to their seats while contesting Federal seats, those State members should at least put their own house in order, and extend similar facilities to their public servants. As to the value of a State member as against a Federal member, when it is a question of selection by the people for a Federal constituency, I have not yet seen the State member against whom I should be afraid to take my chance. But it does not much matter what are our views as to the relative importance of State and Federal members - that is a matter for the people to decide. I support the Bill for the reason I have already indicated. Until State members of Parliament extend a similar privilege to the public servants in their jurisdiction, I, for one, will keep them where they are in relation to the Federal Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members are aware that a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into and report upon the taxation  systems of the Commonwealth, and States, and to recommend such amendments of the law as are necessary to remove anomalies and place taxation on a more equitable basis. This Bill is intro&#176;duced to give effect to such  recommendations  of the Royal Commission as it has so far made modified in such manner as I shall indicate, and to make such other amendments as &#34; this opportunity offers and the circumstances warrant. </para>
                    <para>The definition of &#34; absentee&#34; has been altered so as to exclude a resident of Papua. This is one of the alterations required to exempt the residents, of the Territory from the taxation of incomes derived from sources therein, and it is considered that this relief should be granted in order to encourage settlement in Papua, and leave the income fully available for taxation by the governing authority of the Territory. The Royal Commission made no recommendation upon this point. </para>
                    <para>Another matter in regard to which the Royal Commission made no recommendation arises out of a case recently brought before the High Court in connexion with State income taxation. The Court decided that there is no assessable income arising from the sale of a business as a going concern. In order to prevent the application of that decision to Federal income taxation, an amendment has been drafted which provides that such income shall be assessable. </para>
                    <para>I come now to a matter of considerable importance upon which many representations have been made inside and outside this House, and in regard to which the Royal Commission has not yet reported. I refer to the demands made by members of co-operative societies&#39; that they should foe free from taxation in respect of rebates paid to them by the societies on the amounts* of their purchases. Provision has been made as desired, the Bill  exemping  any rebate received by a member of a co-operative society, based on  purchases from that company, when it is one that usually sells goods only to its own members. </para>
                    <para>Clause 2 provides a new definition of trading assets, and is inserted in order to make it clear that such assets do not include live stock used as working animals or for breeding purposes. This definition is in favour of the owners of working animals or stock used for breeding-purposes, because the profits from the sale of them will not be taxable. It is to be noted that, whilst the present practice -of the Department in regard to what are known as walk-in and walk-out sales is preserved, the amendment will place the pastoralists in a better position in regard to sales of working animals and breeding stock. </para>
                    <para>The method of assessing income on the basis of previous years has given rise to more criticism than, perhaps, any other feature of income taxation. It has been argued in this House, and outside, that this method is unfair, especially to the primary producer. It has been pointed out that a primary producer who, in the year 1917, had a taxable income of &#163;8,000, in 1918 an income of &#163;3,000, and in 1919 an income of &#163;1,000, and is taxed in each year on the amount he received in the previous year, pays in the year in which he had an income of &#163;1,000 taxation on the previous year&#39;s income of &#163;3,000, and in the year in which he had an income of &#163;3,000 is taxed on an income of &#163;8,000. It was suggested that a fairer basis would be to average his&#34; income over a period of years. My late right honorable colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> when delivering his Budget speech, announced the intention of the Government to introduce legislation providing for such a system. That the Bill does. I direct the attention of honorable members to the principle that is laid down. The Royal Commission on Taxation dealt with this matter very exhaustively. It considered the system that has been in. vogue in Great Britain for a considerable time, and the objections to it that have been raised. On page 10 of the Commission&#39;s report it says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Our inquiry has led us. to the conclusion that harsh, and inequitable incidence in the case of widely fluctuating incomes, when each year is  strictly segregated from its neighbours, is inseparable from any system of income tax in which steep graduation is a feature, and that escape from the inequity of such a tax can best be secured by a breaking down of the wall of partition between the years, by some method of merging or averaging, which substantially mitigates - if it does not wholly remove - the cause, viz. : - the unsound  assumption that each year&#39;s income or loss standing alone must determine taxable capacity, whereas the circumstances require that the longest period practically possible be brought into account. When as many years and as many vicissitudes as is practically possible are brought into line through merging or averaging the annual incomes, the true taxability of the subject - that is, his taxable capacity - can be fairly determined. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It must be noted that the British system, which adopts the average income over a period of three years, has given rise to considerable criticism, not because of the adoption of the averaging system, but because the basis of liability is assumed to be identical with the measure of taxable capacity, which it is not. Therefore, in order that the inequity of the present system shall be removed, whilst at the same time having regard to those practical requirements which are inseparable from any taxation system, the Commission has recommended for adoption the following principles: - A quinquennial period is taken, and it determines the rate of tax; but the amount of tax is determined by the actual income received in the year previous to the assessment. I may explain what I mean by taking for convenience, because the calculation is easier, a triennial instead of a quinquennial period. In the year 1917 a man had, say, an income of &#163;8,000 ; in the year 1918, an income of &#163;3,000; and in the year 1919, an income of &#163;1,000, or an average income for the period of &#163;4,000 per annum. If he were taxed on his average income, he would be taxed on &#163;4,000, although in the last year of the period his income was only &#163;1,000. Therefore, the Commissioners recommend that, in order to treat the taxpayer equitably, and to have due regard for the circumstances of the State, the rate of tax shall be determined in accordance with the average income over a period of five years. Reverting to my illustration of an income during a triennial period, the taxpayer would be charged for the year 1919 on an income of &#163;1,000, at the rate per &#163;1 fixed for an income of &#163;4,000. Let us suppose, for the sake of example, that the rate of tax on an income of &#163;4,000 is 5s. in the &#163;1, and that the rate of tax on an income of &#163;1,000 is 2s. in the &#163;1 :in the case which I have given as an &#34;illustration, the taxpayer, whose income in the year 1919 was &#39;&#163;1,000. would pay tax on that amount, not at the rate of 2s. in the&#163;1, but at the rate of 5s. in the &#163;1. He would pay 5s. in the&#163;1, but would pay only on his actual income for that year, viz., &#163;1,000. The average income for a quinquennial period determines the rate of tax, but the number of pounds on which that rate is paid is the amount of the actual income received during the year for which the taxpayer is assessed. </para>
                    <para>I come now to another matter of first importance, that of double taxation. </para>
                    <para class="block">Until recently, persons in Great Britain whose income is drawn both from sources in the United Kingdom and from sources in Australia, paid taxation on the whole amount; but as the result of a conference in London, at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> was our representative and put the case with admirable lucidity and force, the British law has been amended, and a rebate equal to half of the tax is now granted. A man in Great Britain who has an income from Australia receives a rebate on an amount equal to the sum of the Australian taxes, Federal and State, where that is not more that half of the British income rates, but where it is greater than half, the Government of the United Kingdom rebates half of its tax. On the other hand, a man domiciled in Australia who receives income from Great Britain and also from sources in Australia, gets a rebate from the British Government, but receives none from us. We wish, however, to make an arrangement which will materially lighten the taxation of those thus circumstanced.

                    <para class="block">The long and short of that arrangement is that where the British tax is greater than the Commonwealth and State rates combined, the taxpayer will pay in the aggregate only the British rate, but where the combined rates exceed the British rate he will pay only at the combined rates. The higher rate will always be charged, and the lower tax will be wholly rebated. There will be no adjustment between Governments. The Commonwealth will not have to make an adjustment with the States or with the United Kingdom, nor the United Kingdom with the Australian, authorities. The whole matter will be arranged by the Taxing Commissioners. The assessment in the case of the United Kingdom will take note of the liability to taxation under Commonwealth laws, and, in the case of the Commonwealth, of liability to taxation under the British law, and the rate of tax will be fixed accordingly. What the effect of the arrangement will be may be shown by an actual case. A taxpayer residing in the United Kingdom, who has a taxable income in the United Kingdom of &#163;44,436, and draws from the Commonwealth a taxable income of the same amount, pay British taxation at the rate of11s. in the &#163;1, which would come to &#163;24,440, and Commonwealth taxation at the rate of 7s. 7d. in the &#163;1, which comes to &#163;16,849- a total of &#163;41,289. But he is given a rebate of &#163;12,220, on one-half of the British tax. </para>

                            <para>- I am informed that the rebate is allowed in the United Kingdom in connexion with the super-tax. At the present time the taxpayer whose case I am citing gets a rebate of &#163;12,220, and, therefore, pays taxation in the United Kingdom amounting to &#163;12,220, and &#163;16,849 in the Commonwealth, where he gets  no rebate, the total tax paid by him being &#163;29,069. Under this Bill, however, he will receive from, the Commonwealth s rebate of &#163;4,629, so that, instead of paying &#163;29,069, he will pay &#163;24,440. That would be the effect of the application of this rebate to a concrete case where the taxpayer at present gets the rebate in the United Kingdom under the arrangement which was made, and under which we art in honour bound&#39; to reciprocate. Tht arrangement was on a reciprocal basis but owing to the fact that we have not hitherto provided for it, the taxpayer has only had the benefit of a rebate in England but not here. This will pui him in a better position, and require him to pay &#163;4,629 less by way of taxation than he now does. The Royal Commission recommended that the Commonwealth Government should grant such relief as would avoid double taxation, but did not indicate how that relief should be granted. It may be said, however, that the proposals which I have just outlined are generally in accordance with its reccomendations . This Bill, of course, provides only for relief to be given by the Federal Department of Taxation. A full adjustment of the matter will not be effected until the State Legislatures also arrange to rebate a portion of their cwn taxes. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>I come now to another matter of considerable importance. Clause 6 of the Bill which amends section 14 of the principal Act provides for the exemption oi a shareholder in a company from income tax in relation to any profit which is not the result of the ordinary trading of the company - for example, profit on the sale of a fixed capital asset, or the amount by which the value of a fixed capital asset may be written up. </para>
                    <para>Another important provision in the clause is that which exempts profit arising from the sale of a mining property where it is sold by a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> prospector  or by a person who does not make a business of buying and selling properties. Where such a person purchases a property from a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> prospector, and works the property in a proper and efficient manner, that property will be exempt from the tax. The Government hope that this will prove beneficial to the country, and that it will be an encouragement not only to prospectors, but to mining ventures in the early stages of their development. It may be mentioned that this amendment follows the lines of one recently introduced by the Government in the Legislature of Western Australia in relation to its own income tax. That Bill has not yet become law. </para>
                    <para class="block">The last portion of clause 6 deals with a matter of considerable importance, and protects the revenue in cases where it needs protection. It provides that where any trading asset passes, by gift, the in- &#39; come of the donor shall include the market value of the asset. That is to say, where in any statement of accounts a trading asset appears, and is transferred by gift, then the income of the donor shall be liable for the market value of the asset. The amendment will check what appears to be a growing practice. Under the law as it stands at present, a. business owner who makes a gift of trading assets would not; of course, show the value of the assets in his trading account as stock on hand at the end of the trading period, nor would he show it amongst his sales. He would, nevertheless, show it among his purchases. Such action would operate to reduce the profit on the sales of the year, and so result in avoidance of tax. There is no hardship in the course proposed, because it is intended merely that where money is included in the accounts for the purchase of goods, their value should be shown by proper contra entry when the goods pass out by gift. </para>
                    <para>Clause7 of the Bill arranges merely for the transposition of certain words in order to make the meaning of the principal Act clearer than it is at present. Under a recent judgment of the High Court, it appears that a taxpayer could deduct from his income all losses and outgoings incurred outside Australia. That was not intended when the Act was passed, and has not been the practice of the Taxation Department. The amendment makes it clear that the losses and outgoings must have been actually incurred in Australia. Sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> repeals a provision of the law which exempted gifts made, during the continuance of the war, to patriotic funds. The law in this direction has ceased to operate, and the portion of the Act referring to it might now well be deleted. The last part of the clause provides for an increase of the deduction for children from &#163;26 to &#163;30. Clause 8 effects, as recommended by the Royal Commission, an increase from &#163;100 to &#163;104 of the general exemption applicable to persons having no dependants. </para>
                    <para>I come now to another important clause. I refer to clause 9, which is to impose income tax upon profits derived by ex-Australian principals from the sale of their goods in Australia. Honorable members perhaps have had their attention drawn to a practice which is becoming common, and is notorious in the case of one particular company where an Australian branch house is believed to be debited by the foreign house for goods at a price which leaves little margin for profit on the sale of such goods in Australia. These allegations have been made from time to time in this House. It has been said that one company in particular has resorted to some such method in order to escape the Australian tax. The proposed new section will give the Commissioner power to assess and charge tax upon what appear to be the real profits. Honorable members can follow that provision quite clearly.

                    <para>The matter of Appeal Boards, which will interest honorable members, is the next subject with which I have to deal. Honorable members are aware that one of the questions that engaged the attention of the Royal Commission on Taxation was that of creating Tribunals, other than a Court, to deal with numerous cases under the Income Tax Act in which taxpayers dissent from the decisions of the Commissioner, but for various reasons are unable or unwilling to assert in a superior </para>

                    <para class="block">We are, therefore, making provision for the appointment of Boards, and, as suggested by the Commission, we shall start by appointing only one. As many more can be created as the circumstances demand. It is estimated that each Board will cost &#163;10,000 per annum. It may be necessary, ultimately, to have as many as ten Boards, so that in that event the expenditure in respect of them would amount to &#163;100,000 per annum. Let me now point out the relief that is provided for under this Bill, and in the Act itself. Where questions of law arise, the taxpayer has the option of appealing to the High Court or to the Supreme Court of a State. Where a question of fact is involved, he can appeal to one of these Appeal Boards. When it is a question of law and of fact, he can appeal to the Board in regard to the fact and to the Court as to the law. But he has the option of appealing to the High Court or the Supreme Court of a State on questions of law, and he can go to the Court on questions of law and of fact; but he can go to the Tribunal only on questions of fact. There is one class of cases which neither the Tribunal nor the Court can deal &#34;with. I refer to cases of hardship, which are specially provided for&#62; and which will be heard, as now, before a Tribunal composed of the Taxation Commissioner, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Comptroller-General of Customs. </para>
                    <para>I do not know that there are any other clauses to which I need specially direct the attention of honorable members. When we go into Committee, we can discuss such points as are of importance, and I shall then supply honorable members with any further information they require. This measure has been introduced to give effect to the promises made by the ex-Treasurer. <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and follows the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Taxation. Where it deals with matters not yet reported on by the Commission, it follows the generally expressed desire of honorable members and taxpayers. It is hoped that the Bill will improve our taxation machinery, although it must necessarily continue to fall short of what we desire, since much of the trouble arises from the clashing and overlapping of State and Federal Tribunals or taxation schemes. But that is a matter for which tha Commonwealth can hardly be held responsible, because we have always been ready to come to any arrangement that will enable the taxpayer to have one taxation form. Personally, I think it would be a good thing for this country if there was only one tax gatherer. </para>

                            <para>- The amendments outlined by the Prime Minister will effect improvements in several directions, particularly the amendment which deals with co-operative societies, which, however,, does not go far enough. The trouble; * which exists to-day in regard to these, societies is that we ask their members who, already pay income tax on their earnings to also pay income tax on the periodical rebates made to them by their societies. The Rochdale co-operative system, .which was inaugurated in England, and subsequently established in New .South Wales, provides methods by which bodies of workmen may band together and run business for themselves. It is true cooperation. The members who hold shares in a society buy the commodities they require from the society, but, instead of the lowest possible price being charged for those commodities, the members are called upon to pay for them a price which is equivalent to the current rates charged elsewhere.  It is  necessary to do this in order to enable the business to have sufficient money in hand to meet any emergency. In a large business one never knows what may happen. However, at the- end of every three or six months, as the case may be, whatever surplus is left over after running the business is distributed among the shareholders in the form of rebates, and an amendment in this Bill provides that in future these rebates shall not be taxed. My regret is that the Government have not seen fit to make the provision retrospective. In fact, several of these amendments could easily have been made retrospective. I am sure that Parliament never intended that a body of men who band together should be obliged to pay tax on what they may receive through the distribution of any surplus made in their co-operative movement, particularly when they have already paid individually income tax on their earnings. If I. go -to Anthony Hordern &#39;s, in Sydney, and get a rebate om a big purchase, the allowance made to me in that way is not subject to income taxation, but if I happen to be a member of a co-operative society and get a rebate in the way I have&#39; described at the end of six months, I am taxed upon it. An effort has recently been made by the Commissioner of Taxation to collect income tax on all rebates distributed from as far back as 1916. As a matter of fact, the matter has. been held in suspense, and the tax has not been actually collected, because recently a deputation waited on the ex-Treasurer  to place the position before him, and he came to the conclusion that it was wrong to tax these rebates, and he therefore asked the Commissioner to refrain from collecting taxation upon them. The Deputy Commissioner in New South Wales&#39; had been pushing the members of co-operative societies to pay tax on rebates received for the previous five years, and this amending Bill, while it will  exempt  these rebates from taxation in future, still leaves it open to the Taxation Department to collect tax on these past rebates, although we declare by this Bill that it is wrong in principle to do so. The shareholders of these cooperative societies, being ignorant of the fact that they were liable to pay tax on these rebates, had not included them in the returns of their income, but &#34;quite recently the Deputy Commissioner in New South Wales informed them that they would be obliged to furnish returns of all rebates received by them since the passing of the Act. </para>

                            <para>- To illustrate the. absurdity of the position, these members of the co-operative societies whose shares are in the names of their wives will escape taxation, while- those men whose wives happen to have put the shares in husbands&#39; names will find that the rebates they have received will be regarded as  income  upon which they will be required to pay income tax. There is no equity in this, and I ask the Government to give careful consideration to the aspect of the question I have put forward, and see if they cannot make this amendment retrospective in its application. </para>

                    <para>Many co-operative&#39; societies have increased their reserves for the purpose of adding to their businesses or in order to provide additional accommodation. The money so utilized ought not to be taxed. It belongs to the members who have already paid tax on their earnings. These societies are not earning income out of this expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- No. A company, being a speculative concern, is on quite a different footing from a Rochdale cooperative society. It is provided in the amendment to which I have just referred that the societies who are to benefit by the exemption must confine their operations to their own members. There are very few of these societies which sell to non -members, and in order to get the benefit of the provision they will be obliged to got rid of their non-member customers ) but I cannot see why they should be compelled to pay tax on the money they use in extending their businesses. The shareholders have already paid individually income ta.x on whatever they have paid into the societies. It is always, claimed that it is the duty of a Legislature to encourage co-operative principle, and in all walks of life a great improvement would be effected if cooperation were to come into general use ; but here we hamper the movement. If a society, instead of giving back &#163;1,000 to its shareholders out of the surplus it has earned after paying working expenses, devotes the money to the erection of additional accommodation, the Taxation Commissioner claims income tax upon it, whereas if the &#163;1,000 were distributed in the shape of rebates to the members it would not be taxed under the amendment included in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>When we come to the question of the averaging system, it appears to me from what the Prime Minister has said that we take the average of three years in order to fix the rate of tax. A man with an income of &#163;5,000 in one year, &#163;3,000 in the second year, and &#163;1,000 in the third will be taxed on the average yearly income of &#163;3,000. In the last&#39; year, of course, considering his low income, the tax will be comparatively heavier, but a good year may follow, for which he will pay less in proportion. Whether this method will prove of any great benefit is questionable. </para>

As to double taxation, I do not consider it to be fair.

                    <para>I now. wish to refer to a matter with which the Prime. Minister did not deal. It is proposed by this Bill to raise the exemption in the case of single persons from &#163;100 to &#163;104, representing exactly &#163;2 a week. At present, for every &#163;5 over &#163;100, the exemption, in the case of single persons, is reduced bv &#163;1, and under the Bill for every &#163;3 over &#163;104 the exemption is reduced by &#163;1. It will be seen that by the time &#163;130 is reached the taxpayer is in exactly the same position that he is to-day, whereas, with an income over &#163;130, a single person becomes very much worse off from a taxation point of view, because, instead of getting any relief, his taxation is increased. </para>

                            <para>- Tes; and I have always complained of the taxation imposed on single persons. The exemption is far too low, and the proposed amendment doe3 not at all meet the case, but rather makes the position worse. A single person may earn from &#163;150 to &#163;200, and all income over &#163;130 will be more heavily taxed than now. I was under the &#39;impression that it- was proposed to give relief to single persons, but that is not so. Personally, I believe that the exemption should, be largely extended; at any rate, in view of the high cost of living we ought to considerably increase it. When the Income Tax Assessment Act was passed in 1914-1915, the purchasing value of the sovereign was much higher than to-day, and we then made the exemption &#163;156 in the case of single1&#39; persons. The Act was amended during the war, when we were endeavouring to get as much revenue as possible, and the exemption was made &#163;100. In my opinion, it would be only a fair thing to make the exemption at least &#163;200. </para>

Single men cannot now get board and lodging under 30s. a week, and, allowing for washing, purchase of clothing, and other expenses, an exemption of &#163;200 is not too high.

                            <para>- Yes; there is an exemption of &#163;26 for each child under sixteen, years of age; but in New South Wales the exemption is &#163;250, with an allowance of &#163;50 for each child. Taking into consideration the purchasing power of money to-day, I suggest that an exemption of &#163;300, with an allowance of &#163;60 for each child, would be a fair thing; and., in Committee I intend to move accordingly. </para>

All these matters ought to receive consideration at the hands of honorable members; and it is no use our waiting for any further reports. The ex-Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> stated that we would have the final report of the Taxation Commission before we finally dealt with this Bill ; but the Prime Minister has now told us that almost every recommendation of the Commission has been adopted in this measure. That conveys to me that, whatever legislation we pass now will probably stand for two years or more; and as the people outside are clamouring for a considerable increase in the exemption, we are not justified in accepting the Bill in  its present form. </para>

I am glad to see that an amendment is proposed in regard to bonus shares, because many people in the past have escaped taxation in this respect, especially during the war. Companies have made . huge profits, and after distributing good returns to shareholders, have accumulated large surpluses, which have been allotted to shareholders in the form of what are called &#34; bonus shares.&#34; This means that a man holding shares in a company was allotted bonus shares in the ratio of, say, 1 to 10 : at any rate, in this way income taxation has been evaded. </para>

As I have indicated, I shall take action in Committee to test the opinion of honorable members in regard to amendments which I have foreshadowed, and I shall try, if possible, to make the amendments retrospective in regard to co-operative associations. I realize that I cannot obtain all I desire, however strong my opinions may be ; but I hope to see the Bill emerge from Committee a very much improved measure. </para>

                    <para class="block">Royal Commission, we may see numerous instances of the inequalities that have obtained in the past. On page  5  of the report there is a table giving striking figures in connexion with the grazing industry. In one case, amanwho,in seven years, made a net profit of  &#163;56,000,  paid in Federal tax  &#163;60,000,  or  &#163;4,000  more than the income. This was quite apart from Stateincome tax. In the case of a city man, however, whose income over that period had been a steady  &#163;8,064  per annum, the Federal income tax amounted to only  &#163;13,299.  &#39; Similar inequalities are shown throughout the report. I am prepared to abide by the decision which the majority report recommends, namely, that the system of averaging the rate of income tax, as explained , by the Prime Minister and outlined in the Bill, shall be adopted. I realize that it cannot affect steady, regular incomes, such as salaries, nor will it be nearly so equitable or just as the averaging method, with an allowance for suspense credits. </para>

                            <para>- It comes to much more; but the inequalities will be nothing compared with those in the past. The Commission explained that if this method were adopted it would inevitably lead to a great increase in. the expenses of the Taxation Department. As we are in fairly desperate straits financially, the primary producers, although not exactly satisfied, will be very much more pleased with what is proposed by the Government than they are with the present system of taxation. The Taxation Commission recommended that two canons - certainly as to what the taxpayers will be called upon to p.ay, and economy in administration - will be better fulfilled by this method than by any other that has been suggested. In those circumstances, we are prepared to support this measure in the main. </para>

                    <para>I think the definition of &#34; primary producer &#34; should be more explicit, so that there may be no possibility of an actual primary producer being excluded from the benefits to be conferred by the proposed amendment. In regard to doubletaxatiou,I welcome the relief that this Bill will bring ; I think it will have a very beneficial effect in promoting an influx of capital to assist in Australian development. With regard to the amendment dealing with companies trading outside the Commonwealth, who, by reason of various devices, have been able in the past to escape the payment of income taxation - as, for instance, the various oil companies to which reference has been previously made - I am glad that at last the Government are taking steps to stop this leakage. All I regret is that this proposed amendment is not to be made retrospective, as, apparently, some other provisions in the Bill are to be, so that some of the money that has been lost might be recovered. </para>

I would like it to be raised to approximately the allowance made in the New South Wales Income Tax Assessment Act. If the Department has any statistics regarding the amount of taxation that would be lost by the adoption of, say,  &#163;50  per child, such information would enable honorable members to better judge whether the finances of the country will permit of such relief being given to income-tax payers. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to confine my remarks mainly to the mining industry as affected by this Bill. In passing, I express my pleasure that the Government are proposing to liberalize the law in regard to co-operative societies, and the exemption for children. I think the general exemption of  &#163;156  is too low at the present time; but if the Government cannot see their way clear this session to raise it to  &#163;200,  I trust that in the near future they will introduce a proposal to that effect. An exemption of  &#163;50  per child would be only a fair consideration to extend to married people. </para>

                    <para>I am pleased that at last something is to be done to give more encouragement to the mining industry. The taxation of the proceeds of the sale of mining leases is no doubt legal, but it is none the less unjust. There is no resemblance between the sale of a mining lease, and the sale of an agricultural or city lease. In the two last-named cases the lessor receives his property at the expiration of the lease in substantially the same form as it was in when he leased it; often it is improved. But with a mining lease the case is the reverse. A mining lease is, in fact, only a licence to deplete the resources of a property by removing its mineral contents. The vendor of a mining lease parts with  it outright in exactly the same manner as does the owner of a. city property or a farmer who parts with his land. But the incidence of taxation affects those three classes of persons quite differently. The Government have taken note of the existing discrimination, and the proposal which they are submitting to the House will give a great deal of relief. I desire to remind the House of how the incidence of taxation has retarded mining operations during the last two years. After our soldiers returned from Europe there was n period of deep depression. But in Western Australia, there soon occurred one of those bursts of sunshine that are incidental to the mining industry, and people invested money in mining property very freely. Unfortunately, a period of boom followed, which did more harm -to mining generally than anything else could have done at that time. When the boom burst, and normal conditions were restored, people started prospecting for what they could honestly win from the earth, and not for the purpose of selling  to the public leases, many of which consisted of only four pegs in a valueless block of ground. Many of these men had been prospecting for many years, and when, their efforts resulted in the discovery of lodes or reefs, as they could not work them without capital, they thought it better to take the opportunity to sell. I mentioned recently the case of a man at Lake Austin, who, for twenty-five years had prospected in Western Australia, and at last discovered gold to the value of &#163;7,500. The taxation authorities took from him. &#163;4,200, so that more than half of the results of twenty-five years&#39; industry was lost. Another case is that of. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson,</inline> M.L.A., of Western Australia. Being an enterprising man, he thought that the iron deposits at Yampi Sound should be developed. He pegged out a lease and did developmental work. Later, he arranged to sell the deposits to the Queensland Government for &#163;30,000, of which he was to receive &#163;3.000 in cash, and the balance in shares. The whole of the amount of &#163;30,000 was treated by the taxation authorities as earnings, and he was taxed to the extent of nearly &#163;19,000. He had not handled more than &#163;3,000, and was not in a position to pay the &#163;19,000 that the Commonwealth and State Governments demanded of him. I am glad that the Government have at last brought forward a proposal that will give relief in cases of this kind. The money which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson</inline> received represented, not earnings, but conversion of capital. If a, man sell a house for &#163;1,000, the Department regards that as a conversion of capital; but the whole proceeds of the Yampi Sound transaction were treated as taxable earnings. Another case is that of a man who for fourteen years had been prospecting, and  at last struck a little gold at Hampton Plains. He sold his &#34;show&#34; for &#163;6,000 in cash and shares; but, as the vendor, be had no right to trade in the shares for a period of twelve months. He discovered that the tax-gatherers intended to take from him &#163;2.360 because he had found that mine. We want all the gold that can be won from the soil of Australia. That is why men of this type should not be discouraged; and the Government are to be commended for introducing this relief legislation. The man to whom I have&#39; been referring wa3 fearful that something might happen. Therefore, he did not bank his money, but carried it about with him. He was later notified of the amount of his taxation assessment, so he packed up, let his shares go for the time being, and went to New Zealand. He still has his money, and he has evaded the payment of taxation which the Commonwealth Government rightly considered to be due. But he had taken a certain portion of his payment in shares. These were assessed at their full valuation. They  were regarded  as part of his earnings; and, although they were worth, perhaps,  only  ls., the asses-mem was made at the rate of about &#163;1 per share. Before leaving for New Zealand he mentioned that if he had collected the same amount through Tattersalls sweeps, 14 per cent, would have been deducted by way of taxation. He contended that prospecting gave him about the same chance of drawing a prize from the soil as he would have had by regularly contributing to Tattersalls. I say that these prospectors are to be in every way encouraged. </para>
                    <para>Another case recently came under my notice in Western Australia. A man had been prospecting for twenty years, and the only bit of good luck he had had was when he struck a patch which returned him   400 ounces of gold. That was seven years ago. He sold the mine, in conjunction with three backers, for &#163;4,500. But the mine was in his name, although he possessed only a one-fourth share. He was assessed by the State taxing authorities to the extent of &#163;1,000, so that, eventually, his share was worth to him exactly &#163;78. The State Department had taken so much from him that there was nothing left for the Commonwealth Department, which also wanted to claim about &#163;1,000. These instances reveal the need for affording relief. As for mining companies, I desire the Government to consider the possibility of affording still further relief. They should regard a mining lease as a diminishing asset. It should be classed as a chattel, just as are the implements on an agricultural holding. </para>

                    <para class="block">I interpreted the resolution to mean that, if a person engaged in primary production is operating over a number of years, the losses sustained throughout the operations will be taken into account. I have previously mentioned the case of a man who, in his first year, made a profit of &#163;1,000; in his second year, a loss of &#163;2,000 ; in his third, a profit of &#163;3,000; in the fourth, a profit of &#163;500; and in his fifth year, a profit of &#163;1,000. I made calculations on the basis of the theory which I had in mind. Those showed that, calculated on the &#34;income from property basis,&#34; he would be taxed, on the sum of his first year&#39;s profits, to the extent of &#163;74 17s. 8d. In the second year, seeing that he had made a loss, he would not be required to pay anything. In the third year, there would be calculated the profits of his first and third year, making &#163;4,000 in all; from which would be deducted the loss in his second year, namely, &#163;2,000. That would leave a total of &#163;2,000, which, divided by the three years of his operations, would represent a profit for that third year amounting to &#39;about &#163;666. On that he would be required to pay &#163;34 in taxes. Calculating the other years on the same basis, he would pay a total for the whole period of &#163;177. Against that, he will be required to pay, in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, &#163;307. I do not know the views of members of the Country party, but I understand that they have agreed to accept the recommendations of the representatives of the primary producers upon the Royal Commission. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill does not give the full measure of the relief to which those who are engaged in primary production are entitled, but it makes some attempt to give effect to  a resolution which was carried in this House some time ago. I have shown how the incomes of those on the land are subject to fluctuation. Their handicaps are much greater than those of any other section of the community. It might be asked why should an exception be made in favour of the primary producer; why should not a concession granted to him be given also to the manufacturer, but a mere glance at the conditions under which the man on the land works will show that no comparison can be made between their respective positions. A manufacturer can always guard against a decline in the demand for his commodities, but a primary producer may be afflicted with a drought in one year, bush fires in the next, and a plague of caterpillars, or some other form of pestilence, a little later. He is affected by conditions which he cannot alter&#39; or guard himself against, and consideration should be given to this circumstance. I have referred to the case of a constituent of mine whose total income over a period of five years amounted to &#163;3,500.  His  income tax amounted to &#163;722, although his average income was only &#163;700 a year, but a man in receipt of a steady income of that amount, as many a professional man is, pays only &#163;140 in five years. Under the Bill the primary producer of whom I speak will pay &#163;307 a year, which, of course, means that he will get some relief, hut he will still pay more than twice as much as the man who gets as much as he does in five years, but draws it in equal annual amounts. I would like the Government, in dealing with cases  of this kind, to make proper allowance for losses. In the case to which I am referring, the first year&#39;s income was &#163;1,000, but in the next year a loss of &#163;2,000 was incurred. &#39; In the third year there was a profit of &#163;3,000 made. What should be done in a case like that, I think, is to add the profits of the first and third year and subtract the loss of the second year. The average income for the three years was &#163;666, and it is on that amount that income tax should be levied. Had the man whose case I am citing been dealt with in that way he would have had to pay only &#163;177 in five years. It may be contended that my proposal would mean a serious diminution of revenue. </para>

                    <para>The amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments is a reform long overdue. The system under which taxation is now collected is a wasteful one, and the Government should arrange with the State authorities to put an end to it, It is an old saying that what is every one&#39;s business is no one&#39;s business; but the Federal Government should move in this matter, and I * believe that if they set about things in the_ right way an amalgamation would be agreed to by the State authorities which would save much of the expense of collecting the taxes. Economy is much talked of, but seems honoured more in the breach than in the observance. I know, of course, that an amendment could not be moved on this Bill which would effect the amalgamation that I suggest, because nothing can be done without an arrangement with the State authorities; but I hope that this amalgamation will soon take place. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very sorry that the Government has introduced this important Bill so late in the session. A number of honorable members would welcome the opportunity to study the technical phases of a measure of this kind; but when one glimpses these clauses and compares the principal Act with the amendments that are proposed, it is plainly hard to understand not merely the verbiage of the measure, but its object and the motives of those who are responsible for it. As one who has had something to do with the later Commonwealth taxation Acts and the earlier State Income Tax Acts, I confess my inability to grasp the full meaning of these proposals at such short notice; and I think that unless the measure is urgent - certainly not all of it is urgent - it would be safer to lay it aside so that we may study it at our leisure and in conjunction with the proposals for amendment made during the debate. </para>

                            <para>- An impression is one thing, but the facts may be quite otherwise. I do not think it can be said with confidence that the Bill will affect this year&#39;s assessments, but it contains important provisions, and honorable members should have an opportunity to study them. I have endeavoured in the brief time that has elapsed since the Bill was laid on the table to arrive at an understanding of some of its provisions, and these I wish to discuss. I do not at all believe in the averaging of the income of primary producers, although I know that that is an unfashionable statement to make at the present time. The idea appears to be abroad that if the incomes of primary producers were &#34; averaged in accordance with some of the many methods which are possible, all the difficulties of the man on the land would be solved. I do not believe that, but in providing for the principle the Government are making, or are liable to make, two&#34; very important mistakes. The first of these is that they will remit a substantial  amount  of taxation. I do&#39; not know how much it will be. It is possible only for the expert officers of the Taxation Department to inform us, and the Minister should give the Committee  their  calculations before the clauses dealing with the average principle are disposed of. I think the effect on the revenue of the year in which the provision operates will be substantial, and I do not believe in this attempt to make remissions to one particular class of people. My own impression is that if this community can stand less taxation, and I believe we shall have to face that condition shortly, the taxation should be remitted, not to one section of the community, but broadly and equitably according to the circumstances of all taxpayers. In saying that, I do not admit that all taxpayers are .subjected to-day to equality of sacrifice. On examination it may be found that some deserve a heavier rate of remission than others ; but certainly one section should not be relieved while all the rest continue to pay as they have been doing. I speak now as the representative of a metropolitan electorate, but as one in whose constituency  there  are substantial rural interests, perhaps .as heavy as those in the divisions represented by honorable members who speak for the actual primary producers. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The statement is perfectly true, particularly in respect 01 those who are struggling in the low rain-belt areas of Australia. Not so much in Victoria - although the north-west would show the same relationship - but in South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia, and, possibly, in portions of Queensland, there are areas where men are struggling under conditions that sometimes strike with overwhelming force and cripple them. I would go so far as to say, with regard to those carrying on operations in. the low rainfall belts of Australia, that there should be some special arrangement for averaging their income. No such arrangement, however, should be made in respect of the whole of the farming territory of the Commonwealth. Let me take an example to illustrate what I mean. We have in Australia a great number of irrigators. The number, happily, is increasing year by year as water conservation and storage become more general, and are more fully appreciated. These men are not subjected to the vicissitudes of drought that the cultivators in the back parts of the States I have mentioned have to fight against. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. But the conditions vary. The Western District of New South Wales, for instance, is different from the Western District of Victoria, where the variability of the rainfall is slight, and the conditions of production are more uniform, and it would lie absurd, out of a sense of consideration for the men who have to meet the shocks of time and chance, to give these other highly favoured cultivators and pastoralists the same consideration that we give those who are struggling in the low rainfall areas. </para>

                            <para>- We could specify certain areas or rainfall belts, because the rainfall figures of recent years, as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tay</inline> for&#39;s map shows, indicate that portions of Australia with a low rainfall have a larger proportion of failure of actual rainfall than, the high rainfall districts. It would be perfectly safe, therefore, to take given belts with a rainfall pf S,  9,  or  10  inches and up to  12  inches, and give to the men in those belts a concession which we would not grant to the favoured people of the coastal belts, who do not need the same treatment. </para>

                            <para>- Caterpillars, locusts, and so on. There are quite a number of forces working against the farmer and the producer on the land, but they do not work equally against all classes of them. There are a great number of other people in the Commonwealth who are subject to forces which they cannot control. The honorable member for Hume suggested that the manufacturer, when met by a declining demand, can restrict his incomings and output. It is all very well for the honorable member to make that statement; but very many manufacturers and traders in this country have been hit by the re-active effects of drought and depression, over which they have no control. Take the country storekeeper in one of these drought-ridden districts of which we have been speaking. We find him assisting the land-holder, who is to enjoy this remission of taxation, whereas he, in his own turn, is to get no such remission. Surely, that is not fair. </para>

                            <para>- If that were the exact position, I should agree with the honorable member, but he must not imagine that the &#34;primary producer,&#34; as defined in this Bill - and there is a very narrow definition of the term - is the only man who can claim consideration at the hands of the tax-gatherer through the operation, of forces over which he has no control. </para>

                    <para>I say, therefore, that this is an invidious distinction in favour of one class of taxpayers, and is not equitable as between sections of that same class. It is also a premium on speculation. Yet no premium of a similar kind is given to speculators in other lines. Take the man who has a grazing area, freehold or leasehold, and engages in dealings in sheep or cattle. Under this Bill he is to get a remission of taxation; but his losses may be due to speculations in live stock. If a trader speculates - if, exercising exactly the same ambition and desire to get rich as the grazier who has been speculating in live stock, he overstocks and loses - he is not to get any remission of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- It may be; but, if so, it is a rare exception. I point out that, by this class of remission, we shall open the door to speculative results, so far as certain classes of people are concerned, whereas no other section of the community is to enjoy a similar consideration. I ask the House not to imagine that this Bill is going to bring about the millennium, or that it establishes a perfect system of taxation.It does nothing of the kind, and after it has been given a trial for a few years, either this or some succeeding Government will be endeavouring to patch up the mistakes that have clearly occurred through remissions of this kind which have been made. </para>

                    <para>Another matter dealt with in this Bill is the taxation of bonus shares. I understand that a distinction is being made with respect to two different classes of bonus shares. Bonus shares that are given in lieu of dividends out of accumulated profits are to be taxed; the others are not. There is a significant feature associated with this proposal. A dispute on grounds of principle has occurred between distributers of bonus shares and the Taxation Department, under the existing Act, and a test case has been listed for consideration by the Court. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a question of saving the country hundreds of thousands of pounds, but, rather, of interpreting the law. If the Court says that the resisting taxpayer&#39;s interpretation of the Act is right, it is then for the Government to say that it will ask for an amendment of the law; but while the existing law is being tested, I regard it as an evil principle for the Government to come down to Parliament with a Bill to settle all these issues before the Judge has a chance of considering them. </para>

                            <para>- The intention of the Act must be determined by the wording of it. In deciding such a question, we cannot have regard to what, for example, the responsible Minister said when introducing it, or to what was said by honorable members when debating it. The Court endeavours to read into the verbiage of an Act the motive and intentions which appear from its wording. Legal members of the House have explained that fact on many occasions. </para>

This Bill says that shares issued in such circumstances are liable for taxation.

                            <para>- I do not know that it is not retrospective. One of my first complaints on rising to speak was that it was difficult for a layman, and even for a student of income taxation, to grasp in a few minutes the very many technical provisions of a Bill like this, and that it was reprehensible that we should be asked to deal, in the closing hours of the session, with a matter that might detrimentally affect large interests throughout this country. May I give one illustration of this, and ask for an interpretation of clause 7 ? In the opening words of the clause, there is a change in the form of the wording of the principal Act. In comparing this clause with section 18, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> subsection 1 of the principal Act, honorable members will see a wonderful similarity in the actual language employed, but a difference in the order of the words. Already in Melbourne there is a large number of men who think that the alteration has been made designedly by the Taxation Commissioner in. order to get very much heavier taxation from certain interests than the Act has hitherto entitled him to collect. In calculating the taxable income of a taxpayer, the Act provides that the total income derived from all sources in Australia shall be taken as a basis, and that from it there shall be deducted - </para>

                    <para class="block">The words that Wave been transposed are &#34; actually incurred in Australia.&#34; They have been put earlier in the proposed new paragraph, and it is feared by the mercantile interests that a number of deductions formerly permitted will no longer be allowed. Take, for instance, the question of debenture interest. I do not dogmatize to the Minister in charge of the Bill ; rather do I submit this matter for consideration by the Commissioner of Taxation and the&#39; officers of the Treasury to see exactly what will be the effect of the transposition. There are a large number of big companies in Australia, some in the pastoral business and some in mercantile business, who have, raised debenture money in England, and the question, is whether the interest on those debentures is to be treated as a deduction in future, under the&#39; wording of this proposed new paragraph, as it has been in the past. These people claim that if it is not, the difference in the effect on taxation will be as from about 8d. in the &#163;1 to 2s. 6d. in the &#163;1, and this will mean,&#34; in the aggregate, a considerable amount on the vast sums involved, because, broadly speaking, millions of pounds have been advanced by Britishers as loans to corporations operating in Australia. I ask the Minister to carefully consider what effect the new provision will have on debenture interest, or any of the other outgoings formerly allowed as deductions? </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying that it is sound ; except that I say the mercantile interests likely to be affected are already experiencing considerable apprehension and concern as to the likely effect of this amendment. The Bill was submitted so late this afternoon that I have not had more than a casual opportunity of conferring with them. I do not think that wo should enact legislation in a hurry and repent it at leisure. It is not a scientific way of doing things. In any case, I ask the Minister to explain the object of the amendment, apart from the effect of the transposition of the words to which I have referred. I think I understand something of the operation of the old deduction provision, and I confess I cannot see any reason for the amendment. At any rate, we should be clear, before we assent to the clause in Committee, as to its object and effect upon the interests concerned. </para>

                    <para>I was about to deal with the matter of double taxation. I have not the report of the British Commission in which the Commonwealth Statistician participated, but from memory it appears to me that the wording of the clause in this Bill which deals with that aspect of taxation adopts the recommendation of that Commission. I assume that the Minister has satisfied himself upon that point, and. if so, I say that this is a decided step in advance in Empire taxation relationship that will do far more than we, perhaps, at the present time understand to increase the trading and financial interchanges of all parts of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- A Commission was appointed by the British Government, and the Dominions who had been complaining about this double taxation were asked to send representatives to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> was sent on behalf of Australia, and&#93; after - weeks of argument, because it was a knqtty question - we saw enough of it from our end to know that - when men got together from every part of the Empire, and began to see the complications and ramifications of the problem, to their surprise and pleasure they got to a settlement which was adopted with characteristic promptness by the British Government, and only needs this confirmation from us to become reciprocally operative. It appears to me that the wording of this clause adopts and renders immediately operative the remission system as between the Old Country and ourselves. </para>

                            <para>- I did not hear him on that point, and no doubt it is the intention of the clause, but we need to be quite sure - because it is a tangled problem - that the recommendations of the Commission are given effect to in this clause. Those traders who either spread abroad from Australia, to the Motherland, as many of our enterprises have done or spread from the Motherland to Australia, will welcome this provision as an act of statecraft that will be beneficial to every one concerned. Of course, it will mean a loss of revenue to a certain extent to both countries, and more so to Great Britain than to us, because of Great Britain&#39;s generosity in connexion with the arrangement; but still it will be beneficial to the Motherland, and indirectly the taxing officers of both countries will eventually get more money for their Treasurers with less harm than they would create by continuing the duplicate system that has unfortunately run ever since income taxation was first adopted in Australia. </para>

                    <para>I do not wish to detain the Committee further than to say that I hope proposals for relief, such as that which the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has voiced, by increasing the exemption, will not be pressed on this Bill. I would rather have seen this matter, the averaging provision and all other matters except the double taxation clause, which is not a class one, postponed until we can get a chance of understanding more fully the preliminary and final reports of the Taxation Commission. We have apparently lifted one recommendation out of that report for sentimental and political reasons, and are attempting to give it a hasty passage through this Parliament. But the best thing to do with the report is to have it sent in its final form to honorable members, and let it be deliberated on by them, and to let any reorganization of taxation that must be attempted in the near future follow the evidence submitted to the Commission. </para>

                    <para>I  urge the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> when the Government come together after the session closes, to impress on his colleagues the necessity of taking a review of the whole taxation sytem of the Commonwealth. I am quite sure that if we were to put the microscope on many of the things we did in finance during war time, none of us would like to perpetuate them indefinitely, particularly the incidence of taxation. I felt it my duty a little while ago to give some illustrations of how income and land taxation, was pressing on some of the primary interests of the country. If honorable members have time in recess to study the figures of the five cases I gave in the hurry of the moment, they will be astounded at the amount we take out of some incomes, to the jeopardy and eventual ruin of some of the abiding interests of the country. I urge that direct taxation shall be dealt with in a general way, and not piece-meal. Let us study again the principles that are operating in our system, and see whether we cannot find one more equitable to the Treasury and to the individual taxpayer, and more particularly to the producing, manufacturing, and exchanging interests of this country. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to support the .Bill, notwithstanding that I feel it is inadequate as an instrument for fairly collecting taxation from the people of Australia. I found it somewhat difficult to follow the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when he was introducing this Bill; indeed, I do not think he had a thorough grasp of the situation himself. He referred to a person receiving an income of &#163;8,000 in the first, &#163;3,000 in the next, aud &#163;1,000 in the third year, Of course, if the incidence provided by this Bill were, to commence operation in the third year, and go to the first year with its &#163;8,000, honorable members would recognise that such a taxpayer would be sorry that there had ever been an amendment of the Act; because, on the &#163;8,000 he would pay the tax applicable to &#163;8,000, or .53d. in the &#163;1, and on the &#163;3,000 year he would pay on &#163;5,600, while on the &#163;1,000 he would pay at the rate of &#163;4,000. Honorable members will see, therefore, why I say such a taxpayer would be exceedingly sorry that such a Bill had ever been passed. I repeat that the measure is altogether an incomplete instrument for the purposes desired and which it was hoped it would accomplish. All that the primary producer expects is mere justice. I follow the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt.)</inline> when he says that this law of average should apply to every taxpayer. In justice I concede that that is only reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- I understood the honorable member for Balaclava to say that this average method applied to only one section, and I think I am quite right in what I say. But there is certainly much more ground for applying this method to the primary producer than to any other section. The operations of the primary producer may be described as speculative, but I regard them as a necessary hazardous business that is in no way a gamble except to the person engaged in it. It is. an occupation that is highly in the interests of the country ; all our revenue is obtained from primary production, even the wages of the boy who sweeps our streets. Any man who goes out to develop the natural resources of the country &#39;and increase its fertility runs tremendous risks. However, I contend that &#163;1 is &#163;1 no &#34;matter who receives it, and we have taxation on one year&#39;s income. To one that receives the same income every year that does not matter ; but a primary producer runs risks from drought and in many other ways. He may lose on some years, and when he eventually strikes a prosperous period with good prices he is unreasonably taxed, taking into consideration his previous low returns. The same remarks apply to the miner and the prospector. The latter may spend &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 in searching for gold, and when he has found it to perhaps the same value after years of work he is fully taxed on it without any regard to his previous expenditure. Such a system is not in the interests of the development of the country. When a system of graduated income taxation came into force, the Socialistic idea was met, and there is no desire on the part of the primary producer to set it aside; the whole cause of the trouble of the primary producers arises from the graduated tax and the irregular income. If there were a flat rate the primary producer would have no ground for complaint. Whatever income he received he would pay on that flat rate: but, as it is, if after some bad years he strikes a prosperous year, the graduated scale results in 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, of his income going in taxation, although he badly needs the money to make up his  losses. If we devised a flat rate, that would solve the whole problem; but I take it that honorable members opposite would not agree to that. I appeal to them, however, on the grounds of equity and justice. </para>

                            <para>- But we want a system that will act fairly all round. However, this Bill is not an equitable instrument, but far from it. It is possible for two persons, each receiving &#163;10,000 over five years to pay in one case &#163;1,146 in taxation, and in the other &#163;520, a difference of &#163;626. Can it be an equitable system under which such a thing is possible? This, of course, may be an extreme case; but the fact remains that in the five years each of the taxpayers had an income of &#163;10,000, and &#163;10,000 is as valuable to one man as to the other, and, therefore, both should bear the burden equally. In tile case I have cited the income for the first year is &#163;4,000, the next year &#163;3,000, and the third year &#163;2,000, the fourth year &#163;1,000, and the next year nothing, or &#163;10,000 in the five years, and the. result is what I have said, viz., &#163;1,146; but reverse the figures so that a rising revenue will bel shown, when a tax of only &#163;520 would be paid. No one can call the present one a complete instrument of taxation. I regret very much that such an important measure as this has to be dealt, with at this stage of the session. It is for a mind of equity to devise a scheme equitable to all citizens who are equally able to contribute to the revenue? I should like the Government to pass this Bill - though,- after all, it is not entirely on the lines of the recommendation of the Commission - <inline font-style="italic">bub</inline> in such cases as I have cited, where obvious hardship and injustice are inflicted, let us give the Commissioner power at the end of five-year periods to make an adjustment with the taxpayer. </para>

                            <para>- I do, and it is one of the most scandalous features of the taxation system of this country that a man  who loses &#163;1,000 in one year, and makes &#163;1,000 in the next year, is taxed upon the income of &#163;1,000 although when the two years are reckoned together he has not made one penny. I repeat that I am sorry that the House is forced to deal with this Bill to-night. An amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act was promised nearly eighteen months ago and we should have received it earlier; but I accept the instalment of reform contained in the Bill, and hope that the Government, at a later stage, when the operation of these amendments has proved them to&#39; be inadequate, will bring down a more complete proposal. </para>

                    <para>I have before me the particulars of a case in which something like &#163;35,000 was invested. The profit over a period of seven years was &#163;12,330  -  an average of &#163;1,761 per annum, or less than 5 per cent., on the outlay. Had that income been&#39; received in annual amounts of &#163;1,761, the taxation paid in the seven years would have amounted to &#163;841, but because it&#39; was received spasmodically, in amounts varying from &#163;250 upwards, the taxation actually paid was &#163;2,150.Can that be considered to be even in the region of fair play? One man receiving &#163;1,761 per annum regularly, but producing no wealth, would pay only &#163;841 in taxation over the seven years, but the man who invests his capital in the development of the country, and takes all the hazards, has to pay &#163;2,150. I know of no injustice in connexion with our legislation that is greater or does more to retard the progress of the country. This Bill is an admission of the necessity for some remedy, and as such I accept it. It is clumsy and inadequate, but it is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the Government will offer an early opportunity to honorable members to consider a revised instrument for the assessment of taxation which will be equitable all round, and not continue the heart-burning that is now caused to citizens by the unjust and cruel incidence of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- But a good many other alterations that were not announced are included. If we could have had a short Bill to deal with the reciprocal arrangements between the Mother Country and the Commonwealth for the avoidance of double taxation, to give relief to primary producers, it might have passed through the House in a very short time, but apparently the Government and the Commissioner, knowing that the House wanted those amendments, have dragged into the Bill other things which honorable members should have ample time to consider before being asked to finally decide upon them. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> said that the proposed relief for the primary producer should not have been proposed at this time, and in any case should be wider in its scope and different in its outlook; but I think that at the earliest possible moment some relief should be given to those taxpayers. One has only to read the report of the Taxation Commission, and the numerous cases cited therein, to realize that a very grave injustice has been done, not only to the big grazier, but also to the small man on the land. One of the most striking cases that it is possible to imagine is cited in the Commission&#39;s report. Over a period of seven years a grazier made a net profit of &#163;56,447, the result of his transactions in each year being - First year, a profit of &#163;24,015; second year, a profit of &#163;28,804; third year, a loss of &#163;34,645; fourth year, a loss of &#163;67,255; fifth year, a profit of &#163;4,162; sixth year, a profit of &#163;55,531; and seventh year, a profit of &#163;45,835. Although the net result of seven years&#39; transactions was only &#163;56,447, he was asked to pay in Federal income taxation alone &#163;60,161, to say nothing of State income taxation. If that man had invested his money in city property or in war loans, or in  something else that produced a regular annual income of &#163;8,064, he would have paid in taxation only &#163;13,299 in the seven years, and he would have taken no risks and no responsibility. He would have sat down quietly and reaped &#163;8,000 per annum from gilt-edged securities, and would have paid in the seven years &#163;13,299 m taxation, whilst the man who took all the risks - and that there is a risk in the pastoral industry is shown by the  fact  that in one year he lost &#163;67,255 - was required to pay in taxation more than he actually received. That is not the way in which to encourage primary production, or induce people to leave the cities and go upon the land. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know; his name is not given; but in any case the incidence of the taxation is most unfair. Another pastoralist had a net income in five years of &#163;4,802, equal to &#163;960 per annum. He was required to pay in Federal income taxation &#163;2,285, and in State income taxation &#163;716. Thus out of his total income of &#163;4,802 he paid out &#163;3,001 in taxation to the Federal and State authorities. Had he been in receipt of a regular annual income of &#163;960, he would have paid in taxation over the five years only &#163;440. About 130 of these cases were examined by the Commission, and I think that that body is justified in its conclusions - </para>

                        <para>These examples exhibit a state of affairs which cannot be regarded with complacence, and even if they stood alone as special and peculiar, they call for some remedial measure. But they are, unfortunately, typical of a large number. The total taxpayers who are primary producers cannot be ascertained from the latest departmental statistics available, but they number, probably, 100,000. The first of these three examples is admittedly an extreme case, but it &#34;is an actual case.&#34; A system under which such a result is even possible is faulty in both conception and incidence. </para>

                    <para class="block">These cases show that there is ground for some relief. The system of suspense credits would have been better than that which is proposed; but a certain measure of relief will certainly be afforded. With respect to bonus shares, another phase is opened up in regard to which relief should be given. </para>

                            <para>- Not necessarily. Take the case of a small company, which would be known in . this State as a proprietary company. I am referring to a Sydney firm, which has a share capital of &#163;10,000. It became necessary &#34;for the company to approach a bank in order to borrow money to carry on. It had been running for about twenty years, and, in that time, it had accumulated about &#163;15,000 of reserves, which had been turned into stock. A sum of &#163;10,000 was required. . The bank authorities said, &#34; You want as much as the whole of your capital &#34;; but the representatives of the company replied, &#34; We have reserves,&#34; and they mentioned the amount. The objection of the bank was that there was nothing to prevent the company from distributing those reserves; which, if that were done, would materially affect the asset against which it was desired to borrow. The bank officials added, &#34; If you convert your reserve into shares &#176;and make your capital &#163;25,000, we will lend you the money you need.&#34; The firm, converted the capital into shares. </para>

                            <para>- They had been paying taxes, on the 2s. 8d. rate, upon the whole of their reserves, which had been earned since the taxation was imposed. The effect is that the whole of the &#163;15,000 has been brought into the ambit of taxation in one year. The rate has been &#34; skied,&#34; although there has been no change in the company. The amount of money invested in the company is the same; its assets are the same. All that is different is a bit of paper, the scrip. I emphasize that the income is the same, whether one speaks of reserve and capital or describes it all as capital. But the important fact is that there is brought into taxation, in one year,, twenty years&#39; accumulation of reserves; so that this company, which was in need of money to assist it to carry on its activities, would be called upon to pay thousands of pounds by way of taxation simply because it had capitalized its reserves. </para>

I invite the honorable member to suppose that I have 500 shares in a company which pays 10 per cent. I get &#163;50; that is my income. If the company doubles the1 capital out of reserves, the reserves are still in the company, and are bringing money into the company. Suppose that it capitalizes its reserves, and I get 1,000 shares, upon which I receive 5 per cent, instead of the 10 per cent, on 500 shares, my income from the shares is still &#163;50. But the Taxation Commissioner holds that my income is not &#163;50, but &#163;550, which is absolutely absurd. I desire to emphasize the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> who pointed out that the matter of interpretation of the Act is at present before the Court. The proposal in the Bill is, in effect, that where the Commissioner has a doubtful case before the Court- </para>

                            <para>- It also practically imposes new taxation. Parliament has never passed retrospective legislation upon matters such as these. It is quite a new departure to introduce retrospective legislation bearing upon cases actually before the Court. Where there are cases proceeding which come within the ambit of a measure before Parliament, there is always a slaving clause specifically exempting those cases. </para>

                            <para>- For the reason that he never receives it as income. There is an increase shown on a bit of paper, but the income is not in any way increased ; bonus shares are still capital. There is not, and has not been, any opportunity of spending it. I have known cases in which poor women, who have received bonus shares, have been assessed, and have had to sell those shares in order to pay the taxation. The very unfair point is that there will be brought into one year&#39;s sphere &#39;of taxation profits accumulated over a period, perhaps, of twenty years, and by that means the rates are &#34;skied.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Not necessarily, because the extent to which any particular shareholder is interested might be very small, and the company has already paid income tax at the flat rate. A great many things have been dragged in by this Bill which might have been left over for another occasion. A gift of assets is made taxable as income. If a man goes out of business, leaving it to his son to carry on the concern, which happens occasionally, the whole of the stock-in-trade, good-will, and everything else is treated as income for the year in which the gift is made, and the taxation upon it may ruin the business. Then, when a business is sold, good-will is treated as income, although it takes many years to build up a good-will that has any considerable value. When a man dies, however, good-will is treated&#34; not as interest, but as capital. </para>

                        <para>. - I join with those who have protested against the introduction of the Bill in thy dying hours of the session. The measure has, so to speak, been thrown at us with the threat that if we try to amend it the Government will not proceed with it. I hope that the House will resent that threat, and let Ministers carry the odium of withdrawing the measure because members have seen fit to exercise their rights of discussion and amendment. Members have told me that they would move amendments if they were not afraid of the withdrawal of the Bill, so that evidently the threat of the Government is preventing Parliament from functioning as it should do. No private member would like to have attached to him responsibility for the loss of a Bill which affords some small measure of relief to the taxpayers. But no threat will prevent me from doing what I consider to be necessary in the interests of those who sent me here. It is an insult to Parliament to bring down a Bill of ten pages the day before it is proposed to enter upon a recess of five or six months, more especially a Bill bristling with intricate technicalities. Every business man knows how difficult it is to prepare income tax returns which will not involve trouble with the Commissioner. More time should be given for the discussion of the Bill, even if we have to sit longer. Those who now suffer a great injustice by the operation of the income tax law should be given relief by the removal of anomalies. I am glad that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> intends to move to increase the exemption. At the present time persons who have an income of only &#163;100 a year are taxed, although the Courts have fixed &#163;4 5s. per week as the living wage. Many men, taking into consideration the time when they are not working, do not make more than &#163;3 or &#163;3 10s. per week, yet though not in receipt of the living wage, they are expected to furnish income tax returns, and to pay taxation on their income. I am surprised that no notice has been taken of the protests which have been raised repeatedly against the unfair operation of the income tax in the assessment of live stock. A struggling man with 1,000 breeding ewes may lose half the number in a drought, but from the remaining half he may get 400 lambs, so that at the end of the year he has 900 sheep where previously he had 1,000. The present method of assessment takes no account of his losses, but regards the natural increase of 400 as so much income, and this method of assessment has been in operation for years. It may happen that the lambs which are born within the year for which they are assessed as income die before anything can be got for them. Hundreds of cases of that kind have occurred in my electorate during the past few years. </para>

                            <para>- No; it does not amend the section under which this live stock is assessed as income. It must not be forgotten that the breeder of sheep is taxed on the money that he gets for their wool or their carcasses. The Government should have granted relief in this matter long ago. The honorable member for Nepean has shown how harshly the law operates at times towards persons interested in companies, and we who represent country constituencies, and are not so familiar as he is with the kind of case of which he has spoken, are indebted to him for the remarkably clear manner in which he has exposed the anomalies of the law. Members should have time to weigh speeches such as his. Presumably, it is intended that there shall be an all-night sitting, in which the Bill may be forced through. </para>

                            <para>- Some of the Government measures work so badly that they might seem to have been put through in that time. Ministers are not acting fairly towards members in bringing forward a Bill like this so late in the session. I hope that the House will not bs influenced by the threat that the Bill v. ill not be proceeded with if attempts are made to amend it. It would be better to let the measure go over to next session than to place it hurriedly on the statute-book. If we pass it to-night, and, later, attempt to get the anomalies which it will create remedied, the Government will say, &#34;Why did you not have these matters dealt with when the Bill was before Parliament <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> The Government has had two years in which to bring down amending income tax legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The way in which Government measures are presented to Parliament provokes criticism. The Convention Bill was introduced in a form in which it was not in the least acceptable to the House - in a form., indeed, that was not acceptable to any one. I do not think the Prime Minister himself thought very much of it. This Bill follows on very much the same lines. It has been hastily thrown together, and honorable members are now asked to pass it in the course of a couple of hours, leaving the Taxation Commissioner to do the rest. The Bill having become law, the Commissioner will interpret it, and if a dispute occurs between him and a taxpayer, the latter, in order to get justice, will have to appeal to the Court. It is not every man who cares about incurring the cost of law proceedings. </para>

                    <para>The Opposition will assist the Government to so amend this Bill, that it may be more acceptable to the people. That, however, cannot be done properly in the time at our disposal. As it is. we are asked to agree to the Bill being rushed through Parliament, with the result that it will not receive the consideration which its importance demands. Many honorable members are not prepared to remain here all night, and even if they were, we know that by 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., honorable members become so mentally as well as physically fatigued that they are unable to properly analyze the provisions of a measure of this kind. The Bill has many anomalies, and it will only be after it has been passed and the people are suffering under it that; honorable members will realize how foolish they were in allowing legislation of such a character to be rushed through Parliament in the dying hours of the session. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. The Royal Commission on Taxation has not yet finalized its work. I hope that when its final report has been presented the &#34;Government will submit a measure providing for many necessary taxation reforms, and that we shall be given ample time to consider it. We are looking forward to the introduction of an amending Bill that will make for simplicity of taxation methods, and provide also for uniformity. A special effort should be made to induce the States to come into line with the Commonwealth in order that we may secure uniformity of taxation, and thus reduce the cost of collection, and at the same time lessen the troubles of taxpayers, who now have to prepare so many varying returns. The report which has been presented by the Commission shows how essential it is that we should have amending legislation to give relief to primary producers, who have for long been most inequitably treated. I should have been better pleased had the Bill provided for the payment of taxation on actual cash profits as far as primary producers are concerned, and not on increases of stock. The honorable member who has just resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham.)</inline> has referred to the losses of stock that have been suffered by graziers and others who have been taxed on increases in stock, hut I am glad that the Government are now1 giving us a portion, at least, of the concessions for which we have so long been asking. They are giving us the average system which we have been demanding for some years, and while the provisions of the Bill do. not go as far as we would like them to go in that direction, they will, at least, grant some relief to a class of the community which has been very harshly treated. I thank the Government for this Bill, and I hope that when the final report of the Commission has been received those who. go into the back country and help to develop Australia will be granted greater concessions than are extended to those who carry on business in our cities. </para>

I quoted, among other instances, the case of a man who had invested &#163;20,000 in the pastoral industry and who, for some years before the outbreak of war, instead of making any profit, had suffered big losses. That man, however, in one year of- the war made a profit of &#163;4,500, and was called upon to pay &#163;2,250 in respect of the war-times profits tax in addition to the ordinary State and Federal taxation.

                    <para class="block">Thus a city man who during the war made a profit of &#163;10,000, &#163;15,000, or &#163;20,000, not by investing any capital, but by &#34;jobbing,&#34; and so making things dearer for the people, was absolutely exempt from the war-times profits tax, whereas men who nad been battling for years in the bush had to mortgage their holdings in some cases in order to pay that tax. The provision in this Bill in regard to average income is a concession in a small way, and is -badly needed. Those who read the report of the Commission will realize how necessary such an amendment of the law is. I also hail with satisfaction the provisions of the Bill in regard to the mining industry. We are all familiar with the difficulties attending the opening up of a new field. I know of men who1, after battling in the &#39; &#39; never-never country &#34; for fen or fifteen years, made a &#34;find,&#34; which they were able to dispose of, receiving payment partly in cash and partly in shares, and were compelled to file their schedule because of the taxation demanded in respect of those shares. I thank the Government very heartily for this concession to the mining industry. A prospector makes a little profit, perhaps only once in a life-time, and hitherto the Income Tax Department has been taking a very great proportion of such profit. I do not desire to delay the House further, except to express the hope that when we  go into Committee the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Hughes) will explain why clause 12 has been made retrospective, because it seems to me to be so far-reaching that it may be unjust in its incidence. </para>

                        <para>.- While this Bill may do much good it is also calculated to work much injustice, aud I enter my protest against its introduction at this late stage of the session, unless we can. secure considerable alterations from the Minister when we go into Committee. It is impossible, in the&#39; circumstances, for it to receive due consideration. If it be carried, large business firms in Queensland, who realized the necessity of putting aside reserves - in respect of which they had already paid the war-times profits tax and income tax - in order to meet losses that must inevitably occur when the slump comes, and their stocks are consequently reduced in value, will find themselves, so to speak, between the devil and the deep blue sea. The State Taxation Department has collected income tax not only on the profits that have been distributed in the shape of bonus shares, but also on such reserves. Take a company with a. capital of &#163;200,000 in 200,000 shares of &#163;1 each, which had reserves amounting to &#163;25,000. No deduction was allowed the company in respect to its earnings on that &#163;25,000. The tax was based on the smaller amount, and, consequently, was much heavier than it should have been. The legal advisers of various firms told them that the best course for them to adopt would be to distribute their reserves in the form of bonus shares. That was done. After these bonus shares were distributed, in order to avoid being unjustly taxed by forcing the State Taxation Department to distribute the earnings on the whole of the capital, and not on a portion of it only, we have had the Commonwealth Taxation Department saying, &#34; The shareholders must a.t once pay heavy taxation <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the whole of the bonus shares allotted.&#34; To comply with this demand would have meant almost ruination to some firms, and I am told on good authority that there are cases now pending in the Courts concerning the matter. When I know that many facts would have been supplied to me, if time had permitted, by people in Queensland, I feel that I am not justified, as a. representative of a </para>

Honorable members should have tim&#39;e to consider every clause of the measure and its probable effect on every part of the Commonwealth, and not on one State alone. We have not time to communicate with Chambers of Commerce or people who are largely interested in such a Bill. One honorable member has pointed out that if bonus shares are distributed, the recipient gets a larger income, but such is not the case. A company which distributes bonus shares is losing it&#39;s reserves upon which it has been earning -money with which to pay&#34; dividends to its shareholders, and the receipt of bonus shares does not mean a larger dividend. The distribution of bonus shares in Queensland was undertaken because the State taxing officers collected the tax on the basis of the paid-up capital of a. company, and did not distribute the earnings on paid-up capital and reserve funds. We are not given the opportunity of discussing this Bill on its merits as we should. 1 appeal to the Government to lay it aside until honorable members have sufficient time to get in touch with those who are affected by it, so that we may see what action it is advisable to take, or agree to make amendments. </para>

                        <para>.- The desire of the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden),</inline> will best be met by omitting clause 12, the retrospective nature of which makes the paragraphs the honorable member seeks to omit very dangerous. No reason has been given for the presence of clause 12 in the Bill. I cannot imagine why the scope of the measure should be permitted to stretch back as far as 1915, and the Minister might, at this stage, give some explanation of the necessity for the retrospective nature of the provision. Otherwise the Committee would be justified in agreeing to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- It is important to know that two principles in the Bill are properly, understood by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> and by the Committee. One principle is the retrospective effect of this clause on many other clauses, and we have not had a proper explanation of that. The other has reference to bonus shares, and the question is whether this law, retrospective or otherwise, will close the Court to certain litigants. With all respect to the Minister, I say it is not a case of our making the law clear; the Court has been asked to do that on a test case. Nothing we do should take away from that tribunal the power to settle the law as it was when those cases arose. Parliament does not do the sort of thing suggested. If, after the decision, the public interest is not properly safeguarded, .it is for the Executive to recommend legislation to put matters right. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, for the taxpayer. I do not care whether the effects are for or against the taxpayer, there must be ample justification for retrospective legislation, and the onus is on the man who proposes it. We do not know whether it will &#34; kick &#34; against the Treasurer or the taxpayer ; but whatever the result there must be urgent justification before we assent to retrospective legislation. On the second reading I asked the Minister to explain the object and purpose of the retrospection, and of several other proposals, but that has not been done. If it is proposed to pass all these clauses now, arrested by the amendment of the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Bowden),</inline> our only remedy is to throw out clause 12, although we may approve of some of it. </para>

A case is before the Court for the interpretation of this particular individual&#39;s right; but it is essential that we secure that there can be a demand made for moneys collected under what was regarded as the law.

                        <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> must know that it was agreed that the particular case now before the Courts should be taken as a test case, there being, I should say, scores of assessments depending on the decision. If only in one case the claim is to be honoured, then I say it is unfair. Now that a test case has been stated, the Commissioner comes to Parliament, and, in effect, says, &#34;I am afraid I am going to be defeated ; will you alter the law before the case comes on?&#34; I must say, speaking from experience, I have found the Commissioner a most unreasonable man to deal with. On one occasion, when I wished to see him in connexion with a case, he put off the interview&#39; for two days, and then told me to come in and see him the following week. I journeyed from Sydney to Melbourne for that express purpose, and he then asked me to put my objection in writing, for he could not interview me. He treated a client of mine in a similar manner, absolutely refusing to see him, although he also had come over from Sydney. I do not wish to accuse any officer of unfairness, but merely give my. experience. We have no right, by side-tracking, to prejudice the decision of the case which the Commissioner has practically decided shall be a test case. The Minister tells us that this clause is only to give relief. If that is the case, would it not be well to have a proviso like this added to the clause - </para>

I recognise that the excision of clause 12 will do more than I desire to do, but I see no other way of achieving my object. </para>

A recent decision of the High Court, to which I referred when moving the second reading, only applied to the State Act, but if it should apply to the Federal Act it would, I am informed, make a difference of hundreds of thousands of pounds to our revenue. That is a possibility we cannot afford to face. </para>

                            <para>- I think it should. The same anomaly exists in connexion with primary production as in connexion with shares. A person selling his property at any time since the commencement of this Act would be simply transferring his trading asset into capital. The new definition of &#34; trading assets &#34; will apply only to his cows, ewes, and working horses. It will not include his bullocks or wethers. A man who had transferred his cattle or ewes might be mulct in retrospective taxation right back to the year 1915-1916. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is to provide for cases such as I mentioned to-night. A man who has, say, 1,000 breeding ewes loses 500 of them through drought, such as was experienced for a couple of years preceding last year in the northern district of New South Wales, and is frequently experienced in other parts of Australia. From the 500 remaining he may get a natural increase of 400, bringing his total to 900. Even then he is 100 short of his original stock, but the present method of assessment allows him nothing for the 500 he has lost; he has to pay on the natural increase of 400 as though the increase were income. In reality, his original capital shows a loss, because his live stock are his capital, and he has 100 less than he started with. I contend that he should not be assessed on that- natural increase as though it were income. Another case has to do with a man owning 1,000 head of breeders.  His  natural increase may be said to be 600. Drought supervenes; and the lambs may die. He cannot realize upon that lost stock; yet he will be required to pay as though it were income. If those sheep continued to live the breeder would shear wool off their backs; and on such income as he derived from the sale of the wool he would be required to pay income taxation. If he should dispose of that stock the returns would be shown in his schedule as income, and he would pay accordingly. But, I repeat, if that stock dies, he still has to pay upon the natural increase as if it were income. That is grossly unfair, and it entails great hardship upon struggling men in the back country which is periodically visited by drought, fire, and flood. The Government should not levy upon the natural increase until the taxpayer has realized upon it. As sales are made from the produce of the natural increase the person concerned pays upon his income as it is derived. There are many men to-day who are in a most unfortunate position. Almost the whole of their stock have been lost, , what with the drought of two years ago and recent floods, which have wiped out practically all survivors among the natural increase. </para>

                    <para>Royal Commission. It is one to which the Commissioners are at present giving particular attention. It is well known that they have presented a report covering a portion of the matters referred to them; but, upon this subject, they have not yet reported. The Commissioner for Taxation says that, in his opinion, the matter is very complicated, notwithstanding that the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham)</inline> has expressed the opposite view. I hope the Committee will accept the assurance of the Government that the subject is receiving from the Taxation Royal Commission the most careful investigation; and that the Government, directly the Commission has presented its report-even if it should ignore the matter, or put forward no satisfactory or practical method of relief - will afford Parliament the earliest possible opportunity for the discussion of the problem upon its merits. I cannot accept the amendment, but not because I am not desirous of helping the man on the land. I quite appreciate that there must be very many taxpayers who find themselves in precarious and unenviable positions such as have been described. The Royal Commission has done excellent work, and the Government have taken the earliest opportunity to embody its recommendations, to date, in a Bill which, without further delay, should be a law of the land. </para>

The specific case has been recently brought under my notice of a man who branded more than 4,000 calves. He lost all in a draught, together with 62 per cent. of their mothers, but he had to pay income tax on the calves that had died. The position is. not complicated, as the Prime Minister alleges. To compel a man to pay income tax upon capital which has gone cannot be justified. </para>

                        <para>. - There can be no two opinions concerning the unfairness and injustice of the present system of taxing upon the natural increase, especially in times such as the present, when stock is practically unsaleable. There are men in my . electorate who live by breeding, and who have been required to pay &#163;400 or &#163;500 by way of income tax, although they have not been able to sell a hoof in the past two years. And the situation becomes only the more aggravated as the stock grows older and bigger. One of my constituents offered to forward to the Taxation Commissioner the equivalent of his income tax assessment in kind. The Royal Commission has investigated the whole question. I differ from those honorable members who have said that this matter is not complicated. Primary producers are represented upon the Commission by men who are trying to grapple with the position as fairly and squarely as possible. I do not think good will come of hasty legislation at this stage; it might result in more trouble for primary producers. </para>

If the Act is now to be amended it should be so obviously improved as to receive the indorsement of the members of the Commission. In South Africa, where a system has been in vogue similar to that which is now suggested, the authorities are desirous of making a change and of adopting the Australian practice. That ir, significant. I would like to receive from the Prime Minister a definite assurance that as soon as Parliament meets again, following npqn the receipt of the full report of the Commission, the decisions of that body will be given effect to by way of&#39; an amending measure. </para>

                        <para>.- In Queensland graziers may take advantage of a provision which permits them to leave out stock both at the beginning and at the end of a financial period. This is contained in an old Act. Taxpayers  are given their choice as to whether they will come in thereunder - just dealing with purchases and sales - or whether they prefer to act as an ordinary business man does - that is to say, by taking a full stock at the beginning and at the end of the. year. Many graziers are at present working under the provision to which I have just alluded. So far as concerns a man who is purely a breeder, and who sells his income, that provision is very beneficial; but if he deals in any shape or form - buying or selling - he is very hea.vily penalized in some years. I desire to assure honorable members that I know what I am. talking about, as I am a taxation expert. For the past eleven years I have been doing nothing else but working along these lines for graziers and farmers. I have always advised them, wherever possible, to keep clear of this simple matter of purchasing and selling. The whole question is certainly very complicated. Every grazier does not carry on the same class of business. One man may be a dealer pure and simple, another may be a breeder solely ; but if a grazier undertakes the slightest dealing, intermixed with breeding, he will find that the effect of the proposed amendment will be entirely against his best interests. </para>

As the Minister has had time now to consider the matter, I ask him whether the fears I expressed are likely to be realized, or can he give me the assurance that the effect is not as I anticipated. </para>

Times have altogether changed since the original Bill, providing for an exemption of &#163;156 was introduced. It was passed at the beginning of the war. Since then the cost of living has gone up enormously, and the purchasing power of the sovereign has been very materially reduced. Honorable members of the Labour party therefore think that this additional relief should be granted. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not understand Whether the Prime Minister is proposing to omit paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of section 2. I know that in Western Australia a decision in a case against the State Taxation Commissioner has put a certain interpretation on what is to be regarded as the taxable income of trading assets. The State Act is, I believe, similar to the Commonwealth Act. The case to which I refer is <inline font-style="italic">Newman</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Taxation Commissioners,</inline> and, if that is the position, I have no objection to the Prime Minister removing the possibility of paragraph c of clause 2 having any retrospective effect. </para>

                <para class="block">So far as I know in the case of the Rochdale Co-operative Society, in my district, no rebates have been paid on, and this Bill is to obviate the necessity for doing so. The members of the society were not aware that the payments had to be made; tut the Commissioner, in the course of It is duty, has included the amounts in their assessments. They feel that it is most unfair that they should be taxed twice, seeing that they pay income tax on their earnings. I wish to have this clause made retrospective, so that claims may not be made against the co-operative societies after years have elapsed. </para>

                    <para>This is a short Bill for the purpose of amending section 48 of the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1918. In the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915, exemption as regards income from personal exertion was given to any person &#34; who is on active service during the present war with the Military or Naval Forces of the Commonwealth, or any part of the King&#39;s Dominions, or of an Ally of Great Britain.&#34; That was intended to apply only to soldiers who were on active service overseas, and not to home service men, and, was so interpreted and applied. In 1918, an amendment of the Act expressly set forth that that Act was to apply to soldiers overseas, and should date as from 1918. An action was brought against the Commonwealth by a soldier who was engaged on home service, and the case of <inline font-style="italic">Ramaciotti</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">The Federal Commissioner of</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Owing to the provisions of the Customs Act, we are obliged to submit to the Tariff Board any proposal for reciprocal Tariff relations between the Commonwealth and other parts of the British Dominions. During the last few weeks we have been conducting negotiations by cable with the New Zealand Government in regard to reciprocal Tariff relations, and we have practically come to an agreement on the basis that New Zealand shall concede to the Commonwealth British preferential rates, and we shall concede to New Zealand British preferential rates. As we shall get from New Zealand a much greater advantage than New Zealand will get from us, the Commonwealth&#39;s trade with the Dominion being about &#163;2.500,000 per annum, and the Dominion&#39;s trade with us amounting to about &#163;7,500,000 per annum, it is eminently desirable that at the first possible opportunity the agreement with New Zealand should be ratified. We propose in the Bill which will follow the resolution of this Committee to take power by proclamation to give New Zealand British preferential rates as soon as the agreement has been ratified. I assure the Committee that until we are satisfied that New Zealand will extend to us the same treatment as we are extending to it, we shall not issue that proclamation. I feel quite satisfied that the projected arrangement will be entirely advantageous to the Commonwealth, and that we shall run no risk, from a Protectionist point of view, by its ratification. </para>

                    <para>. - The reasons for the message of  His Excellency  the Governor-General may he set out thus : There are quite a number of deferred duties which are to come into force automatically on the 1st January, 1922. The Customs Tariff Bill provides a means whereby those duties may be further deferred. It requires that the Tariff Board shall report, and that the Minister shall act as he thinks fit upon the report of that Board. In all probability, it will be impossible for the Tariff Board to be constituted and to inquire into all these various matters before the beginning of the new year. What the Government propose to do in this connexion is to further defer those deferred duties to the 31st March, in order to permit the Board to be constituted and be in a position to present its reports to the Minister, so that the latter may take action when the 31st day of March has been reached. That is the net effect of the message in regard particularly to a large number of items indicated therein. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The remaining portion of the message relates to the South African Tariff. Negotiations are being conducted with the Government of South Africa concerning a reciprocal Tariff, and I believe that they will be carried to a successful conclusion. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of this amending measure is as follows: - Some time ago Parliament passed a Bill to grant a bounty on the manufacture of black sheets and galvanized iron sheets. The measure provided that the amount of the bounty should be conditioned by the rates of freight as between Great Britain and Australia; and it further laid down that the authority to determine what those rates of freight were, at the particular time when the bounty was payable, should be the Board of Trade, in England. That Board has informed the Commonwealth Government, by cablegram within the past few days, that it has no official information and declines to give an official opinion concerning what the rates of freight are. Consequently, the Government have had to fall back on another authority. In this short measure the intention is to, give to the Minister for Trade and Customs power to declare what the rate of freight is, for the purposes of the Iron and Steel Bounty Act. The point will be determined probably upon the basis of what the manager of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers declares to be the rate of freight for the class of goods concerned as between England and Australia. </para>

It is not&#39; proposed to use any of this money during the present financial year, nor, indeed, to float a loan during the present year; but it takes two months to prepare the organization and machinery needed for the floating of a loan, and it is desirable that the Treasurer shall be able to select the most favorable opportunity for floating it. </para>

                    <para>. - I realize that the money borrowed last year is likely to have run out before we meet again, and that there must be authority for the raising of more money, because we must keep our promises to the soldiers. At the same time I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook told us, when . he asked for authority for the raising of the last loan, that that loan would be really the last. I hope by the time this money is spent that circumstances will be so changed that we shall be able to finance our obligations to the soldiers without going on the market to borrow, because there must come an end to borrowing. I hope, too, that there will not be as much waste of money in the future as in the past. I take it that part of the money it is proposed to borrow will be spent on War Service homes. </para>

                    <para>. - Like the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook saying that the last loan raised for repatriation purposes would be the last. In my opinion, the time has come when we should provide money for repatriation by savings out of revenue, instead of borrowing it. We must, of course, fulfil our obligations to the soldiers. That a certain number of them have been assisted does not relieve us of our obligation to the rest; but a discrimination has already been made between the earlier applicants for assistance and those who are now asking for land settlement. There is a great difference between &#163;1,000, the amount formerly promised, and &#163;625, which is now being offered. Money has been voted for repatriation in a most liberal spirit, and Parliament looks to the Government and to the Minister for Repatriation to see that it is not wasted. During the next few months the Minister will have an opportunity of showing whether he has profited by the lessons of the past. If he does not so profit, condign punishment awaits him. Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

                <para class="block">I would point out that it is designed to enable a truly co-operative enterprise to commence operations. The capital of the company is &#163;100,000, divided into 5,000 shares of &#163;20 each, and is payable in war gratuities or cash, or both. The membership of the company is confined to holders of war gratuity bonds. In the main, the shareholders will be soldiers, but the privilege also extends to the next of kin of deceased soldiers who are holders of bonds. The advances for which this Bill provides could not be made in the ordinary way under section 48 of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act, because it does not apply to a co-operative enterprise of this description. That section was framed for the purpose of enabling assistance to be given to soldiers who, with their own capital and their own labour, engage in an enterprise, and devote the&#39; whole of their time to it. In the case of a co-operative company of this kind, it would be impossible for all the shareholders, who number more than 1,400, to personally engage in the industry. </para>
                <para>The enterprise has been launched in Geelong, where the woollen industry flourishes. It is under skilful management. Its directors, with one exception, are soldiers; and there is nothing of a wild-cat nature about it. It has been started by skilful business men ; it has hardheaded and shrewd directors, and is supported by many whose names will be lastingly associated with the success of the woollen industry in the city I have named. Honorable members may rest assured that, in making these advances, we shall not lose sight of the principle which has been laid down by the Parliament that genuine and practical encouragement shall be given to soldiers to invest their war gratuity bonds in enterprises carried on for their own benefit. The Bill provides for the requisite security being given. The necessary safeguards will be  found in the measure, and honorable members may rest assured that the Cabinet has carefully examined the company&#39;s articles of association, and has found that in all respects they conform to the requirements of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>Notwithstanding the liberal provisions of the principal Act many cases of very great hardship and distress which do not come within its scope have been brought under the notice of the Government. Those are cases where the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces has arisen from what are popularly known as pre-existing disabilities. This amendment of the principal Act is not lightly proposed, because the experience of other countries and former wars has shown that a pension scheme having once been framed it is most dangerous to interfere with it. The Government have been moved to take this action only because of the distressing condition of men who served in the recent war and for whom, at the present time, no adequate provision is made. It has endeavoured so to safeguard this extension of the principal Act as to insure that those who by their own wilful act, or by remissness or carelessness, have contributed to their incapacity and are not entitled to a pension, shall not have public money ladled out to them. I think honorable members will appreciate the object which the Government have in view in submitting the measure. Under it pensions will be payable to men whose incapacity has arisen from a latent disease or constitutional defect which did not manifest itself  before they went abroad. Even in such cases a pension will not be granted unless the soldier served in camp in Australia for at least six months or embarked for active service with the Forces overseas. Some of the most painful cases which have come under the notice of the Commission and of honorable members generally are those of men who are suffering from tuberculosis. Even after the most careful medical examination it is difficult to determine whether the disease was pre-existent or arose from war service or exposure while the men were in training in camp in Australia, undergoing preparation overseas, or actually serving at the Front. Of all wars that through which we have recently passed has been the most productive of this dire disease, owing to the prevalence of poisonous gas fumes on the battlefield. Even after the most careful examination medical officers, in many instances, have found it most difficult to determine whether the disease was latent in the individual at the time of enlistment or was the result of war service. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill is intended to remedy the position in that respect. It will involve a very considerable expenditure, but the Government have determined that no consideration of pounds, shillings, and pence should come between this country and its duty to the men whose health has broken down as a result of war service. At the same time we have provided the safeguards necessary to prevent a pension being paid in any undeserving case. </para>

                        <para>. I think that all honorable members are pleased that the Government have introduced this Bill. For a considerable time past we have been asking for such a measure, because we realized how necessary it was that something should be done to place our soldiers who have become incapacitated, permanently or partially, in a much better position than that in which they find themselves under the provisions of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act in its present form. The pensions of many partially-incapacitated soldiers have been cancelled because they are deemed not to be suffering in consequence of warlike operations. I want to know whether their cases can be reviewed under this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I would rather see the administration of war pensions placed in the hands of the Department which is administering invalid and old-age pensions, because that is the only place where the soldiers can get justice. I can have no faith in the people who have been administering war pensions during the last fourteen months. They have done nothing but cancel pensions. I have been asked to address a public meeting at Abermain in connexion with the case of a returned soldier who is now in&#34; a mental asylum as the result of the cancellation of his pension on the ground that the disability for which he was drawing the pension was not the result of warlike operations. I mention this case so that the Minister may make a note of it. Other honorable members representing New South Wales constituencies will agree with me that they have not received that satisfaction and sympathetic treatment that they are entitled to receive. How many cases have they brought up in this Chamber <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> These cases have been sent by the Minister to the Board concerned for reconsideration, and in every case the Board has returned them, simply indorsing its former decision. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. This Bill now proposes that these State Boards shall still continue to act in the same way. There is not the slightest chance of getting any satisfaction from them. If we submit a case to the Minister he is sympathetic, and says that he will look into it, and send it on to the Board for report; but the Board simply sends it back again to him, as I have already said, indorsing its previous decision. The position is not satisfactory to honorable members, nor to the soldiers, and I think it would be well for the Minister to devise some other means by which war pensions can be dealt with. </para>

                        <para>. - This Bill is a good many months overdue. In fact, I think it is three years overdue, and although the hour is very late, it behoves us to see that it is the best means of carrying into effect the ideas and sentiments expressed on the floor of this Chamber for so many months past. &#34;We may possibly find that it does not carry into effect these ideas, and I fear that if the administration of the measure is left in the hands of those who have been handling war pensions so far, the desire of honorable members that liberal treatment should be bestowed upon our maimed soldiers, who are in many cases in dire need, will not be carried into effect. I cordially support the proposition put forward, on the score of economy and efficiency, and also, I may add, of intelligence, that the administration and investigation of war pensions should be in the hands of the Department which has had considerable experience in dealing with invalid and old-age pensions, and has proved itself to be quite capable of handling the subject. There are qualifying conditions in the Bill which may defeat the object we desire. For instance, it provides - </para>

                    <para>This provision does not cover a case I have in mind, that of a soldier who went into camp, and contracted cerebro-spinal meningitis within three or four weeks. He would not have contracted that disease if he had not been put into camp. At any rate, he is now suffering from post-meningitic symptoms, which cause him to have fits, and prevent him from earning a proper livelihood. Although he applied with numerous medical certificates, which I have in my possession now, to have his pension increased, and he was ordered to report in order that the Board might see whether his application should be granted, he suddenly found that the pension he was already drawing was stopped by reason of the fact that the Act did not cover his case. I am afraid that the Bill will not cover his case either. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened carefully to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> I cannot help feeling that there is a good deal of truth in what they say. I mentioned the other night that, literally, thousands of soldiers had complained tome, and that while quite a number of their claims had been adjusted, there were some with good cause for complaint, for whom no remedy could be found It was because of that, and as a result of the statement I made here the other night, that this Bill has been introduced. The criticism of the measure amounts to this: Very little objection is taken to the Bill itself, which is  admittedly a step in the right direction, but it is claimed that the Board is unsympathetic. </para>

                            <para>- The Board has felt itself constrained by reason of the wording of the Act for which this Parliament is responsible, to confine pensions to cases in which it has been clearly established the injuries have arisen as a direct result of the war. However, I ask honorable members to give the Bill a trial. It is impossible in the limited time at our disposal to make the far-reaching amendments which honorable members propose. Let us have an opportunity of seeing whether this amendment will enable the Board to carry out its duties, and grant relief to these special cases. If it does not do so, we can substitute another Board when the House meets again. I think that I have shown pretty clearly where my sympathies lie. I am sure there are many soldiers who will say I am the last one to bother about red tape. At the same time, I must say that the Act seems perfectly clear, and that, in the face of the specific directions given to it by the law already in force, the Medical Board has had little or no option. Now we are giving it a direction of quite another kind. If the Board does not interpret the directions in the spirit intended, and in the face of these declarations by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> and myself, then- </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this Bill so quickly, because I think it will cover what is breaking the hearts of many &#39; &#39; diggers &#34; throughout Australia to-day. I desire, however, to cross a lance with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the Minister for Repatriation, in reference to one case that I have had before him for weeks, and which was brought under my notice by the  Hon.  W. P. Latimer, M.L.C., of Sydney. Several communications have passed from me to him in the last ten days, and I cannot even get an acknowledgment. . The case is one of the gravest that ever came before me. It is that of one, George Rodgers, who lives in my electorate, and who received a gun-shot wound in the face at Gallipoli. That man has been refused a pension on the ground that the wound in his face, which blinded him, is not really a war injury. According to the Repatriation Department the doctor who examined &#39; him says that he is suffering from tertiary symptoms of syphilis. The reply of George Rodgers is that the doctor mentioned has never seen him or examined him. One doctor, who has examined him, says that there is not a sign of syphilis in his blood. Rodgers to-day is lying in a hospital in Sydney, and is in a very bad way indeed. Amongst the documents I sent in to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Pictorial London,</inline> containing a picture of a soldier with bandaged face leaving, I think, Buckingham Palace, and over the picture in big black letters are the words, &#39; &#39; What our soldiers have done for us.&#34; That man was Rodgers, but on his behalf I can get no satisfaction from the Department. No doubt this Bill will do good, and before he &#34; passes out,&#34; for he is very sick, it is to be hoped he will receive a pension. I am just &#34; fed up &#34; with the treatment I have received from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in connexion with this case. </para>

                        <para>. - It is extremely difficult to say whether a thing contributes to bring about a certain result; and when the Courts are called upon to deal with  cases  of contributory negligence they are confronted with a position that is very hard to resolve. It may be said that taking a cup of tea may contribute to a person&#39;s death, or that the abrupt entrance into a chamber set apart for ladies in a certain state may bring about a most unfortunate result. The question of whether there is homicide, and, if so, whether it be justifiable homicide, are questions that afford opportunities to lawyers of earning an honest living. But I do not feel that I should he justified altogether in deleting this word &#34; substantially,&#34; and leaving the word &#34; contributed.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I do not care whether they are soldiers or not; we are legislators, and responsible for the measures we pass. I should like to mention a case I referred to before of a man at Deloraine, Tasmania, who enlisted and went into camp, where, after about two months, he contracted disease. He was, in consequence, in hospital for six months, and was given a pension, which he drew for two years. Seven months ago, however, that pension was cut off, because the medical Board, or whatever Board it was, decided that his injury was not due to military service.  This  man is very ill to-day, and much more in need of a pension, than he was previously. He cannot do a day&#39;s work, and he has a wife and family. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> D. Millen, the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson),</inline> and myself have been pleading with the Commissioner for months on behalf of this man. He has produced letters and other evidence to show that he never suffered from disease of any description, or was under a medical man prior to going to camp; but the Department is adamant. In view of administration of this kind, I regret that I cannot be satisfied with the Prime </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister&#39;s promise. I have been relying on this amending Bill to afford relief to this particular man, whose case is only one of many. If we wait until Parliament meets again after recess, to see how this Bill operates, this man in all probability will be dead. We have waited years for this Bill, and it would be hard to have to wait for a remedy until Parliament meets again, when the matter could be arranged by striking out the word &#34; substantially.&#34; If this man served for only one month, and, as a result, he became incapacitated, he ought fo have a pension; and nothing, less will satisfy me. </para>

His illness was due to service in camp, but the authorities will not hear him on the case. Owing to the lack of sympathy, and through the exacting manner in which the Act has been administered, I repeat that I cannot be satisfied with the Prime Minister&#39;s assurance, sympathetic though I know him to be. Something is wrong in the administration, and it is for us to find out what. </para>

                            <para>- The public outside are entitled to some consideration, and at least one civilian should have been on the Board. Unfortunately every Act of Parliament proves in practice to be different from what was intended by the Legislature. It will really be to the political advantage of the Opposition if this Board continues, because the longer it remains in existence the greater the number of votes that will be recorded against the Government at the next election. But we are actuated to move as we  ar6  doing by the severity of the rulings which have been given against the soldiers by the Board. It is most obstinate in its decisions, the reasons for some of which the Lord Himself could not explain. I know of men who have been practically hunted out of the presence of the Board for daring to apply for a pension. Some of them have been men with whom I ha.ve worked, and I know that they never drank and that the Prime Minister&#39;s reference to certain diseases could have no application to them. Their cases are entirely deserving, and yet over and over again they have been refused a pension. I would like to see the Board abolished and the administration pf the pensions handed over to the Old-age and Invalids Pension Branch. We would then get sympathetic administration of the Act, which we do not get from the returned soldiers on the Board. Unfortunately, in many cases, when a returned soldier is placed in an official position, the first thing he does is to apply the boot to his mates. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, the individual members of Parliament must shoulder their responsibilities, and we shall do so when we go before the electors. If the Government allow the present conditions to continue it will be the duty of the people to see that the promises made to our soldiers when they enlisted are carried out. Those promises are not being honoured when advantage is taken of every loophole to prevent a man getting a pension. I know of some men who were navvies before the war. They were gassed at the Front, and although outwardly they seem all right, they go to pieces when they tackle heavy work. The Board says that they are one-tenth incapacitated, and that they can find light employment. They cannot get such employment. They are told to look for clerical work, but they have not the education requisite for that work. In fact, the avenues in which they can be employed are limited. If a man&#39;s occupation when he enlisted was that of a general labourer, and after his war service he is incapable of resuming that occupation, his disability should be liberally provided for. </para>

                            <para>- In some cases he should get more. A clerk who loses his left arm is not incapacitated to the same extent as a labourer who has diseased lungs through being gassed. A principle of British justice is that 100 guilty men should go free rather than that one innocent man should be punished; but that principle is being reversed, and 100 de-  serving men are refused a pension because one man is a malingerer. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment I now move, so that the Board, which I hope will not long continue in existence, may be deprived of one of the barriers behind which it now shelters. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope the amendment of the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham)</inline> will be agreed to. it is becoming more and. more apparent that, so far as the Government are concerned, there is being witnessed a repetition of that which has happened in respect of every Government of every country in the world following every war that has ever been fought, with which Governments have had to do. While this country was involved in the war every conceivable promise and inducement was held out to men to go away and fight. Now, however, the Government are doing all they can contrive to evade their responsibilities. It cannot be said that this Act is being sympathetically administered, or is giving satisfaction to returned soldiers. Every chance of  cutting down pensions is being availed of. If the word &#34;substantially&#34; is left in the proposed new sub-section under consideration it will be practically impossible for a large number of former soldiers, who are unquestionably entitled to pensions, to obtain any measure of assistance or relief. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government are anxious to comply with the wishes of Parliament, especially those expressed by former soldier representatives. But to omit the word &#34; substantially&#34; would leave widely open the question concerning whether a man&#39;s war service had in any way contributed to his death or incapacity. If the word is deleted there will be given to the Board, which is called upon to determine very difficult matters, no form of direction whatever. The Government are now bringing within the scope of the pensions legislation a completely new class of former soldiers; and while there are general complaints that the Board is not sympathetically administering the Act, I am bound to point out that it has had no direction from Parliament concerning how it should proceed. I say that in fairness to men who have had a very serious and extremely heavy task to perform in respect of almost a million beneficiaries. To date nearly &#163;24,000,000 has been distributed. That task has imposed upon the Board far more difficult obligations than honorable members realize. There is an obligation, first, to the soldier and, secondly, to the country, which has to find the money, to show that the expenditure is justifiable. If honorable members can agree to substitute something more properly applicable than the word &#39; &#39; substantially &#34; the Government will be prepared to accept it. What is required is a word, or a phrase, which will indicate the degree to which a man&#39;s war service has contributed to his disability. </para>

                            <para>- The Government will be prepared to accept that word in lien, of &#34;substantially&#34;; but to leave out the latter and replace it with nothing would mean that the Board is given no direction. The probable effect would be to leave the intended participant completely at the discretion of the Board. The Government desire to do away with the position which has been created, namely, that the Board, while being blamed all over the country, has really had no direction from the Parliament or the Government in respect of the granting of pensions. The Government have now taken responsibility - as I have just mentioned - for including within the ambit of the Act, a large new body of participants; and if this question is left open many of those who had enlisted in good faith, but whose condition of health did not enable them to participate in the war, may actually be found &#39;to be more materially benefiting now than those who served at the front and lost limbs. The Prime Minister has pointed out that if the intentions of the Government, with respect to the administration of the Act, are not carried out sympathetically internal changes will take place respecting the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Board. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members who have interested themselves in these hard cases have become tired of making what appears to be hopelessly unsuccessful appeals. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has just referred to a very large sum which has been distributed in the form of war pensions. He has mentioned also the fact of the Board having been appointed at a time when the call upon Government funds for the payment of pensions was at its height. It occurs to me that the Board was obviously given instructions to cut down expenditure in this direction. </para>

                            <para>- Let me suggest that there are 100 men who have returned from the war. The doctors who examined them soon after they had reached Australia, certified to their incapacity, whereupon they were given pensions. These men were unable to do any work, even six months later. The pensions were reviewed, and the doctors who had originally examined them again overhauled the incapacitated men, and they continued to draw their pensions. At the end of twelve months, however, a Board was appointed, and immediately pensions were cancelled right and left. The Government now desire that the word &#34; materially &#34; shall be inserted in lieu of &#34; substantially.&#34; I say frankly that I have no faith in this Board. I feel confident that our men will not get justice from it, and I know that the outcome will be that members of Parliament will continue to be constantly appealed to. The Assistant Minister will say, as he has said all along, &#34; Give me specific cases and I will undertake to have inquiries made.&#34; The Minister has been given all the particulars of many a case, and, of course, he has sent them on to those very officials who have already dealt with the cases. Naturally, their replies indorse their own attitude. There are, perhaps, twenty or thirty returned men in my own district who can do no work, or, at best, can only take light employment. There is no hope of their return to their one-time highly remunerative work of coal getting. Some are required to support a wife and several children. Their pensions have been cut off. </para>

                            <para>- Applications will be referred to the Board, and it will be for it to say to what extent war services have contributed to the applicants&#39; condition. I have a case in which a man complains of the smallness of his pension. The Board cut it down to the minimum, and said that only one-sixth of his incapacity was due to war services. If the Board can make such a nice calculation as that, it does not matter whether we have a qualification or not. The, Board has proved itself unsympathetic enough, in all conscience, and, judged by past experience of it, will not grant a pension unless war services have substantially contributed to the condition of the applicant. The Board will deal with each application for a pension as if the word &#34; substantially &#34; were in the clause. </para>

                        <para>. - The overwhelming bulk of the men who went to the war have been repatriated or pensioned, and there is no complaint to be urged on their behalf, though there will always be hard cases on some border line. Under the law as it stands, when a&#60; man applies for a pension on the ground of incapacity, the Board says to him, &#34;Has your incapacity resulted from any occurrence while you were a member of .#the Australian Imperial Force, or from your employment in connexion with naval or military preparations or operations?&#34; There is no difficulty where the applicant has lost a limb, or an eye, or has been wounded, but where the complaint is a break-down in health, the case is often a difficult one to deal with. Should ill-health be established, the question is, Did the conditions of the applicant&#39;s war service contribute to it? Under the Bill a period spent in a camp will be counted as war service. In any camping, rheumatics, or some such trouble, may be picked up. Then men may have been knocked down, or have fallen from horses. Without the word &#34; substantial,&#34; the war will have to be regarded as having contributed to a man&#39;s condition, though it might be only to the smallest extent possible. It is impossible to say how I became deaf, whether it was because I got wet on one particular day or on some other day; but were I among those covered by the Bill, I could claim that my war service had contributed to my condition, and it would be impossible to gainsay me. The doctor would be compelled to give me the benefit of the doubt, and put me on a fund from which has been expended already &#163;23,000,000. In addition, the Government has spent &#163;89,000,000 om returned men in various ways, and has given pensions to 222,000 persons ; -so that it cannot be said that our soldiers have been treated illiberally. As a private member I have done what I could for the soldiers, and I will continue to do everything I can to help them. The qualifying words suggested by the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> are acceptable to the Government, and surely the honorable member, who is a doctor and was a soldier, can speak with some degree of authority in this matter. If at the end of six months the measure is not working satisfactorily, and some persons are shut out from its benefits who ought not to be excluded, I shall have it amended, or, if necessary, put another Board in place of the existing Board. </para>

                            <para>- I do not appreciate the Minister&#39;s point. It applies to men who have been seeking a pension under the principal Act, and unless the word &#34; substantially &#34; he struck out it will afford them no relief. My experience of the Board satisfies me that it will make use of the word &#34; substantially&#34; whenever it can do so to defeat an application for a pension. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that would be an improvement. There are a great many men who, because of the attitude taken up by the Board, are suffering an injustice, and it is our duty to see that justice is done them. In my opinion, the Board has done enough to justify its abolition, and if honorable members were to vote in accordance with their experience of it, it would be immediately abolished. This is neither more nor less than camouflage. The Government have promised to give these men relief ; let us see that they get it. If we do not strike out the word &#34; substantially,&#34; any number of men will still be denied the pension to which they are properly entitled. They ought to be able to get justice without having to call in the help of a member of Parliament. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment. </para>

The Bill now before the Committee provides the necessary machinery to enable the High Court to exercise that jurisdiction. During the war this jurisdiction was exercised under the Judiciary Act and the High Court Procedure Act 1915, but the provisions of the measures were limited to the period of the war and six months afterwards. </para>

                    <para>. - I would like to hear the opinion of honorable members upon the method of selecting juries for civil cases heard before the High Court. It is provided in the original Act that the State laws and rules applying to the selection of juries  shall  apply to the selection of juries for the High Court, but this has resulted in grave dissatisfaction and complications. For instance, the qualification and the method of compiling the jury lists in Victoria are entirely different from those in New. South Wales. In a democratic country such as we claim to be, it is not fit tin  j*  that the juries for the High Court should be drawn from what I may term the privileged classes of the community. The result of this practice is that the juries  aTe  not representative of the people of the country, and are in many cases biased against the men of the political faith of those who sit on this side of the House. The Labour party claim that in a democratic country any man who is a reputable citizen should he eligible for any position. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of whether men are eager to serve; a man serves because it is demanded of him as a duty to be performed in the interests of his country. It is curious to reflect that a man, while eligible to become a member of this Parliament, and make laws, may not serve on a jury in the High Court in Victoria or New South Wales. .Such a fact is a disgrace to the community.  I do not speak as a legal man, but I can say that the question has been discussed for a considerable time by the Labour party, who have been watching for an opportunity to obtain an expression of opinion from this Chamber. There is a great principle involved. Men eligible to sit in Parliament are not eligible to sit on a jury, because of the reactionary legislation by &#34;diehard&#34; Legislative Councils, particularly in Victoria and New South  Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I am complaining that the Bill does not deal with the matter, and I intend to move an amendment to insure that it shall. In Brisbane the High Court juries are selected on quite a different qualification from that in Victoria or New South Wales, and are drawn from a different class. In Victoria there is a &#163;3,000 property qualification. I may say that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> was fully seised of the importance of this question, and strongly urged that, when a Bill of the character of that before us  was  called on, we should take steps to move in the direction I have indicated. Honorable members will admit that in Australia, and, perhaps, in the British Empire, there was no sounder lawyer than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> and, moreover, he&#39; was a great Democrat.  His  appeal in certain litigation is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and therefore cannot be discussed; but when it has been disposed of, and opportunity offers, there may be some revelations in this Parliament in regard to the jurymen and the attitude they adopted. As a fact, we are convinced that no Labour man has a chance of justice before the High Court in Victoria, because of the way in which the juries are constituted. Apart from that, the principle adopted in the two main States is wrong, and it is that principle we are fighting, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> fought. &#34;He used to point out how a man is eligible to elect another man into Parliament, and to enter Parliament himself, and make laws, but, owing  to the legislation of the reactionary laws in some of the States, he is not qualified to sit on a High Court jury. Such a man may, in a Supreme Court, try a man for his life, or, at the Quarter Sessions, decide a case which may mean imprisonment for years, but he is not eligible to sit on a jury of the High Court. It is, I submit, the duty of this Parliament to register its opinion on a question so important, and it should be possible for us to so legislate that the jury lists are prepared without any regard whatever to a property qualification.

                <para class="block">I think that amendment fairly covers the ground. It is undemocratic to say that because a man has not &#163;3,000 worth of property he is not fit to sit on a jury. The very fact that a man is worth &#163;3,000 worth of property may only prove that he is narrow-minded, ungenerous, and not humanitarian. There are many people who owe their wealth to the fact that all through their lives they have thought only of themselves, because, as a rule, the good-hearted man does not possess &#163;3,000. I believe that the great majority of the members of this Parliament, if they were to leave Parliament, would not be eligible to sit on a jury of the High Court in Victoria, although they may have enacted the very laws which the Courts are administering. I hope that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> will agree to this amendment, which has been too long delayed, and make whatever other alterations in the law are necessary to carry it into effect, so that future juries may be drawn from the great democratic section of the community. </para>

The idea has been to provide, as far as possible, that the practices and procedure of the various States where the High Court sits shall apply. The honorable member is asking us to override the laws of every State in Australia, and to introduce a new qualification, which will mean setting up entirely new machinery all over Australia. If ever there was duplication of machinery, and the creation of costs and difficulties, it is found in the proposal that the honorable member has submitted. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this measure is to effect two technical alterations in the Trading with the Enemy Act. It enables certain legal proceedings arising out of the winding-up of enemy companies to be completed. The necessity for this measure has recently become apparent as the result of the decision of the High Court upon an application made by the controller of the Australian Metal Company. The question raised in the application related to the settlement out of the assets of that company of certain claims by Australian companies and the Sydney Municipal Council. The Court dismissed the application on the ground, amongst others, of the absence of procedure applicable to the winding up of the Australian Metal Company under the Trading with the Enemy Act  1914-15.  This Bill makes specific provision for the making of applications to the Court by persons claiming to be creditors of an enemy company that has been ordered to be wound up, and authorizes the High Court or a justice of that Court to hear evidence and determine the question. Under the existing law, only the Minister can move the Court, and if the action be against the Minister he has to move the Court against himself. This amendment will enable other parties than the Minister to apply to the High Court. The other amendment in the Bill enables proceedings to be taken, notwithstanding that the time limit fixed in the Statute of Limitations had! expired, by excluding from such time the period of the war. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members, particularly those of us who have always &#39; contended that, the war being over, we should not continue to sing a &#34;Hymn of Hate&#34; against our late enemies, will welcome this Bill. It is another example of the charming inconsistency of the Government, who, during the war and subsequently, reiterated from every platform throughout Australia that they would never again trade with our late enemies. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that he would resign from the Government if any attempt were made to resume trading with Germany. I remind him of this fact when at last he has apparently been converted to our way of thinking. </para>

                            <para>- It has everything to do with it. We are now about to resume trading relationships with our late enemies, the Germans, who, prior to the world war, were our friends, and some of whom were relatives of the great dignitaries of the Empire. Of course, in those days, war between Germany and Great Britain was never thought of. In my opinion, the Government are acting inconsistently when, whilst  prepared  to trade with Germans in Germany and to purchase their goods, the result of long hours of work and low rates of pay, and produced in competition with Australian workmen, they, at the same time, are expropriating Germans in our own territories. Make no mistake, the Germans will recapture the markets of Australia with their cheap products, to the detriment of our own people, and we are driving Germans out of British territory to Germany, where they will work in competition with our artisans. I particularly refer to the German nationals that we are expropriating from the former German Possessions in the Pacific. _ We 3hall trade with those people when they have returned to Germany, and buy their goods which are produced in competition with our own people. </para>

                    <para>Its main object is to bring the patents law of the Commonwealth into line with English law, so far as regards the duration of the original term of a patent and the extension of the term. At the present time the term of a patent is limited to fourteen years from its date. The Bill proposes to increase the original term to sixteen years. At the same time, provision will be made to reduce the period for which the term of a patent may be extended to five years, or, in exceptional cases, ten years, instead of seven and fourteen years respectively. Thus a patentee in ordinary cases will be eligible to have the full benefit of his patent for twenty-one years, as at present. The reduction of two years in the period of extension in exceptional cases is proposed for the reason that the period of ten years is considered quite sufficient in view particularly of the number of petitions made for extension. The number of petitions made for extension since the commencement of the 1903 Act is seven. The original term of existing patents will be extended to sixteen years, subject to the condition that any licences granted by the patentees will be extended for a like period. As regards the extension of the term of a patent, under the existing law the Court, in considering its decision, is required to have regard to the nature and merits of the invention in relation to the public, and to the profits made by the patentee as such, and to all the circumstances of the case. During the war, however, , some patentees were, on account of the existence of hostilities, prevented from successfully exploiting their inventions, and consequently suffered loss or damage. The Bill makes special provision for those cases, and proposes to enable a patentee who has so suffered loss or damage, including loss of opportunity of dealing in or developing his invention owing to his having been engaged in work of national importance connected with the hostilities, to make application to a Judge in chambers for an extension of the term of his patent. In such a case it will only be necessary for the patentee to satisfy the Court that the loss or damage suffered by him warrants an extension. This privilege, however, is not proposed tol be granted to patentees who are subjects of a country with which Great Britain was at war, or which are companies carried on for the benefit of such subjects. Under the existing Act a petition for extension of the term of a patent must he made art least six months before the original term lapses, and there is no provision for the extension of the time for presenting the petition. The Bill proposes to give power to the Court to extend the time whether the proceedings are by petition or originating summons. In connexion with rights of priority of patentees under international arrangements, the Bill proposes to extend the protection, at present afforded to the patentee only, to the legal representative or assignee of the patentee, </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to know whether the provisions of this clause will prevent the printing, over a design or trade mark, of.  another design. Oases have come under my notice in which manufacturers in the Commonwealth have placed upon their goods a name or design to indicate their grade and quality. These goods are placed on the wholesale market. Sometimes a retailer who purchases them places over the original design or trade mark his own trade name or some other design which obliterates the registered design by which the goods are known. I understand that there is no provision under the laws of the Commonwealth which constitutes this practice an offence. If the regulations mentioned in this clause cover the situation, well and good; but if not, I desire to move an amendment which will effect that purpose. </para>
