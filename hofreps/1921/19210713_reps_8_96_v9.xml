                        <para>- My impression is that there is no lack of shipping, but I understand that flour is not a remunerative cargo, owing to the lack of back loading. My opinion is that shippers fight shy of flour as a cargo, because it does not pay them to carry it. It is a regrettable circumstance, but there it is. </para>

                            <para>- It is an answer that fits the case. As to the first part, it is true that there is a very great deal of distress throughout Australia, and amongst unemployed soldiers. In accordance with the promise I made yesterday, the Government have considered the question. In the first place, I should like to make it clear that this is not a matter of soldier repatriation. The Government never undertook to keep soldiers in employment in perpetuity. What we did undertake was that when the soldiers returned, they should be restored as far as possible to the same position as they occupied before the war in regard to employment. It is claimed by the Repatriation Department that this has been done in a very generous way. </para>

                            <para>- All I reply to the honorable member for Macquarie is that he has had no personal experience of that. The position is that all the returned men. have either repatriated themselves, or have been repatriated by the Department, and it was never contemplated that the Department should carry a soldier until his life ended. It merely undertook to give him a start on his return to Australia. That was done. </para>

                            <para>- The bulk of those soldiers who to-day are, unfortunately, out of employment have already received very generous and ample assistance from the Repatriation Department. Every obligation undertaken by that Department has, I think, been fulfilled, and this question of unemployment, there fore, is not at all a matter of repatriation. Many of these men have been back from the war for three, four, and five years, and have been in employment nearly the whole of that time. To-day, unfortunately, they happen to be out of employment. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister a question with reference to the proposed advance of £2,000,000 for the purpose of the Burnett lands settlement scheme. I am in receipt of a telegram to-day from an unemployment committee in Brisbane, to the effect that a resolution has been carried at a mass meeting urging me to move the adjournment of the House in order to discuss the proposed £2,000,000 loan for this scheme, with a view to absorbing the unemployed. It is not possible for me to take that step to-day, at all events, and, perhaps, the same purpose can be achieved if I address a question to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the right honorable gentleman be good enough to make a statement with regard to the intention of the Government in this matter, and will he, if possible, make the loan that is desired ? </para>

                            <para>- If the Commonwealth Government can help in any way to relieve the situation, that is quite another matter. I hope that the conditions now obtaining are extraordinary and abnormal - that the present unemployment may be only of a temporary character. One cannot say, however, because it is a trouble that is afflicting all countries; it is part of the process of the readjustment of industry, and arises from world causes over which we have only the slightest possible control. But it is an ugly and nasty position to face, and, I hope, in speaking as I do, that I may not be accused of want of sympathy with those unfortunate people who find themselves in a condition of unemployment to-day. What I have in my mind at the moment is to see if we cannot get into communication with the State Governments to the extent, at any rate, of assisting some of the more distressful cases amongst the returned soldiers. If that could be done I should not be at all averse to making available a small sum of money for the purpose of relieving the most urgent cases. </para>

My trouble is that I have not the millions to hand over; and I shall proceed very shortly to ask the people of the country to give me a further loan for the purpose of discharging our own immediate obligations to the soldiers.

                            <para>.- My reason for taking this course is that I deem it to be a matter of very great importance that the representatives of the people of Australia in the National Parliament should give ready and willing approval and support to any movement for the permanent preservation of peace among the nations. of the world. That is the main purpose for which I submit this motion. I have subsidiary purposes, which are referred to in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> and (c), of the particulars of the matter of definite urgent public importance to call attention to which the motion is moved. I refer to the necessity of requiring more exact information of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference now sitting in London, and also the necessity of imposing some limitation upon the powers of the Prime Minister of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> particularly in the matter of approving of any commitment in regard to foreign relations. The whole of the people of, not merely Australia, but the British Empire, and I suppose the whole of the peoples of the world, must have been gratified at the invitation extended by the  President  of the United States of America to a conference at Washington, which will deal, among other subjects, with the question of the limitation of armaments. I think it well that the views of the people of Australia on such an important matter should be voiced in the National Parliament. It is necessary for us to show that, although the Prime Minister happens to be in London, the Government of Australia is here, and it is very desirable that our views, giving support to any move in the direction named, should be known promptly. It should be known that we favour anything that makes in the direction of the permanent preservation of peace. I hope that anything I may say may not be regarded as uttered in any party spirit. My reference to the Government of Australia being here in Melbourne, and not in London, arises out of the fact that a tendency has been shown quite recently to leave in the hands of the Prime' Minister in London matters that, in my opinion, should be dealt with here. I refer to an answer given yesterday by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to a question put to him as to trading with Germany. The right honorable gentleman said the matter was being considered in London, and when I asked him who was considering it he replied, " The Prime Minister." We ought to be able to decide such a question here, and, moreover, it ought to be promptly decided. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I suppose almost everybody will agree that it is desirable that something should be done for the preservation of peace and to avoid the horrors of war. Quite apart from the distress and misery that are wrought by war, we all desire that the tremendous burden of taxation, which falls upon all the people, and largely upon the ' workers - the tremendous burden involved in remaining prepared for war - should be lifted. No one has less to gain and more to lose by war than the workers. It is, therefore, meet that any move in the direction of the maintenance of permanent Peace should receive the prompt approval of the representatives, of the workers. </para>
                        <para>It is hardly necessary for me in a House so well informed as this to refer to the many resolutions that have been passed by the representatives of Labour not only in Australia, but in other parts of the world, indicating their desire to have something done in the direction of not only the limitation of armaments, but absolute disarmament. It may 'not be possible to bring about disarmament in the very, near future, but that ought to be the ultimate object. It is the ideal condition in which the Nations of the world should be. Meantime we may hope that something can be done in the direction of the limitation of armaments. I should like to refer to a resolution passed by the British Labour party on this subject, and also to the views expressed by one or two prominent statesmen and military men upon the question. On 22nd April, 1919, at the Independent Labour party Conference, held at Huddersfield, a resolution was passed unanimously to this effect - </para>

Against such teaching the mind of this country will rise in indignant -protest.' It will demand that the disarmament of the enemy shall be followed by the disarmament of the Allies. If the statesmen will not take the lead iri abolishing war, the peoples of Europe will abolish it themselves* by their own direct action. </para>

                        <para class="block">The move taken by the  President  of the United States of America in calling the proposed Conference to deal with the subject of the limitation of armaments presents, I think, a fitting occasion for us to express our- approval of such action, and to venture the hope that the result of the Conference will justify our expectations. It will help to strengthen the possibilities of its achieving success if the Parliaments, including those of the overseas Dominions, take the opportunity to definitely express their views. </para>
                        <para>I wish to refer now to the views put. before Parliament by the Prime Minister concerning the  Anglo-Japanese  Treaty. In the course of his statement, prior to leaving for England as the delegate for Australia, the right honorable gentleman made no reference to the question of the limitation of armaments, and the fact was pointed out at the time. He confined himself to the narrow ground of the renewal of the . Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The Prime Minister made no reference, either, to the rights of China. The Treaty has to do largely with affairs in. the Far East, with the rights, ' or the claims, of Great Britain and of Japan, and of others, to certain privileges in China. Further, the Prime Minister made no reference to the views or wishes of the. Chinese. I am glad to note that the Conference suggested by the  President  of the United States of America will include a representative of China, because the interests of that country are considerably involved in any Treaty which may .be finally concluded between the respective powers. In the speech delivered in this House, the Prime Minister showed a distinct tendency to subordinate the interests of Australia. . </para>

                                <para>- That was my impression, and the impression conveyed to sections of the press which do not usually accord support to the Labour party. It was pointed out that the Prime Minister had expressed views which might have been expected 100 years ago of the type of man known as " Little'Englander." That, at any rate, was the comment of one of the leading Melbourne journals. The Prime Minister not only then revealed a tendency to subordinate Australia's interests, but he is showing the same in his utterances on the other side of the world. I need only call attention to the contrast between his attitude and that of the Prime Minister of Canada. I am expressing the views not only of the Labour party, but of a large majority of the people of Australia, when I say that we require a great deal more information concerning the Imperial Conference than we are getting. </para>

We have even  had slabs of speeches actually delivered in this House cabled from London back to Australia, and being paid for by somebody. </para>

                                <para>- The Prime Minister is claiming credit for something which is diametrically opposed to what he put before this Parliament before he left for England. I hope the motion will lead to some step being taken to secure exact information of what is happening in London. And, because the information! which we are at present receiving is inexact, and because we know that the representative of Australia is differing from the representatives of other great oversea interests, such as Canada and South Africa, it is all the more necessary that we should place some limitation upon his powers. Further, before he can bind Australia to any commitment regarding foreign relations, it should be determined here that any such proposal shall be subject first to ratification by the people of Australia. I moved in that direction, indeed, before the departure of the right honorable gentleman, and I pointed out that it was desirable that we should know the views of Canada and South Africa, and how far the interests of China were involved; and that we should, if possible, take a bird's-eye view of the whole situation after having threshed out and discussed every aspect in conference. Thus only, and not until then, could the people be expected to come to a conclusion. I was not, and am not now, prepared to leave this grave matter entirely in the hands of the Prime Minister; neither are the people generally. It is for that reason that I have framed the third paragraph of my motion. From the scanty information I have been able to obtain through the press reports, it would appear that the Prime Minister of Canada favoured a referendum on the subject. </para>

                            <para>The Anglo-Japanese Alliance has been the greatest disturbing factor of peace in our Par East, for it has emboldened japan to make descents on China on every opportunity. Wo Chinese keenly feel the affronts, indignities, aggression, suffered from Japan for the sake of peace. On the Pacific tradal interests and friendly intercourse the renewal of the Alliance would be most unfortunate. We appeal to you to direct your representatives at the coining Convention to debar its renewal. </para>

                                <para>- The same message may have been sent to the Conference. At any rate, it has been sent to us in the hope that we may pay some heed to its statements. I do not wish to say a word which could be construed as hostile to the Japanese. I have no hostility to that nation, and desire to be on the most friendly terms with it. I think that we can have friendly relations with them, . and can consider their interests in the Pacific, and at the same time give due and just consideration to the representations of China on points which that country wishes us to bring before our representative in London. I have drawn attention to this matter entirely because I deem it to be of paramount importance that this Parliament should express its approval of, and give help to, any movement for the limitation of armaments. I hope that when this limitation has been achieved a further step may be taken,  and that conscription may be simultaneously abolished in all countries. As General Smuts has said, conscription is the tap-root of militarism, out of which grows war. This is a step in the right direction. Therefore, I consider that I am not only justified in moving the adjournment this afternoon, but that I was in duty bound to make plain what I conceive to be the views in this matter of the vast majority of the people of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Great Britain and Japan declared last year that the Treaty, although in accordance with the spirit, was not in accordance with the letter of the Covenant of the League, and they have agreed to revise it, to bring it into accord with that covenant. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition desires that we shall support the United States of America in endeavouring to bring about a reduction of armaments as proposed by  President  Harding. I agree with him that we should not say anything to offend any nation, and throughout my public life I have endeavoured to avoid giving offence. I have heard members in this House, or outside of it, refer in objectionable terms to the United States of America, but I think it is a mistake to do so; and although I hesitate about curbing liberty of speech and the liberty of the press,. I think that there should be a law to prevent any newspaper from ridiculing foreign countries as a certain print has ridiculed Japan, because such ridicule does nothing but harm. </para>

                                <para>- I have never reflected on the Japanese nation, though I have pointed out that the rates of wages paid in Japan are lower than they should be. While not desiring to offend the United States of America, or to reflect on  President  Harding, I ask honorable gentlemen whether that country, whose last  President  was really responsible for the League of Nations,' has done right in standing out from the League, and in endeavouring to set up a new League, apparently in opposition to it? </para>

                                <para>- One of the main reasons was that the American people did not wish to join a League that appeared coercive, and to become entangled in European complications. That has been their attitude all along, although, no doubt, owing to the war America will find, as Australia has found, that it will be very hard, for any civilized country to keep out of any world war that occurs in future. The only way in which nations can keep out of war is by promoting and fostering the League of Nations. I invite the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rya'n),</inline> who, by his reply to my interjection, appears to be in favour of the League of Nations, to have the maintenance of the League placed as a plank on the platform of the party he represents. I do not believe we shall bring about any reduction or limitation of armaments unless we support the League of Nations. </para>

The Covenant of the League of Nations is a great Charter that we should all support, and if we will but act up to it we shall not require any of those international agreements for which the Covenant of the League of Na.tions provides. Certain regional understandings are respected by the Covenant, but in view of the attitude of some public men towards the League of Nations it will be impossible for some nations that have signed that Treaty to absolutely abandon their agreements. I cannot now discuss what might happen if Britain denounced the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. </para>

                                <para>- I am unable to say what the particular objection of the United States of America is. But I know that there are certain individuals in America and in the United Kingdom who are engaged in the endeavour to stir up strife between the people of the two countries. I have been informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hearst</inline> is one of those gentlemen in the United States of America, and the proprietor of <inline font-style="italic">John Bull,</inline> in England, is another.  But the people of the two countries should not be misled into hostilities by these men. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not think this House can be expected to exhibit its best paces on an important set of problems of this kind suddenly sprung upon it. If the circumstances were such that the invitation of  President  Harding, or any other world development, demanded an expression of opinion by the representatives of the Australian people, it would be far better to attempt it upon due notice, and then honorable members, irrespective of their party adherence, might display what they considered to be the feelings of the Australian people. I do think, however, that the honorable and learned gentleman who moved the motion was correct in interpreting the unanimous view of the Australian public to be in favour of peace, its establishment and maintenance, and a strong yearning towards disarmament; and, if we debated the matter for weeks, we would not find one dissentient from those theories. Therefore, I do not think we need waste much time in admitting that that is the expressed opinion of the representatives of the Australian people, irrespective of parties, in Parliament assembled. I would not have risen but for the argument of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> in regard to the reports from the Imperial Conference. I do not wish to reflect upon our representative or any representative at the Conference, but there are only three ways in which the publicity in connexion with a Conference of this kind could be conducted. The first was to admit the reporters, and deal with the problems of Empire openly in front of them. If these were normal times I would not object to that procedure in respect to some of the questions to be decided at the Conference, but to-day the world is disturbed to its taproots; and until the flux disappears and stability returns it is a dangerous experiment for any world-wide Empire to open its doors to other nations so that they may hear the counsels of the overseas Dominions and the Government of the central Kingdom. Admitting that procedure to be impolitic at the present time, the next best course would be for the Conference to deliberate in private, and for its  chairman  to issue an official report at the close of each sitting or periodically throughout the week's session. That is the most desirable and practicable form of publicity in all the circumstances, and I regret that that course is not being followed, although the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> suggested that an official report is issued every day. If that is so, the public are not informed of it. I have read the cable messages in the metropolitan press, and although following the matter at close quarters, and with deep interest, I have seen no official report. The information published divides itself into two parts. The first comprises statements made by delegates of the respective Dominions. In our case we hear most of what the Australian </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Prime Minister says, and except in regard to communication between the parts of the Empire by ocean or by air, practically nothing of what is said by others. The other questions, foreign policy, defence, and the renewal of the AngloJapanese Alliance, were dealt with prior to the Prime Minister's departure, and on them we heard his pronouncement. What I appeal for is a presentation of a two-sided discussion. If, for example, there is a conflict between the two great Dominions of Canada and Australia, due either to a different conception of their interests or to temperamental differences between two leaders, we should know what the views of Canada and Australia are, and how far it is possible to reconcile them. T do not think we can get that information unless we have a clear report from the Conference itself, described as an official record. The next method is self -reporting, which I think is dangerous as leading to self-glorification by the leaders of all the Dominion Governments. We see in almost every line of the cables hazardous guesses of pressmen anxious to inform the Dominions, stating that, " It is" on reliable authority reported," or, " It is commonly understood," and so on. That class of information is bad enough in connexion with political gatherings here in Australia. We see it when the Labour party meets in private conclave, either in Caucus in the House or in conference in the constituencies; and those of us who have been some time in- politics know how little one can  rely  on the guesses of pressmen outside locked doors as to what transpires inside. </para>

                                <para>- Sometimes they get very near to the truth. I have known pressmen to guess with such wonderful clairvoyance that one has been almost able to put one's finger on their informant. I have no doubt we have all had experience of that kind, but we know the unreliability that is likely to creep into such guesses. I do not believe that this Empire, so weighty in its parts and so light in its links, can be held together and governed in critical times of its history by hazardous guesses of pressmen or by the self-advertisement of Dominion leaders. I hope it will not be thought by the Acting "Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> that in my case, at any rate, whatever he may think of the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> at present leading the Opposition, I have any desire whatever but to obtain exact and safe information which the leaders of the Empire feel that they ought to give to the different parts of that Empire. That is all I appeal for. It is true, as the honorable member for West Sydney has said, that no man can say whether he will be in favour of the renewal of a Treaty the final form of which he has not . seen. But in recent utterances which I have felt obliged to make in my constituency, as doubtless other honorable members have done, I have expressed the desirability of a renewal in a certain form. </para>

                                <para>- Subject to the non-forfeiture of the principles on which this nation has founded its union; I refer to the policy of a White Australia. I have also conditioned it, as the Prime Minister did, and as numbers of honorable members did, by a strong desire that America shall be satisfied with -the form of the contract. .In more recent utterances I have submitted that the interests of China should be considered. Without attempting to also appreciate, let alone explain, the possibilities of conflict of interests in these great Asian dominions, I have said that I thought that Great Britain would probably be better able to influence the sympathetic consideration of Chinese interests by Japan if she were in alliance with Japan than if she had broken the alliance. I say, further, and I say it as no hasty utterance, but as one arising out of as much thought as I have been able to give to the problem, that I think that Britain and this part of her Dominions, including Australia and New Zealand, are much, safer in a free alliance in treaty form with Japan that we should be without a treaty of any kind. The renunciation of the Treaty- after this Conference would place Japan midway between two alternatives - either of remaining in a state of " splendid isolation," to use the immortal phrase of William Ewart Gladstone, or seeking new alliances that might be less friendly to America and to Britain. I would sooner see the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> preserved by an oriental alliance than risk a renunciation and a search for fresh partners either by Japan or Britain. That is all I think one need say at this stage on that point. </para>

                                <para>- I was about to deal with that. There were three questions which the Prime Minister elaborated - the question of defence, the question of the AngloJapanese Treaty and its prospective renewal, and, thirdly, the general question of foreign policy. As to the Treaty, the right honorable gentleman laid down the conditions on which he would be prepared to accept a renewal, and without which he said he would bring it back to this House. To those conditions there was no objection in the House, either by silence or utterance. </para>

                                <para>- So far as I remember, the Prime Minister, in dealing with that phase of the question - which he has since elaborated in more definite form, according to the cables, at the other end of the world - said he would do his best to have the Treaty in such a form that it would secure the concurrence of the authorities of the United States of America. That is all, I think, to which he pledged himself. Later on, if the cablegrams are to be trusted, he said that it was essential that America should approve, and I think he went further and suggested that she should be a party to the compact. </para>

                                <para>- Quite; I am not complaining as to the honorable member's consistency, but as to his unreason, which is quite another matter. However, may I also be permitted to say how heartily I agree with all that has been said in favour of the proposals for disarmament ? Right from the beginning I have placed my faith in the ultimate sanity of the American people; from the beginning I have advocated, with all my heart, mind, soul and strength, closer relationship .between the English-speaking peoples. I have believed, and I believe profoundly to-day, that that offers the one hope of ultimate peace to this weary, war-stricken world of ours; I see no other prospect but through some combination of this kind. America is a nation which has emerged from the war with her resources undiminished and her strength  unsapped,  and both by reason of her inherent strength, and of her position in the world, she is the one nation able to take the leadership of this movement for disarmament - it so comports with all her traditional experience, it is so ingrained into the very texture, the very warp and woof, of the American character and American life. I am glad, indeed, to see that both France and Great Britain are giving their whole-hearted support to the leadership of the American people in this movement. I hope nothing will intervene to prevent this Conference taking place, or, when it does take place, to prevent the happy consummation so devoutly to be wished. </para>

                        <para>It is impossible in my judgment to discuss in the press details of what is proceeding in the Conference. Take the question of reparations. Undoubtedly there will be the widest divergencies of views as to the allocation of the amount coming to the British Empire and the basis on which it shall be distributed. That in itself is a matter which I should imagine would give rise to controversy. </para>

                                <para>- I know exactly what our bill is, and have taken care that we should know what it is ; but differences of opinion are likely to occur even concerning a question of this kind. Then, again, take the question of the government of Egypt, which is being considered just now, and in which we are more closely and vitally interested than any of the other Dominions, since Egypt is at the very gateway of our entrance to the Mother Country. Are the details of that question to be discussed in public? Are we to discuss the details of that question opening out and ramifying as it does into all sorts of delicate international relationships, and all sorts of delicate racial questions as within the Empire itself? Do not honorable members recognise how impossible it would be to discuss such a question publicly, or even to publish the details of a two-sided discussion such as is suggested by the honorable member for Balaclava ? Tha less we discuss these questions iri the open the better will be the result of the Conference, and the better, I submit, will be the result when the discussions have had their way. When we send a plenipotentiary; to discuss these delicate questions,  ramifying into  all kinds of international by-ways and into the sphere of diplomacy, we must be prepared to trust him. In no other way of which I know can such matters be safely discussed. There are some matters which might very well be published to the world, but it is not for me to say what should be published. It is for the combined Conference to determine what shall be given out, and it does so, and issues to the press every evening a statement of the day's proceedings. </para>

                                <para>- It is well known that the New Zealand attitude agrees with our own. New Zealand is in favour of a renewal, but desires that care shall be taken that in the renewal of the Treaty nothing is done, if possible, to antagonize the United States of America. That is our attitude and the attitude of New Zealand, but it is not, or has not been up to the present moment, the attitude of the Canadian delegates at the Conference. There has been a difference of opinion on that point; that much has been made clear by such communications as have been issued by the Conference itself. </para>

                        <para>I come now to the position of the Prime Minister. What has arisen since he went away, I wonder, to make it necessary to send after him these instructions? I venture to say that since he has been in London no possible exception can be taken to any attitude that he has so far assumed, and of which we have any knowledge. He has defended the interests of Australia with rare and conspicuous ability - with rare and conspicuous patriotism - and I marvel at the man who can cavil at his attitude as we are hearing and reading of it every day. Never has this country had a better, more intelligent, more patriotic representation at the Seat of Empire than it has to-day. Here is what the right honorable gentleman said before he left these shores, and I take it that every word of this statement still holds good - </para>

                            <para>If I am asked whether the Commonwealth is to be committed to anything done at the Conference, I say quite frankly that this Parliament will have the amplest opportunity of expressing its opinion on any scheme of naval defence that is decided upon before the scheme is ratified. As to the renewal of the Treaty with Japan, this is my attitude, and I submit it for the consideration of honorable members: I am in favour of renewing the Treaty in any form that is satisfactory to Britain, America, and ourselves. I am prepared to renew it in those circumstances. Jf it is suggested that the renewal should take a form which would involve the sacrifice of those principles which we ourselves regard as sacred, I am not prepared to accept it. In such circumstances, I shall bring back the Treaty to this Parliament. </para>
                            <para>I think I have put the situation fairly, and, since these matters hare sometimes to bc settled quickly, I want honorable members to say whether they will give me the authority I ask for. With regard to the expenditure involved in any naval scheme, the House will not be committed to the extent of one penny. The scheme will be brought before Parliament, and honorable, members will be able to discuss, and accept or reject it. If honorable members say that we ought to accept the Treaty in any form, whether it involves the sacrifice of those principles in which we believe or not, I cannot agree; but I am prepared to agree to anything short of that. </para>

                            <para>.- The motion is good in that it enables honorable members to do two things: first,  to secure by the expression of their views a much more complete record of what is transpiring at the Imperial Conference - for I hope that that will be the outcome; and, secondly, to indicate a unanimous wish, that Australian opinion should be represented, if possible, at the disarmament Conference, and, indeed, that it is the desire of Australia to see a reduction of armaments throughout the world. It has been a misfortune that the United States of America has not become a member of the League of Nations, but the next best condition for the peace of the world is an alliance of the English-speaking peoples, which  President  Harding, in his first official utterance, announced as one of his objectives. Hie idea was that the English-speaking peoples should draw more closely together for the carrying out of common duties in the world, not so much, for the exclusion from the brotherhood of others, but for the better brotherhood of all others. I trust that the present movement inaugurated by  President  Harding will be consummated at no distant date. The opportunity has come by which  the only important element outside of the League can take a distinct place with the other nations, and we all urgently desire to see specific results from the President's invitation. </para>

                        <para>One other important point has been raised to-day, namely, the need for Australia having better representation in London, and for a better system of dealing with our external affairs, here and at Home. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George has said that the proposed Conference will overshadow the Imperial Conference. Is it necessary that, whenever a vital gathering such as has now been projected is to be held on the other side of the world, and whenever our external relations are to be considered, the business of this country must be held up just because we have not yet provided, as other portions of the Empire have done, for a proper arrangement, or sequence, of our international functions? When the British Minister for Foreign Affairs is away the House of Commons still carries on and transacts full public business. Australia has now come to the parting of the ways; she has been admitted, though not, perhaps, full grown, into the comity of nations, and she discovers new " national and international obligations. </para>

                        <para class="block">Government of this country should, at any time, and always, be held responsible for its attitude towards foreign policy just as for its domestic policy. Our isolation has forever gone, and, in this regard, it is utterly necessary that Ministerial duties should be so rearranged as to permit a constant channel of communication between the centre pf the Empire and the Commonwealth Government and Parliament. There is a new orientation of affairs, both foreign and domestic, in which Australia is involved; and the need for a re-arrangement of our system of government in order to cope with our obligations is strikingly apparent. Also, there is now, more than eVer, need for increased economy and control in all our public services because of those increased obligations. </para>
                        <para>In my view, to submit all treaties, including the .specific Treaty under debate, to the direct arbitrament of the people would be impossible. But the Government should be prepared to take full responsibility for its negotiations, just as the Government of Great Britain must accept responsibility for the various treaties and alliances in which Britain ia involved.. </para>

                                <para>- But Parliament can undo the Government. It is impossible to expect continuous negotiations between the whole of the people of one and the whole of the people of another nation'. There must be fully credited and responsible plenipotentiaries; and the only way in which they can be adjudged is by making them responsible direct to the . Parliament, and thus, finally, to the people. I maintain that the assurances which the Prime Minister gave that he would bring all fresh Treaties back to this Parliament, and which have been emphasized to-day, were satisfactory in all respects. He laid down definite conditions, and the Government must be looked to to make them good. We should be satisfied with that position; but if the promises referred to are not kept, it must be for Parliament to take acttion. </para>

                            <para>.- I was pleased to hear the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and to note that he approves of the  view  that this Parliament should receive fuller information concerning what is taking place at the Imperial Conference. Thehonorable member for Cowper -(Dir. Earle Page) also expressed the view that there should be more complete information supplied concerning events in London. It was pleasing to hear these views today from the leaders of the various parties in this House. In the past Australia has suffered through the paucity of information given to us about foreign affairs and our relations with and responsibilities to other countries. At Conferences dealing with matters of far-reaching importance we have been committed to burdensome agreements without the approval of our people being sought ; but the time has now come when Australia must be consulted in regard to all these matters. Every member of the population, no doubt, would approve of the general disarmament of the nations, and the statesmen of the world might well work for that. The recent war, with its immense sacrifice of human life,- wealth, and material, in the barbarous struggle of nation against nation,, has revealed to us most strikingly the need for other arbitrament in international disputes than that of the sword. I welcome the proposals of the  President  of the United States of America. "We can all join with him in giving encouragement -to a policy of disarmament. As to the treatment of Australian interests at the Conference now being held in London, I think that we in Australia are entitled to more information. We cannot consent to be committed to the renewal pf the Anglo-Japanese Treaty without being heard on the matter. It is only reasonable that this Parliament should be asked to ratify any agreement before it binds this people. I, for my part, shall insist on expressing the views on this and other matters of those whom I was sent here to represent. Suppose that, as a result of the present misunderstanding between the Chinese and Japanese, they came into conflict, how do "we know that Australia might not, under the terms of the Treaty, be compelled to fight on the side of the </para>

                        <para class="block">Japanese against the Chinese ? Or, suppose there was a dispute between the United States of America and Japan about the Island of Yap, from which radiate communications linking up the East with America and Australia, how should we stand under the Treaty ? Should we be compelled to fight .on the side of the Japanese against our American cousins? ' I, for my part, am not ready to shut my eyes and open my mouth and accept what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> may choose to give me. I wish to know all about these matters in advance, and the' people .of Australia should be instructed concerning them. If the renewal of the Treaty is a good thing, and likely to benefit the people of Australia, there should be no secrecy about it. </para>

                                <para>- It is in the melting pot now, and none of us know how it will emerge from the Conference. But before it is ratified we should have an opportunity of expressing our views upon it. I should welcome any means for maintaining friendly relations between Great Britain, the United States of America, and Japan; but I am opposed to the acceptance of any Treaty until its conditions are known and understood. The proposed Treaty may contain the germ of another world conflict. </para>

                                <para>- I am one of those who think that more information should be given to the people of this country about what is taking place at the Conference in London at the. present time, especially considering the enormous issues at stake. Of course, no one would wish a word to be said which might jeopardize the success of the important work in hand. I am sure that there is not a man in Australia who would desire another war. The wrecks made by the last war are too much before our eyes, and we have not forgotten the terrible loss of life, and the maiming of human beings that it caused, while the financial troubles which followed in its train are still with us. We must, therefore, all pray that we may never have another war. Fortunately the prospects of peace never were brighter than they are to-day. The news from. Ireland is most gratifying. I believe that the King's speech at Belfast has done more to secure the good-will of the people of Ireland than anything that has occurred for generations. </para>

                                <para>- And the mediation of one of the biggest intellects under the British Flag to-day.,. the Prime Minister of South Africa. I hope that the result will be that before long we' shall have a Parliament sitting in the South of Ireland and another in the north, giving to the people of that country Home Rule, which will afford them every satisfaction, and that this will remove one of the stumbling blocks to. the progress and peace of the Empire. As for the' invitation of the  President  of the United States of America to the nations to try to bring about the limitation of armaments, we welcome it. I regret that the great Republic did not do before what it is doing now. Had America thrown in its lot with the League of Nations the peace of the world" would have been secured. I hope that the treaty with Japan will be renewed. There can be no doubt that if we were to reject the alliance with Japan another alliance would be formed which would be a menace to the peace of the world. . I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will cable to the Prime Minister in London asking if there is any further information in regard to these great matters which can be safely given to the. people of Australia; and, if so, to send it to us. I do not think it is at all likely that the United States of America will consent to the British Dominions being represented at the Conference which  President  Harding has convened. The Acting Prime Minister, who was at the Peace Conference, will recollect that one of the greatest objections which the United States of America had to joining the League of Nations was that, because of the Dominions having separate votes on the Council of the League, the British delegation would have greater voting strength than would the United States of America. </para>

In reading the election speeches of. the Republican leaders, I found that one of their gravest objections to the League was that the granting of votes to the British Dominions would give to Great Britain a preponderating strength in the deliberations of that body. </para>

                            <para>. - I fail to see why this debate should have been promoted at all, and I am afraid it may be regarded as a reflection on the man whom we unanimously chose to go to London to do good work for Australia. It was generally conceded that Parliament was wise in sending the Prime Minister to England supported by the House's expression of confidence in him. We should not do anything by word or vote that would reflect upon him or convey the idea that we have changed our views since he left Australian shores. On the contrary, everything that has happened tends to show that he is acting wisely. There is proof of that in the fact that the  President  of the United States of America has expressed a notable change from the views which we understood were held by the American people until recently. I think it very likely that the opinion expressed by this House before the Prime Minister's departure helped to bring about that conversion. Australia has as much at stake in this regard as any other country in the world, for what country would run greater risk from a misunderstanding between the nations? We should at every opportunity show to the outside world a united front on this matter. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> usually gives careful consideration to these questions, but on this occasion he has acted unwisely in initiating a discussion which might create an idea that the Opposition, at any rate, holds an opinion different from that expressed by the House before the Prime Minister left for England. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 join with other members of the Opposition in expressing profound regret and disappointments at the inadequacy of this Bill. It will fail entirely to carry out the promise made by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to provide legislation which would secure protection, not only for the manufacturer, but for the employee and the public generally. This is to be much regretted, for the present is a signal opportunity, by means of a properly administered Tariff, to establish the Commonwealth on a firm industrial basis. As a matter of fact, the Bill does not disclose any really serious intention' on the part of the Government to deal with those commercial agencies that are now working to rt,ne detriment of the public by undue inflation of prices and the non-observance of those fair and reasonable conditions that should govern the industrial life of this community. Even supporters of the Government have expressed themselves as quite dissatisfied with this measure, and have not hesitated to express their scepticism as to its efficiency. It is possible that, with my inexperience of political life, I had considerable faith in the promise of the Minister for Trade and Customs, only to find it misplaced; and, in future, I shall certainly be more careful about accepting assurances of the kind. The honorable gentleman has not taken advantage of the opportunity presented to test the question, and place the powers of the Commonwealth absolutely beyond dispute. I have endeavoured as a layman to acquaint myself with the legal side of the question, and, after considerable research, I have satisfied myself, as I hope to be able to satisfy honorable members, that this Parliament has every power to deal with protected industries, and to see that those employed in them, and the public generally, receive just and reasonable treatment. I candidly confess that when I was regarded as one of the minor lights in the Labour movement, while the Prime Minister was a prominent and formidable figure, I was under the impression that these powers were not within the Constitution; but I have since investigated the matter, and, though recognising, my own limitations; I have come to the conclusion that it was a wrongful decision by which the High Court, in 1908, subordinated the Commonwealth. The case before the Court, <inline font-style="italic">The King</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barger</inline> dealt with an Excise matter. An Excise Bill 'had been passed by this Parliament in 1906, when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne was Minister for Trade and Customs, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin took a very interested part in the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, who " was the Attorney-General of that day, gave the House the advantage of his legal learning, and assured honorable members that there was nothing in- the measure to invalidate it under the Constitution. In the High Court, a majority decision was given against the Commonwealth by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith,' the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> .Higgins dissented, and, at length, substantiated their contention that the decision was not in accordance with the desire and design of the framers of the Constitution. The chief reason why the Bill was regarded  a3 <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> is to be found- in the words of the head-line to the case, " Implied prohibition," as shown in the report of the case in volume VI. of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports '</inline> of 1908. That was the chief consideration upon which the learned Justices based their judgment. It was sufficient, in their opinion, to justify the decision that the Act was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It is further set out in the head notes to the judgment that the Court held that - </para>

As a layman that does not appeal to me as sound law. To the credit of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> be it said that long before the judgment of the High Court in the later case of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers was given he declared his absolute conviction that the Commonwealth Constitution gave this Parliament sufficient power to deal with those who were unduly raising prices and exploiting the people in respect of the commodities required by them. It is most satisfactory to find that opinion confirmed in this later judgment of. the High Court, and we are justified in the circumstances in supporting such an amendment as is now before us, since it would enable the Government at the earliest moment to test the question that was decided against the Commonwealth in 1908. The judgment in <inline font-style="italic">The King</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Barger</inline> unduly curtailed the powers of the Commonwealth Legislature in respect of taxation, although sound argument had been advanced that the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth in that regard were equal to those of the States.

                    <para>If we have not power to impose an Excise duty, subject to certain conditions, I fail to' see that our powers have any range at all.

                    <para>The Australian Constitution was based very largely upon that of the United States of- America, and although the Constitution of the United States of America has been in operation for something like 150 years, and Congress-' from time to time has taken to itself very wide, powers of legislation - especially in connexion with the imposition of Excise duties - with respect to the domestic  concerns  of the States, every attempt to show that, such legislation is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> has absolutely failed. In the light of experience drawn from America in support of the belief that the judgment given in 1908 was unsound, we have a perfect right to ask the Government to afford a test. ' The grant of powers to the Federation, under the Constitution, was intended to be absolute. The reserve powers given to the States did not permit, or include, .any right of interference with those specifically granted ta the Commonwealth. There is no reserve power possessed by the States under which they may enter into the realm of those powers conferred upon the Federal authority. According to section 90 of. the Constitution, this Parliament has 'absolute and supreme power over Customs and Excise. ' If the Excise Act of 1906 is adjudged <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> there can certainly be no power held by the States to give effect to legislation of (he kind. It is plain, then, that the power of imposing excise must belong to someone; and, if the specific authority is iti doubt, we have a right to claim that a. case be cited before the 'High Court  in  order that the whole situation' may be cleared. If the measure of 1906 had been enacted in the United Kingdom, or in any other unified State, it would have been regarded as thoroughly constitutional. The powers of the Commonwealth in this matter are plenary and absolute. There is nothing within the Constitution which can justify the view that an Excise measure is unconstitutional. Following the matter further, and dealing with the contention concerning, an ' implied prohibition, I call attention to the latter portion of paragraph II.. of section 51, " But so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States." Nothing contained in the Excise Act of. 1906 suggests any intention to discriminate between States or parts of States. Without doubt, . the law was to apply equally and universally. That circumstances may differ in one State from those in another has nothing to do with the Federal authority ; they will be purely local and locally governed. It might be contended that our income tax legislation affords undue discrimination between States or parts of States in that, because- there are larger' families in Queensland than in South Australia, a greater measure of exemption is granted to the people of Queensland. The fact of there being larger families in one part of Australia than in another is a circumstance which is purely local. The powers of income taxation, are universal and uniform. Further developing my argument, I remind honorable members that an Excise Act was passed by the Federal Legislature making it possible for certain persons to secure exemption, in the sugar industry, if they employed white labour only. The idea was to deal effectively with Kanaka labour. That Statute demonstrated the power and control held by the Federal authority over ari industry and over the conditions which should govern it. That Act has never been challenged; it. still stands; and, so long as it remains, I maintain that there is power within the Constitution to afford protection to' those engaged in any industry, . both concerning the rates and the conditions governing it, and the prices which should be charged for the commodity produced by it. Concerning the matter of the division of power between Federal and State authorities, there is considerable difference as- to where the purview of the one begins and of the other ends. A good' principle has been laid down, however by Chief Justice Marshall, of -the United States of America, who, in giving judgment in the Supreme Court, in the case <inline font-style="italic">Givens.</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Odgen,</inline> stated: - </para>

The measure did not impose the conditions for the carrying on of an' industry. No one could be sued in any criminal or civil Court for. neglect to- apply certain conditions to his industry.

                            <para>- That is not provided for in the Bill. The Ministry propose merely to set up another Board, and that will be of no direct advantage to the people. . The smallness of the remuneration which the members of the Board are to receive proves that the Government does not seriously intend to effectively prevent captains of industry from charging the people exorbitant prices, or from refusing the proper industrial conditions to their employees. I hope that this Parliament will accept its constitutional obligations, and by agreeing to the amendment take a step towards the exercise of the power which correctly belongs to us, and thus prevent the injuring of the consumers by the extortions of the manufacturers whose industries we have protected. </para>

                        <para>.- If I thought that the Tariff Board would merely have to make an annual report to Parliament, I would not support the Bill, because it would be merely creating another Board such as we have had in the past. The Inter-State Commission made a Tariff investigation, but the Government paid little or no attention to its reports, on the ground that they were made some years ago,, and that circumstances had so altered since that they did not meet the ease. If the proposed Tariff. Board is not going to keep its fingers on the pulse of commercial and industrial activities, reporting immediately to Parliament when alterations of the law are necessary, it will be useless. Therefore, this Board will be, or should be, different from any Board of which we have had experience in the past. </para>

No honorable member will advocate high prices and unfair dealings, and the proposed Board will give us a better chance of coping with such matters than we have ever had' before, because, if \a manufacturer is acting unfairly, Parliament can deprive him of the protection afforded by the Tariff. That is the most direct way in which an offender can be hit. </para>

                            <para>- What more effective action could be taken under the amendment proposed by the honorable member - for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> to prevent the manufacturer treating the public unfairly ? Time would be wasted by obtaining reports, and taking action, before the High Court; whereas, by the machinery provided in the Bill, Parliament can reach the offender at once, and punish him more effectively than would be possible by a long process of anti-Trust legislation and kindred enactments. I am not enthusiastically in favour of the  Board, .because I realize the danger of creating another sub-Department, which may make only periodical reports instead o'f dealing with every reference promptly and in the right way. It is possible for a Board comprising three members of the right stamp, and working in the proper way, to render the country an incalculable service. But any other sort of Board would merely mean the burden of an <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> additional sub-Department. confusion worse confounded, and a hindrance instead of a help. </para>

If you do not conform to those conditions Parliament will reduce the duty or repeal it." Action of that kind is the benefit I expect from this Board. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members do not seem to appreciate the- difference between the proposed Board and others. This body will be in direct and constant touch with the Tariff, and Parliament should have reports and recommendations upon all the changing circumstances' of commerce and industry. Its position will not be on all fours with that of the Inter-State Commission. If I did not see a chance of some practical benefit emanating from this proposal I would not espouse it ; if the Board is merely to make the compulsory annual reports it will not satisfy me. If necessary, the Bill can be amended in such a way as to oblige the Board to report with reasonable expedition upon every reference to it. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> argued last night that the decision of the High Court" in the case brought by the Amalgamated Engineers against the Adelaide Steam-ship Company overruled the earlier decision of the Court in the Barger case. Certainly that decision did overrule a lot of other decisions, but I doubt if there is any member of this House who, without a close study of the judgment, can form an opinion as to where the High Court's pronouncement actually leaves us. It overruled some well known decisions ; but not the Barger case. </para>

                            <para>- So far, the High Court has not said so. We can achieve more under this Bill, if it is operated as it is intended to be, than would be possible if the suggestion contained in the amendment were adopted. If we rely upon the general powers conferred by the Constitution to see that manufacturers charge only fair prices, there will be almost interminable delays before finality is reached; whereas the machinery provided in this Bill will enable Parliament to speak at once. If Parliament can deal with the manufacturer, what need is there to proceed further, having regard to the fact that in many cases the manufacturer sells direct, through his agents or travellers, to the users. There is a chance of some good being done under this Bill, but I desire to be certain that the Board shall report quickly to the House, so that Parliament may deal with the matter before the conditions change. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable  member is 'quite wrong. The amendment gives no indication of what is going to be done under it - or how it is to be carried into effect - whereas the Board has a chance to do something practical and expeditious. If a manufacturer is charging fair prices there is no need to go any further so' far as he is concerned ; but if it is desired to deal with  retailers,  then general legislation of an anti-Trust character will be necessary, involving much greater powers on the part of the Commonwealth than are given in the Constitution, even though the recent decision shows these powers to be greater than we o thought they were. </para>

                        <para>. -During the consideration of the Tariff, which this House has just passed, I, and I feel sure, other honorable members, felt the necessity for more definite and reliable information regarding the many industries affected by the protection which it was proposed to afford, and I, at least, found that the necessary information in very many cases was not forthcoming. It must be quite obvious that, although honorable members generally are familiar with a certain number of industries within the Commonwealth, they cannot have a sufficient knowledge of the whole of the industrial life and- manufacturing interests of the Commonwealth to be able to judge what is fair and reasonable protection to alford in every instance. The honorable member who is anxious to do what he believes to be the right thing in the interests of the whole community-, and is not prepared, as some are, to go to any lengths to keep out the imported article, in. order to insure that Australia shall produce the whole of its. requirements, feels 'this need for further information... We were overwhelmed with literature purporting to give information regarding, the different items in the schedule as we came to them, but most honorable members will admit that information obtained from such sources could not be regarded as reliable, since it came from interested parties. I feel that a Board constituted on the lines proposed in this Bill could, and' would be able to supply Parliament with the particulars that are absolutely desirable and necessary if a considered vote is to be cast. If for no other reason than that I would support this Bill. </para>

                                        <para>have long held the opinion that, although it may not be possible for us to regulate prices generally, it should be possible to deal. with those manufacturers who may be charging unreasonably high prices for their goods, and who are. receiving the benefit of a highly protective Tariff, by withholding or abolishing the duty. If a manufacturer can obtain excessive prices for his goods, then obviously the necessity for a highly protective duty in respect of them does not exist. That, I think, will be conceded. If we are going to give manufacturers the benefit of high protection, the public in general are entitled to expect that they shall be dealt with fairly by the manufacturing community. I am not going to say that we would be justified in attempting to regulate prices generally throughout the Commonwealth, nor that we should be justified in restricting trade, as I believe we should by trying to insist upon all imported goods being sold at fixed rates, such as would be considered by a Board, after inquiry, to be reasonable. But I do say that the public generally, who have to pay for the protection afforded our manufacturers, have a right to insist upon those manufacturers " playing the game " by them, by supplying their manufactured articles at what is considered to be a reasonable price. The honorable member for Maribyrnong, in the first part of his amendment, proposes practically to deal with the regulation of prices in the way proposed by the Bill as it stands. He speaks of obtaining " adequate guarantees for the primary producers and consumers generally that they can obtain locally-manufactured articles or goods at reasonable prices." That is, in effect, what the Bill proposes to do. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, the abolition of the duty is the only remedy the honorable member could put forward, and, therefore, I think his amendment is unnecessary. I do not know to what extent he expects the House to go to insure an adequate guarantee to the consumer  that he will secure his manufactured goods at reasonable prices. Everything depends, of course, upon the interpretation of the word "reasonable." Coming to the second part of the amendment, we find that it refers to " the securing of proper wages and conditions for these employed in protected industries." I admit "that this Bill does not attempt to regulate the conditions obtaining in protected industries. In that; respect the amendment goes very much further than does the Bill. I take it that the honorable member, in referring to a guarantee that the consumer shall obtain his goods at a reasonable price, means that he wants to insure that the prices of our manufactured products shall be fairly cheap. He wants the wages of those engaged in the protected industries to be very much higher; he wants the employees to have better conditions and shorter hours; and, at the same time, he desires that the consumer shall get his goods at lower prices. I do not know how it is possible to have shorter hours and higher wages and at the same time to have lower prices. </para>

                    <para>I am interested particularly in the constitution of the Board and in the action likely to be taken by the Government upon receipt of a report from that body. Some criticism concerning this matter , of procedure has been offered by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has given an assurance that should there be anything unsatisfactory in the verbiage of the clause dealing with the procedure it will be amended. It is proposed that the Board, after making due inquiry, shall report to the Minister. Parliament should take action, and not the Minister. I am not willing to delegate to the Minister any more powers than he possesses to-day. I am not sure that I would not withdraw from him some of the powers given under the Customs Act. It is not sufficient for the Minister merely to lay the report upon the table of Parliament. Parliament should be able to deal with such questions as reductions, or increases, or the abolition of, duty. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that cleared up. It will be agreed that the constitution of the Board is all important. The honorable member for Balaclava has suggested that the projected fees will be quite inadequate to secure the very best men, I hold that the members  should be paid fixed salaries. The whole of  their time will be occupied by their duties. With regard to the constitution of the Board, I agree that an officer of the Department should be its chairman; but, in the selection of other members, I hope that whatever Minister or Ministers may have to make the appointments from time to time, they will not allow their own views or policy- namely, as between Protection and Free Trade - to influence them. It is well that the Minister for Trade and Customs should bring before Parliament a Tariff so framed as to conform with the policy publicly announced by his Government; but, when it comes to a matter of selecting the <inline font-style="italic">-personnel</inline> of the Board, prejudices' in either direction should not be given rein. Any one who has been associated with an organization advocating a Protectionist policy should not have a seat as  a member of the Board any more than an individual who is a well known advocate of Free Trade. I am not one who believes that, simply by offering high salaries, the best brains are to be secured. First of all, men of character are wanted, men of natural ability. The mere fact that a man has been successful  in business  will not necessarily fit him more fully than any other to sit upon the Board. It is likely that a man who has had some experience in varied "branches of industry will prove more valuable than a successful business specialist. I believe that the Board will be able to give to the Minister and Parliament information which will prove very helpful upon occasions when the Tariff has to be revised. I do not expect that the Board will do everything that is desired, but it is an attempt in the right direction. While I sympathize with the objects of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> I cannot support his amendment, because I think that it would be ineffective. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that if' we were to have a Tariff Board it should have been before the Tariff schedule was discussed. When we were considering the Customs and Excise Tariffs every manufacturer in the country placed information before us, and it was impossible to know what figures were reliable and what were not. Members, however, received information from all sources, and had to judge of its value as best they could. The proposed Board, apparently, is to do what each member did for himself during the Tariff debates. It is going to collect information on Tariff matters, and this information will be placed before Parliament; but it will remain for members to discuss the <inline font-style="italic">pros</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">cons</inline> of every proposal, just as they have done recently. Should a Board be appointed, I think it will not be wise to pay its members at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 5s. a sitting for working intermittently. The members of any Board should be independent of manufacturing and business interests, so as to be able to deal with matters without bias or prejudice, and for such men the proposed remuneration would be insufficient. It will be necessary to appoint to the Board, should a Board be constituted, reliable men, who. will be paid decent salaries; but I see no need for a Tariff Board at all. Clause 14 requires the Minister - to refer to the Board for inquiry and report any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection' afforded to him by the Tariff. It will be very difficult to say when a manufacturer is doing that. Who is to determine what is an unfair profit? A manufacturer possessing, a large plant, and having a big turnover, may, if his management be good, be producing at a very much lower cost than another in a smaller way ; but could it be said that the smaller man was charging too much because the larger man was making a good profit by charging the same prices for his goods? Besides, it is often not the manufacturer, but the middleman, who makes the big profits ; . and there seems to be nothing in the Bill to prevent the making of profits by the distributor. In the past, many of our woollen mills have sold their output for a term of years at specified prices, giving, of course, a fair profit. But the Flinders-lane merchants, who have purchased the goods, have charged very high prices for them, and have made much bigger profits than the manufacturers. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that sort of thing. The Bill does not go far enough to protect the consumer of locally manufactured goods, and I cannot see how he is to be protected. We have had one set of lawyers declaring that this Parliament possesses certain powers which enable it to fix conditions of manufacture, and another set declaring that it has not those powers, so it is hard for a layman to make up his mind as to the constitutional position. </para>

If it had not been for the definite promise made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> two years ago, we might now be getting a reaper and binder for £80  instead of having to pay  £103 for  one, and this under a  10  per. cent. Tariff, while under the  45  per cent. Tariff, . a binder will cost us about  . £130,  while the Canadian farmer can get a similar machine for  £60?  I cannot see that the Bill will benefit in any way the purchasers of articles manufactured in this country under the Tariff. </para>

I thought I made my position quite clear, but, in view of the speech just made by the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson),</inline> I shall recapitulate briefly what I conceive to be the position in regard to the Tariff. As a Protectionist - and I claim that no policy but Protection is sound for this country - I pointed out that it is the duty of Parliament, which has control over the imposition of Customs duties- </para>

                    <para>Mr.RYAN. - I do not wish to listen to the speeches fn another place. I desire to reason this question out from bedrock principles, and not by means of catchpenny arguments. For a country like Australia a protective policy is necessary. By no other method can we make this country great and self-contained. If we fail to realize the necessity for making it self-contained, which can be done only by a policy of Protection, we have utterly failed to learn the lesson of the war. If anything has been driven home to us by the war it is that a community must be able to produce, within its own borders, all things necessary for the carrying on of the community, and must not be dependent for supplies upon markets overseas. If Australia had been dependent upon overseas countries for everything she required during the war she would have been in a very bad position. But, as a corollary to a policy of Protection, it is necessary that Parliament, which imposes that policy, shall follow it to its logical conclusion and insure, so far as lies within its power, that the consumers and primary producers receive their manufactured requirements at reasonable prices. Surely no one can cavil at that policy. The Minister has failed, in this measure, to bring forward proposals that will protect the primary producer by insuring that he will get his machinery at a reasonable price, or that will insure proper conditions for those engaged in protected industries. </para>

                            <para>- Something may be said for those who contend that there is no constitutional power to act, and also for those who contend that there is such power, but nothing can be said for those who merely criticise and say that we can do nothing. T submit that we can do something, and that it is our duty to do it. I congratulate the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Penton)</inline> and the other honorable members who spoke from this side of the House upon their clear exposition of the law in regard to the power of Parliament to act in this matter. They have dealt very fully with the interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court in 1908, and recently in the case brought by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers against the' Adelaide Steam-ship Company. It has been clearly demonstrated that the High Court, as at present constituted - Chief Justice <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Adrian</inline> Knox, and Justices Isaacs, Higgins, Starke, Rich, and Powers - has definitely decided that the doctrine on which the Barger case was decided in 1908 is now exploded, and that the Commonwealth Constitution must be decided according' to. the principles laid down by the Privy Council in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Webb</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Outtrim</inline> and according to the meaning of the plain language contained in the document. </para>

                            <para>- That is a fact that the honorable member need not have come into Parliament to learn. But to-day the Court is composed differently from what it was in 1908, and its recent decision definitely overrules former decisions by a majority of the High Court'. Those decisions which interpreted the Commonwealth Constitution in a narrow way represented the views only of a majority of the Court, namely <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor; Justices Isaacs and Higgins always dissented from that view. </para>

                            <para>- I have nothing whatever to say against them. They were three very able men and three good Judges. If I were discussing them I would have nothing but the highest encomiums to pass upon them. But I am dealing with the decision's of the Court in an abstract way, and I say that a full Bench of the Court as now constituted has decided that the doctrine upon which the decision in the Barger case was based is now exploded, and that for the future the reasoning applied by those three learned Judges shall not apply. Therefore, I contend that we have power to legislate on lines similar to the Excise Tariff Act which was held to be invalid in 1908, and, as was pointed out by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> to pass legislation similar to the Sugar Excise and Bounty Act, which, as honorable members know, was passed in order to secure the employment of white labour in the sugar industry in Queensland and abolish the employment , of coloured labour. So much for the power of this Parliament. It does not rest with me or with the Minister or with members in the Corner to decide the matter, but the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson),</inline> speaking as a member of the legal profession from the Government side of the House, has admitted that the arguments adduced by laymen on this side of the House are nearly conclusive. Even he is nearly convinced - I have no doubt that he is actually convinced, but will not admit it - that the contention from this side of the House in reference to the power of this Parliament is conclusive. Then, why not take a step, by means of effective legislation, or what will be effective legislation if it is passed, to carry out the objects I have indicated, namely, to secure to the primary producer his manufactured articles at a reasonable price and to also secure, what was the object of the Excise Tariff Act, the payment of proper wages and the observance of proper conditions in the manufacturing industries? It is our duty to exercise what we conceive to be our power, and have the question as to the existence  of that power decided by the High Court, which will be uninfluenced by anything said on this side of the House, or by members on the Government side, or by honorable members in the corner. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It is admitted that the Bill brought forward by the Minister does not profess to do anything to secure proper wages and conditions for those employed in the manufacturing industries. The Government did not set out to do that. It is admitted, also, by a majority in the House that there is no effective provision in .the Bill to insure that the primary producer should secure manufactured articles at reasonable prices. </para>

In other words, honorable members in the corner say that we can do nothing, and that our talk is so much make-believe. I shall address myself to that aspect of the case, and show how something can be done. It is admitted, and it is common ground, that if this amendment is carried there will still remain only the remedy proposed in this measure, namely, the power to reduce or remove the duty upon any protected article. But the honorable member for Maribyrnong proposes to go further ; he wants, not only the remedy provided in the Bill, which, after all, is ineffective, but also to place upon the statute-book provisions which will, be effective in compelling the observance of certain conditions in the industry and the vending of manufactured articles at reasonable prices. For illustration, I need only refer to the Sugar Excise and Bounty Act. That measure provided for the payment of an excise duty unless certain conditions were complied with. Parliament there said, as it did in the Excise Tariff Act, " If you do not sell your manufactured article at a reasonable price, to be decided by a competent and independent tribunal, or pay a decent wage to your employees, you will have to pay an Excise duty." </para>

                            <para>- Not at all; the result was the same. Therefore, by the exercise of the Commonwealth power of taxation, it can be so arranged that an Excise duty is payable; but an exemption may be made in the case of those manufacturers who supply their manufactured article at a reasonable price to the primary producer. Is that not a way in which it can be done? Does any one question- do the members of the Corner party question - that it can be done in that way? Unless the amendment is carried it will not be possible to put in this Bill any such provision. If we do not take the present opportunity to deal with the matter, we shall not have another. </para>

                            <para>- The subject is too serious to be passed off in that way. What I wish to impress on my friends in the Country party is' that this amendment is moved for the purpose of doing something effective in the interests of the primary producers and others who come within its ambit. </para>

However, I do not wish to be drawn away from my purpose, and that is to endeavour to show that the amendment is the only effective way of achieving the objects we have in view. This Bill is, a milk-and-water affair - a stave-off affair, which puts a fetter upon the Minister. One of the Government supporters has said that this Bill will be useful when the next Tariff is before us; but goodness knows when that will be! . . </para>

                            <para>- The amendment would make the Bill effective,, and not necessarily mean a Tariff Board, seeing that the Minister, at the present time, has all the powers proposed to be conferred on the Board, and- can,, use the Tariff branch, of the Customs Department to make . all the necessary inquiries. The Commonwealth - has carried on - for all these years without any necessity for this Board: and why this sudden proposal, after we have passed the Tariff - after, the time has gone by when the information could be utilized ? This is a make-believe Board. . </para>

                            <para>- I refer to the Mill only so far as it is connected with- the amendment, and I am showing that the amendment will turn a make-believe into a reality. If - honorable members will not take this opportunity of doing something really effective, they will . have no further opportunity. The members of the  Country party cannot introduce a Bill and pass it, nor can we on this side; .we- can do nothing until; our friends on the Treasury bench bring forward a measure which we may amend, or re-cast. I repeat, that if we allow this -opportunity to pass, the chance of assisting the primary producer is gone. I hope that 'honorable- members will bear that fact in mind, and realize their responsibility when we come to vote. </para>

                        <para>.- We have had many Boards and many Commissions to. deal' with the -Tariffs, and what has ' become of them ? The ablest </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Royal Commission that I think was ever appointed by the Federal Parliament was that which dealt with the Tariff in' the first years of Federation. I am sure that the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will bear me out when I say .that that Commission appointed by both Houses was one of the ablest bodies of men that ever took evidence throughout Australia. The evidence taken was exceedingly valuable, and a Tariff Bill was introduced by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne not very long after the report was published, although that gentleman did not give effect to any one of the recommendations therein. We have had Boards and Commissions dealing with Tariffs and price- fixing ; and now it is proposed to ' appoint another. The idea is to appoint three men, who are to be the judges of all the industries, all. the company operations, and all the industrial life of this country. Why,' it is a positive farce! Supposing the members of this Board start out with an. investigation regarding harvesters - and they could not start on a much better commodity - by the time they have taken evidence and threshed it out, and presented their report to the 'Minister, they will have had to start another investigation in an entirely opposite line of activity. It is expected that three men chosen by the Minister will be experts on every conceivable subject under the sun. We have had' a very good example of such expectations in- the case of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, where .a Judge was expected to be an arbitrator in the shipping industry to-day, and in the shearing industry to-morrow - was expected to have a full knowledge of all the industries, all the lines of demarcation between the different trade union*, and pf all the differences between capital and labour. It is too much to expect any man to become an expert in all the ramifications of our industrial life. And may I be pardoned for saying that the result of. some of -the Court decisions - I say nothing reflecting on the honour or capability of the gentleman in question - would, have been ludicrous if they had not been so serious. Now. we are asked to appoint a Board, one member of which is to be selected from the Administrative Staff of the Department, and the other two from outside, who are expected to deal with all the phases of industry in Australia. This Board, T suppose, is expected to report to the Minister some' time, on this side of the Day of - Judgment! </para>
                    <para class="block">I object to any Government or Parliament trying to shirk its legitimate responsibilities. This Bill is a camouflage, an attempt to take away from the Minister the responsibility that is rightly his. </para>

However, the House, in its wisdom, has passed the Tariff Bill, and now it is proposed to appoint a Board, one member of which has hitherto been employed in the Customs House wholly and solely in dealing with imported goods. Heaven knows that some of the decisions given in the Customs House regarding these goods are peculiar enough ! </para>

However, if I had had information supplied to me as copiously as he had, I suppose I should not have been a very much worse judge than himself. With all due deference to the Government Departments, I may say that the fact that a man is a first-class Government official sometimes invalidates his judgment in outside business matters. He has given the best years of his life to the Service, and we know that service in the Customs House is particularly restricted. </para>

                            <para>- But what actual result have we obtained from its labours? We are now asked to repeat the same error. We are to appoint three gentlemen to this Board, and we propose to ask them, as experts, to advise the Minister and the Parliament on the intricacies, the expenditures, and manufacturing and labouring conditions of every  industry in Australia. No matter how capable these men may be, the result of their labours will be exactly that which has followed the appointment of other Boards. "We have already too many Boards in Australia. There is too great a tendency on the part of the Federal Parliament to place on outside Boards responsibilities which rightly rest upon itself. </para>

                    <para>After these various Boards have sat for months - and in some cases for years - after they have taken evidence all over Australia, and drawn up reports at very considerable cost to the country, what happens? Their reports remain a dead letter. Not the slightest attention is paid to them by the Parliament, and they have no actual result. Very good reasons will have to be advanced to induce me to consent to the creation of any more Boards. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it will not be of any service. On the contrary, it will be a source of irritation and annoyance. It will pester and worry people, and very often not the people whose business enterprises ought to be investigated. The Government propose under this Bill to appoint one Board to deal with all the industries of Australia. If honorable members were invited now to write on a slip of paper the name of the industry which they thought should be dealt with first of all, we should find that there was a very considerable diversity of opinion on that subject alone. Still, we are to have a Board, consisting of three men, who are expected to have expert knowledge of all the industries and all the ramifications of the industrial life of Australia. We have passed the Tariff, for good or for ill, and my contention is that we should stand up to it. </para>

                        <para>.- When the Tariff schedule was before us, I voted consistently for high Protective duties, with the object of establishing our industries on a sound footing, because the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> told us that the Government would bring in a Bill providing for the appointment of a Tariff Board which would remove anomalies and deal effectively with any monopolies that might be created to exploit the people. It was because of that promise that I voted consistently for a Protective Tariff. As the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.- Ryan)</inline> has pointed out, this Bill is very good, so far as it goes, but it stops short at the point of providing means for preventing manufacturers from charging too high a price for their protected goods. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> wants to go a step further. In effect, he says that it is all very well to take steps to prevent the manufacturer, who enjoys the benefits of a Protective duty, from exploiting the people, but we should follow up his goods and see that those who distribute them to the consumer do not exploit the public. It has been said that there are constitutional difficulties in the way of giving effect to the amendment. I am only a layman, but it seems to me that if it is within our constitutional power to prevent a manufacturer from exploiting the public, it should not be unconstitutional for us to go a step further and see that those who distribute his goods do not exploit the public. If we have power to regulate and control the prices charged by a manufacturer, we ought to have power to regulate and control those who sell to the consumer the manufactured article. The honorable member for Maribyrnong does not provide for more than that. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment, if given effect to, would strengthen the hands of the Minister. We have been told that if, as the result of a Protective Tariff, an industry is well established here the price of its products will come down. The Minister has pointed out that one of the consequences of the establishment of the agricultural implement making industry in Australia is that the price of such implements is lower here than in other countries. Why do honorable members of the Country party object to this Board ? They say that the man on the land has to pay too much for his machinery. Here is a golden opportunity for them to secure redress. The Country party should be prepared to support the creation of this Board. Upon its establishment they could ask the Minister to call- upon it to inquire and report whether or not the prices charged for farming implements are unreasonable. </para>

                            <para>- That is inclusive of theatre tickets. I am speaking only of picture shows. An amendment of the Tariff has been made, increasing the duty on films from  1½d.  to 3d. per foot. The extra duty derived from this source will probably cost the people concerned £60,000 to £70,000 per annum. I understand that the intention is to put an extra Id. on all tickets for the "movies." If that is done it will pay the tax and permit the picture people to pocket more than £400,000. If there were a Board constituted as I would like to see it, the added charge would be submitted to that body, and the public would thus be protected against exploitation. . I support the principle of the appointment of a Board, for its mere existence should have a tendency to keep prices down. But the Board should be given greater powers. It is stated that we cannot fix prices. But everything we buy has a fixed price. Some one, or some body, has put a &lt; price upon it. Would it not be better for a Parliament-controlled Board rather than some secret combination to do so? This Parliament will not be doing its duty unless it tries to protect the consumer, the worker, and the manufacturer as well. The question has been asked, How can one fix a price on a falling market? We should fix a price that will not come down ; that is the ideal. </para>

The amendment would prove a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be made the law of the land. Certainly, nothing can be lost by its acceptance. I have the utmost confidence in the legal opinion and assurance given by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr..

                        <para>. - I am not prepared to support, the Bill in its present form. I believe in having courts of inquiry and in tribunals for the collection of public data. But the Government have been misleading Australia in sending three men upon jaunts up and down the country just to collect reports of which no notice is taken. The Inter-State Commission had practically the same powers as this Board will have. The proposal here is merely to resuscitate a body of which nobody took the slightest notice. The Inter-State Commission made valuable investigations, came to. invaluable decisions, and rendered reports of which no notice was taken. This Bill is merely misleading the people. If honorable members are satisfied with it they are not hard to please. There was much railing on the part of members of the Country party during the course of the Tariff debate over the enormous prices which they were being forced to pay for implements by exploiting manufacturers, and they called upon the Government for some protection. They said, " Protect us against the people who in the form of Combines, charge us what they like, and who, by private understandings among themselves and with our own manufacturers, exploit us right and left." I said that I was prepared at any time, if the Country party were in earnest about the matter, to bring into operation the effective Protection set out in the platform of the Labour party. That is the only solution of the difficulty. While manufacturers are allowed to exploit the consumers there will always be the same difficulties. Not only have the farmers been robbed. The woollen mills are a very good example of what has been going on generally. These woollen manufacturers have robbed the people right and left. They have been merciless. Practically all the manufacturers during the past six years have absolutely robbed the people. The only difference between their methods and those of the pickpocket is that the one has been illegal and the other legal; and the former has been the worse form of robbery. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> proposes to give the Board certain powers. Ambiguous language is used in the Bill. Probably it has been so drafted on purpose. The Board may be asked to inquire into " the fiscal and industrial effects of the Customs laws of the Commonwealth." What does that mean but a close examination of the whole of the industrial affairs of the country? That would be an impossibility, and, therefore, the proposal is an absurdity. The Country party is now having the acid put upon it. If its members desire to protect country consumers, here is their opportunity. I appreciate their perplexity. I would suggest that they take early steps to get some of the farmers and settlers connected with the Law Courts to join their party, so that they may not continue at the disadvantage of having no legal opinion at their disposal on occasions such as this. The legal members of the Labour party have this to their credit, that they have been successful in the cases which they have taken to the Courts of Australia and of the Empire. Our  Deputy  Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has been highly successful with cases before the Privy Council, which shows that his law is as sound as a lawyer's law can be, though, with all due deference to him, that is not saying much. I have seen the legal profession upset decisions so often that I am afraid that I have not much faith in their interpretation of the law. After all, what is the law on a particular point is the determination at the moment of a body of men whose members are continually changing, and are, at best, subject to the failings of ordinary human beings. </para>

                            <para>- Quite a number of members have given the House dissertations on constitutional law, and I do not see why I should not do the same. So far as one can see, this Parliament has the right to impose a duty on any given article. It has also the right to abolish or reduce a duty, and it may withhold protection from an industry. Therefore, the threat of Tariff action where prices are unreasonable should be quite sufficient to do what is needed. That is not price fixing. </para>

The honorable member and other members of his party have said that they will do all in their power to prevent that.

                            <para>- You did not expect a proposal which would give you the protection for which . you ardently clamoured, but which you reject when it is offered. The members of the Country party cannot continue to sit on the fence. They must be with the Government and in favour of the exploiters, or with the Labour party against them. Every member of the Labour party went to great pains to make his position on the Tariff clear. We .said, "This Tariff does not suit us, but because we believe that Australia should be self-contained, we accept it until we can have it altered." Every member of the party reiterated the statement that he stands for the effective protection which is a plank of the Labour platform. Failing that effective protection which will protect the manufacturer, the workman, and the consumer, we exercised our discretion in regard to Tariff matters. We were not a united party when the Tariff was being dealt with. </para>

Every member of the Labour party has signed a pledge to support, advocate, and vote for effective protection, and could not remain in our party if he did otherwise. </para>

                            <para>- He has signed the pledge, and ho man would keep it more loyally. We know of the exploitation that is taking place, and we see that this is a make-believe Bill. We realize, and apparently the Country party realizes it, too, that the Bill as it stands cannot do what the Minister says it will do. We have, therefore, offered our solution of the problem, and it has been rejected by the Country party. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wimmera is loud in his declaration against it, and the honorable member for Corangamite has declared against it, and we have been told that it is unconstitutional. Its constitutionality, however, could soon be tested, and would soon be tested were our proposals put into operation. If they are not put into operation by this Government, they will be put into operation by the next. There is just one other point. The members of the Country party are afraid that if we start to fix prices it will not be long before the prices of primary products are fixed by law. </para>

                            <para>- It is that that the Labour party stands for. We have a policy regarding primary production. We say that the man on the land and his family should be paid a fair and reasonable wage like any one else, plus a reasonable profit. It is possible to fix the remuneration for labour, and to lay down the conditions of its employment, and it is equally possible to fix the price of a bushel of wheat or a pound of wool. </para>

                            <para>- The power this Parliament possesses over trade and commerce is set out in sui-section 1 of section 51 - " Trade and commerce with other countries and among the States." That limitation is an elementary fact, which everybody knows, and it is idle to lead the public to believe that this Parliament has power to interfere with any contract of 6ale made within a State. The utmost power we have in regard to commerce .within Australia is in respect of transactions between States. The honorable member for West Sydney must know that, in respect of sales within a State, we have no power of regulation under the trade and commerce provision of the Constitution, and that we have no Dower to fix directly or indirectly the price of goods sold within Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The sugar was bought and paid for by the Commonwealth, and is ours to do with as we please. In regard to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the amendment, " the. securing of proper wages and conditions for those employed in protected industries," the only direct power which the Commonwealth possesses is the arbitration power, which applies only to disputes extending beyond one State. There is no power whatever to single out any protected industry within a State.' Then we are thrown back upon the powers of taxation possessed by the Commonwealth by means of Customs and Excise. We cannot impose Customs duties, because these goods are not imported from abroad, but, are produced within Australia. Thus we are limited to the powers of taxation by means of Excise, and that brings us back to the decision in the Barger case, which still stands as the law of the Commonwealth. The High Court, judgment prohibits us from attempting, in the guise of Excise taxation, to interfere with industrial conditions, the regulation of which is reserved to the States by the Constitution. No one will seriously contend for one moment that we can attempt to legislate directly upon the industrial conditions within a State; that is distinctly reserved, by the Constitution, to the State authority. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member bases that argument upon the decision in the recent case brought by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers against the Adelaide Steam-ship Company. In that case the Court laid down what it believed to be the rule of interpretation, and quoted from a judgment of Lord Haldane, which included the following words :  - " I think that the only safe course is to read the language of the Statute in what seems to be its natural sense." The judgment of the High Court referred to other decisions of the Privy Council elaborating the principles of interpretation, and the honorable member for West Sydney argued that if the High Court will apply those principles of interpretation to the taxation power, it will wipe out the whole of the Barger judgment. I do not think the honorable member can have read recently the judgment in the Harvester case, or he would not make that statement. In that judgment the majority of the Court, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor, pointed out very distinctly that in the guise of one form of legislation, namely, the taxing power, this Parliament could not invade the powers which are reserved to the States; that in determining whether a particular law is or is not within the power of the Commonwealth Parliament, regard must be had to its substance rather than to its literal form. </para>

Such matters were to be dealt with by separate laws, as to which the competency of Parliament could be examined and determined upon independent grounds. The proviso in the Act in question cannot, of course, be regarded as " of no effect," for to do so would be " to make a new law, not to enforce an old one." But, since other provisions are forbidden to he inserted in a law imposing taxation, it follows that if such provisions are inserted, and if by rejecting them the Act would have an operation inconsistent with the expressed intention of the Legislature, the whole Act must fail of effect. </para>

                            <para>- The fact, however, remains. What we are offered by this amendment is nothing substantial, but simply a dream of the New Protection, to which I have yet to learn any honorable member in this corner objects; all that we say is that, under the Constitution as it at present stands, it is impossible. When it is suggested that there should be a Convention to remedy all the faults in the Constitution, the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> is amongst the foremost in opposition. So far as the prices of primary productions are concerned, it seems to me that the stand taken by honorable members opposite is just one of arrant humbug. We are all rather suspicious of the words in the amendment, " adequate guarantees," as applied to the primary producers, because we find that when the world's parity is greater than that which the Labour Governments of Australia think should rule here, action is taken by the Labour party to restrict the primary producers. As to the Labour party's idea  of fair prices, we saw, during last year, how butter was being sold in Victoria at 274s. per cwt., whereas the price in Queensland was 236s. ; and the same sort of thing may be observed in regard to nearly every primary product. What happened ? As soon as the price of wheat dropped this year a few pence below the guaranteed price, there was a howl of indignation, not merely from honorable members opposite, but practically from all sections of the community. Consequently, I am very suspicious of the way in which these guarantees will be observed. </para>

                            <para>- By means of a cunning move, which has for its object the securing of one or two additional seats by the party opposite, we are asked to support a proposal which is admittedly an impracticable one. Recently we have heard a great deal about the attitude which has been adopted by the members' of the Country party. We have been referred to as a sectional party. We have been told that honorable members opposite constitute the only party which represents every section of the community. I would like to direct attention to one word in the amendment which, as I have previously remarked, has "been very cunningly drawn. The amendment speaks of "the securing of proper wages and conditions for those employed in protected industries." It will be noted that it does not -mention those ' ' engaged " in pro&gt;tected industries. The dairyman who works his own farm, and the wheat-grower and banana-grower who work their own areas, will thus be excluded. </para>

                            <para>- I would like to show the use which a Tariff Board might have been to us had it been established sixteen months ago. A Tariff is important either for revenue purposes or for protective purposes. There is no doubt that the present Tariff has been imposed both for the purpose of raising revenue and also for the purpose of protecting certain industries. The Treasurer will admit that while it is his business to find the revenue which is required to carry on our Public Service, it is equally his duty to consider the effect which the method employed for raising that revenue will have, upon the lives of our people. Upon whether indirect taxation is levied in greater or lesser degree will depend whether our lands will be cultivated or merely grazed, how many people will live in the country, and how many in our cities, what industries -they will follow, and how wealth will be distributed amongst them. Taxation determines the whole of these things. The Prime Minister, at Bendigo, prior to the last election. very properly emphasized the need which exists for encouraging our secondary industries; but he laid no emphasis on the need for encouraging primary industries. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> in introducing this measure deplored the fact that in regard to Tariff matters generally, the information which is available is very inadequate. Throughout the whole of the Tariff debate the honorable gentleman enjoyed a .distinct advantage by reason of the fact that he alone, because of the activities of his officers, had exact and up-to-date information at his disposal. If last year, concurrently with laying the Tariff schedule on the table, he had submitted a Bill for the creation of a Tariff Board, one could have supported it much more readily, because it would have been of great value to every honorable member. The Board needs to be rather different from what the Minister suggests at the present time. I am glad to see that he proposes that its composition and its functions shall be strictly non-partisan. He suggests that the  chairman  should be an official of his Department, and, in my opinion, the aim of the Board should be to secure data which may be utilized by revenue Tariffists  and Protectionists, by moderate Protectionists, or by Prohibitionists, but it should advocate neither doctrine. It should examine the effect of the Tariff rates from every angle. We have had a great deal of discussion as to the effect- of various Tariff rates on prices. No phase of the Tariff is more the subject of  controversy  than is its effect on- prices, and a governing body with power to demand information and facilities to cover a wide field could throw light on many dark corners of the Tariff controversy in this respect. </para>

                            <para>- It is; and I am not hopeful of the Board being able to accomplish so much; but that, at all events, should be its aim. With information on those subjects we should have been able to approach many of our Tariff problems much better fitted than we were to solve them. It is admitted that the true principle of Protection in all protective legislation is the maintenance of such duties as will equalize the difference between the cost of production at home and abroad, and provide also for a reasonable profit to Australian industries. We have had no evidence on these points that we could regard as unbiased. We have been dependent entirely on evidence from biased sources. There have been numerous <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements, but very little scientifically produced results. Quite apart from the operation of the ordinary Tariff, if we are to have the intermediate Tariff and commercial treaties between Australia and foreign countries, it is necessary that we should have some organization to investigate Tariff relations and to determine the effect of bargaining Tariffs and other economic alliances. Most Tariffs, and. our Tariff is no exception to the rule, are formed solely with domestic interests in mind, and the reciprocity and bargaining features are tacked on as an afterthought. It seems absurd at this stage to be fixing an intermediate Tariff in this direction, and we would have been more successful in our deliberations if we had had evidence of the effect of the Tariff on the various mandated islands and our territories, and had been able to promulgate a definite scheme that would enable us to retain a considerable portion of the island trade. </para>

                    <para>I do not think that the Tariff Board should be a report manufactory, but it 6hould be able to organize its files and technical staff in such a way as to give immediate assistance, not only to the Minister, but to the. House. In addition, it seems to me that the experience of other countries with regard to free zones or ports, and the desirableness of their establishment in a country like Australia, should be considered. Certain parts of Australia are almost inaccessible from other parts, and it seems to me that we should have evidence to enable us to determine what should be their Tariff relations with the rest of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- If we found that we could not deal with that matter because of our constitutional limitations, such a discovery would impress upon us the desirableness of cutting up this country into workable areas, so that we might have sufficient lines of communication to enable those areas to be properly handled. There are some parts of this country which are so isolated that Customs duties which might be quite appropriate so far as, say, Melbourne, was concerned, would operate in them very harshly. For instance, let us consider the position of Broome, which is entirely removed from all manufacturing centres in Australia, and probably dependent for its supplies, to a large extent, on outside sources. </para>

                            <para>- I am definitely opposed to it because I think it is impracticable. If I received an assurance that the Bill would be altered very materially in Committee, especially in regard to its provisions relating to the composition of the Board, I should be prepared to vote for its second reading, so that we might see what could be done to improve it in Committee. I should like, however, to see the Bill withdrawn and reintroduced at a later stage in the year, when we might expect to have a very much fuller debate upon it than is likely at present, when honorable members are promised that, with the Tariff debate over, a brief recess will soon be reached. For that reason, I would urge the Minister not to press the Bill at this stage. I suggest that he withdraw it and introduce it later in the year. The creation of this machinery is not of the most urgent importance. </para>

                    <para>In conclusion, I would refer, briefly, to the experience of the United States of America. The first Tariff Board of the United States of America was established by  President  Taft in 1909, when he appointed three Republicans as members of it. In 1911, two Democrats were added, so that the Board would not be of a party character. It immediately undertook the study of industrial conditions, and the cost of production, both at home and abroad. Its investigations were conducted scientifically, and were found to be of such value that a permanent Tariff Commission was established in 1917.- That Commission has not, merely revised and codified Customs administrations and laws, and Customs legislation, for submission to Parliament, but has also been able to do a considerable amount of research work and direct American capital into profitable industries, such, for instance, as the manufacture of dyes and. pearl buttons. </para>
                    <para>In the circumstances, I think that nothing would be lost and probably a great deal would be gained by postponing the further consideration of this measure for, say, three months. After the recess, we should be able to give it a more mature consideration than it is likely now to receive. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> implied that I cast reflections upon the three lately deceased Judges of the High Court. I did nothing of the kind. My reason" for pointing out that they were dead was to show that there was a new set of Judges on the High Court Bench, and that the men who were dead would not be able to record their decisions in any future cases, whereas the -three men who had taken their places had recorded entirely different views. Since the High Court has the final say in interpreting the Constitution, I submit that it is worth our while to go to it and endeavour to obtain a decision from it. I am satisfied that if the Minister for Works and Railways had occupied the position of Premier  of  Queensland, he would never have taken a case to the  Privy  Council, and would never have won a case, as the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> did when he occupied that position. He took those cases to the Privy Council on appeal in the face of the decision of the Judges of Queensland, and of the opinion given him by the best legal authorities in that State. He took them to the Privy Council off his own bat, and won. The Government are evidently afraid that they would hurt their supporters by approaching the High Court on the lines suggested by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Ryan),</inline> and outlined in the amendment of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Penton),</inline> which voices the platform of the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- The three Judges to whom I referred as being deceased have not passed away very long. It was of no use going to the High Court while they were there. Judges vary very widely in their opinions and points of view. Three of the High Court Bench, as it was then constituted, decided in a certain direction, while two others, who. are still on the Bench, dissented from them, so that, after all, it was, really only one man's opinion that prevailed. The, human element enters largely into the decisions of Judges. In Queensland, they  did  not want to allow a Judge to sit because he was appointed by a Labour Government. It was the Lords of the Privy Council who upset their prejudices, and ordered that he should sit. I believe the men who are on the High Court Bench now would record a decision on the lines outlined by the honorable member for West Sydney. The members of the Country party say that they agree with the Government that nothing can be done. If people <inline font-style="italic">da</inline> not want to do anything, it is very easy for them to convince themselves that it is useless to move. ' These members, who are continually accusing everybody else of adopting the go-slow policy, are going slow themselves so far as concerns taking any steps to protect the people of Australia. They rely upon stirring up prejudice against honorable members on this side of the House, and on ridiculing us in our honest endeavours to carry out the true intention of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- No ridicule that is not deserved. The object of the Tariff is to provide employment for people in Australia, and to provide us with those necessaries of civilization, especially when we are cut off from communication with other parts of the world. We cannot hope to have a great nation here if we are all farmers, and it is of no use to produce any one commodity solely. We are sending millions of money out of Australia every year to provide good employment for people in other parts of the world, thereby forcing our people to produce commodities that are hard to dispose of. Who will say that we do not produce more than five or six times as much wheat as we can consume? It is very hard to get rid of that wheat overseas. At the same time we are sending millions of money away to buy motor cars and other commodities that could be produced here. We send away millions of pounds worth of wool and import our finished woollen goods, and in connexion with that raw material we had recently an excellent example of how, when trade outside our own territory is dislocated, we may be left in an unfinancial position. </para>

                            <para>- No, but it is necessary in addition to producing the wheat that wo should have the men here to make the motor cars and other manufactured articles and eat the wheat. We should not have to Bend it overseas to feed the men in other countries who make the motor cars, and pay them there, and then import the motor- cars here. In our own country we should have a bigger population and a more ready sale for our commodities. </para>

I think that the outcome of the Tariff will be the bringing into Australia of many millions of capital for the manufacture of necessaries for the Australian public. We cannot hope for large secondary industries if conditions remain such that the foreigner can undercut us in his prices. </para>
