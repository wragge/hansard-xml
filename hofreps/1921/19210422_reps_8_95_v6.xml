                        <para>- Has the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs been directed to a report appearing in last night&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of statements made at the Australian Manufacturers&#39; Conference held at Launceston? According to the report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martyn,</inline> a Victorian manufacturer, moved, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> of the Sunshine Harvester Works, seconded, a motion as to the necessity for a federation of all Australian employers of labour, anda <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> of Tasmania, who supported the motion, suggested that the members of the federation should act, and not speak. He urged the adoption of the German system under which, he said, 70,000 volunteers had been enlisted to break down strikes. The German Government, he mentioned, had subsidized this movement. Can the Minister inform the House what class of goods is manufactured by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> and whether the Government think it right that manufacturers, even before the Tariff is passed, should propose to take all the advantages of the duties for which it provides, and, at the same time, bring into existence an organization of strike-breakers to operate throughout the Commonwealth? </para>

                    <para>- When I asked the employers to give their employees a holiday on Anzac Day, I do not think any one misunderstood me. I am sure that the employers who are inclined to give the holiday will read into the letter of my appeal the spirit which is behind it. I shall certainly consider it no holiday if employers , are merely going to say to their employees, &#34; If you like to stay away from work you need not come, and we will see about it at the weekend.&#34; That is not what I meant at all. There may be exceptions, but I think it is very surprising the way the public have responded to my appeal. The Government have done all they can by setting an example. I am not going to bully the people outside; it is bad enough to have to bully people inside. </para>

I understand that the South African Government have not ordered this wheat and flour to be destroyed, but will not accept any of it since i* is unfit for human consumption. By the export of such commodities a great injury is being done the fair name of Australia. To use a vulgarism, Australia&#39;s name &#34;stinks in. the nostrils of the people&#34; of South Africa, and a very grave situation is arising.

                            <para>- The honorable memo ber brought this matter under my notice about a fortnight ago, and it was again brought to my attention yesterday by the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins).</inline> It is alleged, and I believe it to be true, that a very large quantity of wheat and flour, which turned out to be unfit for bread making, was sold to South Africa. I am informed that* it was so bad that the Kaffirs would not eat it. Portion of it was sent to Britain, where it was condemned as unfit for human food, and was sold for the making of paste for the use of bill stickers arid others. The amount represented by the whole of the shipment I have not been able to ascertain precisely, but, speaking very generally, it is somewhere between &#163;300,000 and &#163;500,000.  I feel very strongly about the matter, and think that every Australian ought to do so. This wheat was sold in some cases with a certificate issued by a State Government. In. other cases it was not. I am informed that some of the flour and wheat covered by such certificates was not only unfit for human  consumption, but absolutely stank. </para>

                    <para>The Government of South Africa has taken up this matter. The Government of the Commonwealth must also take it up. It would be most improper for me to attempt to lay the blame on the shoulders of individuals or of particular Governments unless and until the evidence is clear. A mere <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement is not sufficient on which to act. It is abundantly clear, however, that hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of, B grade wheat and flour was sent out of this country to South Africa, which is one of our best markets, and proved to be absolutely unfit for human consumption. I submit - and I speak as a tyro in this matter - that there is an implied warranty with flour, if not with wheat, that it is sold for making bread or biscuits for human consumption. I think that any Court would hold that such an implied warranty existed, unless there was clear evidence that it was the practice of the trade to sell under other conditions. That being so, and the matter having been brought officially before me, I make no apology for this comparatively long statement. I want only to say that I think it is the duty of this Government to see that not only the reputation and honour of Australia, but its material interests are safeguarded by putting the matter right. If it involves the payment of compensation, then the compensation must be made, and the Commonwealth ought to see, as far as it has power, that it is made by the people who are primarily responsible. </para>

                                <para>- I am obliged to the honorable member for asking the question. My statement on this matter is misunderstood if the House and the country think that it is only wheat and flour that are sent out in a way that reflects discredit on this country. I have had collected by my office a number of cases - not hypothetical, but actual cases - of products, manufactured and primary, in which we ought to excel, and, as a matter of fact, do excel, having given ground for serious complaint. There have been some most glaring cases of goods being exported not true to description or sample, and thus calculated to bring the name of Australia into disrepute and to kill our trade. That is not in South Africa, but mainly, I think, in the East. One case was quite distinct from articles of food, having reference to a case of bolts and nuts. I do not know the calibre, but it was a matter of sending out, say,    bolts and nuts. Naturally, there was some surprise and some dissatisfaction amongst the people who received the articles, but they had no redress. Some of the States have taken steps to insure that exports are true to the sample, and if the States do not see to this business we must exercise those powers which are given us over exports. We must say that unless exports are true to sample, and not in any way calculated to prejudice the name of Australia, they shall not leave the country. </para>

                                <para>- I certainly do. There are at present two men in Australia, one a South African and the other an Australian who has been in South Africa. They are engaged in the wheat and flour trade ; and I have asked them to put their case before me in writing. I must have facts; and one of these men has given a written statement, and the other, whom I met yesterday, I have asked to also furnish one. As soon as I get some evidence to go on I certainly think there should be an inquiry, whether those concerned be the Government or individuals - whether . it be the Wheat Board or not. Apart from the moral aspect, we simply cannot afford to allow the position to continue. It would pay us better to give South Africa &#163;300,000 or &#163;400,000, than to allow the position to remain as at present. Otherwise South Africa will never buy another pennyworth of flour or wheat from us, for it will be impossible to sell it. I was informed yesterday that a man went to South Africa from South Australia with the object of selling wheat, but he was unable to do so ; and we cannot blame the South African people. We must set this matter right. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. Yesterday the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> did something which I thought was hardly fair. He courteously told: me; during the afternoon that he intended <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> speak on a certain matter with which my name was connected. I appreciated that courtesy, and said that I would be present when he spoke. Later he informed me that he did not intend to speak on the subject during the sitting. While I was speaking in the grievance debate, and was perhaps rather heated because of the interest I had in the subject with which I was dealing,I received from the honorable member a note saying that he had again altered his intention, and would follow me. I considered his action unfair, and I used the word &#34; trick,&#34; which should not be used in relation to friends. I value the friendship of my old associate too much to have it disturbed by a harsh word spoken in a moment of excitement. As the honorable member has read a letter from me, I shall take the earliest opportunity of reading my lawyer&#39;s reply to it. Then, I think, my old friend will agree that we are level. </para>

                    <para>- I, too, wish to make a personal explanation, which is the first I have made in this House. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> is entirely to blame for the little <inline font-style="italic">contretemps</inline> which occurred yesterday. He desired that the grievance debate should cease at a certain time, so that the debate on the Imperial Conference might be resumed. For that reason I decided not to speak, and so informed the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney).</inline> However, there were so many speakers on the Opposition side, as there generally are, that the Treasurer subsequently informed me that the debate would be allowed to continue until the dinner hour. As I was anxious to deal with a certain matter, I decided to speak, and advised the honorable member for Melbourne accordingly. When I first told him that I did not intend to speak during that debate, I was not aware that he proposed to address the House. My conscience is absolutely clear. </para>

While the honorable member was speaking in regard to Naval defence, I interjected that Australia should do her share.

But, in fairness to the honorable member for Bourke, I wish to say that he came to me and offered an apology which I accepted, and my reply was that if the honorable member would come outside on the bowling green, I would deal with him in the manner which he deserved. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. I .submit that the subject which the honorable member for Batman desires to discuss is not a definite matter of urgent public importance, and that there is nothing in the Standing Orders which in any way derogates from your discretion as to the acceptance of a motion of this kind. I know that it has been said sometimes by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that the fact of five honorable members rising in their places to signify acquiescence in a. motion determines the point of urgency and public importance. But the mere rising of five members cannot take from you, sir, the discretionary power that is reposed in you by all the rules of Parliament. Therefore, in view of all the circumstances and having regard to the fact that a period has been put to another important debate, I ask whether you should permit a discussion on a motion of this kind. The House has already put a period to that other debate, which is of much more importance than the subject which has been brought forward by the honorable member for Batman, and here is a motion intruded to interfere with the other debate and to prevent the House from carrying out the arrangement which has been definitely made. Apart from that, I call attention to standing order 38, which governs this procedure - </para>

                <para class="block">It is clear that the rising of five members indicates merely that they approve of the proposed discussion. _ They do not determine whether or not the discussion shall take place. That discretion is inherent in the Chair. The five members simply indicate that so. far as they are concerned they are  agreeable that the discussion should proceed. Their action does not remove by one iota the discretion which resides in the Presiding Officer. That that is so is made perfectly clear by the following passage in <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> page 241: - </para>

                    <para>A matter submitted to the House in pursuance of this standing order which fails to obtain the requisite support cannot during the same session be again brought forward in the same manner; nor can more than one such motion for adjournment be made during the same sitting of the House. Though the responsibility of bringing forward a matter, as a matter of urgency, rests with the member who desires to exercise the right given by the standing order, still there must be some colour of urgency in the proposal; and the  Speaker  has declined to submit a motion for adjournment to the House because, in his opinion, the subject to be brought forward was not a &#34; definite matter of urgent public importance.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">I submit that with that clear statement of the practice of the House of Commons, together with our own standing order which limits the right of members to &#39;a mere expression of approval of the motion proposed, but in no way disturbs the &#39; discretion of the Chair, you, sir, should say whether or not, in your opinion, this matter is a . definite one of&#39; urgent importance which cannot await discussion at the proper time. I ask for this ruling particularly in view of the fact that it is sought to intrude this motion into another debate, and that that course of action must take away from the time allowed to honorable members for the discussion of the more important subject. I submit that your ruling should be guided by the consideration of what is , clearly in the interests of members of this House, and, above ail, that it should incline towards greater freedom of debate, and not to restriction. </para>

                        <para>- I appreciate the point sought to be made by the interjection, but upon the question of urgency I maintain that it is a thousand times better, and in the best interests of the Prime Minister himself, that the honorable member for Batman . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> should have introduced his motion while the right honorable gentleman is in attendance, rather than that he should have waited until after the Prime Minister&#39;s departure. If the honorable member for Batman, or any other honorable member on this side, were to wait until the Prime Minister had left for the Imperial Conference, his action would be strongly denounced, and he would be accused of having deliberately delayed until the Prime Minister&#39;s back was turned. </para>

                        <para>- This House resumed its sittings only about a fortnight ago. In order to introduce the discussion of a matter of urgent public importance an honorable member must await his opportunity. During the past week there has certainly been no chance to move the adjournment of the House upon the subject under review; and there was no opportunity before the adjournment of the House last year, because the Prime Minister returned from the presentation ceremonial in Sydney on the very day of the adjournment. At that time doubts were expressed in the press concerning whether the gratuity to the Prime Minister did not involve an invasion of constitutional limitations. I do not propose to curtail the time which may be devoted to the discussion either of this point of order or of the urgent motion, or of the other business which has been interrupted. But I maintain that the ruling which you gave on the 5th November, 1920, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> applies equally now, and that the honorable member for Batman, therefore, has every right to proceed. </para>

If the House chooses to consider other business meanwhile, and to allow the business which has been interrupted to be temporarily set aside, such a course is entirely in the discretion of the House. And when the time arrives which has been fixed for the termination of the debate, the  Speaker  is bound to interrupt the discussion then proceeding, and put the vote to the House. </para>

                        <para>- That is probably so, but it is a matter for the House itself. And at the time which has been fixed, namely, at a quarter to four this afternoon, the business at that moment before the House must be interrupted by the  Speaker,  in order to give effect to the decision of the House in regard to the taking of the vote. With respect to the right of the  Speaker  to exercise &#39;his discretion concerning Whether a motion of this kind should be discussed, I would point out that rulings have been given on this very point on more than one occasion by different Speakers which have determined our practice. As an example, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in its record of the debate of 20th August, 1915 (page 6008), states that the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> raised a point of order concerning whether a motion which had been introduced was one of urgent public importance. The  .Speaker  - the Honorable Charles McDonald - thereupon stated - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>The Standing Orders .provide that if a certain number of honorable members rise in their places to support the honorable member who desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a subject of urgent public importance, that of itself constitutes _ a sufficient ground of urgency. I &#39;have no discretion in the matter. </para>
                <para class="block">That decision is in accordance with other rulings which have .been given. It accords also with rulings given in the House of Commons by Denison, Brand, and other&#39; Speakers. I draw the attention of honorable members to the fact that this view appears to be supported by the standing order requiring forty members of the House of Commons to rise in their places to support the motion for the special &#39; adjournment pf the House in order to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance. I am bound to admit that there are conflicting decisions; but rulings have been given in the House of Commons that the fact of forty members of the House rising to support a motion of the kind determined alike its public importance and the question of its urgency. In our Standing Orders the number is five. Honorable members of this Chamber, when rising in support of such a motion, therefore, take the responsibility of declaring that, in their opinion, the subject-matter of the motion is both urgent and important. Under our established practice here it rests entirely with the House to decide whether a motion is of sufficient importance to be discussed. If the House is not of that opinion, members have in their own hands the means to prevent the debate proceeding. It is not, however, a part of the duties of the  Speaker  to decide the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I will proceed now to address myself to the subject-matter of the motion as read by you, sir, without reference to the unrehearsed preliminaries. This incident which I- am now seeking to have considered by the House arose last year at the close of our sittings. And, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has rightly pointed out, it was only on the very day when this House adjourned that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> returned from Sydney .after receiving the gratuity, the propriety of which I am asking the Prime Minister himself, and honorable members generally, to express and record their opinions upon. Yesterday I addressed a question to the Prime Minister on this same subject. I do not know whether the right honorable gentleman misunderstood the purpose and reasons for which the question was asked, but he would have done himself and the House a greater measure of justice and would have extended&#39; to me a larger meed of courtesy - though no more than a due measure - if he had given a candid reply to a. question having to do with a very delicate and&#39;, .1 submit, a very important matter , of public interest. It is important historically, and is .also of present- immediate importance. </para>

But I am bound to say that there does not seem to be, among these names, a representative of the proletariat. I do not see that the men who fought the war were adequately represented, although it is true that many distinguished persons who took a hand in the direction of the war were well in evidence.

                    <para class="block">As I said a moment ago, this matter is of great historical interest. It was in the debates of the 1891 Convention that the first part of paragraph iii. was adopted, and probably the Prime Minister, if he deigns to make any reply, may seek to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> who raised the question, seemed to direct his mind more particularly to the fact that, while other general contractors with the Commonwealth were disqualified from occupying seats in Parliament, there was one exception in the case of counsel who were still to be permitted to accept briefs from the Commonwealth and to argue for an honorarium the public questions in support, it may be hoped, of the public interest. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> addressed himself particularly to that aspect of the case against the privileges of learned counsel; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton took a contrary view, and a very interesting discussion followed. However, the first part of paragraph iii, namely, &#34; directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth &#34; was adopted by that Convention. The. latter part of the paragraph, namely, &#34; or for services- rendered in the Parliament to any person or State,&#34; was inserted at the 1898 Convention on an amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, and completed the paragraph as it stands to-day. It may be said that in regard to the first part of the paragraph, which I suggest relates particularly to the matter now under discussion, that the persons who first moved in the direction of inserting it in the Constitution did not have within their purview the particular class of case I am now considering, but the Prime Minister will, no doubt, be familiar with that well-known rule of construction that where the language of the Statute is clear and unambiguous, those whose business it is to interpret it will not have regard to the expressions of opinion of those who originally moved to have the provision inserted, nor their objective nor the language employed in moving it. . The resultant terms being clear, must be given, as my right honorable friend will surely agree, the ordinary plain meaning of plain English. </para>
                    <para>I do not accept the responsibility at present of expressing a legal opinion on the matter, but I do maintain that as such a delicate matter affecting the purity of our public life and the honour of our public men has been raised, and I think properly raised, the correct attitude of the persons concerned is a rapid readiness to clear the air as far as can be done. In matters of this kind we should apply the standard applied to, and by, judicial tribunals, namely, that they must not only be free from bias, but also be free from the suspicion of bias.  I suggest therefore that both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution enjoin the greatest care and freedom from equivocation in a matter of this kind, because if the Prime Minister will take the trouble to run his eye over the list of the great men his predecessors in bur public life, he will find the names of many who have been tenderly sensitive in regard to anything touching the purity of public affairs, especially where it seemed even remotely to reflect upon themselves. In order to show the attitude of at least one representative public man in the past in similar circumstances, and without regard to the purely technical legal aspect of the case, which, after all, is the least important, I shall read for the benefit of honorable members a very interesting letter reprinted in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on Wednesday, 1st December, 1920, and written by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes many years ago to a committee of gentlemen who proposed to make him just such a testimonial as was made in this case to the Prime Minister. The introductory note sets out that in 1881 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, who was then Premier of New South Wales, was about to visit England, and some leading citizens of Sydney proposed to present him with a testimonial in the form of a gift of money. On public grounds <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes declined the gift, and in the appended letter to the secretary of the testimonial committee he explained his reasons for so doing : - </para>

                        <para>Having endeavoured to express my feelings to this effect, it is with much reluctance that I am now constrained to interfere with the movement which has been set on foot in my favour. But it never occurred to me in the first instance that any such movement would assume the form of a pecuniary testimonial. </para>
                        <para>After carefully considering the proposal of my friends, as now presented to the public, I feel it incumbent upon me to state that I must respectfully decline to accept the intended honor. Occupying the high place of first Minister in the Government of the country, it is clearly my duty, as far as lies in my power, to preserve my public position from personal entanglements which at the present or some future time might be made the ground of reproach or suspicion. Calumny is on all occasions sufficiently busy in misrepresenting the actions of men intrusted with power, and where the choice is within my own hands I must choose to hold myself entirely free to act, if necessary, against the interests of individuals who may be my political friends. It is a matter of principle, which appears the plainer the more it is examined. I could not reconcile the acceptance of a gift of money from the public with any sense of propriety and obligation as the occupant of a high political office. </para>

                    <para>I do not intend to entrench unduly . upon the time at our disposal. Honorable members opposite, including the Prime Minister himself, may think what they will of my action. They will probably think ill of it, and if they do it will not be the first time they have &#34;clone so. But I can take the flattering unction to myself that there has never been an occasion when I have spoken in this Parliament - except when, perhaps, I have been indulging in a little airy persiflage by way of obvious jest - that I have not spoken from a more or less compelling sense of public duty. I do that to-day. I tell the Prime Minister that I speak in no spirit of unfriendliness to him.. This subject, which engaged the thought of the great framers of our Constitution, _ is worth reconsideration to-day. And, seeing that the matter is one which may reflect, although even remotely, upon the good name of the Commonwealth through its chief spokesman, it is worthy, I think, of a courteous statement by the Prime Minister. Honorable members of this House have bitter and unscrupulous enemies outside. There are individuals and newspapers more than ready to asperse us, and to attribute base motives. I candidly admit that I reluctantly acknowledge the Prime Minister&#39;s position. He knows that I am opposed to him, and. would cheerfully remove him with the legitimate weapons of party warfare; but this is not one of them. </para>
                    <para>The terms of the Constitution are clear. We have made out a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case that the money received by the Prime Minister was for services rendered in his official capacity to the Commonwealth of Australia. I acquit him of personal corruption, but nothing more subversive of the public interest than that groups of moneyed men should get together and reward any honorable member for his conduct of the business of the House or for anything of a public nature that he has done outside the House. The reasons were well stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes. </para>
                    <para>It has been suggested by the Treasurer that I have acted in an un- sportsman-like way. What would have been said if I had waited until the right honorable gentleman had left these shores, and then, behind his back, had submitted this motion ? Every one knows that in . the short time that has elapsed since we resumed there has been no opportunity for the consideration of a motion of his kind. There has been no such opportunity because of the matters obtruded on this House by the Government itself - matters which we say should not have been brought forward - and in the discussion of which, I would say, if it were parliamentary, to do so, that time has been wasted. I have nothing further to add, nor have I any apology to offer for having introduced this question. I regard it as urgent and as one that merits a complete and courteous answer. If the Prime Minister and the country are satisfied, then nobody need be so sensitive in the future. </para>

I . could understand very well such a contention coming from a layman, since the mazes of the law are such that the average citizen finds himself continually in difficulties when trying to thread his way through them. But the honorable gentleman is a member of my own profession, his speech shows signs of most careful preparation, and it is evident that he has refreshed his memory by reference to the Constitution. He said that probably I should endeavour, by reading from the <inline font-style="italic">Convention Debates,</inline> to show what were the intentions of the framers of the Constitution in regard to section 45. Anticipating  such an intention on my part, he said that, where the language was clear, the Court would ignore the intentions of the framers, and look only to the plain wording of the section. That is quite true. It is one of the fundamental principles of the interpretation of law. Let us, then, look, at the section and see what it says. That having been done, I shall then quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Convention Debates</inline> in order to show what were the intentions of the framers of it.

                    <para class="block">The honorable member says the intention of the section is so clearly expressed as to leave no room for doubt as to what it means. He contends that it applies to the presentation of a testimonial by citizens of the 1 Commonwealth to a member of Parliament, and that the act of receiving a testimonial is in itself sufficient to subject a&#39; member to the penalties of paragraph iii of section 45. The honorable member&#39;s interpretation of the section is so entirely wrong that it will not bear examination for a moment. </para>
                    <para>The paragraph forbids two things - (1) the taking of a &#34;fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth&#34;; and (2), the taking of a fee or honorarium &#34; for services rendered in the Parliament to any person or State.&#34; The first part of the paragraph, dealing with the taking of a &#34; fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth,&#34; refers not to the receipt of fees for work done for any citizen or any number of citizens of Australia, but to fees received from the Commonwealth for work done for the Commonwealth as a constitutional entity. It refers in particular to payment received for Crown briefs, or to payment by the Commonwealth for work done for the Commonwealth. The honorable member has so twisted the word &#34; Commonwealth &#34; as to make it appear that the. word used in the section is synonymous with the people of Australia, or any section of them. It is abundantly clear that this is not the intention, either obvious or implied, of the section. The &#34;Commonwealth&#34; means the Commonwealth Government or the Commonwealth as a constitutional entity. That and nothing more. </para>
                    <para>The second part of the paragraph refers to the taking of any fee or honorarium &#34;for services rendered i&#39;i the Parliament,&#34; which means the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The plain and obvious intention of the section is to prevent a member of this Parliament from taking a fee from the Government for work done in the Parliament or outside in his capacity as a member of Parliament. I would not even like to say that the paragraph goes so far as to prevent the Attorney-General taking a fee. It probably does; yet honorable members know that it is a very common practice in some of the States for the Attorney-General to take fees. The honorable member for Batman knows very well that I have never taken a fee or honorarium in that capacity. These, then, are the obvious intentions of section 45. These are the acts at which the provision was aimed. The intention of the section is not confined, as is the case in some States, to Ministers only, but extends to all members of Parliament. It has reference to a state of things which existed at the time of the framing of the Constitution, and in some State Parliaments exists now, where a man, who was a servant of the Crown, might yet receive an honorarium for doing work for the State of which he was already the servant. Wo doubt such a fee might influence a man&#39;s vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers as he now is - when moving the insertion of the section at the Adelaide sittings of the Convention in 1907, said, as reported at page 1034 of the <inline font-style="italic">Convention Debates -</inline></para>

                        <para>This will practically bring the Commonwealth law into line with the law that holds good in Victoria. I understand that there not only is a contractor debarred, but no person can accept a fee or honorarium. As I pointed out the other night, I see no reason why lawyers or professional men should be in a better position than other members of the community. There is just as much likelihood for abuse to creep in if you allow them to accept fees or honorariums as there is in the payment of contractors. I only desire that in a matter of this kind, if we legislate against contractors, newspaper proprietors, merchants, and ordinary tradespeople, we should also legislate against any member of a privileged profession from doing that which is admitted to be wrong in others. I will say nothing about corruption; but if there be a principle in the matter, and it is a good principle in one case, it is equally good in the other. </para>

                        <para>I do not suppose it happens in the colonies - at any rate, I know of no such case -but it has been stated that members of Parliament, even in the colonies, have accepted payment for putting Bills through the Houses. As I have said, I have never known of a case of the sort, but it is quite possible such things have happened. We do not wish such a condition of affairs to arise. If we disqualify a man for performing service for the Commonwealth for payment, it is equally important that he should be disqualified for accepting fees for work done in the legislative body. Under the latter circumstance, the member works under false pretences. He appears to work in the public interest, when really he is accepting payment for putting measures through the Legislature. </para>

                    <para class="block">The intention of the section then is perfectly clear on the face of it; and it sets out what the framers of the Constitution as expressed in their speeches obviously desired. </para>
                    <para>I invite the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> who professes to take the liveliest interest in upholding the honour of this Parliament, to take the case to the only place where it can be definitely determined.I am amazed that he has so long delayed doing what he now asserts he does from a keen sense of public duty - I am amazed that he has so long allowed the honour of his country, and of the first Legislature of his country, to rest under this imputation. I invite him to ask the High Court of Australia to say whether I, whom he describes as the custodian of the honour of Parliament, and as the principal offender, have been guilty of violating the Constitution and the honour of this Parliament, which I have sworn to uphold. I invite the honorable member and all those who say that&#39; under section 45, or any other section of the Constitution, I have done that which is improper by receiving this testimonial, to take the matter to the High Court. The honorable member says that he takes this action from a keen sense of public duty. </para>
                    <para class="block">I have been longer in politics than he has. Does he say that an honorarium must necessarily take the form of money? Suppose that, instead of a cheque, I had received jewels, or something that could be converted into money, would that have been less corrupt than the receipt of money, or would it be said that section 45 would not equally apply to the one case as to the other? It happened to me in New South Wales in, I think, 1899, to receive from my constituents a testimonial of &#163;150 for services rendered to them during the great plague. The watch I am  wearing I had given to me at the same time. I invite honorable members, and I invite the honorable member for Batman, in spite of all that has come and gone, and of what has been said to-day, to come to my house, where they may see dozens of testimonials, pieces of plate and other articles of value, that I have received from trade unions, and from my former constituents. Does he say I may take testimonials, money, or things that can be converted into money or articles of intrinsic value from trade unions or from my former supporters in the Labour party with impunity, but that my seat must be declared vacant if I take them from any one else? Is it the amount that the honorable member cavils at, or is it the thing itself? Does he say that it takes &#163;25,000 to bribe me, while others may be bribed with &#163;50? Unless I do the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> a wrong, I fancy that once in his career the trades unions enabled&#39; him to take a trip - provided the money for it. Does any one who knows the honorable member say for a moment that it was an improper action on his part to receive the money? </para>

                    <para>I do not apologize for receiving this testimonial. It is true that I have been singled out in this honorable House, composed of men of eminent virtue &#34;whose records are written in letters of shining gold. Who am I, an insignificant pigmy, that the people of the country should select me as the recipient of this munificent mark of their appreciation? I wish I could congratulate every one of my honorable friends in this House on having received a testimonial ; if they had, I should never have said, &#34; You ought not to have taken it.&#34; No man has endeavoured to serve his country more faithfully than I. Whether I have succeeded is a matter of opinion; but we must remember that it is only five years or less ago that the honorable member for Batman would have been the first to say that I had served my country well. He and I have differed, and on a point that has really nothing to do with the. principles that underlie the Labour movement or politics. He knows there is a gap between him and me that neither time nor even Providence can span; he knows, too, that this difference arises out of our breeding and our race. But does  he condemn me for this : not that I have done wrong, but that I differ from his opinions? I have done what I think to be right. I have never questioned for a moment that the honorable member is sincere. I have opposed him, and he- me ; but I have never told him that he is not sincere, because I believe that he is; and he should give me credit for being, at least, as  sincere as himself. I took testimonials when I was Leader of the honorable gentleman - when I was unanimously chosen as the Leader of the Labour party. I say that all honorable members who were in the Labour party&#39;s room on that eventful day when we parted company know that, had I chosen, even after all that had happened, I could have remained Leader. But I shall leave that on one side. </para>
                    <para>Does the honorable member for Batman say that the people of this country, or any of them, have no right to express their appreciation in terms of money if they like, of a man who, in their opinion, has served hi3 country well? I am a poor man. I have given, not like some men the fag-end of my life, but my whole life, to my country. I say deliberately that I could have made far more money outside of Parliament than in it. Some people in this country, and the soldiers amongst them, were desirous of expressing their appreciation of my services, and they did so. I stand here now and make no apology whatever for having taken the money my fellow-citizens gave me. I am now, as I always was, a man who will take his own line, though a thousand may say to me, &#34; Do this,&#34; or &#34; Do that.&#34; No body of men better than honorable members on the other side know that that was my way from the beginning ; that it is now, and will be my way to the end. </para>

                        <para>.- With a certain amount of diffidence I follow the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> on this question, but I wish to recall some incidents to honorable members opposite. I submit that there is no difference between a presentation in money and a presentation in kind. I was the first recipient of a presentation in this Parliament. The chain I wear - not the watch, that is elsewhere - was given to me for services I had rendered to the -Labour party up to that time. The then Leader of the Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Christopher</inline> Watson, had a valuable presentation made to him, and so had the ex-High Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> these being in kind, not in money. I now come to an event which is retained in my memory because of my association with it. I wish to contrast the action in Opposition of the party which now sits on the Government side with the action of the party now in Opposition. The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> and the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> will remember that a former member for Coolgardie, when severing his connexion with a newspaper there, received a presentation of &#163;400. On that occasion there was no murmur from the then Opposition; no one made any accusation of impropriety against the honorable member. My association with that event is that I bought - I emphasize the word &#34;bought&#34; - a number of Melbourne newspapers, which contained an account of the presentation, and sent them to constituents iu my electorate. It was &#34; bread cast upon the waters &#34; that never returned; and the result fixed the event in my mind. There have been so many instances of the kind, not only here but elsewhere, that I wonder the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> should have brought the present case before the House. Something was said yesterday by an honorable member about &#34; playing the game.&#34; I certainly do not think the action taken this morning is &#34; playing the game,&#34; for, to my mind, it is not compatible with the dignity of the honorable- member for Batman, or with the dignity of the House, that a matter of the kind should be discussed. I rose merely to relate my own experience in this connexion. Of course the value of the present I received was very insignificant in comparison with that which is under discussion to-day. I thank the Prime Minister and the honorable member for Yarra for their instrumentality in getting that little tribute for me. I was certainly taxed about it a good deal, and to make matters worse, I was robbed when standing on the back of the tram on my way home  at night. Several people asked me what brand of liquor I had been drinking, but that my misfortune was not accounted for in that way was proved by the fact that on the following day <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was treated in the same manner, when proceeding to open a bowling green at St. Kilda. Presentations of the sort under discussion are &#39;quite common occurrences, and it seems to me that the head and front of the Prime Minister&#39;s offending was the largeness of the amount he received. I can only add that if I were offered &#163;25,000, or even any smaller amount, as recognition of my public service, I would accept it gratefully. </para>

Anybody who listened to. the moderate .language he employed when moving the motion can come to no other conclusion; even the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> must hold that opinion.

                            <para>- The Prime Minister must have misunderstood the question, because that is not what the honorable member for Batman asked him. In any case, he could have given yesterday the same answer as he gave this morning, but he replied with a curt and abrupt &#34; No,&#34; and the Treasurer&#39;s answer was exceptionable for the same  reason.  The matter of the presentation to the Prime Minister has been much discussed amongst the public and in the press. There is no honorable member who would wilfully make any suggestion of corruption unless there was the strongest evidence of it, and the honorable member for Batman merely asked for information, because, as he put it, a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case was made out by the telegram sent by ,the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to the Prime Minister in Sydney at the time the presentation was made. In that telegram, the Treasurer offered the congratulations of his- colleagues to the Prime Minister on the handsome gift of &#163;25,000 which he was receiving for, amongst other things, services rendered to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Nobody would be so foolish as to suggest that the money came from the Commonwealth Treasury, but there is an impression abroad that the money came from those who have large financial interests, and had big business transactions, possibly with the Commonwealth, during the period of war. After all, most people think that gratitude is a lively sense of favours to come, and that, whether or not a presentation comes within the embargo imposed by the Constitution, it is not desirable that responsible Ministers, while still in charge of the affairs of the country, should accept large gifts from persons who may subsequently have business dealings with the Government. I do not suggest that the Prime Minister would be influenced by the presentation; I would be sorry, indeed, to suggest that he would do anything corrupt, but I do suggest that there is a possibility that he might have a kindly feeling - he could not help it - towards those who were good enough to make the presentation. </para>

I invite the consideration of the Prime Minister as Attorney-General to the meaning of the words &#34;services rendered in the Parliament to any person or State.&#34; The section does not refer to a fee or honorarium received from any person or State.If any person in Parliament renders a service to some person or State, it matters not from what source the fee or honorarium comes; it need not come from the person or State receiving such service to bring it within the ban of paragraph iii. of section  45. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to be drawn off my argument. It is quite clear that if a fee or honorarium is received from any source for services rendered in Parliament to any person or State, the seat of the recipient is rendered vacant. The Prime Minister said that the honorable member for Batman might test the matter by taking it to the High Court. The honorable member has taken the first step necessary to test the matter by giving the Prime Minister an opportunity of making a frank statement as to the transaction. But as a matter of fact, the statement made by the right honorable gentleman does not disclose anything other than that he has received a presentation for services rendered in his public capacity, but there is no disclosure as to the sources from which the money came. If the right honorable gentleman does not wish to give that information that is his affair, but the public can form their own opinion. As I read the Constitution, this matter cannot be tested by the High Court unless it has been referred to the Court by resolution of this House. </para>

The Constitution of the Commonwealth is different from the Constitutions of the different States.

                            <para>.- The debate on this most important matter has been pursuing a somewhat haphazard and interrupted course. I regret that very much, not so much on my own account, but because of the very great importance of the issues that will be discussed at the Imperial Conference, and more particularly as they may affect Australia. I do not know, in all my experience or reading, of a position fraught with greater possibilities, either for good or for evil to Australia, than that which will confront the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> upon his taking part in the Conference in London. In the circumstances, therefore, as much time as was possible should have been devoted to this discussion, so that the Prime </para>

                        <para class="block">Minister might have been armed with a general expression of opinion from all sides of the House, which would have been of undoubted use to him. Interesting speeches have been made in the course of the debate. Some have been helpful, while others have been of somewhat doubtful value. I confess to a feeling of surprise - I might almost say of amazement - at certain of the observations uttered. I listened to the forceful speech of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> but I regret that that gentleman, in discussing the relationships of the various parts of the Empire, and particularly the relationship of the Mother Country with Australia, indicated that he saw very little in it to admire.  His  ideas with regard to the conditions under which Great Britain has exercised an interest in Australian affairs were very deplorable. According to him all the interest taken by England in Australia was due to the most ignoble motives. I am certain that his anticipations concerning possible developments in connexion with the &#34;proposed renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty are very far fetched. The honorable member, for Bourke waxed eloquent in his protest against the probability - as he put it - of Australian soldiers having to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese against a people of our own kith and kin. I am unable to see that probability at all; I do not think it was Worth while discussing. The Imperial authorities have very carefully safeguarded the Empire against -any such possibility.&#34; It is unthinkable, so far as Australia herself is concerned, and I can conceive of no Imperial Government attempting to coerce us into taking part in a conflict which we would abhor. </para>
                        <para>Another honorable member gave utterance to a most regrettable statement when he insinuated that there were English statesmen ready to betray our White Australia policy. I do not think there is even the faintest suggestion of such a possibility to be found in the sayings or doings of English statesmen from the first day when the policy of White Australia was enunciated here. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt an alarmist propaganda has been at work in Australia, too. It has&#39; not been  entirely  friendly to the Commonwealth in its origin, but has sought to work up some trouble between ourselves and the Motherland. However, there is no indication of any weakening on the part of British statesmen in connexion with the policy of a White Australia. And it has not been an altogether agreeable policy .;n some respects. It has meant a certain  amount  qf difficulty in connexion with the relationships of other portions of the&#34; Empire. Yet, in spite of that British statesmen have been uniformly loyal to the great Australian conception. I enter my protest, therefore, against any suggestion to the contra&#39;ry. It has not been justified up to the present ; and the Prime Minister, when, he meets Imperial statesmen in London, will find that they are prepared, as they have ever been, to maintain to the utmost of their powers the policy on which Australia has set her heart as vital to our existence. </para>

                        <para>There is another phase of the White Australia question to which I desire to refer. That is the suggestion that this policy has been challenged by Japan. I do not wish to pose as an apologist for Japan in this connexion. j.apan is a country which might, in  certain  circumstances, develop a line of action somewhat hostile to Australia; but, up to the present, we have no right to harbor any thought of the kind so far as that country is concerned. Japan has been thoroughly loyal to her alliance with Great Britain; and, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> remarked, the White Australia policy has remained intact from its inception, so far as concerns any effort to disrupt it by Japan. There is no indication that Japan has registered any serious objection to this policy. Nor could Japan consistently do so, seeing that it is a matter of life and death to that country to keep herself free from the swarming -hordes of China which, if allowed to enter without hindrance, would overwhelm the Japanese. Japan cannot keep Chinese coolies out of Japan and then with consistency turn round and demand free access for her people into Australia. But&#39; it may be suggested that we have only to look to recent history in the United States of America to realize the possibilities of trouble for ourselves. I sympathize with the people of California in the difficulty in which they are placed&#39; with respect to their Japanese fellow-residents; and I realize that, in their interests, something must be done to put an end to a state of affairs which provides for them a second colour problem on top of the one which they have been enduring for so many years. But the Japanese difficulty in the United States of America is almost entirely the making of the people of that country themselves. Under an arrangement agreed upon when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taft</inline> was  President,  Japanese have been freely admitted. They entered in fair numbers, ;and, on the Pacific coast particularly, they were actually welcomed. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so; Americans who are settled along the Pacific Coast are largely .engaged in fruit and vegetable growing for canning and curing for the markets - of the world. They needed labour, and the immigration of Japanese solved that problem for them to a large extent. So they welcomed the Japanese, gave them employment as freely as they came into the country, and were able to pay them good wages. But the Japanese, being progressive, and thrifty, did not all remain content to- be wage-earners. &#39; They saved, and they looked around to do something better for themselves. Land was difficult to obtain, and  the best of it had been taken up long previously, but there were certain possibilities in connexion with areas that the Americans had left severely alone, regarding them as worthless tracts which appeared to be utterly unfit for agricultural purposes. For these lands the Japanese made offers, and I have no doubt that the Americans who sold the apparently worthless land to them chuckled as they did so, thinking that they were taking the Japanese down. But the purchasers happened to know what they were doing, and in a very short time they turned these areas into highly profitable fruit and vegetable farms, with the result that at the present moment they are competing formidably with the&#39; native Americans. It is just at this moment that the Americans have realized the danger of Japanese immigration. These immigrants were all right when they came into the country as coolies, but the position altered considerably when it was realized that the former coolies were now amassing wealth and securing a considerable amount of the trade which the Americans had previously monopolized for themselves. . Japan is taking up an attitude in regard to these immigrants for which no country could blame her. She is merely asking that those who were not only admitted to the United States, but also welcomed there, shall not be treated differently from other immigrants entering the United States under the same conditions. Any nation with a regard for its honour could do nothing less for that portion of its people which find themselves threatened with the imposition of serious disabilities after having been tolerated and encouraged for a considerable time, and I have no doubt that some way out of the difficulty will be found&#39;. To my mind, Japan is not to blame for the course she is taking in this connexion. (As long as we are prepared to look the situation fairly and squarely in the face, we need have no difficulty with Japan. I do not think there is the slightest inclination on her part . to send her people into Australia in any considerable numbers, because she has better methods of utilizing her surplus population near at hand. In fact, it will be bad policy for her, as well as for any other country,- to dissipate her people over a widely scattered portion of the earth. As Japan is over-populated, she must have expansion. A prolific and progressive country is entitled to that so long as there are any waste spaces of the earth available. The large areas of land in Manchuria and Siberia which can be made available for her surplus population will suit Japanese expansion far better than Australia. Japan is somewhat late in seeking room for expansion and the areas available for her are undoubtedly limited; but she has done nothing more than copy the methods adopted, not only by Great Britain, but also by all other countries, when the necessities of a super-abundant  population compelled them to take action. If Japan is given reasonable scope . in the parts of Eastern Asia to which I have referred, there need be no fear whatever about her bothering us with claims that portion of our territory should be allotted to her, or that her people should be allowed to enter Australia in any considerable numbers, to the detriment of our own settled policy and ideals. </para>

At any rate, it is an undoubted fact that the strength of the British Empire in the Council of the League of Nations is one of the reasons, if, indeed, it is not the principal reason, for the United States remaining outside the League at the present time when we are all anxious that that country should become a member of it. </para>

                                <para>- I am interpreting what I take to be the general consensus of American opinion as expressed in some of the best magazines, and by some of the most representative publicists of that country. Statesmen as&#39; we know, with the exception, perhaps, of our own Prime Minister, are given to thinking a great deal and saying very little; but I  feel sure that those who have expressed the objection I have mentioned to the present constitution of the League of Nations on behalf of America are saying what is felt very strongly throughout the&#39; whole of that great country. If the difficulty could be overcome in some way or  other, say, by allowing the Empire in all larger matters to be represented on the Council of the League of Nations by no more than a number of votes corresponding to the representation of the United States of America, something very useful would be achieved, and the road would be made smooth for the introduction of America into the League. </para>

                        <para>We are very proud also of our Australian Navy. We have heard a great deal of talk as to the necessity for maintaining it, and in some quarters it has been urged that it should &#39;be considerably enlarged. It was brought into existence because of the German menace. That menace has now disappeared, yet still we insist upon the maintenance of an Australian Navy. Why ? Let us be quite frank. Because of the possibility of danger coming to us from Japan. If there is danger in that direction, does any honorable member in the House imagine that the mere handful we could put on the seas in the shape of an Australian Navy would be of the slightest use? Would it not be absolute murder for the Government to send Australian seamen on our few ships to compete with the might of Japan ? Under any circumstances whatever, could we hope to create a Navy that would be anything more than a mouthful to Japan, if the worst came to the worst? </para>

                                <para>- That is another matter; but when we come to talk about the development of the Navy in the ordinary sense of the word, I say, without hesitation, that we could spend the money to far greater advantage than by putting &#163;6,000,000 to &#163;10,000,000 into a capital ship which, assuming we are in danger from Japan, would add practically nothing to our security. Seeing that the existing Australian Navy is now practically so much scrap iron, that it is already obsolete, and that there is no danger to be apprehended from any quarter, I think that, for the time being, we might very well call a respite from the building and equipment of any war ships, and put the money to purposes that will give better results in connexion with the maintenance of our White Australia, and the development of the Commonwealth as a nation within the Empire. </para>

The money that is being spent just now on naval and military developments, to a large extent, is being entirely misapplied.  Take, for instance, the fact mentioned in this House, that we have not a Naval Base that will accommodate one of the larger ships of war. We have had reports from experts regarding the absolute necessity of having, at least, one Naval Base to meet the requirements of the Imperial Navy. Fremantle has been pointed to as being the important Naval Base, but, for many years, the Government have simply frittered away money there in doing practically nothing. Our very first step in naval development should have been to create at least one Naval Base for the refitting and repairing of such Imperial ships of war as might have to operate in this part of the world. </para>

                        <para>Then, again, there is the creation of a uniform gauge of railway. There is nothing more urgent in connexion with the defence of Australia. Some of the money  being wasted on our present warlike preparations could, with advantage,, be used in a development of . that kind. Lastly, and by no means least of all, we need, as has also been said in this House, to fill up our waste spaces as fast as we can with people of our own kith and kin. A great deal of time has been wasted in that direction. The present opportunity is a good one to secure population, and this or any other Government worthy of the name, should devote almost every ounce of &#39;its energy and every penny we have to spare to the settlement of these large &#187; areas which are crying out for population, without which our control of Australia must always remain open to challenge. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister is going home on a  very  delicate <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> difficult task. I should like to suggest to him a course that he ought to adopt; but I am afraid I shall be suggesting something which is rather impracticable. The right honorable gentleman&#39;s policy is always to take a strenuous and leading part in the councils of the Empire. I would suggest that the policy of Australia at the present time is. not to take a strenuous and leading part, except in so far as is necessary to safeguard our interests, but rather to keep somewhat in the background until the international situation clears up. At present, it is both difficult and uncertain. Our safest course, I think, would undoubtedly be to stand by until the situation is relieved as between these two countries - the United States of America and Japan - where we see trouble brewing just. now. There is nothing to be gained by haste, and the only fear I have regarding the Prime Minister&#39;s errand to London is that, with &#39;his usual temperamental peculiarities, he may say, and do, more than is entirely safe in the circumstances. I would suggest, therefore, that, if possible, he should adopt a policy of caution and reticence as the one best suited to the circumstances of Australia at this juncture. </para>
                        <para>I come now to what is to me a most important, though to some of my listeners a somewhat intrusive &#39;subject. In the invitation given by the Prime Minister of </para>
                        <para>Great Britain to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, it was stated that, in addition to the matters specifically mentioned as to be dealt with at the Imperial Conference, there were many other subjects which might call for consultation and decision. There is -one matter of predominant importance just now to the. Empire; there is one great trouble right at its heart. I refer to the Irish difficulty, and do so with a certain amount of hesitation, because I know how readily in Australia one is liable to be misunderstood and misrepresented in discussing Irish affairs. But there can be no doubt whatever of the seriousness of the Irish problem to the whole Empire. It is no longer a matter as between England and Ireland. It affects vitally our relations with the United  States  of America. In the main, this country is friendly to the Empire. But the trouble in Ireland is carried over into the United States of America, where several million Irish votes play no small part in determining the attitude towards Great Britain. Observers have expressed the opinion that, until the Irish question is satisfactorily settled, the friendship of </para>
                        <para> Great Britain and the United States&#39; of America cannot be as close as it could and should be. I have before me the <inline font-style="italic">Contemporary Review</inline> for March, in which  there appears an instructive article entitled, &#34; A Plea for Conciliation,&#34; by an English publicist. The writer says that, when travelling recently through the United States of America, he found that there was only one opinion regarding the Irish question, and that was, &#34; Get it settled for Heaven&#39;s sake, and then we can come together in the permanent bonds of friendship.&#34; We, in Australia, in common with the rest of the Empire, are waiting anxiously and eagerly for such a coming together of the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race. It behoves us, therefore, to do anything and everything within our power to bring about that happy state of affairs. </para>
                        <para>I have thought anxiously and long over this particular trouble. I do not want to-day to discuss either the rights or the wrongs of. the Irish question. I desire merely to suggest what appears to me to be a method of solving the problem, and I put it to the Prime Minister as something which I hope will be worthy of bringing before the Conference. A little while ago I addressed a letter on the subject to the editor of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times.</inline> . I do not know whether it is in print. Sufficient time has barely elapsed to allow of its publication, but in that letter I embodied my suggestion, and as I put it in as condensed a form as possible, and as well as I could, I shall take the liberty of reading it in the hope that the view therein expressed will commend itself to the Prime Minister, to members of the House, and also to the press and public of Australia. In the hope that it may help to resolve a long-standing and difficult problem, I now read the letter -  17th  January,  1921. </para>

                    <para>Although  the  awful state  of  affairs  in Ireland is of the  gravest concern  to the  whole Empire,  it  might hastily  be  said  that any one  daring  to  offer a suggestion towards a solution  of the  problem from the remote antipodes was hardly  in  a position  to  make  an  effective contribution to  it.  But  the  distant observer  has  usually  the  advantage of obtaining  the  more comprehensive view and  the  truer perspective.  He will not  perceive  the  smaller details, and yet, by reason  of  this,  be  all  the  better able  to  realize  the  situation. There  is  such a thing as being unable to see  the  forest  for  trees, and this to  the  writer&#39;s mind  is  precisely  the  position  of  those  who are  right  in the  thick of the </para>
                    <para>Irish tangle. The two countries immediately concerned - England and Ireland - have striven for many years to arrange their difficulties. Every effort has failed, the patience and forbearance of both parties are utterly at an end, and a position has been reached which menaces, not only the peace, but the very existence of the Empire. Surely, when face to face with such a state of affairs, the British people throughout the world have a right to some say about it. More than that, I&#39; feel strongly, as one with a considerable political experience who has given some study to this question, that the Empire should not only be consulted regarding it, but that in this way the solution of the hitherto insoluble Irish problem can be reached. If ever England and Ireland were in the frame of mind to arrive at a mutually satisfactory understanding, they are certainly not so to-day. Then why not call a family conference, which, while thus emphasizing and maintaining the relationship of its members, would be specially competent to establish peace in the common interest between the two antagonistic brothers. </para>
                    <para>Reduced to definite shape, my proposal is that an Empire Commission should be appointed to go into the whole Irish question with a view to its settlement on a just and sound basis. The Commission should be composed of equal numbers of representatives chosen by the Parliaments of the self-governing Dominions of Canada, Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. The three senior members of the family - England, Scotland, and Ireland - would also, of course, be represented on the Commission. The importance of the undertaking should insure a careful selection of the most suitable men. They would conduct their investigations with the great, and, indeed, unique advantage of the good-will and confidence of the two parties immediately concerned, and their findings and recommendations would have a weight and value far beyond any of the efforts yet made to bring to those Isles of Britain - which we of the outer circle of the Empire still call &#34;Home&#34; - the peace and the unity which should be associated with that sacred word. </para>

As I understand the honorable member - and I have tried to do so, although it was my misfortune not to hear him - he meant a submission direct to the people by way of referendum, taken either at an election, or at some other time. But the amendment of the honorable member is not limited to the Treaty, but extends to all matters of foreign policy - to naval and military defence and, in short, to all matters that may be discussed by the Imperial Cabinet, whether involving expenditure, or of interest to the people of Australia. I leave on one side, for the moment, all matters excepting the Anglo- Japanese Treaty, &#39; because, as I understood, the honorable gentleman chiefly directed his remarks to the Treaty. But before dealing with the honorable member&#39;s amendment I wish to congratulate the House, and honorable members who have spoken, on the tone of the debate. There may be one or two exceptions - I have not heard them - but in the main honorable members have done their country infinite service by refraining from reflecting on foreign nations in a way calculated to make the task of those who are to represent the British Empire still more difficult than it is. I think that the reputation of Australia, and of this, its national Legislature, is enhanced by this debate. It has shown that we are capable of dealing with great questions in a great way. These encomiums, which I pass without reservation on my fellow-members, are not to be interpreted as meaning that I am necessarily in agreement with all that has been said. but of approval of the manner in which they have expressed their opinions. But there has been disclosed, during the debate, amazing misconceptions of the relations that actually exist between this Dominion and Great Britain. And statements have been made with which I entirely disagree - statements disparaging the Empire. The reflections made upon the Empire last night by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> were most unfortunate and unjust. He implied that the Empire&#39;s guiding principle is self-aggrandizement - that the Empire, and particularly Great Britain, is actuated by the most sordid motives. I do not contend for one moment that our race is guiltless of those errors which others have committed. We are not, any more than other men, flawless, but at this time, when the Empire is surrounded by enemies, secret and open, it comes with very bad grace from an honorable member of this Commonwealth Parliament, which  speaks for Australia, which is and desires to continue as an integral part of, the British&#39; Empire, that almost every nation on earth should be lauded and the Empire held up to ridicule and contempt. I for one will always couch a lance for the Empire in which I believe. It is most unfortunate, in my opinion, that the British Commonwealth is known to foreign nations as an Empire. It is the most democratic form of government the world has ever known. I ask my fellow-members to point cut in the history of any nation throughout the ages its parallel. Where is there, or has there ever been such a community of free nations enjoying to the full such rights of self-government? Where has Democracy such triumphs as amongst those nations which compose the family of the British people? I will not tamely submit to listen to diatribes about &#34; Imperialism,&#34; as if this Empire of ours, which I prefer to call the British Commonwealth, were an Empire such as Germany, Russia, or Ancient Rome. The word &#34; Empire&#34; does not fit our circumstances. &#39; We are a federation of free peoples, and history may be ransacked in vain to find a parallel to the constitution under which we live, the liberties we all enjoy, and the ideals that animate us. </para>
                        <para>Let me now turn to the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney. The honorable member for Bourke, in supporting the amendment, said that the amendment did not bind us to a referendum. But the honorable member for West Sydney, who ought to know what it means, says that it does.  He said that one of two things must happen: - either Great Britain could make this Treaty without consulting us, or we would be bound by the Treaty whether we liked it or not. From that he went on to paint a picture in which he represented the Anglo-Japanese alliance as a net in which we were enmeshed, and which would presently, in company with the Japanese, entangle us in a war against our cousins in America. It is the habit of the honorable member to be carried away by his own eloquence, which all honorable members admire, and no one more than I; but if the honorable gentleman had listened carefully to what I said in my opening remarks he would know that I had expressly declared that one of the chief difficulties in. the problem now confronting us lay in drafting a Treaty satisfactory to Britain, Japan, and  ourselves  which would not involve us or Britain in a struggle with the people of the United States of America. For I said that, as I saw it, the peace of the world for which all men prayed depended upon an understanding of some sort between America and what is known as the British Empire. So I put aside that horrific panorama of words conjured up by the honorable member and refer him to the plain facts of the case and to what I. said. And I lay it down as an axiom that we must not be embroiled in war with America. I said that it might be difficult to arrive at such an understanding as I indicated; some people might think it impossible, but we ought not to be deterred by mere difficulties. As to impossibility, no <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> ought to say that a thing essential to our welfare and the  peace  of the world was impossible until at least every avenue had been explored and every means exhausted to achieve it. That brings me to the point I particularly wish to emphasize. The honorable member has said to me, &#34; We will not give you the right to speak for Australia,&#34; and it is obvious that I cannot speak for Australia if what is to be done is to have no effect unless, and until, it is submitted to al referendum, of the people. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> speaks quite lightly of a referendum. Perhaps, if he had had as much experience of referenda as I have had he would not so lightly turn from the beaten path of parliamentary government, especially on a matter of such vital importance as the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. The honorable member does riot understand the position. He seems to think, and certainly the honorable member for Bourke said, that if Great Britain renewed the Treaty and went to war with America, which is unthinkable, and the possibility of which exists only in the imagination of those two honorable gentlemen, Australia would be involved. Do honorable members really believe that? Let us look at the question fairly. I said last night, when the honorable member for Bourke was speaking, that we are not bound by any Treaty which we ourselves do not. ratify. I speak not at all of the practical consequence to us of any act of Britain, but of the effect of the Treaty itself. The practical consequences of Britain going to war with America, or any other nation, whether Japan was or was not our ally, would have to be faced by us. But one thing is certain, that whether we ratified the Treaty or not our position while we remained an integral part of the Empire would for all practical purposes be the same. The paper which is the subject of the motion we are discussing sets out the text of the various treaties existing between Britain and Japan. So far as I know this Parliament has not assented to any one of them, and, technically, is ho more bound by them than if they did not exist. Therefore, when the honorable member for West  Sydney says that he would ask the people, &#34;Are you in favour of that Treaty or not?&#34; he is proposing to ask them to give a verdict upon an issue which is not before them. Let me speak plainly. I say, unhesitatingly, that if this Treaty -were renewed in its present form - it cannot be, and I will tell the House why - it would npt bind this country to go to war with America or Germany or any other country. Our liability in regard to wars in which Britain is involved arises not out of any treaties, but out of our .relation to Britain and to the Empire generally. When Britain goes to war, then, <inline font-style="italic">ipso</inline><inline font-style="italic">facto,</inline> we are at war also. Whether we elect to send troops out of Australia is another matter. But that we should be at war with Britain&#39;s enemy is certain. The best proof of that is what happened when. Britain went to war with Germany. We were never compelled to send troops to assist Britain. We did that of our own free will. But we were at war, not because of a treaty, but because the British Empire is to a foreign nation an indivisible entity. - I come now to another point. </para>
                        <para>During the progress of this debate some honorable members have spoken of the ever-widening powers of the Dominions, and have censured the Government and me, as their representative, for seeking those wider powers of self-government which I, as an Australian, not by birth, but by residence of nearly forty years, thought the people of the Commonwealth desired. Do they not .realize that at this moment there resides in the British Parliament power to make laws for this country? This morning, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> and I quoted from the Constitution. What is that Constitution? It is a British Statute, and technically - the practicalities are not affected in any way - Britain can repeal that Act to-morrow, and, legally, as the honorable member for West Sydney knows perfectly well, it would be binding upon us. But is there one man, no matter how perfervid a worshipper of England as against Australia he might be, who would bow the knee to a British Statute which took away our rights of self-government, or of any British Statute, unless it were passed by the expressed wish of the people of this country? Does any one believe for a moment that Britain would pass such a Statute or do anything to impair in the slightest degree the right of this country to govern itself in its own way ? If all these facts are unassailable, and no one will deny that they are, what are we to think of honorable members suggesting that we should submit to a vote of the people of Australia a Treaty to which this country&#39;s assent is not necessary, and will not be called for- a Treaty which can&#39; be made over our heads, no matter what form it takes? This Treaty is one between Britain and Japan. The Peace Treaty was in a different category, because the representative of Australia was invited to append his signature to it. But so far as the Anglo-Japanese Treaty is concerned it is a treaty between Britain and Japan. Does any one deny that, if Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa were not represented at the Imperial Conference, Britain must either renew the Treaty or allow it&#34; to lapse? The position is very clear: the Treaty, if renewed, will be between Britain and Japan, but because the Treaty affects or may affect the whole Empire, the British Government has invited the Prime Ministers of the Dominions, who are members of the Imperial Cabinet, to come to London to discuss this and other matters, so that the views of the whole Empire may be heard and considered, and not merely that of Great Britain alone. I think I am entitled, in view of what has been said, to quote a few paragraphs from the cablegram I sent to the British Prime Minister, and to which his cablegram was a reply. When the question of the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty was mooted, the Government cabled to the Imperial Government that we hoped that this matter would -not be considered without ample opportunity being afforded for the wishes of Australia to be ascertained. Time went on, and as the period was short, it was decided by Great Britain, as a <inline font-style="italic">via media,</inline> to renew the Treaty for twelve months. After I had been advised that in all probability the Constitutional Conference could not be held this year, and as no arrangement had been made which would enable Australia to state her views upon the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, which affects her so vitally, I telegraphed, in October of last year, to the British Prime Minister, as follows : - </para>
                        <para>In my opinion, it is absolutely essential that the Dominion Prime Ministers should meet in London next year. We ought not to, in fact, we dare not, allow ourselves to drift along. The necessity for a clear understanding or- policy, call it what you will, on certain matters vitally affecting the Empire is urgent and obvious. I know, of course, that the  difficulties  in the way of a common foreign policy are most formidable. Empire problems are many and complex; they clamour for settlement, and I feel quite sure that as time goes on a solution will be less easy.&#39; I most earnestly recommend that you call a meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers next year in London - say, &#39; about June. _ Delay for another year is most dangerous.&#34; </para>
                        <para class="block">It had been originally understood that the proposed Constitutional Conference was to be held this year. But the other Dominion Prime Ministers intimated that they could not attend, and it was postponed. It was then suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George that a meeting of the Imperial Cabinet - that is, of Prime Ministers - should be held in Ottawa about the end of last year. That also was found to be impossible. The Anglo-  Japanese Treaty affected us vitally. Other matters of foreign policy hardly less so, and there was the question of naval defence about which some decision - whether based on Lord Jellicoe&#39;s report or not - could not be postponed.- As I pointed out when speaking originally upon this motion, the Anglo-Japanese Treaty affected us very much more than it did any other of the Dominions ; and I thought Australia&#39;s views should be heard. The Prime Minister of Great Britain <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lloyd George)</inline> agreed that they should; and he agreed, too, that it was essential that we should endeavour to come to some common understanding in regard to matters of foreign policy, including defence. In the ordinary course, these matters would have been discussed along with the consideration of constitutional changes, if any. As I have already said, I am opposed to constitutional changes. The question of the renewal of the Treaty, however, is, as I see it, a matter upon which our voice ought to be heard, and without delay; and we have been invited to express our opinions. But, if we . did not express our view, if we sent no one to the Conference, or if we expressed our opinion only here, the British Government would have to take its own course, and either renew &#39;or refuse to renew the Treaty. If it refused to renew it, in any shape or form, is there any honorable member who would be prepared to take responsibility for seeking to compel or induce the British Government to do so ? I would not be. I fully realize the dangers of Charybdis,  but I see also those of Scylla. The hope for the peace of the world lies in an alliance, or understanding of some sort, with the United States of America, and I would as soon think of jumping from the  Tarpeian  rock as of agreeing to anything that did not clearly set out our position in regard to the United States of America. This, then, is the position. It is essential that we should know where we stand on all these matters. It is essential that the Anglo-Japanese Treaty should be renewed, and should be renewed in a form that will not give offence to America. But I want to say that there is nothing to submit to the people of this country as regards the Japanese Treaty. Long before the Australian public could approve or disapprove, the Treaty will be renewed or else allowed to lapse. If our people do not approve, that will not alter matters by one- thousandth part of an inch. I say so </para>

                            Hughes. for this reason : I am not the mouthpiece of Britain upon the subject, but I feel sure that I do speak for what the majority of Britons think. There is no possibility of Britain ever going to war with America. The British people will not have it; and there is an end to it. If honorable members knew how far Britain went out of her path in the course of the Peace Conference to avoid giving umbrage to America, and how much Britain sought to do that which was pleasing to America, they would realize that the last thing that any British Government would think of would be to become embroiled in a war with the only nation in the world which, with our own, can hope to maintain the world&#39;s peace.

                        <para>The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has said that we must submit this matter to the people. On my return from Britain, if the Treaty as drawn up and agreed to is not satisfactory, this Parliament can say, &#34;We will have none of it &#34;  and we can renounce it. But the practical consequences will remain, and Australia will have to face them. Let me remind honorable members, that since 1902 the AngloJapanese Treaty has been in existence, and this Parliament has never made the slightest effort to express an opinion concerning it. There has not been the hint of a desire on the part of this country that Australia should not be a party to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. And, if war were to be precipitated to-morrow - as war broke out on 4th August, 1914: - with Britain as a party, what would Australia do ? We are told by some honorable members that it is now the settled policy of their party that Australians shall not fight outside of Australia. Those honorable members are. most amusing. They say that there is a danger arising from the AngloJapanese Treaty, that Australians may be compelled to fight outside of Australia - to fight against America. Australia need not fight against anybody by virtue of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, because. Australia need not approve it. But, under the Covenant of the League of Nations, which this Parliament has solemnly ratified, Australia will be compelled, if and when the League so decides, to send her quota of Naval and Military Forces against any nation in the world. These loud-mouthed gentlemen who eulogize the League - the Covenant of which they swallowed because they believed it emanated from some source other than Great Britain - now say that there is a danger  in the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, under which Australia has existed for more than eighteen years and has ignored it. The honorable member, for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> said we shall never fight side by side with Asiatics. Britain has never sought, and never will seek, to compel us to fight at all. She has never done so. What we have done has been done of our own free will. But the honorable member&#39;s memory is most convenient. What are the facts relating to the war ? Our first Australian Division would never have left these shores had they not been under the protection of a Japanese Fleet. They were kept in Australia until that Fleet could arrive in our waters in sufficient strength to escort our Forces in safety. And not only that: The . <inline font-style="italic">Emden</inline> would not have been  sunk but for the Japanese Fleet. I recall that in those days some honorable members suggested in. this House that we should hire Russians to fight for us, because it .would be cheaper and safer ! As a matter of fact, during the war we fought side by side with Asiatics - those of us who did fight; we fought side by side with Indians, and with Japanese, and against a white race, and a Christian race at that; people whom my friend the honorable member for Bourke was lauding last night, namely, the Germans. </para>

                    <para>. - I respectfully draw your attention, sir, to the fact that, in speaking to the motion which has just been disposed of, I tried to discuss the arguments of my opponents, and not to impugn their motives. I appeal to you and honorable members generally to say whether that has not always been my policy. I have not the slightest doubt that from time to time I shall be lied about unconsciously, but I strongly object to being lied about deliberately in your presence. I distinctly object to the utterly uncalled-for statement made about me by the Prime Minister. No utterance of mine has ever justified what he said about me, and he knows, when he makes a reflection of that sort on me, that it is not true. </para>

                        <para>- Without my expressing it, you will understand quite well what I mean. The Prime Minister, without any utterance or action on my part to call down such abuse on my head, referred to me as one who was antiImperial and pro-German. I strongly object to that statement. My attitude on these matters is known. It is the attitude that for a hundred years has been taken up by Englishmen whose love of their country is unquestionable. It is the attitude taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Phillip</inline> Gibbs and others. When I speak of England, I speak for the mass of the people who belong to England, and not for the particular class that happens to be dominant in its politics. If, after the lapse of time since the war ended, the Prime Minister feels that it is in conformity with his honour and sense of decency to still pursue assiduously such a policy of slander, I must leave him to it, but I draw your attention, and the attention of the House, to the fact that there is not, and never has been, anything in my public conduct to give any grounds whatever for such an utterance. </para>

I heard every word the honorable member said last night, and if he did not impute motives to persons on this side and to certain people elsewhere, and did not attempt to hold up England to ridicule and contempt, then I do not know the meaning of words. I prefaced what I had to say by speaking in the highest possible terms of members of this House, but added that I did not agree with some of their statements. I did not agree with the statements of the honorable member, and I thought it my duty to express my opinion. </para>

                        <para>.- I asked the Prime Minister yesterday a question regarding the necessity for appointing additional Judges to the Arbitration Court to hear cases regarding the reduction of working hours. The right honorable gentleman, in reply, said that in some instances these cases had been hung up by the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and pointed to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers had dealt with many cases. I have here, and want to put on record, a copy of the report of cases heard before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, because I wish the Prime Minister, before he leaves, to know that there is trouble brewing if something is not done to rectify these things. The report I have here is that of the cases of the Federated Gas Employees Industrial Union <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> the Metropolitan Gas Company and others, and also the Federated Gas Employees Industrial Union <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> the Brisbane Gas Company and others. I will read sufficient to let the Prime Minister see that he is wrong. The report reads as follows :  - </para>

                            Before Your Honour definitely announced the postponement of the consideration of hours, I may say we are very anxious to have some specific statement from Your Honour as to what is likely to happen in regard to that question of hours. This organization has been endeavouring for years past to get its hours reduced. In 1918 we asked
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                            Higgins for a rate of hours as to the ordinary work.

                            No, certainly not; but we have been fighting for a reduction of hours.

                            Our men have had their hopes built up, and they have been waiting for this case. During the gas workers&#39; strike last year we came to a settlement with the companies. It was on the understanding that the matters not fixed up then should be dealt with by the Court; and one of the matters left with the Court was the question of hours.

                            It may be that Your Honour has no power to do this. If so, Parliament or some one else should be impressed with the importance of this question. The men engaged in this industry have waited for the Court, and now find that Parliament has acted in such a way that this Court cannot deal with the matter. I am afraid that something will happen in this industry as it did in regard to the wages. Therefore, I should like, if possible, to get a definite statement as to when this union is likely to have the question of hours decided. I hope Your Honour will intimate that at an early date.

                            Powers will deal with, it as early as he possibly can ? &#34; . If so, they will want to know whether the Act has been altered, and whether

                            Powers will have the right to go on with it.

                            Parliament has passed an Act which prevents my doing it, and until Parliament amends that Act I cannot do it. It has also been made public that I have made suggestions. I cannot do more:

                            - Not until Parliament sees fit to alter the law, and gives the Court power to deal with it. At present they have not a Court that can deal with it because there are not at present available a President and two deputies. All I can suggest to you at present is that the unions should try and induce Parliament if they think it is right, to try and amend the law. I cannot express an opinion as a Judge on what Parliament does. If the union consider it a breach of faith, Parliament is the authority that must be approached.

                    <para>I have quoted sufficient to show the Prime Minister that these cases are being held up to-day in consequence of the Act passed by  us  requiring that the question of hours shall be dealt with by three Judges. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers says that in these circumstances he cannot deal with such a matter. That is altogether different from the statement made by  the Prime Minister as to the settlement of a number of cases. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers says that if Parliament will amend the law he will be able to deal with the question . The Prime Minister is about to leave Australia, and we do not want any industrial trouble to occur during his absence. That being so, the Government should make available the machinery necessary under the law for the settlement of questions of this character. Unless they do that we must expect trouble. I ask the Prime Minister, therefore, to attend to this matter before he leaves for England. </para>

                            <para>- That is no answer to my complaint. The right honorable gentleman knows very well that as the result of a measure recently passed by us the question of the hours of employment can be dealt with only by three Justices. Many of us opposed that provision when the Bill was before the House, but he held strongly to it. If we expect industrial bodies to carry on under that law it is only reasonable that the Government should put in operation the machinery for which it provides, so that their disputes may be settled. I shall bring before the Prime Minister industrial troubles that I think he may help to settle, and whenever it is necessary to do so in the interests of the country I shall appeal to the head of the Government, no matter whom he may be. </para>

An arrangement was entered into that the debate on. the motion relating to the Imperial Conference should close at 3.45 p.m. to-day. I rose on three or four occasions with the object of expressing my views in reference to our representation at the Conference, but was not afforded an opportunity to do so. </para>

This Parliament deliberately passed an Act giving employers and employees the right to settle their disputes in a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration instead of having to resort for that purpose to strikes and lock-outs. If the Government are not prepared to amend the Act, which provides that the question of the hours of labour in an industry shall be dealt with by not less than three Judges, they can get over the trouble by administrative act. All that it is necessary for them to do is to appoint the number of Judges required to constitute the requisite Court to deal with such questions. </para>

Our view is that if it is competent for one Judge to determine questions of wages one should be sufficient to deal with the hours of labour in an industry.

It holds that the question of hours must be settled in the near future. I ask the Government to give the matter very serious consideration. We are all apt to make mistakes, and I think it would be wise for the Government and &#39;the Parliament to say that a mistake was made in providing that the question of the hours of labour to be worked in any industry should be dealt with only by a Court of three Judges. Let us go back to the old order, of things, under which such a question could be dealt with by one Judge. Failing that, the Government should appoint the number of Judges necessary to enable the machinery of the Act in question to be put into operation. </para>

                    <para>Mr.RY AN. - He is not hanging onto his job. I am satisfied that he is doing his duty, It is unfortunate that a learned Judge can be criticised in this House, although no specific motion on the subject is before us. I rose to protest against the action of the Prime Minister and his Government in not placing on the table of the House at a much earlier date the documents which he read this afternoon, because I ascertained for the first time this afternoon that the Prime Minister himself was the instigator of the invitation issued to Dominions representatives to attend the Imperial Conference in June. </para>
