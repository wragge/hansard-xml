I know, applications for positions in the Bureau nave not yet come before me, but when they do the claims of returned soldiers will receive due consideration. The work to be done is highly technical, and in the fina&#93; selection the first consideration must be the fitness of the applicant to perform it. Subject to fitness, of course, preference will be given to returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- About a fortnight ago, I asked questions in this House regarding the ultimate home to be provided for certain returned soldiers who have been mentally afflicted, and the Assistant Minister for Repatriation gave me to understand that provision was being made by the Commonwealth Government for the care of these men. Since the House met this morning, I have been informed, over the telephone, that instructions have been issued to the officials at Mont Park Hospital that, on the first of next month, the control of that institution is to be handed over to the State authorities. In the course of my questions, I explained to the Minister the disabilities under which these unfortunates would be placed should they be transferred to State control. I wish to know whether it is a fact that the transfer is to be made ; and, if so, how it coincides with the assurance given me by the Minister only a comparatively few days ago. </para>

I know of no change of policy under which mental cases are to be transferred to the direct care of the State. The Commonwealth accepts full responsibility for the permanent care of all mental cases. </para>

                        <para>.- Tea is admitted free of duty, except in respect of that which comes into Australia in packages. There is very little of the latter, however. The latest official returns show that only 341,000 lbs. entered the Commonwealth in that form - which is an insignificant item compared with the total importations of about 56,000,000 lbs. </para>

                            <para>- The tea which we imported from within the Empire,according to the latest official returns covering one financial year, was distributed as follows: - From Ceylon, about 20,750,000 lbs. ; from Hong Kong, 55,000 lbs. ; and from India, 8,800,000 lbs. From China, we imported 928,000 lbs.; from Java, 26,000,000 lbs.; and from Japan, 360,000 lbs. Those figures reveal that a tremendous proportion of the tea imported from outside the Empire is grown in Java, while almost the whole of that obtained from within the Empire is grown in Ceylon and India. Nowadays, we see many people waving the flag, and we hear them talking with pride and sympathy of the great and sacrificial deeds of our Empire.. Here is an opportunity to show practical sympathy, and to. express practical loyalty. India and Ceylon are notable parts of the Empire; they. did their worthy share in the Great War. If tea is to come into Australia free of duty from any part of the world; it should be that grown within the Empire ; but it is my view that we should secure some revenue from tea imported from foreign countries. Care should be taken that the tea which we may import free shall be grown within the Empire, and not merely despatched from a point within the Empire; otherwise we may get it from Hong Kong, in which part of the Empire, however, it has not been grows. If we imposed a duty of 2d., per lb. on tea grown outside the Empire, we would receive an additional revenue of &#163;360,000. I cannot understand why tea drinkers should not be called upon to pay something in this direction towards the revenue. We have increased the duties in other directions, as we have to pay higher prices for our cigars, whisky, and ales; and there does not appear to be any reason why tea drinkers should not contribute towards the revenue. </para>

I want it to be clearly understood that I desire to give preference to tea grown within the Empire, whichIsuggest should be free of duty, and that tea grown outside the Empire should be dutiable at 2d. per lb.

                        <para>.- The item under discussion is of some importance, and, as tea is not produced in the Commonwealth I believe that it should be free of duty. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has. consistently opposed Protection for certain Australianindustries; but is prepared om this item, for revenue purposes, to impose a duty of 2d. per lb. </para>

                    <para>Mr.CHARLTON.- There is a difference of opinion on that point. During the whole of the debate I have heard  very  little from the honorable member in support of our own industries, and I think it will be admitted that he has been doing his best in the direction of Free Trade. In connexion with this particular item, the honorable member not  only  wishes to maintain the  duty  of1d. per lb on 20-lb. packages, but desires to go further and impose a duty of 2d. per lb. on tea produced&#34; outside the Empire. It really comes to this: The honorable member is prepared to support Protection within the Empire, but not within Australia, which is an integral  part  of the British Empire. He believes in such countries  as  India being given consideration, but he has not endeavoured to give Protection to the industries within the Commonwealth. Personally,I am opposed to a tax on tea. The honorable member said that these who consumed tea should be prepared to pay far it, but he must not overlook the fact that a large majority of the people in Australia axe tea drinkers, and it is generally admitted that, as a beverage, tea is essential in this climate. </para>

                            <para>- Of course they should. As we cannot produce tea, there is no reason  why we  should impose a duty, and the Committee would be acting wisely if they removed the duty altogether. It has been admitted that only 341,000 lbs. have been imported in 20-lb. packages, and that is very little. I think we should remove the duty, and allow the Australian people to have tea as cheaply as possible. </para>

The Minister for Trade and Customs has said that1d. duty is sufficient to protect the tea packing industry here, but the honorable member for Dampier wishes to impose  an  additional tax, which means that tea consumers would have to pay more. </para>

                        <para>. - The Committee has agreed to an increase in the duty on candles, and the duty proposed on stearine is quite inconsistent with that decision. If it remains as proposed the stearine will be imported, and for the manufacture of candles will be required only to be moulded here, which is the simplest part of the manufacture, and thus candles made here from imported stearine will come into competition with the candle industry. Stearine is the most important element of these manufactures, and from it byproducts, are used in connexion with the manufacture of woollens and also of explosives. The manufacture of stearine, therefore is, in a sense, part of our defence system. The most important consideration is the manufacture of stearine in Australia from our own tallow. While we have increased the duty on candles, we have left what is. really the main industry still at the mercy of outside competition as before. I am given to understand that wax can be landed here, paying the present duty, at a less rate than it costs to manufacture stearine in Australia. If that is so, it proves the necessity for protecting the manufacture of stearine, in order that we may utilize our own tallow. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to look into this matter with a view to putting the duty on this article on a proper basis. The paraffine wax imported into Australia is produced by black labour, and that is an additional reason why we should put our own industry for the manufacture of stearine by white labour on a proper footing. The industry has been established in every State, and for many years has been employing a considerable number of hands, whilst the production of the article here is of benefit indirectly to numbers of people employed in other industries. The cost of production here has been checked, and the statement that it costs more to produce it than the price at which wax can be imported from other countries can be vouched for. I have no objection to people using wax candles where, in this country, they can be used, but so far as. their use in the warmer parts of Australia is concerned there would be ne harm done if their local production was wiped out altogether. By protecting the manufacture of stearine we give facilities for the production of oline, which is used in the manufacture of woollen goods and glycerine, which is used in the manufacture of cordite. Before I submit an amendment, I should&#39; like to know from the Minister whether he will agree to an increase in the duty on this article on the same basis as the increase agreed to on candles? </para>

                            <para>- There is no necessity to convert me to belief in protection for the industries of the Commonwealth, I may be a little inclined tp go to extremes in the matter of Protection. In the production of stearine we have an essential industry closely connected with the candle industry. The Minister has very wisely consented to give some further protection to the candle industry, and that is appreciated by the manufacturers. The protection of the stearine industry does not mean the protection merely of the production of paraffine wax and stearine, but of other products manufactured from tallow which are of very great importance. If we allow paraffine wax to come in under the present rate of duty, we shall practically wipe out of existence the use of stearine for candle-making purposes. It has already been pointed out that paraffine wax, under the present Tariff, can be brought in at a price below that at which stearine can be manufactured here. We are out, therefore, to protect the Australian stearine industry. All the money used in the purchase of the material from which stearine is made, and all the wages earned in connexion with the industry, are spent in Australia ; whereas the money paid for the purchase of paraffine wax is sent outside Australia; and in the preparation of the wax, black labour is employed. As a White Australia community, we have no desire to encourage black labour. The stearine industry benefits the Australian farmer, the grazier,&#39; and the worker. In connexion with the manufacture of stearine candles in Australia, we produce annually 1,000 tons of glycerine, which is largely used in the manufacture of cordite, and for many other purposes; and if we do not protect the stearine industry, we shall have to bring in from overseas large quantities of that by-product. Knowing that thousands of tons of fallow are used annually in the manufacture of stearine candles here, the Minister will, I am sure, agree to increase the duty. </para>

                    <para>When we increased the duty on candles two days ago, it was said that the result would be an increase in prices - that the people outback have practically no other means of lighting, and would have to pay more for their candles. I have it on the best authority; however, that since we have seen fit to grant the industry a very necessary increased protection, the manufacturers have decided not only not to in crease, but from to-morrow to decrease, by&#189;d. per packet, the price of candles to the . people outback. </para>

                        <para>.- This matter was brought under my notice quite recently, and I have been looking into it. The object sought to be achieved in arranging the duties on candles and wax has been, as far as possible, to protect the manufacturers of stearine candles as against the wax candle. If honorable members will compare the item relating to candles with that now under discussion, they will see that the arrangement hitherto has been such that the duty on wax has been slightly below the duty on candles. There has been a difference of id. per lb. We have now raised the duty on candles to 2id. per lb. I appreciate the arguments which have been put forward as to the necessity for a slightly higher duty on paraffine wax, inasmuch as it can be brought here and moulded directly into candles without any further process of manufacturing. In that way, it must become a serious competitor with candles manufactured from the Australian raw material, unless we give an additional protection to the local stearine industry by imposing an additional duty. It seems to me, however, that the same balance as between the paraffine wax and the paraffine candles - that is a difference of&#189;d. per lb. - should be maintained. That, in the circumstances, is just. I therefore move - </para>

It retains the balance that has hitherto existed under the Tariff as between the wax and the finished article! At the same time, it will give an additional protection against paraffine wax, which is the competitor of our stearine candle. </para>

We shall never be short of tallow in Australia for the manufacture of stearine. In any case, candles made from paraffine wax are neither suitable nor desirable in Australia.  I  remember some thirteen years- ago, when this question, was before us, the &#34; poor miner &#34; was trotted out, but certainly paraffine wax candles are not suit-, able for his purposes. </para>

I  have discussed the matter fully with the honorable gentleman, and I regard his proposals as fair and reasonable. We have to decide whether candles shall be made from stearine or paraffine wax, and to assure ourselves that there is no possibility of the stearine industry suffering by reason of importations. The Minister, as  I  say, has gone, into the matter, and  I  agree with him that there is  no  possibility of the industry suffering if &#39;his present proposals are&#39; accepted. There will be an increase in the . duty on the wax and another increase on the finished paraffine wax candles, and there is an increase of the duty on candles made from stearine, so thai, under. all the. circumstances, the balance. ..is. maintained and the industry is fully protected. </para>

This stearine industry, and all the industries based on the manufacture of tallow, are essentially Australian. The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> has put the case very clearly, and there is no doubt that in all these matters we ought to keep our defence requirements in view. If there is any item in the Tariff that needs protection I should say it was this one; and the increase in duty should be at- least Id., in which direction I am prepared to move. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to point to the value of the stearine as a key industry for defence purposes. In the manufacture of stearine candles in Australia the annual production of glycerine amounts to 1,000 tons, which is sufficient to make 2,000 tons of cordite. This is sold to our explosive and ammunition works, and&#39; during the war, besides supplying our own requirements, a large quantity was placed at the disposal of the British Government. If the&#189;d. increase is not sufficient, I would like the Minister to consider the advisability of advancing the duty. </para>

                        <para>.- Two requests were made to me originally by the candle manufacturers. They asked for an additional1d. on candles, and an additional1d. on wax. In this Tariff I have given them a&#189;d. on candles, and I am prepared to give them1d. on wax, which will maintain the balance sought in their requests. I have looked into this matter earefully, and I think I am advising the Committee properly when I say that, in my judgment,&#189;d. is fair protection. It represents a protection for the stearine industry, as against paraffine wax, of &#163;18 13s.4d. per ton. I think that, in the circumstances, what I am doing is right. </para>

                            <para>- A great deal of latitude is usually allowed during the discussion of the items in a Tariff. No honorable member can have very much respect for the manner in which the Tariff has been debated up to the present, as item after item has gone through without even the slightest debate. Upon further consideration, I think that probably it would be better if I deferred my remarks until we are considering woollens, as I want to be able to speak generally on the high, cost of living, and to quote from reports submitted by the Inter-State Commission. I want to show how the woollen manufacturers of this country have unduly exploited the people. However, I shall take a better opportunity of doing so. </para>

                        <para>.- I have always been strongly of the opinion that we cannot do too much in the direction of encouraging trade between the various portions of the Empire, and particularly with Great Britain. The Minister proposes to admit cotton, linen, and other piece goods, n.e.i., free from Great Britain, as against 5 per cent. under the intermediate Tariff, and 15 per cent. under the general Tariff, but I would like to have Free Trade within the Empire. Great Britain depends very largely upon the manufacture of cotton goods, and we ought to do all we can to give it every possible advantage in that respect, particularly in view of the fact that since the war the United States of America have been making a powerful attempt to wrest from the Old Country its supremacy in the cotton trade. It is our duty to support the Motherland, not only in times of war, but also in times of peace. Because I feel that this is our duty, and also because I am absolutely convinced that the establishment of Free Trade within the British Empire would advance, not only the interests of the Empire as a whole, but also those of Australia, I want to see the adoption of this principle as far as possible. Of course, we should not gb to extremes in anything in politics. One begins to get into trouble at once by adopting absolute FreeTrade or absolute prohibition. I advocate neither course, but simply claim that we should give the Old Land, and the various Dominions, the greatest form of preference, approaching as close as possible to Free Trade, with safeguards which could easily be adjusted to prevent the products of coloured labour from overwhelming those of white workers. Anything we can do to help Great Britain, in the cotton trade, will assist it to maintain its supremacy in that trade, and also its command of the mercantile marine. I hope the Minister, right through these textile items, will give as far as possible a free list to  Great  Britain. </para>

I have raised the British preference from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent. Cotton, linen, and other piece goods are free, 5 per cent., and 15 per cent, in their respective columns, as against free and 5 per cent, in the previous Tariff. I have increased the duty on cotton and linen piece goods defined for cutting up from free, and 5 per cent, to 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 20 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- There is a little difference between that class of goods and cotten, linen, and other piece goods, n.e.i., and I thought that when they came in defined for cutting up it would be an advantage to get a little revenue out of them. However, there is in that item a preference of 15 per cent, to Great Britain. In the sub-items the same preference will be found. I propose to make an alteration to sub-item d, covering silk, which will go back to some extent on the general in-, ten tion to give a preference of 15 per cent, to Great Britain, the reason being that the exportation of silk from that country is practically negligible, and the giving of a substantial preference to British goods would not be effective. Where there is no doubt as to Great Britain&#39;s ability to manufacture and supply our needs in regard to textiles, felts, and furs, I have throughout increased the preferential Tariff in their favour from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent. I have given her <inline font-style="italic">carte &#34;blanche</inline> to do what I recognise she can do - give us all we want; and if she cannot do it on a 15 per cent, preference she ought to be able to do so. There is a departure from that principle in regard to calico for bag-making, because Great Britain does not manufacture that particular class of goods, and to give her a preference in that respect would simply mean putting an unnecessary tax on our own people. For that reason I have taken off the whole of the duty on calico for bag-making. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The flour we export goes away very largely in calico bags. That is why I have removed the duty. The effect of an amendment that I am going to move will be to leave tubular cotton piece goods exactly where they are in the Tariff, in so far ,as they are not used for the manufacture of articles of clothing. At the present time there is a certain class of tubular cotton piece goods coming into the country which, are simply chopped up, and which can thus be very easily converted into articles of clothing.  These goods are coming into competition with an established industry, and therefore it seems desirable that we should make the alteration to which I invite the Committee to agree. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Minister why yarns, sewing cottons, and silks have been omitted from this division of the Tariff? The item of yarns is a key item for textile manufactures, and therefore should have appeared at the head of the textile division. It should be dealt with before we determine, the duty upon cloths and attire. A similar remark is applicable to sewing cottons, without which the whole of the textiles would be practically valueless. Why these articles have been placed in items 392 and 393 of the schedule is beyond my comprehension. There is one matter connected with this particular item which requires some explanation at the hands of the Minister. The ways of the Customs Department are peculiar at the very best of times. How the officers of that Department arrive at their decisions I have been endeavouring, without success, to understand for the past twenty years. It is no wonder that our importers become confused by the way in which duties are manipulated. As a matter of fact, certain goods which are imported may be placed under different headings of the Tariff, and the authorities are thus able to twist them to suit their own convenience. I know of instances in which an officer has decided that tie duty payable upon a particular article was so and so, and after the goods have gone into consumption the authorities have come along and determined upon the payment of a higher duty. It is for this reason that I desire something definite. In this schedule it is proposed that leather cloth shall be dutiable, under sub-item h (3) of the item which we are now discussing, at 5 per cent. British preferential Tariff, 10 per cent. intermediate Tariff, and 15 per cent. general Tariff. Then, under item 130a, it is proposed that duck waterproofed by treatment with any substance shall be dutiable at 15 per cent., 20 per cent., and 25 per cent. respectively. As oil baize, leather cloth, and upholstery ducks are practically identical, there will thus be three rates of duty upon similar articles. If they were placed under the one heading all difficulties of classification would disappear. I am not complaining of the duties which it is proposed to levy upon these goods. But every importer should know exactly what he has to pay upon them. It would simplify matters, both for the Customs authorities and the importers, if all these goods were subject to one duty. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to amend the item so as to make it read &#34; Cotton, linen, flaxen and other piece goods, n.e.i. ; oil baize and upholstery duck&#34;, &#38;c. I am advised that all these articles are used for the one purpose, and consequently they should all be included in the same category. I think that the three items which have been enumerated by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> should be subject to the one duty. Now there are three heads of classification - certain articles, such as oil baize, are admitted free ; others are classified as leather cloth ; and others again as upholstered duck. This diversity of classification creates an enormous amount of trouble for importers as well as for the Customs officials, and must also increase the cost of administration. I do not ask for an abolition of duty, but I think that an arrangement might be made which would lessen the difficulties that are complained of. Week after week decisions in regard to classification are made and published, so that they fill whole books. According to an article published in a Tasmanian newspaper in 1911, there were then 14,000 fluctuating decisions. The simpler the Tariff schedule, the better for the community. </para>

                            <para>- Leather cloth- not the light material that is stamped &#34; leather cloth,&#34; but an article well-known in the trade - is dutiable because it competes seriously with our own leathers. The acceptance of the honorable member&#39;s suggestion would tend to prejudice the waterproofing industry here. Canvas and duck imported from the United Kingdom are admitted free, and used locally for waterproofing material. Oil baize is not made here. </para>

                            <para>- The proposed wide definition includes articles that are made here. Great care has to be exercised in the framing of definitions, and in the Department we thresh out every matter carefully so that no loop-hole may be left  for importation prejudicial to local industries. The task is an extremely difficult <inline font-style="italic">one,</inline> but we have done our best, and have succeeded fairly well. Any change in the items takes a considerable time to work out in all its details, but definite decisions are published from time to time which make lines of demarcation that, after a little while, the trade gets to know and to act on. What the honorable member proposes is too  far-reaching. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a revenue duty; but we thought that silk was more or less a luxury, or, at any rate, an article on which we might fairly impose taxation. The preference to Great Britain is not effective to any extent, because silk is not manufactured there. So what I am proposing is, in effect, to revert to the old duties in respect of silk piece goods. These latter are the raw material for some of our own industries - ties, parasols, and the like. We found that the duty under the general Tariff was so close to the duty upon apparel that there was not sufficient margin. I think, however, that the proposal to restore the former impost on silk goods will prove satisfactory to local manufacturers who work on the imported raw material. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment, if agreed to, will certainly improve matters. I do not intend to move a further amendment, but I wish the Minister would consent to the imposition of a duty of  10  per cent. only upon silk imported for the manufacture of ties, parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas. I understand that there are fifteen tie-making establishments in Australia, and these employ a large number of hands. I ask the Minister to give my proposition serious consideration. </para>

                        <para>.- -The Minister for Customs has proposed a substantial reduction which should have considerable effect upon the tie and umbrella manufacturing industry. In my view, however, the duty upon the raw material could have been still further reduced. Industries which are prosperous to-day may not be in such good circumstances twelve months hence; and this </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Tariff, of course, is to stand for a long time. England imports her silk free from Italy and France, and has a great advantage in competing here with Australian makers of silk ties and umbrellas. I do not object to fair competition; but we need to see that it is fair, and that we are not injuring a promising Australian enterprise for lack of reasonable encouragement. While the Minister has been generous I would like to see a slight reduction even upon the rates under the old Tariff. I have been informed that, unless Australian silk tie-makers - who deal in a raw material which Australia cannot produce - can secure increased production, or be given greater protection against overseas competition, they will be unable to satisfactorily establish themselves. I ask the Minister to postpone consideration of this item in order that he may go more deeply into the matter of local manufacture from English silk piece goods, and, perhaps, agree to an additional 5 per cent. reduction. </para>

But since that, from information I have received, I believe the Minister would be acting wisely if he inserted a sub-item to deal with ties, parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas under departmental by-laws. It has been pointed out to me that some such amendment as this is necessary if our industries are to exist, which they cannot do if the Minister&#39;s amendment is adopted. </para>

The Minister proposes to increase the British preferential Tariff on silk introduced into Australia for general purposes, which, of course, can be considered a luxury, from 15 to 20 per cent. The proposed rate is evidently for the purpose of obtaining revenue. I do not take any exception to the present rate, and I do not think I would have objected if it were 30 per cent. The position taken up by manufacturing industries in Australia is that silk is used for articles of utility that must be obtained by all sections of the community, and when we consider that phase of the question we have to endeavour, as far as possible, to protect our own industries. </para>

                            <para>- That the Minister should agree to an addition to sub-item dd, covering silk for manufacturing ties, parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas under departmental by-laws, making the rate of duty less than on other articles. That is all I require, because our own industries are not in a position to compete with imported articles. </para>

                            <para>-  I can contradict that statement, because I have been informed that the pre-war Tariff on raw material was, under the British preferential Tariff, 10 per cent., and 15 per cent. on foreign silks. I understood from the Minister that he was amending the rates so that they would be equivalent to prewar rates, but that cannot be so, as he proposes increasing the British preferential Tariff to 20 per cent. I am informed that the great bulk of the trade done  by  Australian manufacturers was in lines at two prices, namely, 12s. per dozen and 20s. per dozen. Buying with the greatest care, and being extremely keen over each item required in the manufacture, they were, in the case of the 12s. per dozen lines, just able to beat the imported ties by 6d. per dozen; but, in the case of their 20s. line, more often than otherwise they were imported at 18s. 6d: per dozen, which was 1s. 6d. per dozen less than the Australian tie. Their only  reason  for getting trade at this price was because smaller quantities could be bought, and they were on the spot to deliver at once. Several of the manufacturers at this time imported ties, and were able to sell them profitably in competition with goods of their own manufacture. As this happened with a Tariff of 15 per cent, on foreign raw material, it requires no great foresight to understand what will happen if we are asked to pay 30 per cent, on our foreign silks, which form 80 per cent, of the trade. I ask the Minister to consider this matter, with a view to charging a lower duty on the silk we use in manufacture in Australia, and which thus affords employment to our own people. </para>

                        <para>.- This matter has been before me on many occasions, and the amendment I have moved is the result of the consideration that has been given to the whole question. If &#39;honorable members will turn to the Tariff, and compare the pre-war rates with those I am now proposing as between the rate on silk-piece goods and that rate &#169;n apparel, they will find that there is a difference between the apparel rate and the piece-good rate of 25 per cent, which has been retained. The 25 per cent, in my opinion gives an ample protection for the manufacturer of ties. </para>

                            <para>-  Honorable members must remember that the high apparel rate is on the finished article. There is not a further 25 per cent, difference, but there is 25 per cent, greater protection on the finished article than on the raw material. I do not know, but I think it would be fair to assume that the finished article, generally speaking, would be worth double the price of piece goods, which means that there is an actual protection of 50 per cent. </para>

The rates which I have provided in the Tariff have been carefully considered, and are in my opinion ample to give the necessary protection to manufacturers. Personally, I am not prepared to give any further concessions in this particular direction as it seems that it is ample protection as to British goods, and the rate is still greater on goods coining, from Prance and Italy. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the difference between the apparel rate and the silk piece rate. tinder the amendment the British preferential rate is to be 25 per cent., and the foreign rate 35 per cent. It must be remembered that SO per cent, of the imported ties are made by .British manufacturers from foreign, silk, and they enter the Commonwealth with preference over foreign made goods, so that the manufacturers consider that there is a margin of only 10 per cent.

I was under the impression when the Minister very generously amended the rates to 15 and ,20 per cent, that we were going back to the pre-war rates, but I find that the position is as stated by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> the duties, in those days, being 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- &#39;Exactly. Even if we were paying 15 per cent, in those days it has been altered to 20 per cent. Surely with the protection that this industry is asking for - particularly when the material cannot be manufactured in this country - there is no one who would&#39;  support actual prohibition by refusing the concession that the people in the tie and umbrella industry are asking for. There are certain subsidiary items, such as silver tops, which are used in the manufacture of umbrellas and parasols, and if they come in as manufactured articles they are cheaper than they would be if introduced in bulk for manufacture here. I do not say that the tie or umbrella industry is of great importance at this juncture, but if the Government will give the industry sufficient encouragement the manufacturers are prepared to invest more capital in it. </para>

I represent as many people, and perhaps more, than the honorable member does. We want articles that cannot be manufactured in this country to come here, but. we must give our industries an opportunity to compete, not only with Great Britain, but with foreign countries. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the proposed reduction of the duty on piece silk imported for the manufacture of these articles. Piece silk is not manufactured in Australia at all. The idea that silk ties are a luxury is fallacious. A silk tie from the economical point of view is the cheapest tie that any man can wear. I have on a silk tie which I have been wearing for two years. If I wore cotton ties I should have had to purchase twenty in the same time. Silk piece goods made here into ladies&#39; blouses represent the most economical apparel that ladies can wear. To argue that a duty on the raw material of these industries is justifiable because silk ties are a luxury is merely to cloud the issue by suggesting that the Government desire to tax the rich and leave the poor untaxed. Silk piece goods are manufactured here into articles of utility and the most economical apparel that can be worn. There is no factory in Australia making silk piece goods that are made up into ties, and if the tie industry is to be developed the duty must be removed from the silk piece goods used in the industry. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> argued some time ago that bulk tea should be admitted free to Australia because it was put into packages in this country, and the thing to do was to make the packages dutiable. In the same way I say that silk piece goods, used in the manufacture of ties, should be admitted free, or at as low a duty as possible, because, no doubt, the Treasurer must consider the revenue aspect of the Tariff. If that is the intention in this case, why does not the Minister for Trade and Customs say definitely that he is introducing a revenue Tariff, and cut out all the nonsense he has talked about building up Australian industries? </para>

                        <para>. -  I wish that honorable members would consent to go to a division on this item. We have been talking about it for a long time. I have explained the item to the Committee, not once, but half-a-dozen times, and now we have an honorable member, who was not present during the previous discussion, standing up and again repeating that the proposed arrangement of the duties does not protect the local industry. It does. It gives the local industry a protection of 40 per cent. It  give3  it exactly the same amount of protection that it has &#39;had all along. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member will look at the Tariff he will find that  under  the proposal I am now making the United Kingdom rate is 15 per cent., the intermediate rate 15 per cent., and the general Tariff rate 20 per cent. If he will look at item 110 he will find that the United Kingdom rate on apparel is 40 per cent., the intermediate rate 50 per cent., and the general Tariff rate 55 per cent. Our manufacturers buy foreign silk piece-goods and their com petition is with manufactured articles from Great Britain, which are dutiable at 40 per cent. This represents a difference of 20 per cent. Then members must bear in mind that the value of the manufactured article is practically double the value of the raw material. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is; I can prove that from the statistics of the Trade and Customs Department. Therefore the protection which the industry is given on the manufactured article is 40 per cent. I say that that is ample. The proof of that statement is that that is the protection which the industry has had all along, and under which it has been built up and has grown to considerable proportions. I am retaining that protection in the case of imports from Great Britain, and have increased it in the case of imports of these goods from foreign countries. </para>

                            <para>- Just so; and, as I say, we are giving the industry exactly the same amount of protection that it had before. The position, as I see it, is that, inasmuch as the manufactured ties from silk piece-goods are worth double the value of the silk with which they are manufactured, if a protection of 20 per cent, in excess is given on the manufactured article the effective protection must be doubled, and, therefore, it is an effective protection of 40 per cent, that is proposed for this industry.

                            <para>- I am talking now about ties only. The tie industry is a big one here, but the general Tariff duty of 55 per cent, is of no value to the local manufacturers, since ties are not imported from foreign countries. Our only competition comes from the Mother Country itself. As we have no silk industry the question is whether we should encourage the development of our tie industry by giving the manufacturers the raw material at a reasonable price. I suggest to the Minister that the original duties of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, on the raw material would produce quite as much revenue as he is likely to get from the increased duties, and that a reversion to the original duties would also have the effect of substantially increasing the tie industry here. It would enable manufacturers to absorb a large proportion of the trade that is at present catered for by imports. It is true that there is a duty of 40 per cent, on made-up ties from the Mother Country, and that the honorable gentleman has added 20 per cent, to that duty. Nominally, there is a protection of 20 per cent., but practically there is a little more by reason of the greater value of the made-up article. The tie manufacturers, however, had the benefit of that difference before. </para>

                            <para>- This matter has never been brought before the Department. Had there been any real need for such a change, we should have heard of it long :20. It seems to me that people very often put up these proposals, without- first consulting the Department, in the hope that they will carry them, and that they have some object to serve, of which, we know nothing at the time. If we accepted such proposals off-hand, we might suddenly discover that we had done something that we dM not wish to do. Unless we have a fair opportunity to look into these technical alterations - and they are very technical in their detail - we should not be asked to make them. We should nob be asked off-hand to take a line out of one item and to put it in another when there have been no representations to us in regard to the matter. If there was any grave reason for this change, we should have heard of it long ago. I ask that tinsel cloth and tinsel belting remain in the item in which they now stand. </para>

                        <para>.- We find that there are two items dealing practically with the same article. According to the departmental classification, tinsel, which is a metallic artificial silk, comes in under item 105e, while what is exactly the same kind of thing is classified differently, and comes in under 106a. I join with the honorable member for# Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> in asking that &#39; both be dealt with in the one item. The amendment means that both will be dutiable, so that no loss of duty is involved in its acceptance. My sole desire is that we shall simplify, as far as possible, the bringing in of goods through the Customs </para>

                    <para class="block">Department, since any expense incurred in that way must necessarily involve further cost to the people. Without desiring in any way to reflect upon the Department, I must say that it is absolutely autocratic in its methods. The classification in operation this week may be altered next week. One has only to look at the extraordinary classification book issued by the Department to realize the detail involved. I presume a great deal of it is necessary. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt; but my object is&#39;, as far as possible, to simplify the Customs procedure, so that every importer may know exactly what duty he has to pay. I am afraid that much of the agitation against the removal of the Seat of Government from Melbourne to Canberra is due to the fact that local merchants and others realize that, while they are able, as at present, to get readily into touch with the Department - and I am not for one moment suggesting anything improper - they have a better chance of having their cases looked into than has a business man in another State who has to interview the  Deputy  Controller of Customs, who, in turn, is bound by the instructions issued to him under the classification. When several classes of goods are brought out in the one package, the whole parcel has to be opened in order that the goods may be examined and classified. I am not arguing as to whether these goods should be dutiable or not - that is a matter wholly for the Parliament to decide; I simply suggest that the amendment would simplify the Customs procedure in regard to at least one line. </para>

I have not had an opportunity to thoroughly inquire into this proposal, but what I think is at the bottom of it may be briefly stated. There is a provision in the Customs Act that a substitute for any particular article shall come under that article for which it is substituted.  </para>

                            <para>- It is a provision which cannot he avoided. I admit that these two articles do look something alike, though one is an artificial silk, with an artificial metallic basis, and the other is a true tinsel, having a small proportion of silk finish with a true metallic base. This artificial silk is probably a copy of the tinsel; and the reason it is put under a different item from tinsel is that it is a substitute for silk, and must, therefore, be rated as silk. These difficulties crop up in administration in a hundred and one different ways. Even if we did what is requested, and changed this from one item to the other, it would only give rise to another set of difficulties of exactly the same kind in the matter of interpretation - difficulties inseparable from the administration of the Customs law. We do our best to meet the requirements of the trade, and, though there have been no representations made up to the present, I shall do whatever lies in&#39; my power in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- -These duties are an increase on the duties imposed by the Tariffs of 1908 and 1914, and I should like to take this opportunity to deal with the position of the woollen industry in Australia. I endeavoured to address myself to this question some time ago, but was ruled out of order; and I take the present opportunity to raise a protest. I feel that, while the war was on, the woollen manufacturers of Australia did not &#34; play the game &#34; so far as this country is concerned, and that remark applies also to the woollen manufacturers of Canada. I address my remarks particularly to honorable members opposite, who  have been very persistent in their arguments in favour of high protective duty. I think they will find it difficult to show that the worker engaged in the industry has had anything like- </para>

                            <para>- I propose to do so ; but the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has very pointedly remarked that I am here as a Free Trader, and, of course, against Protection. This is unjust and unfair. Where it is shown by statistics that an industry is languishing, and there is a desire for higher duties, I am prepared to grant them. But has it been shown in this instance that the industry needs more protection? The Victorian State Government appointed a Fair Profits Commission to inquire as to the profits of manufacturers in this State, and that Commission, in its Report No. 13, issued last year, says - </para>

                        <para>There is one other mill, and perhaps two, in which the profits have been increased by too high a rate of gross profit on turnover. The other mills, forming a majority, have been making no more than fair profits. Of the two mills just named as making undue profits, one is a &#34; private &#34; business, i.e., not a public company, but its figures for the past three years are as notable as those of the second mill, which is a public company, and so can be freely named, as the Ballarat Woollen and Worsted Company Limited. Some further reference to this company, must be made. It has had many vicissitudes in past years, but of recent years has been very prosperous. After making all allowances for writing off capital in former years, it cannot be said - and the Commission adopts the company&#39;s own figures - that shareholders have put more than &#163;60,000 original capital into the business. In addition, within the last few years &#163;30,00.0 of reserves have been capitalized and issued in shares to the shareholders. According to published statements, at an interim meeting of the company, held a few weeks ago, the following distribution of profits for the half-year was made, partly out of accumulated but previously undistributed profits, namely: - </para>

                            <para>- There was no justification whatever for these manufacturers putting up prices as they did. During the general debate on the Tariff. I read a letter sent from the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney in regard to blankets, pointing out that the Australian manufacturers could not supply all the blankets required for the people. Letters have also been appearing in the press recently on this subject. One was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> only a few days ago, from a draper, who stated that he could not get supplies of the cheaper flannels required for the poorer sections of the community. </para>

                            <para>- It must not be forgotten that during the war our woollen manufacturers got all their wool at the appraised prices. They were not called upon to pay the high rates demanded of the English manufacturers for the same types of wool, but, nevertheless, they raised the prices of their goods enormously, especially for the articles manufactured from the poorer types of wool. The Minister has given us an undertaking that when the Tariff Bill comes down he will make an effort to insert some provision for the protection of the people in regard to items in respect of which high duties have been imposed under this Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to make a suggestion. I understand that the Denton Hat Mills and most manufacturers at present will only supply wholesale houses; and I suggest that if we impose duties, with the idea of making this country self-supporting, we should see to it that the people are able to get their requirements at fair and reasonable prices. I believe the Minister intends to include provision in the Tariff Bill to the effect that where protection is afforded an industry, those who control it shall be compelled to supply goods, say, for cash, to retail houses. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister knows why I want to bring this matter forward. I have some remarkable information concerning the position of the woollen industry in Canada, showing how the manufacturers there fleeced the people during the war. They paid poor rates of wages to the workers, and made enormous profits. We know, also, that during the war there was, in this country, one section of the people always ready to give everything. They were to be seen on the wharfs and in the hospitals, men and women, devoting their daily lives to the task of helping the Empire in the struggle. And there was another crowd, generally to be seen chasing around in motor cars, waving flags, and always talking about the Empire, but who, at the same time, were robbing the people for all they were worth. </para>

                            <para>- I think we all indorse the remark of President Harding, that special legislation should be brought in to provide that, during war time, every person should have his allotted duty, and that no one should be allowed to make undue profits. I have no time for the man who wants high protective duties, but is not prepared to do a fair thing by the community. And yet we have evidence of this on every hand. There is the statement, in the <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Australian,</inline> to the effect that, although the capital invested in the woollen industry in Australia was only about &#163;1,100,000, in three years the manufacturers made profits amounting to more than the whole of the amount invested. </para>

                        <para>.- It is quite refreshing to-day to hear the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> talk about the advisableness of dealing with the people who make excessive profits.  His  remarks are iu marked contrast to what we have been accustomed to in this House during the past few years. I agree with him. So far as woollen goods are concerned, I admit freely that during the war, and at the present time, too, the prices charged to the general public are altogether too high. I. also remind the honorable member that the people who support him - the importers of goods manufactured in other countries - also charged excessive prices during the war period. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently, nothing alters the position in the opinion of the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster).</inline> He knows that during the war the wool produced in Australia was exported overseas, manufactured there, and when returned to Australia was  sold  at prices far in excess of its true value- I am not justifying high prices at all. I merely want to remind the honorable member for Dampier of the true position; and I ask him if he  ha3 forgotten  the very many occasions when this matter was brought up by honorable members on this side of the House during the war, and if he did anything to help us? The Government then had full power, under the War Precautions Act regulations, to do whatever they liked to stop profiteering. When we impaled the Government on this issue, what did the honorable member do? Why, he supported those who were plundering the people. Let him not forget that. He has little cause to talk at us, and to question my consistency  in  regard to this  matter.  My conduct  in  regard to this matter during the war was quite consistent right through. I always, complained that the Government were permitting the manufacturers in this country to rob the people. The honorable member now expresses surprise that more revenue was not received through the medium of the war-time profits tax. But, after all, that was only another device to permit those who were inclined to increase their prices to extract from the people more than they were entitled to get. They felt secure so long as the Government were able to collect something in the form of excess profits tax. That was the kind of legislation which the honorable member supported, notwithstanding that honorable members on this side of the House frequently pointed to the serious position into which the country  was drifting. </para>

                            <para>- We are on woollen goods, and I am replying to some statements made by the honorable member for Dampier. However, if the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> wants to bring me back to the point,  I  may state that last year we imported woollen goods to the value of &#163;3,500,000, as compared with &#163;2,000,000 worth made up in. Australia. It appears, therefore, that there is room for improvement, so far as our own manufacturing industry is concerned. It is essential that we should be a self-contained nation. Honorable members opposite are in agreement on this question. </para>

This policy is on the lines of our party platform. This New Protection is what we have been advocating for years. And this is what we asked of the Government during the war. It is pleasing, even at this late hour, to know that at last something is about to be done. I give the </para>

We must see to it that while they get a fair return on their  capital.  the workers engaged in the industry and the consumers are treated fairly. We want to be a self-contained nation. The war has taught us this lesson. I object to the honorable member for Dampier charging me with inconsistency, because if any party has been consistent in regard to profiteering it is the party to which I belong. Had we the power when we were in office we would  Save  made an alteration. The power was available during the war to the Government of which the honorable member for Dampier is a supporter ; and, had the honorable member and his party been consistent, action would have been taken against those who were then robbing the people. </para>

                        <para>.- It is only fair to the Government that I should point out to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> from whom we have just heard a very interesting speech, that he was in this House for a considerable time supporting a Government which passed the War Precautions Act and enjoyed all the powers bestowed by that measure. But what action did he and his party take under that Act along the lines that he is now telling us this Government ought to have followed? We have only to turn up the public records to ascertain that the only party which exercised the powers to which the honorable member has referred was the party now in office. But, after all is said and done, this has nothing whatever to do with the case. The woollen mills of Australia before the war were not able to earn more than a reasonable return on their capital. </para>

                        <para>.- The manufacture of wool is undoubtedly a natural secondary industry of Australia, and ought to be most successful, seeing that we grow 62 per cent, of the world&#39;s merino wool; but I think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> in view of his experience under the operations of the War Precautions Act, must realize that he is overdoing things when he seeks to impose a protective duty of 30 to 45 per cent. It is likely to bring great profits to those who actually manufacture the wool, and those who invest their money in woollen mills. The extra impost will be absorbed by higher profits and the payment of higher wages for shorter hours of labour. In view of the experience gained by the Government during the war, they must know what profit it is possible to make in this industry. They took over twenty-two mills with a capital value of &#163;1,144,000, and in two years and four months made a profit of &#163;1,177,000 on the output of those establishments. That is to say, they could have paid off the whole of the capital cost of the mills and still made a substantial profit. I do not think that the making of inordinate profits is calculated to develop the woollen industry. When such&#39; profits are made, the people of Australia cannot be getting the advantage they should derive. I am not opposed to giving reasonable protection to any industry where it can be shown that it is necessary, but in the face of the figures I have quoted the protection asked for on this item is totally unnecessary. In any case, the -Australian woollen manufacturer has ample natural protection. He has at his command the raw material, and  it  is the best  in  the world; he has every facility for turning  it  into cloth - the coal, an ample water supply, and an excellent climate - and he has also the protection of freightage. With  all  these advantages, the Australian manufacturers ought to be in a position to manufacture every bale of wool that Australia produces, and spurn all opposition. No claim can be advanced upon this item for the imposition of high duties  On  the ground that it is necessary to fence off the competition of black labour, yet we are asked to impose a 30 per cent, duty against the white labour of Great Britain, where wages have risen, and where the cost of coal and other materials has mounted to a high figure. It seems to me quite unnecessary to have this increased protection for the local manufacturer. I would not mind if the duty were made 100 per cent, against outside nations, &#39;but as a matter of principle I am not anxious to see unnecessarily high duties imposed, which have a tendency to make Australians inefficient and lazy in the building up of their industries. </para>

                        <para>. - I am no friend of, nor do  I  hold a brief for, the &#34; boss &#34; manufacturer. He is usually a nasty man, who does not pay decent wages unless he is compelled to do so. Workers in woollen mills  aTe  among the worst paid in our community. It is true that great profits were made during the war, but we Would have been compelled to pay double the prices we did pay for our goods if it had not been for the existence of our own woollen  hallS.  The trouble in regard to the prices we paid during the war arose from the fact that our warehouses in Flinders-lane were not only sellers of goods manufactured locally, but also sellers of imported goods. The great mistake made by the local manufacturers was in allowing a yard of their output to be sold in Flinders-lane. During the war. a tailor who bought so many pounds worth of goods per month from a certain warehouse was not permitted to take more than a small percentage of Australian-made goods. The serge of the suit I am wearing was obtained by the warehouse from the woollen mills at lis. 6d. per yard, but when it came to be sold to the tailor the firm demanded 27s. 6d. per yard. Flinders-lane also endeavoured to pass off locally-manufactured goods for imported goods, and at high prices. Though I hold no brief for the manufacturer, I am greatly concerned as to the interests of the1 workers. For that reason I would like to see higher duties imposed. Once the importer realizes that he is about to be beaten for the local market, he will lower his prices and take less profits in order to overcome the competition of the local manufacturer. We must be prepared for that emergency. During the present year, thirty companies have been formed for the purpose of undertaking the manufacture of woollen goods, and I understand that a dozen more are in course of formation. This is no proof that the duty is sufficient. The companies are hopeful of getting further help from this Parliament. If the wool-growers had gone in for the manufacture of their own wool, there would not have been the great drop they have recently experienced in the price of their crossbred wools. Those wools could easily have been made up into goods and exported. But the pastoralists have never recognised the side on which their bread is buttered. Honorable members ask what steps can be taken to prevent the manufacturers from raising their prices. I hope that the promise of the Minister (Mt. Greene) to introduce legislation to prevent these men from robbing the consumers will be carried into effect; in any case, if the local manufacturers do attempt to rob us by putting up their prices, the importing friends of some honorable members will be more likely to rob us in the same way. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; since the duties were increased in 1908, the quality of the woollen goods produced in Australia has improved enormously, and there is no valid reason why it should not approximate that of the west of England cloth, which, I repeat, is the best turned out in any part of the world. If I had the power, I would make everybody wear Australian-manufactured goods. With this end in view, I would absolutely prohibit the importation of tweeds from the west of England. </para>

                            <para>- If there were no combines in Australia the different woollen mills would certainly maintain the quality of their goods. Take a list of the manufacturers in the Commonwealth to-day. They are all deeply concerned in each other&#39;s welfare, but legislation could prevent them from arriving at any so-called &#34; honorable understanding.&#34; That would be the common-sense way of checking this evil. What is the position in which we find ourselves? Australia is the greatest wool producer in the world, and yet there is wool selling here to-day at 2d. per lb. Why should we not encourage the conversion of that wool into the cheaper forms of cloth?&#39; During the war the duty imposed upon woollen goods was utterly useless, because we could not have obtained those goods from overseas at any price. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; tailors were buying goods from the warehouses in Melbourne from 42s. to 25s. per yard, whilst others were indenting woollen goods at those prices. Yet in the years gone by I have made up thousands of yards of the same material at 8s. and 9s. per yard. To-day, however, everybody is endeavouring to restore the pre-war conditions. We all recognise that wages must come down in England and America, because manufacturers there desire to produce cheaper commodities for the purpose of supplying the oversea markets. We must take steps to prevent this dumping in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- There is only one way in which we can get better wages and better industrial conditions for the employees of our woollen manufacturers, namely, by Protection through the Customs House. We all know that at the end of the season countries which produce certain commodities export their surplus to foreign markets. A case of the kind was quoted in this chamber to-day. At the present time the users of fat in Australia are paying &#163;8 per ton more for that article than is being paid for it in England. We now have an opportunity to set our house in order. The Tariff is before us, and until that great bone of contention, William Morris Hughes, returns to upset us again, we have time to consider it from a scientific stand-point. It is up to us to see that this great wool-producing country shall also become a manufacturer of woollen-piece goods. I appeal to the Minister, in spite of the uproar that has been caused by this item, to increase the duty which has been proposed upon it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. ff I could compel our manufacturers to keep their prices down to a reasonable level I would impose a duty of 100 per cent, upon it. There is no reason why we should not compel our manufacturers to sell their products at a fair price. Could we not create a Department which would take into consideration the cost of labour and the cost of manufacturing operations; and which would assess the profits that ought to be made upon the capital invested ? </para>

                            <para>- That is a conservative view which ought long since to have been forgotten. Some years ago the manufacturers of Melbourne Ports held a conference which I attended, at which they considered the freight which the coastal shipping companies should charge them, and also the price which should be paid for coal used in their industrial establishments. I was told that these prices were too high. My reply was, &#34; Very well. We want to stop that. The Labour party desires that the Commonwealth shall have power to compel the companies to charge only a fair price for their coal. Will you vote for us ?&#34; Their answer was, &#34; Oh no, Mathews. The worst of your crowd is that they go too far.&#34; These people feared that if we regulated the prices charged by the shipping companies we should also regulate the prices which they themselves charged. In spite of the capitalistic talk to the effect that labour is ruining Australia, quite a number of persons are anxious to embark upon this particular industry. I have no use for our present economic system, but I recognise that the people who sent me here have to live whilst we are effecting a change in it. I wish to give them an opportunity to live during the transition period, and the only way in which I can do that is by granting Protection to our manufacturers. I ask the Minister if he cannot see his way clear to increase the duty upon this item? </para>

                        <para>He said he was aware of his responsibility and the nature of an oath when he made this statement. He had previously challenged the Committee to call a writing expert who would verify the signature as Caldwell&#39;s signature. </para>
                        <para class="block">Your inference, therefore, is irresistible, namely, that he produced a forged document. You, however, omitted the word &#34; therefore.&#34; If you had said, &#34; Since Colonel Walker relied for his perjured statement on the document he produced, it must have been such a perfect signature of Caldwell&#39;s as to deceive a writing expert.&#34; You would have stated a conclusion had you used the word &#34; therefore.&#34; Colonel Walker evidently believed that he could commit perjury witheut being found out, as he impudently challenged the Committee to produce a writing expert, because he believed the signature was such a good imitation of Caldwell&#39;s that he would be borne out. If a signature will deceive a writing expert it must be a remarkably good forgery of the original signature. Of course, you could not prove that it was forged by Walker or anybody else, but Walker gambled on the perfection of the forgery. You obviously knew nothing about it. Most men would agree with you had you stated this as a conclusion, but you stated it as a fact, and did not preface it with the word &#34;therefore.&#34; You would not he able to prove as a fact in a Court of law that this signature of Caldwell&#39;s was in fact a forsrerv. and, therefore, that it would be a forged document. This, however, does not dispose with the real question. Colonel Walker has the unparalleled audacity to try and make you responsible on a completely false issue. He is like a cuttlefish which flings out inky fluid to prevent being followed. These cuttlefish tactics of Walker are obviously designed to save him from further prosecution for perjury. Now he turns round and says, &#34;Although I committed <inline font-style="italic">perjury</inline> deliberately and in order to prove I was telling the truth, demanded a writing expert to prove it was a real signature, I now turn round and say since I committed perjury when I said it was written by Caldwell it is no longer a forged signature, and I no longer want a writing expert, and, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maloney</inline> would have independently to prove that it was a forged signature, but he cannot do this, as he is unaware of any of the circumstances. </para>
                        <para>Here, an impudent offender against the criminal law instead of being repentant and humble, actually dares to threaten a member of Parliament, who honorably does his duty, which this unrepentant sinner by threatening hopes to deter him from doing. The crime is defined in the Act of Parliament which constitutes the Joint Accounts Committee, and the punishment for this crime of perjury is five years&#39; imprisonment. Their duty was clearly to uphold the law of the Commonwealth. Of course, it is ridiculous to assume that a man who deliberately sets out to commit perjury does not commit it, because he is found out and forced to recant. You cannot be deterred from doing your duty by any threat or impudent challenge to surrender your parliamentary privilege. The parliamentary privilege is the highest privilege a member of Parliament has, and that is a very good illustration of its value to the community. Here the facts are absolutely true as  a  whole, and you have acted as an honorable man in making your statement for the benefit of Parliament and for the protection of public morality, which ought to include that no man who commits perjury, no matter how highly placed, should escape justice. The question is, what does the honour of Parliament demand if the Joint Accounts Committee have failed to observe those principles of honour which should actuate all members of Parliament for the enforcement of the law. </para>

                    Madden, when challenged on one occasion to repeat outside statements that he had made in Parliament, refused to do so, and I shall follow his example in this case, but if a statement is wanted as to perjury, I am ready to make it. I do not know

                    I have found a decent fellow. I take it that in this case he speaks as a lawyer representing a client, and wishes to make a point, because I did not use the word &#34; therefore.&#34; I am fighting for an Australian native who has been deeply wronged. Had not  Colonel Walker&#39;s  statement, made in the course of evidence on oath, been challenged by the cross-examination of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline>
                    D. Millen, so that  Colonel Walker  was forced to own that what he had sworn to was not true, much injury would have been done to this man. Thirty years ago, in this chamber, I tried to secure the punishment of a millionaire who had committed perjury, as later I tried to secure redress for the Reverend J. B. Ronald, who was injured by nine witnesses who gave perjured evidence against him. Apparently, however, under our laws, if a man has money enough, he may escape punishment for an offence for which, if poor, he would be put into gaol.

Let these statements be uttered outside, so that Colonel Walker may take action in respect to them, and clear his character definitely, or, if &#39;he cannot do so, accept the consequences. This is not an unreasonable thing to ask. No man should make statements in this House which may damage a citizen for the rest of his life, and not give that citizen an opportunity to make an adequate reply. </para>
