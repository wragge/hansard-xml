            <para>- In regard to aggrieved persons in the Northern Territory, I ask the Treasurer whether it is not a fact that residents there are now assessed for income tax by Ordinance on the same basis as that which was operating in South Australia before the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, and that they are, therefore, paying a very much Tower rate than applies to the general taxpayers of the Commonwealth? </para>

These men are in gaol, not for refusing to pay the taxes which are paid by every other Federal&#39; taxpayer in Australia, but for refusal to pay&#39; a local tax - a territorial income tax, which would correspond, I presume, with the State income tax. </para>

              <para>- That is a matter of no concern. The point is that the tax has been in operation practically-ever  since the Territory has been known as such. It came over with the transfer of the Territory from South Australia. We incorporated the State . Statute, and adopted it. The tax was paid for many years by residents of the Northern Territory when the Territory was under South Australian control, and for many years later it was collected without the slightest trouble. Suddenly some <inline font-style="italic">real-.</inline> dents of the Territory took it into their heads that they would stop paying taxes. That, I think, was in 1918, and since then they have declined to pay any taxation. As the Territory has to be developed so that they may live in it, and since it has also to be governed at very great expense in their interests, they must pay these taxes voluntarily, or be compelled to pay them. </para>

            <para>- Is the Treasurer aware that, on 5th September, 1911, a return was presented to Parliament, giving in minute detail particulars in regard to those honorable members who had received the increased allowance agreed to some time previously, and also the names of those who had refused it, and had allowed the increase to revert to the Consolidated Revenue? Since this is so, the right honorable gentleman was incorrect in stating yesterday that, to give such a return in relation to the Parliamentary Allowances Act, would be to create a precedent; and I, therefore, ask whether he will now have placed on the table a return giving in detail the names of honorable members, and the amounts they have drawn from the date of the passing of the Parliamentary Allowances Act to the end of the present financial year. </para>

            <para>- I am obliged to the honorable member for calling my attention to this precedent. I asked my  officers if such a return had previously been presented, and was told that such a thing had not been done. It appears that they were wrong. I accept the honorable member&#39;s statement that the details to which he refers were furnished in 1911; but I do not know what good would result from the publication of such a list just now. The honorable member ought to be quite all right. I see that he is on the &#34; honour roll &#34; in this respect. I will, however, consider the matter. </para>

              <para>- I can only say that, of the number mentioned, twenty appointments have Been made, and that only six of those appointed have been taken into our own Public Service, and will appear on our own Estimates. Of the six, three need to be explained. Three of them are appointments under the Navigation Act. I believe that, in connexion with the administration of that Act, we are making as few new appointments as possible, but are using the lighthouse officers on the coast for the purposes of the Act. In that way, therefore, we cut out three of the six. They are not new appointments, except in the sense that the officers concerned are taking on other duties in addition to those previously performed by them. Of the remaining three, two of them are appointments to the new Flying Corps, and one to the control of the Aerodrome. The balance of the twenty relate to the mandated Territories. They will not appear on our Estimates, and will not be paid by the taxpayers of Australia. </para>

He has not described the position accurately. &#39; He speaks of the &#34; monthly attacks &#34; of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> upon the Canberra question. He would have been more correct if he had spoken of the daily attacks. I am afraid the Government j.ust now, ave not satisfying the people at all by the way in which they are proceeding. They are certainly unable to satisfy the enthusiasts from New South Wales. They are equally unable to satisfy the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the people in Victoria, who think that we are rushing pell-mell to financial destruction, because of the money which they, inaccurately, describe as being squandered at Canberra.

Is the honorable gentleman aware that by this change considerable hardship has been imposed on invalid and old-age pensioners under the Commonwealth Act, their pensions being now stopped because that Act has not been amended so as to exclude beneficiaries under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, as in the case of the Miners&#39; Accident Relief Fund ? In the light of these facts, will the Treasurer afford an early opportunity to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act so as to obviate this hardship ? </para>

The facts which I. shall now quote are taken from our own records, through. the High Commissioner&#39;s Office; and. the. letter in which the particulars are contained is dated from the office of the High Commissioner, 19th March, 1915.

          <para class="block">It is clear that England had to adopt methods of smuggling to obtain latch needles in order to get the industry going. These facts&#39; fully establish that point. Now I wish-to- turn to. the question concerning whether the supplies were sufficient or not. The honorable member for Dampier has furnished me with a statement issued from the War Office. I draw particular attention to the point that, though the facts were perfectly well known, those who drafted this report say therein&#34; that it is probable that the trade was largely dependent on Germany for the supply of hosiery needles before  the war. I will say that, not only was it probable, but that England, in fact, had been absolutely dependent on Germany, and was equally dependent after war broke out. That is a truth which ought to have been well known. I have added up the figures contained in the honorable member&#39;s statement concerning the total issue of cardigan jackets to the end of November of the year in question, and I find that the articles numbered 240,120. My remarks applied to other things beside cardigan jackets, as I have more than once this afternoon stressed. I have had some difficulty in ascertaining the number of British troops in France and elsewhere at that time, but Volume X. of the <inline font-style="italic">New Age Encyclopaedia</inline> says at page 313- </para>

            <para>Great Britain, alone of European nations, began the war with a voluntary army. Her Expeditionary -Force consisted of 150,000 very highly trained and equipped men, of which about 70,000 (i.e.) four divisions and a cavalry corps) were transported across the Channel with marvellous secrecy and despatch between 7th and 16th August. This force was quickly reduced to somewhere about 00,000, but by 1st October had been augmented to 150,000, and by the end of November to double this number. </para>

In this return nothing is said about the enormous number of men in camp to whom, equally with the other soldiers, my remarks applied. So I can say nothing about the number of jackets issued to them.

          <para>A great deal of the discussion upon this item last night consisted of the argument that, because we have not imported a large number of spokes recently, we need have no fear for the future. The following figures will emphasize the need, for increased protection of this industry: During the twelve months ended 30th June, 1919, we imported 227,925 spokes of a value of &#163;3,374; during the year ended 30th June, 1920, we imported &#163;6,932 worth; and during the eleven months ended 31st May, 1921, &#163;28,446 worth. Those figures show a startling increase, and I believe that within the next twelve months the increase will be even greater. I ask honorable members to recollect that during one eleven months we imported &#163;28,000 worth of a manufactured article that could be made in Australia. </para>

              <para>- Those which have been quoted by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> support the statements that were made last night. I had been told that the imports were increasing very rapidly, and that was why I was so anxious last night to do something to secure this industry. If the value of imports increased in one year from &#163;6,000 to &#163;28,000, it is clear that the trade is going out of Australia. </para>

              <para>- No; the importation of hickory is provided for in another item. The only question at issue now is whether our people are to be given the opportunity of working it up in Australia, or whether that work is to be done by people on the other side of the world. The Minister would be well advised to increase the general duty by 5 per cent. </para>

            <para>.- Sub-item a of item. 303 enumerates many articles made of wood, but I should like the -Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to introduce a new sub-item relating to clothes-pegs. We have made the boast throughout the Tariff debate that we are prepared to do everything within reason to establish local industries. There has been established in this city since the war an industry which has been capitalized, and is being conducted, principally, by returned soldiers. I refer to the manufacture of clothes-pegs. The industry is in its infancy, and I understand that the factory to which I refer is the only one of its kind in Australia. Prior to the war, all clothes-pegs used in this country were imported from America, and the Americans had been charging what they liked for them. A number of our soldiers returning from the war, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> America, saw the possibility of establishing the industry in Australia, and particularly for the reason that some of our Australian timbers lend themselves specially to the manufacture of clothes-pegs. They decided, therefore, to enter upon their manufacture in this city. They had no sooner done so than they met with opposition from manufacturers overseas, and unless they are granted some greater protection than is afforded them under the item as it stands, their industry is likely to be wiped out. I ask the Minister, therefore, to consider favorably the insertion of a new sub-item giving the industry the protection that it needs. </para>

            <para>.- Will the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> consider in connexion with this item the desirableness of applying a uniform rate of duty to a number of articles covered by it, as well as by items 305 (a) and 305 <inline font-style="italic">(e)</inline> such as metal bedsteads and cots, manufacture of metals n.e.i., manufacture of wicker and cane n.e.i., manufacture of wood, n.e.i., furniture, n.e.i., and chair seats of any material. Importers would be saved a great deal of trouble if uniform duties of 30 per cent. under the British Tariff, 40 per cent. under the intermediate Tariff, and, say, 50 per cent. under the general Tariff were imposed. If that were done, we would also give a slightly greater preference to British imports. </para>

          <para class="block">A  specialist, commenting upon this suggestion, writes as follows: - </para>
          <para>The inclusion of fancy goods, n.e.i, would simplify classification, while the deletion of the word &#34; sovereign &#34; would include all purses not mentioned in item 300 under this sub-item to which they belong as much as do the other articles enumerated. The deletion of the letters &#34; n.e.i.&#34; after &#34;purses&#34; and the insertion in lieu thereof of the words &#34;except partly or wholly of gold or silver &#34; would make reading clearer in conjunction with sub-item  (a).  Wallets also should appear here, seeing that card cases are included. Purses and wallets are now included in item 376 (a), which is a confused mass of unmeaning verbiage as regards these lines. The effect would be to lower the duty under the British Preferential Tariff by 10 per cent. on same. </para>
          <para class="block">In regard to sub-item c the same specialist comments as follows&#39;: - </para>
          <para>The wording of this item still leaves the classification of the articles enumerated very vague. Take, for instance, a collar stud - a rolled gold, or gilt, or yellow metal stud, or a stud of metal with on imitation pearl or precious stone, that is a piece of glass, inserted, would be dutiable under item 314 at 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent., while gold or silver collar studs would actually be dutiable at a lower rate than the imitations. If the words &#34; or imitations thereof &#34; were deleted all these articles, other than those of gold or silver, or containing pearls or precious stones, would be classifiable thereunder. It is, therefore, suggested that this alteration be made accordingly. </para>
          <para class="block">I  am  given to understand that a cheap collar stud is classified at higher rates of duty than one made of gold or silver or any other precious metal. I would like the Minister to make a note of these points for consideration later on. </para>

            <para>. - In practice the amount paid in duty upon imitation jewellery works out at a. very much lower amount as compared with the duty payable on the real article. I admit that the rates are high, but they are luxury duties. The rate paid on imitation jewellery, which is of intrinsically low value, although it is a high <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, works out in practice very much less than does a lower <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, in itself high, upon the more valuable articles of gold or silver. </para>

It has been truly said that the country can live without the cities, but that the cities cannot live without the country, and the Government have been blamed by the press for its centralizing policy; but on an item of this kind, which does not advance the national development one bit, the Minister is prepared to reduce the duties  by  over 100 per cent. I fear for the future of Australia when we see such unsympathetic consideration extended to those who do not deserve it. </para>

It is that difference which explains why in one case, in a matter which is comparatively insignificant, I am prepared to accept a suggestion of the kind referred to, while, in another case, I do not do so because there are involved protective duties for the establishment of industries here. I presume the people in the country, in common with the people of the cities, will get whatever advantage accrues from this proposed reduction in the duty. </para>

I am glad to see that the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> now seems inclined to do what is the fair thing in regard to the Tariff, but I should like to know whether this proposed reduction of duty will result in the purchaser and the user of watches obtaining any benefit.

            <para>. - I now desire to move an amendment, the effect of which will be to take films for home kinematographs from their present position in paragraph 2 of sub-item c, and place them where they will be subject to a lower rate. These home kinematographs are very largely used in schools, and films which are educational are not dutiable. The  ouly  films which are dutiable are those which are of  Australian  subjects; for example, depictive of an Australian industry. Those would be dutiable, even though they were educational. If a film is of an Australian subject it is regarded as one which ought to have  been  photographed  in  Australia by Australians, and made here also by Australians. Films which are dutiable comprise dramatic films and, I repeat,  films  of Australian subjects. But it has been represented to me by those who are interested in using the home kinematograph  that  among a series of pictures shown to children for educational purposes there are generally a few devoted to amusement.. We propose to&#39; permit them to be brought in at  a  lower rate of duty. There is a further amendment which I shall propose also to section 2 of sub-item c. The effect of this will be that the British preferential rate will apply only to films which have been taken in Great Britain ; that is to say,  the  picture itself must have been made in  Great  Britain. My Department has experienced considerable trouble with firms claiming the British preferential rate on films actually produced and made in America, but duplicates of which have been printed in Great Britain. We do not desire to grant British preference  in  such circumstances. I ask the Committee to consent to a proviso which will have the effect of giving the preferential rates on  films,  the originals of which have been actually made in Great Britain. I move - </para>

              <para>- I am astonished at the attitude of the Minister. Practically the whole of the production of pictures, so far as the Australian public is concerned, is carried on in the United States of America. There are numbers of famous picture stars, among whom I may mention, as an example, Charlie Chaplin. Against his ability I say nothing, but I do complain that this artist is drawing large sums of money out of this country, and is not paying one penny of taxation to the Commonwealth. When theatrical artists come to Australia - and some of the finest in the world do come here - they are immediately pounced upon by the. Treasury, and compelled to pay income tax upon their earnings in the Commonwealth.The &#34;movie&#34; stars in America, according to the statements of leading men in the picture-show business, practically dictate the terms upon which their pictures are to be exhibited in Australia. If only for the purpose of making men who are earning large incomes out of the Australian people pay their share towards the revenue of the country, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> should agree to make the duty <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> The fixed duty he has proposed is utterly ridiculous. </para>

              <para>-No doubt, there are some pictures which should be excluded; but there are others which are of great benefit to the community. It has been stated that the importers of films estimate their value at about 4d. or 5d. per foot. It is upon that estimate that this duty is based, and an examination shows how hypocritical such a valuation is. Some pictures have an enormous value on account of their capacity to attract the public and earn large sums of money. The value per foot of the film is no indication of the value of the picture. The fairest way would be to impose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. Pictures in which the star is Charlie Chaplin are worth many thousands of pounds. It is ridiculous to  value a picture in which he or Mary Pickford figures at only 5d. per lineal foot. When those who control the picture industry in Australia complain of the enormous percentage of duty we are imposing in collecting1&#189;d. per foot on films that they value at 4d. or 5d. per foot, they are throwing dust in the eyes of the Government. I cannot see why the Minister should object to adding to this sub-item a certain duty <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> and collect either that or the fixed duty, whichever is the higher. </para>

              <para>- Not at all. The value of a picture depends entirely upon its capacity to. attract the people, and those which . have a big drawing power should not be allowed in at the same ridioulous&#39; rate of duty as is a picture for which an intelligent person would not pay 2&#189;d. It has been said that anybody daring to suggest that picture films should bear an increased duty would be endeavouring to put an additional burden on the workers and their children. I consider that the amusement &#39;tax on all charges of admission up to ls. should be remitted immediately. Any revenue lost in that way could be recovered by an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on films. </para>

              <para>- Does the Minister consider that l&#189;d, per foot is a fair duty ? Has he made inquiries as to the actual value of pictures of Mary Pickford. Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and Fatty Arbuckle, and what showmen in Australia are called upon to pay for them ? I am not prepared to allow picture artists thousands of miles away to draw a huge revenue from the people of this country, and not pay one penny in taxation. We should consider also the building up of the moving picture business in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> W.

            <para>. - I have gone carefully into &#34;the question as to whether it is possible to impose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on these films. The possibility of getting extra revenue out of the picture show business occurred to my mind, and I shall explain to the Committee why I did not proceed with it. In the first place none of these films, so far as I can learn, are purchased outright. There are some for which certain definite. &#39;sums are paid, but other arrangements are entered into which make it almost impossible to arrive at the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty which should be paid on any of the films. There are three , distinct ways in which payment for films is made by the picture, show proprietors in Australia. Firstly, the film is invoiced at practically the cost of production of the film itself, not the picture, and exclusive of the salaries of artists, cost of staging, &#38;c. In addition to this, however, certain royalties are charged in the form of a lump sum, which&#34; usually equals from three cents to four&#39; cents per foot. In the second method the. film is invoiced at cost, and in addition to this a. percentage of the gross takings for the use of the film in .  Australia is remitted to America. The amount so remitted depends upon the success of the film as an attraction in the Commonwealth. This is the usual method when the purchaser in Australia is a branch house of an American company, the percentage remitted to America being usually . about 65 per cent. The third method is that, in the case of some companies, the parent houses of which are in America, the film is invoiced . at cost, and all profits are remitted to the parent house. It is. practically impossible to arrive at the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of films when the business, is handled in those ways. </para>

If in respect of other commodities the importers made the assessment of duty difficult, we would not be justified in wiping out the duty. I suggest to the Minister that every film imported into Australia should be submitted to public auction at the Customs House. In this way the value of a star picture would be ascertained immediately. </para>

              <para>- If at auction the films realized a greater price than had been placed on them by the importers, there should be no cause for complaint. The Minister&#39;s statement regarding the difficulties of collecting <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties strikes to the root of all Customs taxation. If the importers can make the valuations difficult they escape with the payment of small &#34;duties. The picture show proprietors and all amusement vendor&#39;s have been mulct very unfairly by the amusement tax. Picture-show promoters have followed the lead of all profiteers, and have raised their prices very considerably. So far as I know, there is only one man in Australia who deserves praise in regard to the charges for admission to his theatres. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Benjamin</inline> Puller, who allowed the children of Melbourne and Sydney to see a pantomime for 6d. No other theatrical <inline font-style="italic">entrepreneur</inline> has displayed such thoughtfulness for the little ones of the community, and I thank him for it. Pictureshow proprietors and others have in many cases doubled their charges of admission. Would it not be possible for the Minister so to word this item as to leave it to the Tariff Board to call expert evidence in addition to that of his own officers, in order to determine what should be the basis of value. Every boy in the street knows that there is a difference between the value of a Charlie Chaplin film and a scenic film. </para>

              <para>- I know that the Minister is with us in the desire to make these large Combines pay a little more. Every picture-show proprietor in Australia is bound by agreement to show American pictures. Many of the American pictures are both instructive and refreshing; hut the point I wish to make is that picture-show proprietors are compelled, under an agreement extending, I believe, either to the end of this year or to the middle of next year, to screen a certain number of American pictures. That is an advantage which the film producers in the United States gained during the war, and they seek to retain it. </para>

              <para>- I am sorry that Australia has followed so bad an. example We have an opportunity to gain ten times as much as great artists would pay the Treasury in respect of income tax during their stay here. I recognise that there is some difficulty in carrying out what we propose; but I am satisfied that any obstacle put in the way of the Customs Department by rich companies, Combines, or artists, could ultimately be overcome. If a Government official, on the arrival of films from overseas, were to announce his intention of submitting them to public auction, every pictureshow proprietor would be represented at the sale, and we would be able quickly to arrive at the value for Customs purposes. </para>

              <para>- I know that. The Minister said there were three difficulties in the way, and in listening to him I was reminded of the device to which a Japanese firm resorted at a time when the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> was the Victorian Minister for Trade and Customs. The firm sent out with its goods three invoices, one to submit to the Customs House authorities, one to show the importers&#39; customers, and a third setting out the actual cost to the importer. The honorable gentleman came down very heavily on that firm, but its device was certainly most amusing. We are told that films are invoiced at the actual cost of producing them, exclusive of the fees paid to artists, the cost of stage fittings, and so on. If that be so, we might get at the value by allowing, say, 2d. a foot for the -celluloid, plus so much a foot for printing. If the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> intends to move an amendment, I shall vote for it. </para>

            <para>. - I am extremely disappointed that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> in the preparation of this schedule, has accepted the system of levying Customs duties on films which the film manufacturers and importers have foisted on the country. It is obviously not only inadequate, but paltry. A duty of1&#189;d. per foot imposed in respect of a big film might yield a revenue of something like &#163;20, whereas that film, before it had been finished with in Australia, would probably be worth &#163;2 or &#163;3 per foot to the importer. One frequently hears of a film worth from &#163;2,000 to &#163;5,000, and for the right to screen it for one evening only a picture show proprietor may pay &#163;5 or more. </para>

              <para>- I am not prepared to accept without a fight the system of taxation which the American film producers have foisted on the Department. We know the value both of films and of artists coming to this country. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Lauder, for instance, comes to Australia-, we know months before he reaches here what his value from the point of view of the Income Tax Department is.  His  value is determined by the people who bring him here, and as soon as he arrives the Taxation Department assesses him accordingly, and he pays income tax. If it is possible to assess the value of an artist for income tax purposes, surely it is possible to assess the value of a film, a musical instrument, or any other means of amusement brought here. It seems to me to be a sinister fact that the manufacturers abroad send out films accompanied by absolutely false descriptions as to their cost. </para>

              <para>- The trouble is that practically in every case they refuse to sell a film straight out at its exhibition value as a film. They sell it for what it costs as a film, and on top of that they charge certain allowances, royalties, profits, or whatever it may be. That is the way in which they work. </para>

              <para>- The value of a film is determined in the way the Minister has indicated. It is known to the exporter in America, and to the importer here, long before a film arrives in this country. We ought to be able to ascertain the value at which the negatives of films are insured in America. However, , it should not be impossible for us to impose a heavy rate of duty at so much per lineal foot, although it would mean charging the same rate for high-grade and low-grade films. </para>

              <para>- Seventy-five per cent. of the pictures imported into Australia are rubbish; they merely depict bedroom scenes, or custard throwing, or deal with sex problems; but the balance are educational or high-class matter. The trouble, is that, if a duty of l&#189;d. per foot is charged on high-grade films, people will ask why the same rate should be imposed on low-grade films. I object to the introduction of these low-grade films. I have no objection to the importation of high-grade films of educational value or depicting high-class subjects, so long as the producers in America are not evading our taxation. Pictures have been produced in Australia under great difficulties. The &#34; Sentimental Bloke &#34; film has been distributed throughout Europe and America at fairly high rates. The Snowy Baker cowboy pictures have not the value of the &#34; Sentimental Bloke &#34; picture, but they have been produced in Australia mostly by Australian artists and under Australian conditions; that is to say, Australian wage3 have been paid, sometimes under arbitration awards. Snowy Baker went to America and copied the tricks of the American cowboy, transplanted them to the Australian bush, and retaliated upon America by exhibiting his films there. I believe that we ought to be able to build up in Australia a fairly large film industry. Any pastoral, mining, or other company engaged in some activity in Australia, whose head office is in London, is obliged to pay taxation on the money earned by it in the Commonwealth,yet American firms, who may make &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000 out of a set of films distributed in Australia, are not taxed upon that amount. While we are endeavouring to protect an Australian industry, we ought also to take steps to insure that these people pay us an adequate share of the earnings derived in Australia. We are told that it. is impossible to do this by means of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. I believe that the American picture producers have instituted a system of distribution of their films which prevents the Commonwealth Customs Department from ascertaining what their business is, so that, whether the picture be educational or merely depicting custard throwing, the rate of duty . collectable by us cannot be other than a fixed rate at so much per lineal foot of film. . But it is a shame that the rate should not exceed l&#189;d. It ought to be; at least,1s.perfoot,whichwouldbringin arevenueoffrom&#163;250 to&#163;350 ona fairly good film,butwouldbebutasmall impost upon ahigh-classfilm,worth about &#163;2or &#163;3per foot. </para>

            <para>.- I hope that- the. Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(-Mr. Greene)</inline> will see his way to place, goat-skins, raw or pickled, on the dutiable list. These pickled goat-skins are partially prepared, and. they ought, to, afford a good deal of employment here for our own people. My suggestion, which- I hope will be accepted, rs that the duty be 10 per cent, in each of the columns. Such a duty would not, injure Great Britain, which, does not export goat-skins except those obtained in the course of trade. When the previous Tariff was under consideration goat-skins became a burning question, and I certainly think that a duty ought to be imposed. We are trying-&#39; to&#39; build up. in Australia a civilization which will give the&#39; average1 worker higher wages and better conditions than are to be found in any other country; and. to that end! we have the freest Constitution under the British flag, with an unexampled franchise. In the previous Tariff there was a duty on pickled goat-skins such as I now suggest, and I think it might well be re-imposed. </para>

            <para>. - Goat-skins pickled were removed from the dutiable list because, since the duty was imposed, there has been a large development of the glace kid industry. After careful investigation of&#39; the whole subject, I came to the conclusion that duty on pickled goat-skins would be detrimental to the development of the glace kid business, and, as the latter represented the more valuable side of this class of industry, it was. decided&#39; that, under all&#39; the circumstances, they should be free. </para>

            <para>:.- Can the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> give particulars concerning importations of raw hides from New Zealand? Representations ha,ve been made to me from persons interested in Queensland that the number of hides brought in from that source are rapidly increasing, and&#39; they are being,, and always have been, introduced free-. During the twelve months ending 30th June,, 1920, 12,637 calf skins were imported, compared with 57,893 during, the eleven months ending 3,1st. May,. 1921. The importations of hides, during the year ending 30th June,. 1920, totalled 37,056, while., for the following eleven months, the importations were 96,796. These figures reveal a total increase for the Tatter period&#39;,, in respect of hides and. call skins combined, of 104,996 . Can the Minister account for that considerable increase? I consider the Queensland hide industry is likely to be seriously affected by the apparent probability of. dumping from New Zealand. I understand that for some time prior to those years to whichIhave just referred, an embargo was placed on the. importation of New Zealand hides. </para>

In 1918-19 there was again an increase, the number of hides imported being 116,000, and in 1919-20 the total was 106,000. I do not think the Departmental statistics differentiate concerning hides as between calf skins and bullock and cow skins. </para>

If such a duty were imposed we would be doing greater injury to the tanning industry than could be balanced by the amount of good conferred upon either employers or employees here.

              <para>- I support the view of the honorable member for Bourke that the rate of duty upon goat-skins, under the 1914 Tariff, should be reverted to. The Minister has stated that to impose a duty would interfere with the manufacture of glace kid in Australia. If honorable members accept that view, will the Minister be sympathetic when dealing with patent and enamelled leather? </para>

              <para>-The honorable member overlooks that the manufacture of this leather is a new Australian industry, and, as such, should be safeguarded. Once it has become firmly established I would say, &#34; Let them all come.&#34; This is essentially an infant enterprise, and is in close association with the great pastoral industry. Numbers pf Australians have placed a great deal of capital in the manufacture of chamois leather. </para>

              <para>- In several States. In South Sydney, for example, there are several factories, and I know of one in Queensland which is doing its best to place a first-class article on the market. It is, indeed, an excellent chamois, as honorable members will perceive by the sample which I hold in my band. Although thousands of so-called chamois leathers are imported, the description is not accurate. &#34;Chamois&#34; is only a trade name. They are made almost entirely from sheepskins. The Australian manufacturers, however, are chiefly using lamb-skins; and I hope the industry will receive support by way of a substantial degree of protection. I suggest 20 per cent. </para>

              <para>- For some considerable time lamb-skins and sheepskins have been purchasable at from 04d. to Id.  per  &#62;., and if manufacturers who can get the sheepskins so cheaply cannot, without the aid of a duty, produce chamois leather in competition with foreigners who have to import the sheepskins, this country is in a bad way. This imitation chamois leather is a poor makeshift, and after it has been used in water for a while will become hard. In twelve months- enough of this kind of material could be turned out to meet the Australian requirements for the next twenty years. I have manufactured this stuff, and know something about it; it is poor, at the best. </para>

            <para>.- I suggest that, as this is a new industry, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> might impose a deferred duty on chamois leather. Whilst a number of firms are actually engaged in making chamois leather to-day, others are only now doing the preparatory work, and I know that, in a number of instances, the machinery is only being installed at the present time. The statement by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> that he was not successful in the manufacture of this article, is not proof that others will similarly fail. The sample before the Committee demonstrates that chamois leather can be made in Australia. </para>

If we give encouragement to the manufacture of chamois leather and similar industries: we shall not only assist them directly, but will give a meed of support to the primary industry which-produces the skins. </para>

          <para class="block">Honorable members are aware that there are different varieties of patent and enamelled leather, having different values-, and for that reason it would be preferable to impose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. Some of the raw material used in this; trade  is  taxed severely, the duty on. colours being as high as, 30 per cent. The importations, of patent and enamelled leather in l920 amounted, to 2,200,000 feet, and during the first nine months of 1920-21 to 2,400,000 feet, representing, on a conservative estimate, about 80,000 hides. If a sufficient duty,  were  imposed, those hides would be purchased in Australia, and. I think we  all  would prefer to export our hides in manufactured form rather than in the raw state. The duty in 1908-11&#39; was 2d., and in 1914, British, 2d.; general, 2&#189;d. Only about 50 per: cent.of the employees who were engaged, in the industry last year are at work to-day,.  Any,  honorable member who knows of the splendid material produced by, local manufactures must support an &#39; increase in this, duty.. I. would, prefer, that the duty should be <inline font-style="italic">advalorem,</inline> for, whilst I recognised the difficulty in  arriving  at  the.  values of picture films for duty purposes, no such, difficulty presents itself, in connexion with leather.

              <para>- That, is: so.. In the, circumstances, I. fail to understand  why  we should indulge in these exceptional importations. We produce thousands- of hides per annum;&#39; and, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has stated, we annually export something like 600,000- Seeing that we can manufacture all classes of leathers here, it seems to me an economic waste that we should send our hides thousands of miles overseas to be turned into the manufactured article and brought back again. In respect of the last year for which the records are available,  2,400,000  feet of patent and enamelled leather came into Australia. That was under the present Tariff. We know what is going on to-day in America and Great Britain, and owing to the inadequacy of the Tariff I fear that, unless we make a very considerable increase, there will be an enormous development in these importations. The industry is established, so far as efficiency is concerned,; but the present duties are not sufficient to protect it against the competition with which it will be confronted within the next twelve months. I would remind honorable members of the Country party that we axe dealing here with something that is produced from one of the raw materials of the farm. The making of these patent and enamelled leathers, in the first place, was a close secret. Some thirty years ago, I think, only one man in Victoria knew how to produce them. He, in turn,, handed over the secret to his son; but to-day quite a number of Australians are familiar with the process, and are engaged in this industry. The Victorian firm to which I have just referred, on the death of one of its experts, obtained from New South Wales an expert who knew the secret, and who ultimately became a member of the firm. An industry that is so important and necessary to Australia, and which uses up so much of one of the raw materials of the farm; ought to be encouraged. </para>

            <para>. - This sub-item, no doubt, relates to a growing industry.; but the honorable memberforMaribyrnong (Mr.Fenton) has rather overstated (the position in saying that the Victorian Railway Department is using locally-manufactured patent leathers for its best class of trimming work.That is not a fact, nor is it a fact that the production of this class of leather has . reached a high state of efficiency in Australia. The industry is certainly important, and should continue to develop ;but the honorable member for Maribyrnongknows very well that it is impossible within a few years to reach the degreeofperfectionthatob- tainswheretheindustryhasbeencarried onfor,perhaps; a hundred years. Australian conditions are favorable to the manufacture of these classes of leathers; we lack only experience. The industry is well worth encouraging, but it would be unreasonable to double the present duties. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Mr.GREENE(Richmond- Minister for Trade and Customs)&#91;6.0&#93;  .  -  I have been looking into this matter for sometime. It is extremely difficult to balance these duties because leathers become the raw material of other industries, and the duties relating to those industries must also be considered.Wehave made  a strenuous  effort to try to draw them together, but whether we have succeeded or notIcannotsay. The industry of producing patent or enamelled leather has made very considerable strides in Australia, and did so particularly during the war period.We have here , a number of manufacturers, and I have seen samples of their leathers which I think would stand almost any test. A patent leather that can be bent and pressed as hard  as  one pleases without cracking is  a  fairly good article. </para>

There can be no question, therefore, that the industry is growing and has reached the stage at which it can pretty well provide for the greater part of Australia&#39;s requirements. Before the war it could not do so. Up to that time we produced only about  10  per cent. of our requirements, whereas to-day., althoughno&#39;t producing the whole of our requirements, we are turning out a very much greater . proportion than  before. </para>

              <para>- But we are dealing now only with patent and enamelled leathers. The old duty of2&#189;d. per square foot was equal to only 10 per cent. on the prices then ruling.The duty now works out at about 17 per cent. on the values for 1918-19. In respect of some classes it is slightly more, and in regard to others slightly less. Honorable members are aware that there are some grades which are more expensive than others. After going into the matter carefully, I am inclined to think that the position would be met by making the fixed duty per square foot - British, 3d. ; intermediate, 4d.; and general, 5d. That, I think, will be sufficient protection on the lower grades of leather, and we should provide alternatively for <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent. That, I understand, will meet with the general acceptance of the trade, and I think it will meet the position. </para>

              <para>- There are many people in my electorate who cannot find work as a result of the conditions appertaining to this industry. I have a few facts to place before the Committee in regard to patent and enamelled leathers. In 1914-15 this industry employed 90 hands, who produced a little over 1,000,000 feet of patent and enamelled leathers, and earned in wages, roughly, &#163;15,000. In 1919-20 the industry employed 340 hands, who produced over 3,500,000 feet of these leathers, and earned in wages &#163;60,000. The figures show an increase of over 300 per cent. The fact that British journals ave complaining very bitterly that Germany is endeavouring to wipe out Great Britain&#39;s trade in these leathers, and that America is imposing a special duty on patent and enamelled leathers, should cause us to open our eyes as to what may happen here unless, the industry is accorded further protection. In reply to the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster),</inline> who has, said that the locally manufactured leathers are not being used extensively by the State Governments, let me point out that these leathers are used almost exclusively on the South Australian railways, and are used extensively by the Railway Departments of every State. The leather trimmings in Australia House are of Australian manufacture. If we can afford to advertise our own work in that magnificent structure at the seat of the Empire, we have no occasion to doubt our ability to turn out a first-class article here. I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to reconsider his proposal, and accede to the request of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> by making the fixed duties 6d., 7d., and8d. or <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> 30 per cent., 35 per cent., 40 per cent., which ever rate returns the higher duty. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has made an effort to meet the wishes of honorable members, but has not gone far enough. Possibly he might agree to increase the general rate to 7d. The increased output referred to by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> was followed by a severe slump. </para>

          <para>At the same time importations from America have increased. The men who were conducting our industry during the  war could have sold their products in foreign markets at 2s. 6d. per foot more than they were getting locally : but, as they did not take advantage of the opportunity to do so, they are now entitled to every consideration from us. Last year hides for motor leather were quoted in the American market at 25s. per lb. Their price is now 6d. per lb. Hides for boot uppers were quoted last year in the Chicago market at1s. 6d. per lb.; they are now 5d. per lb. Hides for patent and enamelled leather were quoted at 25d. per lb.; they are now 6d. per lb. As a matter of fact, the value of hides to-day is practically 40 per cent, lower than it was before the war. Possibly the Minister has gone as far as he can in regard to the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, and the fixed Britishand intermediate rates; but I ask him to increase the general rate to 7d. </para>

            <para>.- Why reduce the intermediate duty by 10 per cent. and the British duty by only 5 per&#39; cent. ? I could understand cutting down the British or the intermediate duty by 10 per cent., and the general duty by only 5 per cent. Why reverse the process? If you make the two first duties 25 per cent. and 30 per cent., why not make the general duty 40 per cent. ? </para>

              <para>-  I am: glad&#39; that this matter has been mentioned. I have no fear of the consequences- that, may attend any vote I give in. this Committee, but I certainly do object to being&#39; threatened almost- at the. door of. the chamber by any man, and especially by a stranger. This afternoon I voted for an increase in the duty on picture films,, and already I. have been threatened by one: man who is interested&#39;, with a systematic, propaganda in my electorate, and. the&#39; exhibition of my photograph on every picture-show screen in order to make known that I voted to increase the cost of films. I do not mind that, course of action, being taken&#39;.. The parties concerned may screen my photograph, if they, choose; but surely members of the- Committee should be protected, from interference) by anybody., Conditions are quite bad enough, without threats of that. kind. One. can hardly walk into, the. lobbies without being addressed, by people who have requests to make. I take strong exception to any person, newspaper reporters or others, attempting to- intimidate me- or threatening me with a certain course&#39; of action in&#39; my electorate, and. conduct of that kind/ should be stopped immediately. </para>

              <para>-  We have to be exceedingly careful that nothing in, the nature of intimidation shall take place, particularly in regard to such a question as that which is now before the Committee. If there has been anything of the kind in this case, then the method of dealing with it, which the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has suggested, is certainly the proper one to pursue, subject, of course, to inquiry and report. I do. not know what actually occurred, as I was not present when the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> made his statement; but during the dinner adjournment I heard a good deal of talk about the matter, and it seemed to me that a mountain was being made out of a molehill. I thought that honorable members were merely laughing at the suggestion which had been made. In the course of this discussion, however, a statement has been made which reflects upon newspaper men generally. We have a number of gentlemen of the press who attend here regularly, and the statement to which I refer might reflect upon them as well as upon the individual who is said to have uttered this threat. Such a reflection upon newspaper men generally would be most unfair. Although they may sometimes publish statements of which we do not approve, we all realize that as a rule they are exceedingly fair. If the matter went as far as has been stated, it is the duty of the honorable member concerned to make his report, and for the House to have it investigated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -Deputy Speaker,</inline> who, in turn, would report to the House. </para>

A large number of very poor quality rubber shoes come into Australia at such values that <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties do not afford sufficient protection against them, especially when they are imported from cheap labour countries. I do not propose to raise the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, which, I think, are ample in respect of the better class of rubber shoes, but I will move a fixed duty of so much per pair which will provide adequate protection against the poorer classes of canvas rubber shoes.

          <para class="block">This fixed rate will put a stop to the importation of a lot of rubbishy rubber shoes such as are coming into the market at the present time, and which are really of no value to the individuals who purchase them. At, the same time, it will provide the necessary protection for the Australian industry, which is capable of great developments. There are at present about 200 hands employed in this particular branch of the industrv. and I am informed that if it is developed, as I believe it can be. it will give employment to fully 600 hands. Importations latterly have been growing, and last year &#163;103,000 worth of. these shoes were imported. We can make them here, and I think we ought to do so. </para>

            <para>.- I have been furnished with a great deal of information in regard to rubber tyres. It appears to me that the rubber-making industry of Australia has progressed beyond all bounds. The manufacturers have made enormous profits, and I think we ought to be able to look forward to a big reduction in the duty. The Goodyear Company suggests a fixed . duty ranging up to 2s. 6d. per lb., instead of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. We must realize the great part that motor cars play in opening up our country, and how necessary they are to people in the outlying districts. We know that the motor bodies are made very well in Australia, but I think that we can ask for a big reduction of the duty on tyres. As a matter of fact, the local manufacturers are now exporting them. Is the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> prepared to omit the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates ? </para>

            <para>-I hope the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Greene)-</inline> will make- asubstantial&#39; reduction in the duties xm rubber tyres other than &#39; &#34;pneumatic. Manifestly such tyres are used for commercial purposes on country roads, and where railways are not available. When the motor . car was first- introduced there was an idea that it was entirely an aristocratic vehicle,-; but motor transport is really taking the place, of, the horse and dray. It is a mistaken policy to make it difficult to obtain these cars, seeing that the- producers&#39; here are in competition, with* the producers! of other countries, where: there are greater- facilities for transport. An attempt: is being- made to catch &#39;ua.&#39;wipb &#34; chaff when we are asked to  i  place; the lod&#39;estone- of heavy duties, on  gub  primary industries! I should! not mind! almost, prohibitive* duties; in the: case of countries with whichs we. have no desire to deal, but, . where: the handicap, is. fair, why should:- we be afraid of the- competition, of our owiu people, elsewhere ? There is: no. doubt- that, every, time we impose high duties we-  enable, the profiteer to increase <inline font-weight="bold">Ms profits,</inline> and thus  raise, the cost of living. In this regard the attitude of the,. Coriunitt.ee is to a large extent! inconsistent.

            <para>.- I I invite the&#34; Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Greene)</inline> to consider hofw&#39;the&#39; amendment just1 moved will square with - item- 35-2, under which we have- already imposed  duties&#39; of&#39; 20^ per cent, and 30 per; cent, on motor  cycle parts: Even&#39; if &#39;complete&#39; motor cycles- are not&#39;, being; made here, we. should, at least encourage the. assembling of tha parts. During the: last two* years more . particularly motor cycles of all makes have in? creased&#39; im price to a most- unreasonable extepib. If. - there, is- anything approaching profiteering in connexion, with any imported article,, it certainly exists in. respect of&#39; motor cycles. There appears to be an arrangement, between the various manufacturers&#39; bringing these machines into. a. country, because if the- price^of one particular&#39; make&#39; of&#39; motor cyclfe&#39; is* raised the companies&#39; producing other &#39;brands immediately raise their prices&#39;. If the duty of . &#163;12 per machine; were taken&#39; off tomorrow: I do- nob. think amy reduction would be made iw the. price. I &#39;trust that thei Minister- will see-that the Tariff- Board j when appointed, goes carefully/ into- the question: of the exorbitant; rates, charged for imported motor cycles, so. that, local users: may bei protested&#39;.. . . </para>

            <para>.- The Minister has acted wisely in deciding not to increase at the present time the duties already imposed under . sub-item a ; but I think that the duty he proposes under sub-item b on steel or iron wheels, or steel tyred wheels for railways, is excessive, and I hope he will agree to a reduction of the British and intermediate rates. I do not care how much he increases the duty under the general Tariff, but I object to such a heavy impost being placed against people of &#39;the same colour as ourselves. It seems absurd to do so, especially when every State is crying out for railways to enable its territory to be developed, and more effectively occupied and worked. To load ourselves up with such high duties, which the State Governments who own the railways will be compelled to pay, is simply a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. One might understand the imposition of a heavy rate on these, wheels and tyres &#39;if conditions existed in Australia which made it difficult for us to produce these articles, but there is no difficulty in making them here. In the exercise of the spirit displayed in this Committee, which has for its purpose the abolition of militarism, and all that kind of thing, and an endeavour to make us self-contained, we ought to protect ourselves by building adequate railways, to equip which we must have full supplies of steel-tyred wheels. There is no difficulty, I repeat, in making these here, particularly when we have our steel works situated at. the coal pit&#39;s mouth, and when we have the richest iron deposits in the world. The freight paid on bringing wheels from overseas ought to be sufficient protection to any local industry, and, apparently, the sole object of imposing heavy duties is to make wealthy men wealthier and place heavier burdens on the people. Every State railway system is bearing a burden of debt, and each year shows a, deficit, yet this Tariff proposes to make the capital cost of each system still higher. The main weight on each system is its capital cost, which, as we find it to-day, is only about half what it would be at the present cost of materials. We ought to halt before agreeing to these duties to see whether we are acting wisely in giving such enormous protection on these railway requirements. Certainly, let us give a reasonable margin of protection against the Mother Country, but the enormous duty of 35 per cent, will only serve to encourage laziness and slothfulness, and build up big fortunes, while incidentally crippling the country. We are . asked to undertake the work of making our railway gauges uniform at a cost of from &#163;50,000,000 to &#163;90,000,000, and yet we expect the various State Governments to pay a duty of from 45 per cent, to 50 per cent, on the material required to carry out that work. It is absurd. </para>

Every railway system in Australia would have been brought to a standstill during the recent war but for the fact that the Railway Departments happened to carry at the beginning of the war immense stocks of wheels and tyres; because supplies could not be got from overseas. And had it not been that one or two Australian firms had sufficient enterprise to come to our rescue, and commence the manufacture of these wheels and tyres, even with the big stocks on hand, we would have been in a very difficult position. </para>

              <para>- No; the process is not carried out by hydraulic pressure. The solid ingot is put under a steam hammer, and then flattened out to about one-third of the size of the wheel, and is then pierced. It is then taken from that machine, and gradually rolled out to the exact size required, and goes through various processes until completed. A very expensive plant is required, and the operations are most interesting to watch.  Hatfields  Limited, of England, have arranged with the Australian Electrical Steel Company to manufacture tyres, wheel  centres,  and other railway material. The capital invested in this whole industry will eventually be &#163;500,000, but that invested in the large plant, at Newcastle, for this particular branch of the business is about &#163;250,000. The plant is now, I believe, in operation, and the products, which are entirely of Australian  raw material, are giving as much satisfaction as those imported. </para>

            <para>.- During the war period the engineers associated with this industry, in my electorate, found themselves unable to get axles and wheels they had contracted for, and they formed a purely Australian company, composed of the various engineering firms in Sydney, and some in Melbourne, to establish the industry with a view to turning out complete axles, wheels, and tyres. The danger to such industries in their early stages is, that one or two big ship-loads of wheels or axle3 may come from America or elsewhere, and simply wipe them out of existence. In this one industry  there has already been spent &#163;240,000. The plant consists of a 10-ton electrical furnace for the purpose of producing lie finer classes of steel required. A complete machine shop has been erected for the manufacture of wheels ; and axles, the small skip wheels used in mining, and other field castings. The wages spent per week, at the present time, amount to&#163;1,750, while &#163;3,000 a week is spent on local purchases necessary to &#39;beep the -works going. It will be seen that the industry is now of some magnitude. For the first time in the history of Australia the complete work , is turned out here, and the test applied is . of the highest; it is that imposed by. the Engineers&#39; Board of Australia, and it is accepted by the railways as a thorough guarantee. </para>

            <para>. - I was surprised to hear the speech made &#39;by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> for if the honorable member were to examine the railway wheels in Australia that were procured before the war, he would find the great &#39;majority branded &#34; Krupps, Germany.&#34;It is to the discredit of. the Australian &#34;Governments that they bought &#39;Krupp&#39;s wheels because they were&#163;5 per pair cheaper than British &#39;wheels, a fact which I saw stated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> referring to a parliamentary  return.&#39; on line cost of wheels- on. the east-, west railway*.. The; profits made1 by the.  German: manufacturers of these: wheels, were used t&#169;&#62; make guns- -with, which, to; blow Britishers: to pieces. An honorable member, who would challenge . anybody who doubted&#39; his loyalty, proposes to-day, by his action in refusing a duty, to give, more money to- the. foreigner with which to&#39; provide&#39; guns for our destruction. In is- queer reasoning when a proposal is&#39; made to&#62; murder an- Australian industry which stood&#39; by this country in our time ofi trouble, showing;&#39; apparently, approval of the&#39; action of unpatriotic Governments&#39; before the war. I am sure, that no member&#39; of the Corner party would invest his money in an industry unless he were given adequate protection. The members of that party are all  the  time asking for Protection in. their own, interests, and yet, when men are prepared to invest &#163;300,000&#39; in&#39; an&#39; industry of &#39;.this kind, they refuse- any. &#39;diity.

T-he railway wheel tyres produced by Thompsons  are  of the finest. That-, firm has up-to^&#39;ate1 machinery, and I am delighted to find that these tyres are&#39; being made in Australia. I aro prepared! to go&#39; further than the honorable member for East Sydney or the honorable&#39; member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr..

              <para>- I feel compelled to speak in this way when the Committee is giving such heavy duties to industries, which, having the raw material, the coal for power, and everything else needed to enable them to compete upon reasonable terms, do not seem to need this extreme protection. We are asked to give consideration to men who can produce locally the rims of railway wheels, but at the same time some honorable members are prepared to heap the burden on the primary producer, who is . expected to lift the financial load off Australia, no matter how they handicap him in comparison with his competitors overseas. If we were to adopt a policy that would really help Australia, we would give the local manufacturers full command of the whole of the natural secondary&#39; industries, provided they could deliver the goods at a reasonable price. That is not being done. </para>

              <para>- I am not speaking only of them. The true interests of Australian industry have not been conserved by the past actions of this Committee. If we do not provide now a sliding scale in  connexion with these duties, I am afraid that we shall not find it very easy to reduce the duties when the industries are established. We should do that throughout, because the idea of Protection is to help an industry to become established. But we seem to have departed from that principle. If it is necessary for the time being to impose such a high duty, we should have an assurance from the Minister that there  will be a reduction on a sliding scale. Give industries protection until they are fully established, and then give them the whole of the. Australian trade upon the conditions I have already mentioned. </para>

I also stated at the time that the contract was subject to the British Government arranging with the Peninsular and Oriental Company for an alternating four-weekly service which would give us a regular fortnightly service between Australia and Great Britain . I am glad to say that to-day I received a letter from the Australian manager of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, in which he states - </para>

          <para>My managers cable that the Peninsular and Oriental Company has informed them that it has made arrangements to carry out a regular alternating four-weekly service with ours, commencing as from September this year, when the new mail arrangements start. To secure regularity in the day of despatch of the mails from Australia, we have made arrangements to alter our day of departure from Sydney. This will he  a  Tuesday instead of  a  Saturday, so that in future there is to be  a  regular fortnightly service by means of the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient steamers, leaving Sydney on Tuesday, Melbourne on Saturday, Adelaide on Monday, and Fremantle on Friday. </para>

            <para>- The position will be practically the same, with the exceptions to which I referred when I laid the Agreement on the table of the House. This is the best Agreement we could get. It is terminable at any time with twelve months&#39; notice. The shipping company would not enter into any other, and did not think that it was desirable to ask the Commonwealth Government to do so during the transition period we are going through at present. After I made my previous statement it is very gratifying to know that there was no adverse criticism of this Agreement. </para>

            <para>- I must say that, in my opinion, the provisions of the Agreement are very loosely drawn. It is left under the Agreement to the Orient Company to make arrangements for the alternating &#39;service, and the Commonwealth Government has very little say in the matter. It is pleasing to know that the alternating service has been arranged, for, but it would be interesting also to know - and the Minister gave us no information on this point- whether the  boats to be employed in the alternating service are equal to the boats to be provided for the monthly service by the Orient Company. </para>

            <para>- Under the 1905 Agreement, the voyage from Naples to Adelaide . occupied696 . hours. Under the 1907 Agreement, which has just expired, . and which was entered into for ten years, starting with 1910, the time allowed from Brindisi to Iranian tie was 638 hours. The present Agreement should have expired in 1920. I , do not know whether it did or uot, and whether we have for some &#34;time been carrying on under some arrangement with the Orient Steam Navigation Company. </para>

            <para> - Under . the Agreement now under consideration, the time allowed xor &#39;the voyage &#39;between Toulon andFremantle is 632 hours, so that there is no improvement proposed in the matter ofspeed.If &#39;we add the time occupied betweenFremantle and Adelaide to the&#39; 632 hours, it will certainly &#39;bring the total time occupied . to Adelaide up to that provided for in the l905 Agreement. We are clearly gaining no advantage in the mattero6f speed. In ; the matter of frequency of service &#39;we are to have the -same conditions as &#34;we had formerly. I hope&#39; that we shall have for the alternating service the same . class of boats las the : four provided for under &#62;the Agreement with the Orient Steam Navigation Company for the monthly service. I do not wish to occupy time in . quoting clauses from the Agreement, out it provides fpr the exemption of boats used in the alternating . service f roi.i certain conditions with &#34;which the other boats ore compelled to comply. That is a loosening of t-he Agreement as -compared with the one which &#39;has just expired. </para>

        <para>Mr.CHARLTON. -I accept the Minister&#39;s statement on the point, hut I  . did  not notice that in reading the contract. As regards cost, under the 1905 Agreement for a . fortnightly service, the expenditure was : to be &#163;1:20,000a year, and -we added to that &#163;26,000forcarrying the mails ou from Adelaide to &#39;Sydney, so that in round figures the expenditure was &#163;146,000. Under the 1907 contract we paid,, I &#39;think, &#163;170,000 per annum, whereas under this contract we shall pay &#163;130,000 a year ; but the conditions in regard to the &#39;running of &#39;the &#39;service are aTtogetlrer different. Under the former contract the company was required to carry the mails to Adelaide, -While &#39;under this contract they will have to &#39;carry them only as far as Freinanule, so &#39;that &#39;the mileage is considerably less. It seems to -me that under this* Agreement the  icorapaaiy  is making &#39;a much better &#39;.bargain than it secured in (regard . to . the carriage of &#39;mails under the . previous Agreement. The Minister &#39;(Mr.Wise) -has -.said that he had to do the best that he could,, ; and I . think he meant to infer that . he -was unable -to- secure . as-. good an arrangement as obtained under the old Agreement.. . Provision is made under this, as under -the old contract, for each . vessel being fitted  up with &#39;insulated space. &#39;Three calls a year have to be made at a Tasmanian port,, as against six calls a&#39; year made under&#39; . -the old arrangement, &#39;so that &#39;Tasmania will toe at la disadvanitajge. </para>

It is to. the. latter portion of the clause that. I- objject. We say that the law of the land must- be complied&#39; with, and one of the laws of the Commonwealth, provides for the registration-, of organiza.tibns. which may secure awards of theCourt in regard to- hours- and conditions of lhbour. Yet under this Agreement; the company may employ non-unionists&#39; with the object, perhaps; of breaking down the unions and. the wages awards- that have been made. Such&#39; a provision- ought to, be  eliminated. I should like to ask the Minister whether any other tenders were received. </para>

            <para>- That is so. When this contract was drawn up it was believed that the four vessels agreed upon at that time would be able to conduct a monthly service: If that was so, I see no reason why, when the five large steamships being built to the order of the Commonwealth are ready to. be put into commission, we- should not employ them in providing for ourselves a monthly mail service. We could employ auxiliary vessels just as this company, is doing, and the &#163;135,000 per year now to be paid to the company would be of great assistance in enabling our own vessels, to- Be run on a satisfactory commercial basis. There is no genuine reason why, when those ships are ready,, they should not b&#187; used for the carriage of our mails.. </para>

        <para> Mir. CHARLTON. -I am aware of that proviso, and&#39; as soon, as the Government, are reasonably sure that these new steamers of the; Commonwealth line will. be available, would, it. rot he advisable: to-  give the company twelve months&#39; notice  of  the termination of this Agreement? Surely if we are going to build ships of our own we will not pay the taxpayers&#39; money to outside firms, and thus assist them to keep going and to make a success of their own boats as against ours? It seems from what we can read that these outside companies are doing everything they can to hamper and hinder the Commonwealth Shipping Line. It  is  therefore necessary that we should see to our own interests and the interests of our people, and carry the mails in our own boats. The Agreement is a business arrangement, and though I could give my own interpretation of different clauses, one or two of which I hold to bo very weak, I shall not occupy time in doing so. It is a business arrangement, which will be entered into when it has received the approval of this House. The Minister says that he has made the best deal he possibly could under adverse conditions. I commend to him the suggestion that, when we have suitable boats to carry the mails- and those which are being built for us will compare favorably with any of those carrying the mails to-day - he should, as soon as is reasonably possible, give the necessary notice for the termination of the contract, so that our own vessels, may carry our mails, and in that way save the Commonwealth a good deal of money. </para>

          <para>.- I am one of those who think that mail contracts are of great importance; but the history of the mail contracts entered into by various Governments in Australia will not bear much investigation. If they were inquired into, it would be proved beyond doubt that the interests of certain individuals and of one section of the community have been better served than have the interests of the great masses of the Australian people. In the latter portion of the seventies a contract was entered into by which the Government of </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Victoria agreed to pay the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company no less than &#163;800,000, the arrangement being that the terminal port should be Melbourne instead of Sydney. That was done in such a way that the State of New South Wales took strong measures in connexion with the American mail con tract, one good result of which is that we have to-day a line of steamers running regularly from Australia to England <inline font-style="italic">via,</inline> America. I do not wish to pass any severe reflections on those who entered into the contract now before the House, because I know they were at the mercy of the company, which has an absolute monopoly of the shipping between Australia and the rest of the Empire. Lord Inchcape, the  chairman  of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam. Navigation Company, is a man with wonderful influence. I suppose that no man within the Empire has. more, and his influence arises out  of  the grip he has on the shipping of Great Britain.. I should like to know if the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company are going to man their ships with coloured crews? </para>

            <para>- If the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company had a dispute with their employees, we would have no control over their coloured crews, but we would have some control over&#39; the crews of the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#39;3 boats. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, therefore, have a fine opportunity to defeat the progressive and humane White Australia policy of the Labour movement. I do not understand why twelve months&#39; notice should be necessary for the termination of the Agreement. Where has the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> been to allow such a provision to be inserted? . He must know that we have  begun to build ships of our own, which surely are not going to be toys. I am sure the desire of the Government and of the people of Australia is that we should not be at the mercy of existing monopolies in the matter of transport between Australia and the older portions of the world. We should have some control over the ships that will carry on the trade between Australia and Great Britain. I direct the attention of members of the Country party to the fact that the contract makes provision for the carriage of butter and other commodities of that character to the other side of the world. It is to the interests of Australia that private companies should not have a monopoly of that trade, or be able to dictate terms to Australia. If we had our own service, it would be managed in such a way that the interests of Australia would be the first to be considered; but there is no possibility of that under this contract. I admit that our own service is not sufficiently advanced to be able to take over the carrying of mails or passengers between England and Australia, but I certainly abject to the provision requiring twelve months&#39; notice on either side for the termination of the Agreement. That period is far too long. It renders the contract what I might call an indecent one, or one which is not mutual. It has been held that a contract is not binding unless the agreement is mutual, and this one cannot be called mutual owing to the long period of notice required to terminate it. If the Government had given that phase of the matter proper consideration, I am certain that they would never have agreed to such a stipulation. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> pointed out that under the contract, unless 300 tons of butter are available, the refrigerating chamber will not be worked. If some misfortune should occur, or , a Ring should be formed to prevent supplies getting to England - for instance, it could be arranged between the company and those concerned in the butter interest that 300 tons of butter should not be available to send to England in order to corner the market - that clause would be open to all sorts of abuses. It leaves the door open to all the tricks of the commercial world. All such risks would be obviated if Australia inaugurated and maintained her own shipping communication with the Old World. It is just as essential that our overseas transport services should be under Australian Governmental control as our national railway systems. The day is not far distant when we shall be bound, in self-defence, to undertake the sea carriage of our mails and produce and citizens. I deprecate rushing this proposal through Parliament. The practice is dangerous. The Government are not infallible; they must take the responsibility of forcing the contract upon the country. There is no keener business interest than the big shipping firms. Their sole objective is the conservation of their shareholders&#39; interest. They have nothing to do with the welfare of Australia. They are neither public spirited nor philanthropic; they are just good business people. For those reasons this Parliament should be very cautious. I do-not think the period mentioned in the contract should be so long. Before twelve months have gone we may be very eager to break the arrangement. Lord Inchcape, who is the individual power behind the big shipping firms concerned in the carriage of Australian mails, is the head of a huge maritime combination, the activities of which are not likely to be beneficial to the Commonwealth. I would do almost anything to arouse the Government to the urgent need for instituting an all-Australian shipping service. Only by such means can we hope to secure fair play. </para>

          <para>. - It is useless to discuss the mail contract. I rise to express my sympathy with the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise).</inline> He has done the best he could under trying circumstances. He has been up against the biggest Combine the world has ever seen, the Shipping Combine of Great Britain. It does not matter what company the contract has been made with. They are all in the same Combine. Everyone who has had dealings, no matter how slight they may have been in their ramifications with this Shipping Combine, lias found himself up &#39; against a brick wall. We must carry our mails, and must make certain provision for communication between Australia and Great Britain; and, in the circumstances, the Postmaster-General has made the best terms he can get. He was not in a position to dictate terms, because tike- Inchcape Combine, or  what  is: called&#62;  the  Gonf.crenco Line; practically commands the whole of the shipping between Great Britain and&#39; Australia and: between Great Britain and&#39; other parts of the world&#39;. The- only hope we have of overcoming this unfortunate state of affairs&#39; is that outside companies will break up this Combine, as they did in connexion with freights., The Combine was charging Australia  &#163;7 a  ton to get its wheat Home, and it was not until foreign companies came iru that, we succeeded in reducing that amount by one-half, and iu. some cases&#62; to a little less than, one-half. The other d&#39;ay a boat was lying at an. Australian wharf loading: wheat at &#163;7 a ton, and&#39; quite, close to- her&#39; was another boat loading wheat  at  half that&#39; rate. The Inchcape Combine thought&#39; that by having&#39; the British-American shipping under their hand&#39;s; they could dictate terms1 to the world1; but fortunately there are fleets flying other flags, although rt  is  a lamentable condition of affairs that any Britisher should be, obliged&#39; to look to. ships flying foreign flags to secure the, carrying of goods from Australia at. a reasonable rate; of. freight., My sympathy is. extended  to  the Postmaster-General in Ilia endeavour to; get the best terms, for ccmmamication between Great Britain and; Ausfiraiia,. when he found himself face to face  with  this;  the&#187;  greatest and: moat merciless Combine the world has ever seen. </para>

We have other steamers- under our control-., At any rate, the five steamers, we shall have- at our disposal! at the. end; of. the, year will be of a- better type and, speedier than the- Orient steamers, and will be; more up to- date. . . Why,, then, should we keep on. paying a high- subsidy to the Orient. Company to; carry our mails? Will the Minister promise that,, as soon as, he can. see -that we are- prepared to carry our own mails- in our own steamers, notice will- be given to; terminate the contract with the OrientCompany? </para>

          <para>. - There is- a) good deal) of misapprehension in the mind&#39;s of honorable members with regard) tOt this contract. It is&#62; simply a, contract with the Orient Company for a-.  fourMveekly-  service, and takes; the place of the old contact with- the. same; company- which, existed for tea years&#39;, and&#39; which was entered into for that period, providing for  ai  fortnightly, service. By reason of the fact that the British Government had arranged with the Peninsular and. Oriental Steam, Navigation Company to run a, fortnightly service from. Great Britain to Australia, we were able&#39; to. have  ai  regular, weekly service. be the two companies: alternating- their- vessels. Af the same time;we- had not control) over the. Peninsular and Oriental Steam- Navigation Company.. The position, is exactly the same to-day. The Orient Company gave us notice to terminate their Agreement, and we had to make some fresh arrangement. They were not . anxious to have a lengthy contract. The matter was entirely in their hands, for there was are other means by &#34;which we could provide another service  if  &#34;they had refused to continue. However, they met us, but they said that they did not want a long contract over what they recognised was a transition period.  They  suggested &#39;an interim contract which &#171;ould be terminated by . twelve months&#39; notice on either side. They -did not even ask for a contract Cor twelve months, and thereafter subject &#34;to twelve months&#39; notice, which meant a contract for at least two years; but only a shed for an Agreement which could  be  terminated by giving twelve moirtfhsl&#39; notice at any time, so that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> we desired we could give the notice immediately after the contract started. This shows that they were net anxious to bind as to a long contract. In order that we might  have an alternate -service through the British -Government -with the &#39;Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, we made it a condition of the contract that it -was subject to -such an arrangement being made in Great Britain. Theheatsof the -Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company axe quite as good as those of the Orient Company. in fact, . recently we have tad one or two of their vessels here which were wp-to date boats. We shall get  the  benefit of the alternative  aervioe in exactly the same way as  we  have -had -the  benefit of  the Peninsular and Oriental &#39;Company&#39;s -service  far  the last ten or eleven years during the existence  of  . the Orient Company&#39;s contract. The points to which the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> . referred are embodied in the new contract. </para>

Alterations have been made to give effect to a four-weekly service instead- of a fortnightly one, to allow far&#39; different ports of call, extra time, and the paying &#163;130,000 per annum instead of &#163;170,000. There is also an alteration in regard to the freight on perishable goods, such as butter and fruit, which, instead of being carried at a axed rate, will be earned according to - the ruling rates charged at the ports of call.
