                        <para>- Honorable members will recollect that at the last sitting of the House I intimated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Woollard, the Clerk-Assistant, proposed to retire from the service of the House on his attaining the statutory age. That gentleman relinquished his position on the 31st of last month, and consequent on his retirement I made the necessary recommendation for the following changes to be made in regard to the officers in attendance in the Chamber: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clapin</inline>
                        to be Clerk Assistant.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hubert</inline>
                        to be Second ClerkAssistant.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGregor,</inline>
                        who some time ago resumed duty after serving as an officer of the Australian Imperial Force, to be Serjeant-at-Arms and  Clerk  of Committees.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">These, and other changes, will not add to the total number of officers, but have rendered possible a very necessary rearrangement of duties. When the House of Representatives first met there was a Second Clerk-Assistant, but, later, on the promotion of the occupant of that office, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder said he did not propose at that time to fill the position of Second Clerk-Assistant, as he desired to try if the work could be efficiently performed with only two Clerks. In view of the fact that the sessions of the House of Representatives are very much longer, and the work of the Department much greater than it was anticipated at the inauguration of Federation would be the case, I think the time has now arrived for the appointment of a Second Clerk-Assistant to be again made. The present  Clerk  and the Clerk-Assistant are of the same age, and, in the event of their retiring at the same time, the House would be at a disadvantage if an officer who had had no previous experience at the table were to be appointed  Clerk  of the House. I may add that in the State of New South Wales there is a Second  Clerk-  Assistant in the Legislative Assembly. </para>
                    <para>Other officers of the staff have also been recommended for promotion as a result of these changes, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Clifton Green, Clerk-Assistant; and Serjeant-at Arms of the House of Assembly, Tasmania, has been appointed  Clerk  of the Papers and Reading  Clerk.  Several of the applications for this position were from officers of other Departments who possess high qualifications and have distinguished military records; but, after exhaustive consideration, the choice fell on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green,</inline> who, in addition to his other qualifications and good military record -including the award of the Military Cross - has the great advantage of experience as an officer of Parliament. Honorable members will be interested to know that we have now on the staff of the House  ex-officers of the Parliaments of Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, a combination which is of obvious benefit in dealing with the work of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>In reference to the financial aspect of the alterations made, I may state that, excluding the salary of an officer formerly paid under the non-clerical branch, the annual cost of the clerical staff will be ?4,310, as against the annual rate of ?4,370 at the initiation of the Parliament - including a salary of ?1,200 then paid to the  Clerk  by the Victorian Parliament - showing that the cost of the salaries of out clerical officers is now ?60 per annum less than it was twenty years ago. The present is only the second occasion on which promotions have been made in the staff, and the total amount of the increases in salaries is more than counterbalanced by the fact that, notwithstanding the great increase in the work of the Department, our small clerical staff is actually one less in number than when it started. </para>
                    <para>I have just learned that my recommendations would be given effect to. </para>

                    <para>. -(By <inline font-style="italic">leave)</inline> - I have a statement to make concerning the business to be submitted to Parliament. It is the intention of the Government to ask honorable members to confine' their attention, during the remainder of the session, to the consideration of the Tariff; and, though circumstances beyond our control, and, indeed, beyond that of the Parliament, may compel the consideration of other matters, Ministers do not now propose to submit any new measures. </para>

                        <para>- In the Melbourne newspapers of the 11th and 12th ultimo, the Treasurer was reported to have said that he was as surprised as any one to hear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fleming</inline> had joined the Country party, and that the honorable member had given no intimation of his intention so to do. I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he ever made any such statement? </para>

                        <para>- I believe that what purported to be an interview with me was published in the newspapers about the time mentioned by the honorable member. All that I know of that interview is that a reporter met me on the steps of the Treasury as I was leaving for home and plied me with the usual questions. I parried those as best I could, and I remember my last words to the reporter were - " I have nothing whatever to say about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fleming's</inline> retirement." The rest is due to a very enterprising reporter. </para>

                            <para>- I shall tell the honorable member all I know, though it is not very much. Because freights have varied, and are varying, very considerably, and as the whole of the wheat has not been shipped, but as, I understand, only a comparatively small portion has been despatched, it is impossible to say what the f.o.b. equivalent of the c.i.f. price is of the wheat sold to Germany. But I may remind the honorable member of a statement I made, which appeared on Saturday, showing that the average price that this wheat has been sold at is more than the price which the people of this country have been asked to pay. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to move an amendment, in view of what appears to be a desire to hide the evidence given at this inquiry. As the representative of Melbourne, I asked for copies of the evidence, and this I did at the request of no fewer than three legal firms in Melbourne. However, the  Chairman  of the Committee, the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> refused to comply with my wishes; and I now urge on the House that, in the interests of justice, this evidence should be printed so that it may be available in case any prosecutions should arise. I must say I was astonished at the refusal of the  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee to supply me with the evidence. </para>

                        <para>- Is it correct, as reported in the press, that Admiral Grant, who attended the recent Naval Conference at Singapore, reported, through his secretary, to the Naval Board, instead of . to the Minister for Defence? Is it a fact that this report was overhauled by the Board before the Minister saw it - that the Board superseded a Minster of the Crown ? </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member is iu possession of information to the effect that that contract has now been settled, I can only say that no such information has reached me. I will place myself in communication with the other party, or, if necessary, with the British Government in order to ascertain if the matter has been settled, and, if so, a copy of the contract will be laid upon the table. I have had no information since I last had the honour of replying to the honorable member upon the subject. </para>

                            <para>. - I regret the necessity for having to move a motion of this description to-day, especially upon a matter affecting the welfare of so large a number of Australian residents. The action of the Government, or the Naval Board, or whoever was responsible for the sudden dismissal of a very large number of men from their employment at Cockatoo Dockyard, came as a shock, not only to representatives of the Labour party in this House, but also to many honorable members who are sitting behind the Government. This action seems to have been taken in the most heartless and ill-considered manner possible. . The employees at Cockatoo were engaged upon work which was expected to continue for a lengthy period, but, without a word of warning, a notice was sent to the Dockyard from the Naval Board that nearly 2,000 men were to be discharged. I telegraphed to the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith),</inline> who. I understood, was in charge of Naval affairs and controlling the Dockyard authorities, and I received a reply, not from the Minister, but from an official, which, without intimating that the Department was prepared to give any explanation, referred me to the Treasury. As a parliamentary representative, I protest strongly against such treatment. My wire to the Minister warranted the courtesy of a reply, if not from him, at least, in his absence, from the Department. But the officials merely intimated to me that my communication had been referred to another set of officials in another </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Department. However, after a good deal of sparring in connexion with the matter, we found that, although the Minister for the Navy was not prepared to make 'any explanation 'to me - his silence was that of the grave - the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> jumped into the arena and said that the explanation for the dismissals lay in the fact that the whole of the money voted for new naval construction had been exhausted. I want to point out, in the first place, that it could not have been a sudden discovery that all the money for new naval construction hal been exhausted. Every month a statement is f forwarded  to ' the Naval Board showing exactly what work has been done in the various naval yards - Cockatoo Island. Garden Island, and elsewhere-rand in that way the Minister for the Navy ought to have known what his officials clearly must  hE  ve known, namely, the amount of money  which  had been expended out of any particular vote. In fact, for months past the Department must have been aware of the position of the various funds. Yet ii » warning was given  ,o the men. At almost a moment's notice they were suddenly thrown out on the Street. In my opinion, they were at least deserving of some notice of the intention of the Government. </para>
                        <para>As the dismissals were not confined to men engaged in. new naval construction work, but embraced all classes of workers, the only case put up on behalf of the Crown, namely, the contention of the Treasurer as to the lack of funds, must fall to the ground. Hundreds of men were discharged who were engaged upon merchant ship construction, upon ordinary maintenance work, and upon repair work generally, but according to the Treasurer ample funds were available for this class of work. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, men engaged upon casual work, but some of -the men of whom I am speaking have not been engaged upon casual work. My complaint is that men who have been employed at Cockatoo Island for thirty or forty yeans, who were engaged, not upon new naval construction, but in assisting in the preparatory work for the construction of the projected 12,500 tons merchant ships, have been thrown out of work in such a heartless fashion. It could not have been for lack of funds, because the Treasurer admitted to the representatives of the men in Sydney that ample funds were available for the purpose of proceeding with the work of merchant ship construction. I also complain on another ground. At Cockatoo Island, as is the case with all dockyards where large numbers of men are employed, there is always liability to accidents, and a number of men have met with accidents while employed there. They were entitled under the State and Commonwealth laws to certain financial compensation - in this regard their legal position was undoubted - but they compromised with the Government, and, instead of receiving monetary compensation for their injuries, accepted a lighter form of occupation in the yard with the promise of permanency. These men have also been thrown out of work in a ruthless fashion, although, so far as the industrial turmoil outside is concerned, they are on the scrap-heap, because, owing to -the injuries they have received, they are utterly unfitted to" follow their occupations in competition with others. Therefore, the Government are not only acting heartlessly, but are also breaking a moral agreement they entered into with these men. Had the men gone to the Courts upon their legal rights they would have been granted monetary compensation for loss of limbs or other injuries sustained, but, believing that the Government would act in an honorable way, they compromised with them, and now they find themselves thrown out of work. I can supply the Minister with the names of very many men who have been affected in this way. </para>

                        <para>In view of the fact that the Treasurer has told us that ample funds are available for new merchant ship construction,' I would like to point -out that there are thousands of  tons  of material - frames, plates, angle bars, &amp;&lt;. - lying at Cockatoo </para>

There is a vast amount of preparatory work to he undertaken in handling that material, so that when the Commonwealth are prepared to proceed with shipbuilding it will all be ready to go right into its place. Eventually this would lead to economy. Men could be employed economically and well on that class of work, and, on the Minister's own statement, ample funds are available therefor. Why, then, does not the Minister make provision to employ men at that particular work ? There is another very serious aspect of the matter. After years of experience on the island, an expert shipbuilding staff has been built up. Previously, Australia had been handicapped by lack of men with the necessary training and experience to make the industry successful; but as an outcome of shipbuilding activities during the war years, we have now a trained staff, together with expert workmen. However, the action of the Government means that these experts will be scattered. Some of the very best men on the' island, in regard to whom no action has been taken by the Government to retain their services, will, be snapped up by private firms and lost altogether . to the Commonwealth industry. </para>

                                <para>- Why ? When her keel was laid, in 1917, she was launched within eight months. That period compares favorably, in respect of similar work, with the work of any naval shipbuilding yard in the Empire. The laying down of the keel and the launching of the hull within eight months implies very rapid work. For those engaged upon this new industry in Australia to be able to compete so well with the Old Country, and create an actual record, speaks volumes for the efficiency of the men at Cockatoo Island. However, after the hull had been launched, she was left tied up to one of the wharfs. By the instruction of the Naval Board the whole of the activities on the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> were stopped. The purpose was a very good one, I am bound to admit. At that period the whole of our transports were returning with troops, :at the conclusion of the war. These craft had to be refitted and handed over to the original owners;, they were urgently wanted for oversea and Inter-State commerce. The whole of the men available at Cockatoo Island were therefore put on to the task of reconditioning. The outcome of all this was, however, that for about nine months only three men wore actually employed on the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide.</inline> She remained for about eighteen months with practically no work whatever being carried out upon her. _ </para>

                            so that there would be no dismissals or dislocation of the highly-trained staff. Suddenly, however, came the word to stop. From whom, or whence, or why, I do not know; but work ceased. It was. necessary to proceed with it ; it is necessary to-day. The Prime Minister

                            said money could be made available. I accept his word. The Treasurer can do as the Prime Minister has suggested. Why does he not make money available from the source indicated? The warship is lying unfinished in the harbor. She is needed as a fully equipped and commissioned unit. We never know bow soon we may want that vessel; and notwithstanding all the sneers and hints that she is already obsolete, it will be found that she is one of the most modern and up-to-date vessels of her class afloat to-day.

In the same way, pending a parliamentary vote, money could be made available for the completion of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide.</inline> Therefore, it was unnecessary to discharge the men who have been discharged, and the Minister responsible for their dismissal should explain his action. The Treasurer admits that money could be made available, and the Minister for the Navy will not deny that the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> is needed, and will be, when constructed, a good, up-to-date vessel. Why, then, have men been discharged before he? completion if it is not that Ministers desire to create an army of unemployed? I should be sorry to think that; but the facts are forcing me to that opinion. </para>

We are supposed to know nothing about it. However, we found out about it, and, desiring to assist the Government in maintaining purity of administration, I suggested that a representative of the men should be present during the inquiry to help in the investigation. If anything wrong has been happening, no one should be in abetter position for helping to discover it han the workmen concerned. But when I made the suggestion to the  Chairman  of the Board, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deacon</inline> - another of these newly-appointed Naval gentlemen- I was curtly informed by him that the matter had nothing to do with me, or with the men, and that he was conducting the Inquiry. Thereupon I intimated to him rather forcibly that I should have something further to say about the matter. </para>

As a matter of fact, the manner in which he is conducting the inquiry is a standing joke on Cockatoo Island. My suggestion was made to assist the investigation, and I was practically insulted by this imported "cockie" for making it. As an Australian, I object to this, as any other Australian would. </para>

We wish to know more about the matter. We wish to know, also, why the Board refused to allow a representative  of the  men to assist them in clearing up things, and in showing whether there is  or is  not anything wrong. If there is anything wrong, the person responsible  should  pay the penalty, and in the public interest the matters should be cleared up. They can be cleared up only by an open inquiry, not by keeping things dark. As representing the workmen, I say, clearly  and definitely,  " We have nothing to be afraid of, and welcome an inquiry. We are prepared to do everything in our power to assist the Government in clearing up matters." </para>

I do not say that the statement  is  true - because  I  do not know whether  it  is true or not - but in the interest of  the  purity of administration it should  be  cleared up. A lot of the work at Jervis Bay is under the control of the Naval Works Branch of the Department of the Minister for Works and Railways, and this is most significant: The gentleman holding the highest position in that branch in New South Wales - out of consideration for his family  I  do not wish to mention his name, and  I  do not know  if  he is still in the office - was prosecuted, and, on 1st February last, was committed for trial, on the serious charge of stealing material from Cockatoo Island. Nothing further was heard of the case until, after making inquiries.  I  learned that, at the instance of the Common wealth authorities, the prosecution had been stopped. </para>

                                <para>- It is true. It is stated that there is a relationship existing between this man and a prominent member of the Naval Board. That is the statement I stand to. Let honorable members contrast the action of the Government in dealing with this man with their action in the case of ordinary men working on the Island, who may pick up a piece of scrap which they may consider handy for some purpose. It may not be worth a penny, but the man is immediately grabbed by the policeman at the gate and placed under arrest, is haled before a Court, and dealt with. At the very time that the official to whom I have referred was committed for trial, and at the very same Court, other men were charged, dealt with, and fined. One man who, I hasten to say, was not a workman but a foreman civil engineer, was fined £15, whilst in the case of the "boss cockie" and head of the lot, the prosecution is stopped. The Government may have a good explanation to offer, but if so I am anxious to hear it in order that I may do no injustice to this man. </para>

If justification for closing up Cockatoo Island docks could be given we have had it to-day from the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony).</inline> There is nothing right at the docks, and everything is wrong. The officers are incompetent and dishonest, and all sorts of things are going on that should not be going on. If the honorable member's statements are correct, the best thing we can do is to suspend operations until the whole matter is cleared up. </para>

                                <para>- I shall not miss that. I am the culprit in this matter. Let there be no mistake about that. Moreover, I am as interested in the docks as is the honorable member for Dalley, as there are many of my constituents working at the docks. All that I have to say with regard to the latest statements of the honorable member, is that I have just heard of them for the first time.I did hear that there were certain irregularities alleged over there, and the moment those things came to the ears of the Government a departmental inquiry, and not a purely naval inquiry, was set going. We were asked at the Treasury to nominate a competent accountant who would, be capable of investigating these matters. The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> selected a man, the Treasurer selected another, and the Naval Board selected a third, and those three men have been making a preliminary inquiry. Honorable members may rest assured that these matters will be sifted to the bottom. If there have been dishonest practices at the dock, they must be stopped at once. </para>

                                <para>- Because of the main point of the indictment of the honorable member for Dalley. He wants to know why the money was stopped, and why men were discharged from the island. As I remember the circumstances, I received a request from the Navy Department for £120,000 additional to the estimate that was passed by this Parliament. I asked for some explanation of the request, and I was told that the money had run out for work on the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Moonbah.</inline> Honorable members will recollect that each year for some years past, there has appeared on the Estimates an item of £30,000 for new construction. That vote is supposed to last for the year. Honorable members will please note the fact that the money comes from revenue and not from loan. I found when I came to investigate the matter, that at the very moment at which this request for £120,000 was being made to me, my Department had a credit to the vote on its books of £75,000. What happens is this: When we get a yearly vote like that to which I have referred, we issue quarterly warrants making available a fourth of the total sum at the beginning of each quarter. I found that, up to the end of February, during only eight months of the financial year, every penny of the year's vote had been spent. </para>

                                <para>- As I understand the matter, this is what occurred. Honorable members will recollect that a great deal of repair work was being carried on at the dock in the reconditioning of transports and work of that character. The volume of that work had fallen off since the troops have returned, and the transports are done with. There was, therefore, less work on the island than there was during the war, and what has happened has been that, instead of letting men go off as they were accustomed to do when the volume of repair work decreased, the manager, for some reason or another, crowded them all on to the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide.</inline> That, I believe, is the cause of the trouble. </para>

I am concerned about making the country aware of the facts, and I say that I was asked to find money which this House had not voted. I declined to do so. I found that the vote for the year had been exhausted in eight months. It occurred to me that there was no particular urgency for the completion of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide.</inline></para>

                                <para>- I was going to say. This is the only bit of new construction we have in hand, no other new Navy construction having been authorized. It did occur to me that, as this boat has been three or four years on the stocks, and as £100,000 intended to complete her will be available during next year, or maybe when the new Naval Scheme of Defence has been settled at Home, it would then be quite time enough to consider the completion of this cruiser. I want to say, with regard to the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> that I have no sympathy at all with the criticisms of the vessel which have appeared in some of the Melbourne newspapers. A great mouthful is made of the fact that she will cost over £1,000,000. If we were building the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> in London to-day, instead of costing £1,900,000 as she did, a similar boat to-day would cost well over £4,000,000. The cost of Naval construction has more than doubled at Home. It has only doubled here yet, so far as we are aware. There is, therefore, no reason to gird at the probable cost of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> and to talk of costly construction. In my judgment, the construction has not been costly, and I believe it has been efficient. It is time that people stopped decrying, as some are wont to do, everything that we undertake in Australia. We can build ships here, I believe as well as they can be constructed anywhere else. </para>

                        <para>The point to be cleared up is who proceeded to spend this money without authority. Having spent the whole of the vote, they had no other course but to turn away these men when there was no more money available for their payment. I wish it to be understood that while I am at the Treasury I will not be bludgeoned by any Department, by any officials, or by any persons in that way. We have the Estimates as passed by Parliament, and we are making a great effort just now to confine our spendings within those Estimates. It is not possible, however, to do so, and I shall have something more to say before very long concerning that aspect of the matter. There are some items which I cannot control - obligations which must be met, even without waiting for the authority of Parliament. One of these is the increase in wages and salaries granted by the Courts - the payment of  the basic wage, and matters of that kind -approved by this House, but for which no Estimates have been framed. The payment of the basic wage alone will run into something like £800,000 or £900,000. There are other items of the kind which I must meet; but when Parliament places on the Estimates a sum of money to provide for the construction of a vessel or for the carrying out of some other work it is my duty, as far as possible, to keep that work within the compass which Parliament has set for it.[Extension <inline font-style="italic">of tine granted.]</inline> This, then, is the explanation : I was faced with the position that, at a moment's notice, on my own initiative, I was to increase by 25 per cent. -'the vote passed by Parliament. I absolutely declined to do so. </para>

                        <para>SirJOSEPH COOK. - I am going to tell the House. It appears to me that a mistake has been made on the island in respect to the two vessels under construction. When the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> and I went over to investigate this matter, we found that whereas the manager had been operating the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> with about from 450 to. 500 men, he suddenly, in November last, jumped up the number to 800, then to 900, later on to 1,000, and finally to 1,100, until the whole bubble burst. That is exactly what happened. It would have been infinitely more sensible, if the manager wanted to concentrate the men on a particular vessel, to have concentrated them on the <inline font-style="italic">Moonbah</inline> and got her off the slips, since, until the <inline font-style="italic">Moonbah</inline> islaunched, a start cannot be made with any of the other work awaiting attention. </para>

                                <para>- Men on the island say it is not bunkum, but the truth. The engineer of the City Council says it is the truth, and so does the manager of the island, but the honorable member says it is bunkum. I am afraid we shall have to take the opinion of these responsible and competent gentlemen, who know all about the matter, in preference to the statements of my honorable friend. To begin with, there are no plans or drawings in existence in connexion with the work to which he has referred, and the machinery for that job would have to be imported from the Old Country. </para>

That, I understand, can be done for £6,000, and I have made that amount available. As soon as the <inline font-style="italic">Moonbah</inline> is launched the slip is to be widened to accommodate the larger vessels to be built. When that is done a start will be made with the construction of these other vessels, in respect of which there are already assembled something like 5,000 tons of material. For that there is money, and the sooner the work can be done the better; but I do not know that all our talk here will facilitate it by even one minute. </para>

                                <para>-  I do not know. I am not the manager of the dockyard. The honorable member appears to know more about the work of the dockyard than does the manager himself. I can only say that instructions have been given to get the <inline font-style="italic">Moonbah</inline> off the slips at the earliest possible moment. The sooner that can be done and the slip widened so that the assembling of material for the big vessels can be proceeded with, and as many men put on as can be employed in that way, the better for us all. I heartily wish we could do something speedily to bring back some of these men. I deeply regret what has occurred. I take my share of the responsibility in so far as the curtailing of money is concerned, but I have adopted that course in an honest attempt to try to keep the spending of the various Departments within the Estimates passed by this House. As for anything else I accept no responsibility. In conjunction with other honorable members, I can only express my deepest regret at the inconvenience, trouble, deprivation, and perhaps, in some cases, the suffering, that has been caused by the unnecessary and, in my opinion, wrongful sudden discharge of these men. I hope that they will soon be employed. </para>

                                <para>- The aspect of this question which I wish to discuss, and which comes within the scope of the motion, is quite distinct from that of, the construction of naval vessels. It relates to the general policy of Government shipbuilding. I do not wish to traverse from its very inception the history of the programme which has been mapped out by the Government. Honorable members are well acquainted with the fact that the Isherwood type of vessel has been built at two places at least in Australia, namely, in Melbourne, and at Walsh Island, near Newcastle. The Walsh Island dock is State-owned - it is not the property of the Commonwealth. But, immediately the Commonwealth Government outlined their shipbuilding programme, the  Government  of New South Wales expended considerable sums in establishing a proper dockyard, in order that they might participate in that programme. Up to the present time the Government of that State have expended upon plant and machinery installed on the Island no less a sum than  £500,000.  They have constructed six ships there, which, from the point of view of quality, will compare favorably with those built  in  any other portion of the world. Admittedly the work has been faithfully performed. It was undertaken in the belief that the Commonwealth Government intended to continue its policy of shipbuilding with a view to thoroughly establishing the industry in Australia. Quite recently orders for the construction of some of these vessels were given to private firms: At Williamstown three ships have already been turned out, whilst at Walsh Island half-a-dozen, or thereabouts, have been constructed. But, for some reason or other, these private firms have ben obliged to forgo their contracts, so that three ships which were to have been built by private enterprise are now to be built at the dockyard in Melbourne. I mention these facts merely for the purpose of showing how wide of the mark is the statement made by the Treasurer in reply to a deputation which waited upon him in connexion with this matter. Upon that occasion, he said that the whole of this shipbuilding should be carried out by private individuals. He made that statement at a time when private contractors had failed to carry out the contracts which had been intrusted to them by the Government of the day.A request has since been made that the </para>

                                <para>- I have heard that statement contradicted by the men who were engaged in the building of those vessels. I do know that some of the ships, which were supposed to have been built elsewhere for a little less than they could be built at Walsh Island, have since had to be sent to the latter place for repair). It is idle to consider the expenditure of a pound or two more per ton upon ships if the result of that expenditure is in any way doubtful. </para>

                        <para>In my judgment, the Government are under an obligation to keep going the shipping industry at Walsh Island. Only some two or two and a half years ago a proposal was made by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company for the purchase of that island, with a view to the establishment of the shipbuilding industry there upon its own account. The company intended to proceed immediately with the construction of twelve vessels. At that time, however, so intent was the Prime Minister upon extending his shipbuilding programme and upon hastening the construction of vessels that, at his request, the New South Wales Government refused to part with the island. Yet, immediately the first contract by the State Government has been concluded, they are told that there is no more work for them to do, notwithstanding that the Prime Minister himself was instrumental in preventing them from disposing of the island to the company which I have mentioned. Personally, I have never favoured the adoption of the Isherwood type of ship. In the days of keen competition, the royalty which these vessels will carry so long as the Government owns them will mean all the difference between a profit and a loss. </para>

                                    <para>Cockatoo Island dockyard should, in our opinion, be reserved for naval shipbuilding. Naval and mercantile shipbuilding, are two distinct branches for which staffs have to be trained and maintained separately in the large dockyards of Great Britain, where both kinds of shipbuilding are carried on. In Australia we think it better to separate the two classes of work into different yards, thus enabling the staffs to concentrate on the particular branch allotted to . it. As Cockatoo was intended primarily as a naval establishment, and has been equipped with that object in view, it seems unwise to add commercial shipbuilding to its activities. The dock might, however, continue to be utilized when 'available for docking merchant vessels. Cockatoo dockyard requires -re-organization. There are too many supervisors, and there is too little supervision. There is much friction among the staff, and discipline is very lax. </para>

                                <para>- It is at a place where more Customs and Excise revenue is collected than is collected in the whole State of Tasmania. It was in conformity with the policy of the Federal Government that this shipyard was established, and the work there has been carried out to the letter and up to date. We have the report of a committee of inquiry showing that it is the best yard at which to construct those large vessels ; and all that is requested now is a share of the work that is going ; but that is refused by the' Government, though it would be sufficient to tide the concern over the trouble. First, of all, the State Government was requested not to sell this yard to any private company; but to reserve, it for Commonwealth shipbuilding; but when that request is acceded to, the order goes forth that no more ships are to be constructed there. That, I really think, amounts to absolute repudiation. Even if this is a State dockyard, the men employed there are just as much Commonwealth taxpayers as any other employees in the State. </para>

                            <para>.- This is a question which seriously interests myself and other representatives of the metropolitan area of Sydney. Certain allegations have been made, not only in this House, but in the press, and by the public at large, in reference to Cockatoo Island dockyard, which, if they are true, call for severe censure on the management. It appears to me that it was an ill-advised action to dismiss 1,600 men at five minutes' notice. </para>

                                <para>- If there is one way in which revolution can be bred, it is by such action as that to which I refer. If the. management of the dockyards cannot see more than five minutes ahead, and provide sufficient funds to meet current expenditure, it is not worthy of the trust reposed in it, and should be displaced. In my opinion, the dismissals at the dockyard started at the wrong end. I have never met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clark,</inline> who, according to report, is a most competent man ; but when we come a little further down to the foremen of the various branches we realize the need for close investigation of the methods they employ in carrying out their work. </para>

                                <para>- Whoever is responsible for the present position is worthy of censure and dismissal. We hear in Sydney, and throughout Australia generally, most serious statements made in regard to the manner in which the work is carried out at the dock; and a Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire as to their truth or otherwise. If the allegations, as the result of such inquiry, prove to be true, then those responsible should be penalized; on the other hand, if the statementsarenottrue,thepeoplewho  make them should be penalized. These rumours do harm, not only to the dockyard, but to Australia as a whole. Australian tradesmen compare more than favorably with tradesmen anywhere else in the world ; and it has been proved time after time, especially since the commencement of the war, that we can build ships here more cheaply than they can be built in either the Old Country or America, as a comparison of the cost per ton will show. These rumours, I again urge, ought to be proved or disproved, and punishment meted out to those who deserve it. It was said in this House at the beginning of the session . that there were. men at Cockatoo earning, on an average, £20 per week. </para>

                                <para>- At any rate, we know that Australian workmanship can compare with that in any other part of the world; and, that being so, we ought to be patriotic and support those undertakings which employ large numbers of men. By continual criticism of the administration of such works we bring discredit, not only on particular enterprises, but on Australia as a whole. I have heard a man say that he was given a position on the island, but that he walked around for three days without getting any job to do. In such a case the foreman in charge of the gang is surely responsible ; on the other hand, if that man's statement is untrue he is not fit to be employed there. </para>

The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony),</inline> by means of a question, has raised the matter of re-employing some of the dismissed men in assembling material at the dockyard, of which I understand * some  5,000 tons are now lying there. If it is possible for the Treasurer to act on the suggestion, it would be a desirable thing to do. </para>

I personally make no allegations against the management of the dockyard, but merely draw the attention of honorable members to the rumours which are floating about, particularly in Sydney, and which continually come under the notice of representative men. The truth or untruth of these rumours should be established, and the responsibility placed upon the proper shoulders. </para>

                            <para>.- The remarks of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> are sufficient to indicate to every honorable member that somebody is to blame for the discharge of such numbers of men from their employment at Cockatoo Dock. Those who know the circumstances of the commercial and industrial life of Australia, are aware that an attempt was made some time ago to bring about a strike of the seamen; but, although the press used its columns very extensively for that purpose, the strike failed to take place. One would almost imagine that the Government had been hand-in-glove with that project, inasmuch as, at the very time that the seamen's strike was to have been brought about, so many men were discharged from the Government workshops at Cockatoo Island, and the labour market was flooded in consequence. Watching closely, as I do, all these movements, I feel that there is no other conclusion that I can come to. At any rate, it is certainly within the realm of reason. Alderman Lambert, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, and his fellow aldermen, knowing that certain complicated machinery was required in connexion with the electrical plant, of the Sydney City Council, heard that it could bc made at Cockatoo Dock. They knew that there was a shortage of work there, and so alive were they to the possibilities of giving employment to Australian workmen at the dock, that they visited the place to find out for themselves whether that machinery could be made there. It is to their credit that they made a searching inquiry, and were able to tell their fellow members of the City Council that the dock was in a position to perform this particular work, instead of its being -sent to America. Tenders had been called for it in various parts of the world, and I believe the lowest came from America; but, fortunately, a good many of the aldermen of the Sydney City Council are good Australians first, and they decided to keep the work, if possible, in Australia for "Australian workmen. They tried to ascertain, from the dock authorities the possible cost of the work; but they did not ask for any concession or privileges. They simply asked whether the dock could do this work, which was urgently required to enable the citizens of Sydney and suburbs to obtain electricity for light and power purposes, seeing that the demand in that progressive city had grown so greatly as to far exceed the existing facilities. The City Council thought it was within the bounds of possibility that the Government would permit the necessary machinery to be made at the dock; but, to the surprise of every one, it was intimated indirectly that a gentleman of the name of, I think, Hall, had decided that no persons employed by the Government in these national workshops were to be allowed to do anything to encourage the Sydney Council to have the work done there. I cannot understand why such an intimation should he given to an official connected with the dock; but I am assured that he was told that he was in no way to encourage those who wanted to carry out a policy which would have been so beneficial in every way to the people of Australia. I should like to know why Australia's national workshops* cannot be given the opportunity to supply the requirements of the Australian people or of Australian public bodies. I am credibly informed that the machinery which the City Council required, and which the dock was able to manufacture, was something in connexion with turbines. It is known that turbines cannot be made in all the engineering shops of Australia ; in fact, I do not think one has been turned out in Australia yet. </para>

                                <para>- I was about to mention that fact. No turbines have been turned out in Australia except at Cockatoo Dock,  where  the Government actually spent money on special machinery to enable them to be. made. That machinery  is  very complicated, as some of the parts of the turbines are very small, and very nice machinery  is  required to turn them out. I believe the necessary machinery was installed at Cockatoo, to enable  a  new turbine to be made for the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Loongana,</inline> which runs between Australia and Tasmania. So much influence was brought to bear that Australia's national  Workshops  could ' be used for that purpose, but when the Labour Mayor and Labour aldermen of the city of Sydney - and here comes in the crux of the question - wanted similar work to be done at the Cockatoo Dock for the city of Sydney, they were told that they could not avail themselves of the national workshops for the benefit of the people. </para>

I do not know whether the Minister is aware that such an instruction as I have indicated was sent to the dock officials. If he is aware of it, he is not fit to occupy the position of Minister of such a Department. He must know as well as I do that there is a great dearth of employment in Sydney, and he should know that the Sydney City Council was prepared to pay the Department whatever price was agreed upon for the performance of the work at the dock. The members of the Sydney City Council are good Australians, and want to provide employment in Australia for our own workmen'. Any Minister who blocks work of that sort should be put to some other job, because he is not fit for the position he holds. The Treasurer has told the House that there has been a great bungle over the discharge of the men from Cockatoo. He said that he shares the responsibility so far as the money is concerned, but that he takes no * share in the responsibility for discharging the men, or for the position that has been created. That position was created by those in charge of the Navy Department. </para>

                                <para>- Somebody is certainly answerable. . Ever since I have been a member of the House, I have taken up the position that the Minister must be the head of his Department. We have been running to blazes so far as the constitutional carrying on df business is concerned. There may have been some justification during the war for some of the , actions of the Government; but now that the war is over, all those of us who are democrats - and that applies particularly to those who sit on this side of the House - should endeavour to secure a return to true constitutional government, with Ministers held responsible for their actions. If they do things that are not in accordance with the Constitution, or which injure any section of the community, they should be kicked out of office, just as any private employer would discharge a man who did not perform his duties properly in his own establishment. That is the idea- which the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> was partly driving at in the motion which he intended to move to-day. I only wish he had moved it. I would have seconded it, in order to give the House an opportunity to know something about the financial position, and the conduct of affairs at Cockatoo Island. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know how the Naval Board ever got into its present position of authority. I do not object to a board of management for the Navy Department, but I do object to the Naval Board giving to officers of the Department directions on matters of policy, which should come only from the Minister. A Naval Board may be a good thing, but I strongly protest against its assumption of Ministerial control. I am constantly receiving letters " By direction of the Naval Board." To my mind, the direction should come only from the Minister. If, it did, the Minister could be held answerable for it. </para>

The matter was then entirely in the hands of the Crown Law officers, and they, after consideration of the facts in their possession, 'advised that a continuation of the proceedings was not justified. The evidence showed that the material found in the possession of this officer had been purchased by him, and the Crown Law officers advised that the further proceedings should be abandoned.

                                <para>- This matter has been brought before Parliament so frequently that the Minister ought, to be in possession of sufficient information without waiting to hear what other honorable members have to say. I was surprised that the Minister, instead of speaking at once, put up the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to speak for him. The Treasurer, in his light and airy fashion said, " Shut up the docks." That is all very well, but what about the thousands of employees who have families dependent upon them? Some of those people have been driven to the doors of starvation. Other people advise us to buy the ships abroad, because, they say, we can buy them cheaper than we can build them locally. What is to become of Australia if we adopt that policy? What  is  to become of the iron industry? Are  we  to send the raw material abroad and buy  it  back in manufactured form for ten  or  twelve times as much as  we  receive for  it,  as  we  do with our wool? I hope  we  shall set our face against any policy of that kind. Where are  we to  buy the ships - from China  or  Japan? From the figures  in  our possession  we  know that  we  can build ships  in </para>

                        <para class="block">Australia ais cheaply as they can be built in any other country in the world  at the  present time. Why, then, should  we  deny our people the opportunity to work?  Is it  a fact that although 1,600 workmen  were  dismissed from Cockatoo Island, the  services  of nine assistant managers were  retained,  notwithstanding that it has  been  suggested by responsible men and  the  press that there were already too many managers there, many of whom were  imported  men, and did not know their  job?  I know it is difficult to prove some  of the  allegations which are being made, but will the Minister tell us something about  the  supposed sale of the <inline font-style="italic">Sea Lark,</inline> which,  it  was said, was disposed of for something like £2,500, although at the time there were on board Government stores in excess of that value? Let the Minister tell  the  House whether it is true that one night, in Sydney Harbor,  a  motor launch grounded, and that when assistance was taken to the boat many hundreds  of  pounds worth of Government stores, supposed to have been taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Sea</inline><inline font-style="italic">Lark,</inline> were found on board? I believe that if a Parliamentary Committee went to Cockatoo Dock that statement could  be  proved. Many months ago I voiced some of the complaints which have been mentioned to-day, but I could get no redress of any kind. What about the company which is said to have been registered, and of which many of the men connected with Cockatoo Dock are supposed to be  members?  Last year I called' attention to the fact that the Government were taking work away from the dock and giving it to a private company. My statement was denied, but the Minister cannot now dispute that after- 1 made my statement that work was returned to Cockatoo Dock. The state of affairs there is scandalous. Of course, people do not make broadcast the charges of which one hears because of the difficulty of proving them. In the interests of the country, as well as of those who have charge  of  matters at ' Cockatoo Island, the Minister ought to  clear up all these allegations. It is said that £250,000 worth of Government stores have disappeared from Cockatoo Island, and we must have a very peculiar system of control if the accuracy or otherwise  of  that statement cannot be proved. I know that at Jervis Bay hundreds of pounds  of material was missing which was subsequently discovered in the houses of different people. We ought to know how it got there. The same deal should be meted out to the men in high positions as to the humble individual who has to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. There ought not to be one law for the rich and another for the poor: Let this House 9end a Committee of Inquiry to Cockatoo, and within twenty-four hours some of these allegations will be cleared up. I personally will undertake to prove something. A star chamber inquiry is being held at Cockatoo now, and evidence is being taken in secret; but is the evidence that is desired likely to be obtained when the nien who .can give it know that their bread and butter is at stake, and that they may be victimized? To my own "knowledge, which is fairly extensive, some curious things have been happening at Cockatoo Dock, and the rumours which are abroad ought to be investigated. I am astounded that any honorable member should' suggest the closing up of the docks. I am a good Protectionist and a good Australian, and any man who urges that the dock should be .closed, and that we should purchase our ships abroad instead of giving employment in our own country, has no right to be in this Parliament, or even in the Commonwealth. If we adopt that policy, what shall we do with our iron works, and where are our primary producers to find a market, or our people to find employment? Is the <inline font-style="italic">sama</inline> policy to be advocated in connexion with everything we produce in Australia - wheat, for instance? Because there is a slump in the price of materials on the other side of the world, are we to buy abroad and throw our own people out. of employment? I hope this House will discountenance that doctrine. I frei keenly on this matter. I have no particular interest in Cockatoo Dock, and I will not defame anybody who is employed there; they should get fair play, both managers and men. The Minister, as the responsible head of his Department, is the man to whom we are looking for a satisfactory explanation. I congratulate the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> upon having raised his voice in this House, and for standing up for these men, many of whom are in dire distress. I object to this star chamber committee business. Is it a fact that three gentlemen are over <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Sydney now taking evidence in secret? </para>

On a former occasion, I made a statement in this House that some of the men were getting <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> and £30 a week. I do not know whether .they were earning that sum, but they were paid it. Nothing was said about my statement then. </para>

                            <para>. - I court the fullest inquiry in this House or anywhere else into my administration of the Navy Department, and I know some honorable members here are quite capable of judging because they watch me very closely indeed. I invite them, to say what they think of my . administration. I do not want to misrepresent the' honorable member who said last year that the Naval ratings were seething with discontent, but I invite the fullest inquiry. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know. One honorable member did. All I can say is that if honorable members will inquire, they will find that such- is not the case. Other acts of administration have been carried out by me to the best of my ability. And, after all, how long have I been responsible for one of the biggest Departments in the Commonwealth : eight years, ten years, twenty years? No. I have been in charge for just eight months. I thank the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> for having brought this matter forward, because it gives me the opportunity I looked for in order to say something upon it. I realize my responsibility as a Minister. Unless I had some proof, I would not presume to lay any charge against the humblest man employed in the dockyard, and I am. endeavouring, to the best of my ability, and with the help of the Naval Board - which courts the fullest inquiry- to obtain all the information possible in connexion with this matter. I do not profess to be an expert - no Minister can be on everything - and so I must rely upon the advice of the experts in my Department. They have given me most loyal service, which I fully appreciate. The committee that has been appointed is a departmental Committee of Inquiry for  the purpose of ascertaining the truth of certain allegations into affairs at the dockyard, and when the complete report is submitted to me, it will be made a subject-matter for- Cabinet consideration. Certain statements were made some time ago, and, as a result of inquiries, we ascertained that a man in a big firm in Sydney was systematically defrauding the Department. He is in gaol now. Who put him there? The Government, who prosecuted him for his crime. That is something. </para>

                        <para>I should like now to . say a few words with reference to the statement made by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> about tenders for electro-turbines. I understand that these turbines have been designed for the generation of power for the city of Sydney, and I have been credibly informed that to-day a firm is completing tenders, to the value of about £200,000, for the construction of the same sort of machinery, although the honorable member says it cannot be made in Australia. I am speaking subject to correction, but I remember reading a statement that the work can be done in Sydney. </para>

                                <para>- Not long ago I saw a Sydney company's prospectus, which stated that they were going to do this work. Cockatoo Island dock is a shipbuilding establishment constructed for that particular purpose, and the construction of electro-turbines, I understand, requires a certain number of highly skilled men but very few unskilled workmen. In addition, certain patent rights are owned by a certain company, and I believe it would be very difficult indeed to get them for Cockatoo Island dock. I have also been informed that it would take nine months at least to equip the establishment for this special machinery. Fancy installing machinery for this special work with all the overhead charges, and then using it only once. Would that be sound business ? </para>

The committee of inquiry is assisting me to do so. I have not in my possession at the present time sufficient information to make a direct charge against the General Manager. </para>

                                <para>- Not at all. The honorable member is known as a reasonable man, and it is useless for him to attempt to twist my meaning. It would neither do him any good nor do me any harm, because I cannot be held personally responsible, seeing that I have done everything that any one would ex'pect of a Minister in charge of a Department. For that reason I court' the fullest inquiry. When a Minister gives an order; and it is transmitted to the proper quarter, where it is supposed to be carried out, can he be held responsible if it is nob carried out, so long as he brings all concerned to task immediately he hears that it has not been carried out ? That is the course I intend to follow, and as soon as I can ascertain who is responsible for the present state of affairs at Cockatoo Island, he will be made to suffer as he deserves to suffer. I. do not think any member would expect me to undertake the task of watching every man working in every branch of a great public Department. How could I do so? A system has been laid down which I shall endeavour to work to the best of my ability. I have not been absent from my. office one day, except when in other States on departmental business. I have worked holidays and Sundays. The control of coal supplies was added to my responsibilities, giving me a great deal more work to do than I anticipated, and people of all classes have thanked me personally for the manner in which the task was undertaken. Could it be of any avail or interest to me to condone any fault? </para>

In fact, it was hinted that this was the reason for the stopping of work. </para>

                                <para>- I am not saying so. The true facts are that the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> was under construction during the war, and because it was seen that it could be of no assistance during the war, it was placed alongside a wharf at the docks, and work was concentrated on the fitting of troopships. Work was entirely suspended on the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide.</inline></para>

                                <para>- I shall explain the position. As the war proceeded, the Navy found out the weaknesses of different classes of ships, and many weaknesses were found in cruisers of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> type. As a consequence, many things which had been completed on the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> had to be altered, and very often when the alterations were effected the Naval Board would come along and say, " That will not do; this has to be altered." As a consequence, they have kept on altering the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> from time to time, and, of course, naturally the cost of construction has gone up. </para>

Sometimes after an alteration has been made the original design has been  reverted  to. When we find a Naval Board so incompetent as to keep on was' lng the people's money in this way, there is ample justification for this House to condemn their actions and see that in future they do not interfere with a vessel's design, but will allow it to be completed, and thus give the workmen a fair chance. </para>

                        <para>I do not wish to say anything to prejudice the employment of these men again, but if the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> could 'get together with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> I am sure they could be re-employed in another week or two. Owing 'to the high cost of living the workers at the island could only live from week to week, and now they are out of employment while steel plates are ready to be assembled for the building of large ships at.. the island. Apart from any criticism, to-day I appeal to the Minister to look at the matter from a humanitarian point of view, and to see if these men cannot be started again. It is unfair to blame the men for the overhead charges, or for the expense incurred in connexion with alterations. There are too many highly-paid inspectors and officials; and surely the men cannot be held responsible for the outlay incurred in that direction. The officers and men are there to do their work, and if they do not perform it satisfactorily their services should not be retained. I trust the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> will earnestly consider the advisableness  of reinstating the men next week, so that the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> may not be allowed to remain in her present unpainted condition, as she is an eyesore to thousands of people who cross the Harbor daily, and is a reflection upon the Commonwealth Parliament, the Government, and the workmen. I ask the Government to complete the work - I believe the vessel is now up to date - and thus prepare for the construction of the larger ships, as that will be the means of absorbing a large number of men who are at present unemployed. I trust the Treasurer will endeavour to find sufficient money to keep the men engaged until the Estimates for the next financial year are passed. </para>

                            <para>.- The information that has been given to the House by Ministers this afternoon shows that there has been sufficient ground for a searching inquiry into the administration at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In the first instance, there appears to have been no justification for 1,500 men being thrown on an already glutted labour market in Sydney without the slightest notice or warning, and it seems that this action has been taken in an endeavour to show a spiteful attitude towards the Treasurer because he said he would not find any more money. Whoever is responsible ought to be made to pay very dearly for his action. We have been informed that a departmental inquiry is being held to ascertain who is really responsible for the present state  of affairs; and that the Board of Inquiry includes a representative of the Naval Board, who,, naturally, will not say that the Board which he represents is open 'to censure. The Department of the Treasury is also represented, and it is not likely that the officer from . that Department will blame the Treasury. There is also a member representing the Ship Construction Branch, and he will not hold <inline font-style="italic">~his</inline> Department or Minister responsible. In these circumstances, it seems very unlikely that the blame will be placed on the  right  shoulders/ We are endeavouring to establish the shipbuilding industry in Australia, and, in doing so, are meeting with opposition from one of the greatest combines in the  'World.  Lord Inchcape and his followers are only too . ready to scathingly criticise the Commonwealth shipbuilding policy, and naturally the position which has recently been created will be given great publicity, not only in our own newspapers, hut in others circulated in other parts of the world. Circumstances such as these will do more damage to Australia than many others that might be mentioned. The fact that £75,000 which ought to have been expended between March ' and June was disbursed before February by some one, apparently without the knowledge of the Treasurer - because the Treasurer said that his account showed a credit of £75,000  -  surely needs some explanation. </para>

                                <para>- The credit still remains, and apparently some one in another Department has spent it. There must be something wrong if vouchers covering the expenditure have not been submitted to the Department. There is in this fact striking evidence of mismanagement, as some one has apparently spent a large sum of money without the Minister's knowledge. I could not quite understand the statement of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr-. Laird Smith)</inline> when, in reading from a document, he said that in January the Manager was informed that, if he went on spending at the present rate, the vote would .'be exceeded before the due date. The Minister at the same -time said he did not know the vote had been exceeded until he was informed that the money had been spent. There has been mismanagement, and the result is that the persons who have paid the penalty have not been those who were responsible. The officers are still employed; but 1,500 men who, as we know, live practically from week to week, are out of work and have to bear the consequence of same one else's blunder. If ever there was an occasion for a searching inquiry it is in connexion with the administration of Cockatoo Island Dockyard. It has been stated that some men have been earning £20 per week, and, if that is so, all power to them; but they were on piece-work and would have to </para>

                            <para>.- As there are several others who desire to speak to this motion, I do not intend to delay the House for more than a few moments. The fact that there has been such an embroglio in connexion with this matter, and that 1,600 men have suddenly been thrown out of work, certainly, needs some explanation. It is incredible to think that the money available for these works in the current financial year has been exhausted without the Department being aware of it. It is inexcusable in the light of the fact that two years ago the Economy Commission, in conducting its investigations, directed special attention to the conduct of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The report of that Commission states - </para>

                            <para>A statement in regard to the Stores Branch showed .that stock-taking took place on 30th June, 1916, hut the stock-sheets showing the result only left the dock in March, 1919. They showed deficits amounting to £52,SS6, and surpluses of £42,807, making a net deficit of £10,079 on a .total stock of £117,071. It was advisable that the construction of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> should be reviewed, as, with the gift ships received from Great Britain, the Commonwealth would have more vessels than she would require. That is exactly what has occurred. Our Fleet is too expensive to keep in commission, so at present a big portion of it has been placed on the reserve. </para>

                        <para class="block">In the light of the Commission's report more than usual care and supervision should have been exercised concerning what  was  actually taking place. On this occasion there  seems to  have been  less  than usual. In view of the conditions, existing at the Cockatoo Island dockyard, it is quit© conceivable that something similar may transpire at any moment in any other public Department. It is particularly regrettable  at a  time like  the  present, when money is so difficult to obtain, and when productive undertakings are hampered owing to the absence of capital, that we should have proceeded with the construction of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> which is, we understand, already obsolete. We should, two years ago, have devoted attention to more productive works  and thus  proceeded in some more gradual method of finding employment for these men. </para>

The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> said that the great cost was largely due to the fact that the Department was constantly replacing obsolete portions of the ship. It is very necessary at this juncture that we should get full value for every expenditure', and there are many directions in which the capital employed could have been more profitably spent.

I wish at this moment to thank the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> for having moved for an extension of time to permit this important matter to be further discussed. Indeed, it is of such importance that it deserves an even longer period for debate than has been allotted.

                        <para>At a time when there is a tremendous amount of unemployment in Sydney, 1,600 or more men are suddenly thrown idle through what is admitted to have been a bungle; and the public naturally places blame and responsibility on the shoulders of the Government. Employees at Cockatoo Island have been rendered idle practically without notice, and without any provision having been made to absorb them in other avenues of employment. One would have thought, at any rate, that if it were deemed necessary to dispense with the services of so many men, engaged as they were in work of such importance, requisite steps would have been taken by the Government to see that those who were discharged were absorbed in other work. However, the Government appear to have made no effort to fulfil that obvious duty. The Treasurer says that some one has  blundered, but that he is not that person. He states that Parliament voted a certain amount of money, and that that vote having been expended, it was impossible to continue work. I do not agree that the Treasurer is taking up a proper attitude. He says he is not entitled to spend more money than has been authorized by Parliament. Parliament, when it passes an appropriation, does so on the basis of a message from the Governor-General. That message is the outcome of advice tendered by  His  Excellency's Ministers; and I suppose that in the particular matter of the allocation of moneys such advice usually comes from the Treasurer himself. It is quite possible that the right honorable, gentleman 'underestimated what was a proper amount of expenditure for the Department involved in the matter under debate. After all, it was only an estimate, and it was an estimate which this House had not the power to increase. Consequently, the responsibility - almost the sole responsibility - for the fact of the amount not being greater lies with the Treasurer himself. It may be that the amount recommended was too small. At all events, the sum was expended long before the financial year had ended. Assuming that a sufficient amount was asked for by and granted to the Treasurer, that Minister is. responsible in that ho has not kept proper supervision over the expenditure of the different Departments. It is quite new to me to learn that some particular officer can spend the whole of a vote long before the financial year has ended, and that the first thing a responsible Minister may know of the matter is that the money is all gone and a large number of men have had to be thrown out of employment. One would expect that either the Treasurer himself or the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> would have some system by which a report would be tendered, say, monthly, to the Minister direct, as to the progress of expenditure in relation to particular votes. The responsibility, to my mind, rests upon the Treasurer in the first place, either in that in the original estimate he did not calculate what was a proper amount to be allocated, and thus made his estimate too low, or that, having made his estimate on a proper footing, he did not insure adequate supervision by way of obtaining progress reports upon the expenditure of the amount in question. There should be some system. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking with some experience of administration when I say that the expenditure of particular Departments should be reviewed, for example, monthly. There should be some Minister directly responsible to this House who knows "the progress rate of expenditure in connexion with large votes in various Departments ; and the situation should never arise in which- it could be suddenly made known, in January or February of a financial year, that the whole of the year's vote had been expended, and a great industry dislocated, so that large numbers of men arc thrown upon an already glutted labour market. It should not be possible for that kind of thing to happen without some responsible Minister knowing what is coining. If it can happen, however, there is something wrong; and it is for thi3 Parliament to see that a system of administration is adopted which will enable the Treasurer, or the Prime Minister, or the responsible Minister - whoever he may be - to keep his hand upon the pulse of things and know, roughly at all events, the progress rate of expenditure on any and every particular vote. But because such a system has not been adopted and practised by the Government, this position has arisen, and honorable members have to listen to occupants of the front Treasury bench informing the House that they know nothing, about the , matter, but that some one has blundered. We have to listen to them saying, ""We knew nothing at all until we read about it in the papers, and until we found great unemployment and suffering among the women and children in Sydney." And yet, all that is to be done is to institute an inquiry to ascertain who is responsible. "Weeks hare passed, and no Minister can tell us to-day how -this trouble, came about. At the same time 60me secret investigation is going on. Who are the investigators ? What is the tribunal which has been set up to decide on whose shoulders the responsibility rests ? As far as Parliament is concerned it rests on the shoulders of one or other of the three or four Ministers. There appears to be divided responsibility in respect of control, and there are four Ministers involved, namely, the Treasurer, the Minister for the Navy, the Minister for Works and Railways, and the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton).</inline></para>

                                <para>- I have not suggested that; but that there should be some system by which the Treasurer would be able to secure information at regular intervals concerning the rate of expenditure of large votes, in different Departments. There should .never again be such a sorry situation as that which has now developed, wherein the Treasurer says, " The vote for Cockatoo Island was spent before I knew anything about it." And now he is chasing about the country with a secret board of inquiry to find the culprit. There is something radically wrong . </para>

                                <para>- It is quite a common thing for an estimate to be exceeded ; indeed, an estimate is never the exact amount spent. If it was desired that the manager should so distribute his expenditure as to make it cover a certain period, he should have been told so in definite language.

                                <para>- Yes, and many others. lt is a common occurrence. All who have been Ministers know that votes are often exceeded. Frequently an' amount double the estimate is spent. An estimate is not the absolute limit of expenditure. Consequently, responsibility for what has taken place in this case should not be thrust upon some subordinate who cannot come here to defend himself, and I hope that the House will see that that is not done. It would be disgraceful if,' because a thing of this sort happened through the ineptitude of Ministers, or the mistake of some one in the Government, a subordinate public servant should be made to suffer, and perhaps lose his position. </para>

I hope, too, that the Government will see that steps are taken to compensate those persons among the 1,600 men who have been dismissed, to whom the undertaking was given, although sometimes indefinite in form and not reduced to writing, that they would have continuous employment. I hope that they will be compensated, or that they will be given continuous employment. </para>

                            <para>. - This debate is disappointing to a great many of us who, from 1914 onwards, have fought continuously, and at last successfully, for the appointment of an expert Committee to investigate the administration of all the Departments. At that time the Naval Department was in a state of chaos, and the Economy Commission made it one of its first duties to investigate the administration of- that Department, and to frame recommendations concerning it. I should like to know from the Government whether those recommendations have' been carried into effect. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I have now only sufficient time to draw attention to -three point*. We have the allegations of honorable members opposite, and some admissions from the Government, which suggest that there is still a want of proper system in that Department. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has told us that the Department had a Treasury warrant authorizing the expenditure of £300,000, with the intimation that the money was to be spent throughout the whole financial year. Then all at once it was discovered that the whole sum had been spent in eight months. ^ The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird . Smith)</inline> says that he is endeavouring to discover who is to blame. Under a proper system of management that should be discovered in five minutes. A warrant authorizing expenditure goes from the 'Treasurer to the Minister, and from him to the Accountant of the Department, and there should be monthly reports and statements of balances in re- gard  .to the several works in hand. If that system had been observed, this unfortunate mistake should not have been made. It should not be difficult to discover who is responsible for the blunder that has occurred. Then it is alleged that material of a value running into very big figures is missing. With a proper system, such as is observed in every well-ordered business concern, that would be impossible. If the stores were properly controlled and issued, and, when issued, followed to their ultimate use, it could be seen at a glance whether an issue had been applied to the particular purpose for which it was" intended, and there would be a check against loss or misappropriation. </para>
                        <para>We were promised a proper costing system, and I should like the Minister to say whether such a system has been provided for. If it has not, I cannot understand the reason, nor can I understand how honorable members who have condemned this enterprise root and branch, now say that we can build ships as economically as they can be built elsewhere. We have been promised by Ministers half-yearly reports upon Government industrial enterprises. I hope that the Minister for .Shipbuilding <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> will soon, present his next half-yearly report, so that we may know just where we stand. It has .been claimed that shipbuilding has been a success during the past few years. We cannot form a proper opinion from the experience of abnormal times. The Minister has submitted reports and comparative statements, but I should like to have up-to-date information, because the country is being committed to an expenditure of many millions, and we should know where the money is going and whether we are getting 20s. of value for every £1 spent. This is not a party question. All honorable members should insist on proper and adequate returns at regular and short intervals. The Government should know each month what the progress df a work is, what the expenditure has been, and whether estimates are being exceeded. Without this close application we shall need to review the whole question again. I understand the Government to say that the investigation into these matters will be thorough, complete, and impartial. There is a departmental inquiry at present being conducted, but I take it that it is simply a preliminary inquiry to advise the Minister. I hoped that, without the intervention of this House, the Minister would have ordered a searching and independent inquiry. I await an assurance on the point, because I am watching public expenditure in this direction very keenly indeed. I know something about it, and I say , that this House should scrutinize continuously all these industrial enterprises carried on by the Government. Let me say that I hope that the Government will keep politics out of them. If a Government enterprise can succeed as well as an outside independent, enterprise, and it rarely does, it can only be when politics in every sense" are rigidly excluded from its operation. As soon as politics get in we have want' of discipline, chaos, and confusion, and it is rubbish to tell the world that, under such conditions, a Government can do the work as well as outside enterprise, where the best brains and the be3t experience that money can buy are applied to the management. </para>

                            <para>- In consequence of the existence in some parts of Australia of worm nodules in cattle, the British Government ever since 1911 have debarred the entry into England of forequarters of beef from Australia unless the brisket has been removed. This means the removal, including the shin, of approximately 90 lbs. of beef from each carcass. With a view to overcoming this disadvantage, and in the interests of Australian exporters, the 'Commonwealth Government some little time ago nominated a representative to approach the British Ministry of Health on the subject. Negotiations took place, and a modification of the absolute prohibition of the importation of brisket beef was suggested, but the Imperial Government's requirements in regard thereto were so stringent that, after discussing the position with meat exporters in the Commonwealth, it was unanimously decided that it would be better to submit to the embargo, and allow existing arrangements to continue. </para>

                        <para>.- The Tariff that will occupy the mind of this Parliament for some considerable time is unquestionably one of very serious importance. The whole incidence of the Tariff is, in my opinion, "totally unnecessary, except as an ordinary expedient to replenish the exchequer of an impecunious Government. It is one of those artificial stimulants that get a people " no forrader." I read in one of the newspapers recently a most interesting statement . to the effect that the Department of Trade and Customs was seriously perturbed because of the slackening . off of shipments from the Old Country, and the fact that the revenue was therefore falling below anticipations. Whether that newspaper report was wrong or not, I cannot say. </para>

                            <para>- The . revenue has increased very much, I admit ; but this statement appeared in the press, and I have not seen a contradiction of it. It was stated that because of a shortening of certain freights - because ships were not coming out fully freighted - the Department of Trade and Customs was much perturbed. I think, that is true, and the perturbation of the Department seems quite natural when it is recognised that this increased Tariff is designed to bring in more revenue. It would be a misnomer to ca 11 it Protection. It is the simplest and shortest cut to 'the supply of money to the exchequer. No one can soundly reason that the imposition of additional protective duties was necessary. This Tariff certainly has had the effect of increasing the cost of living to the whole of the people of Australia, and it is unnecessary now . that the war is over, since the war itself has given the industries of Australia an immensely increased measure of protection. Other countries which before the war had extremely cheap labour no longer have cheap labour. Wages in other countries have increased to such an extent as to afford us a very great deal . ofprotection.Increased freights to this country <inline font-style="italic">a.\*o</inline> constitute a big measure of protection, and the great increase in the price of coal in other lands is an immense protection to Australian manufacturers. Surely it will bc a  admh  ted that in these several respects considerable and ample protection is given to our manufacturers. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The putting of a Tariff of this kind on the key industries of Australia is having the effect of strangling more important ones. Euclid has taught us, among many useful principles, that the whole i3 greater than its part. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> since the imposition of this Tariff has had to recognise that fact in detail, and I submit that it applies all round. The honorable gentleman doubtless on appeal will be prepared to remove the duties on certain tools which are not made in Australia, and which are necessary to the manufacture of a greater instrument or piece of machinery such as an engine, which is more important than is the local manufacture of the tools necessary for its construction. In the interests of the greater he will be prepared to sacrifice to some extent the lesser. If the establishment of an industry here is being prevented by reason of the heavy duty imposed upon the machinery necessary to that industry he should be ready to remit that duty. The Minister has really conceded my point as shown by his practice and actions in respect of such matters. It will be admitted that the greatest of all Australian industries - an industry which accounts for 76 per cent, of the wealth of Australia -must be regarded from the aspect of the whole. Anything that would materially retard the progress of that whole is prejudicial to the interests of Australia. This leads me to the point that the Tariff which before the imposition of these duties was excessive is to-day absolutely burdensome to the primary producer. </para>
                    <para>It cannot be gainsaid that the primary production of Australia is the greatest asset which the country possesses. It is the only source from which new money may be obtained, to give stability to our national credit, and we cannot afford, therefore, to disregard its importance. We cannot shut our eyes to anything which is calculated to' hinder the increase of " our national wealth simply because our national responsibilities are increasing. But the effect of this new Tariff will be to inflict a further blow to the primary producer and generally to retard the progress of primary production in Australia. Of course, I know the cry which is always raised in regard to dumping. But, dumping or no dumping, the fact remains that a binder which was quoted at £80 . last year is quoted at £120 this year. It is very difficult to persuade the primary producer that he ought to pay the £40 increase which is there represented, especially as £S0 was easily double the price which he was called upon to pay for the same implement fifteen years ago. Nevertheless, by reason of the operation of the proposed new Tariff, the price of a binder has been increased by £40. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page.</inline> - That £40 does not represent the duty which is payable upon binders. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever the cause may be. the fact remains that to-day the farmer is compelled to pay for his binder £40 more than he paid previously, and that there is no way in which he can pass on this extra charge. We expect our primary producers to purchase costly made Australian machinery, and in this connexion I was very pleased to hear -the statement made by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> this afternoon. We are frequently told that no man is a good Australian who does not purchase Australian-made goods. But I cannot help remarking that quite a number of people' who claim to be good Australians, object to paying a reasonable price for Australian-grown wheat. Seeing that our primary producers are obliged to labour for seventy or eighty hours per week, whilst the employees in our cities and those who are engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements work only forty-four hours per week, the deal, I contend, is not a square one. I observe, too, that the press is seriously perturbed in regard to certain sales of Australian wheat which "have been made overseas. </para>

                    <para class="block">Whilst I "was with the  Deputy  Comptroller-General of Customs in Western Australia the other day,' a most remarkable incident occurred. A certain merchant, who was present, said to me: <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. Prowse,</inline> I should like to ask the  Deputy  Comptroller why there is an export duty upon flour." I replied, "If you do so you will ask a very foolish question, because there is no export duty upon flour." Thereupon he said, "I know a damned sight better." I answered, " Then you had better ask your question." He did so, and the  Deputy  Comptroller-General, after looking rather thoughtful, replied, "But there is no export duty upon flour. Would you mind explaining what you mean?" The merchant then said, " Well, only the other day a ship's captain, who comes here, ordered 10 tons of flour. As soon as he arrived at the wharf he was told that the flour had been kept for him." "Oh, thank you," he said. "What is the price?" He was told that the price was £18 per ton for the wheat and £16 a ton premium, making a total of £34 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member got into the Wheat Pool. The  Deputy  Comptroller of Customs was quite in the dark as to how such a thing could have occurred, but in a flash the explanation came to me. That explanation was that in February of the previous year the representatives of the various States, with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> conferred with the Australian Wheat Board, and notwithstanding that the value of wheat at the time was 8s. 3d. per bushel, they entered into an arrangement under which wheat for Australian consumption was to be sold at 73. Sd. per bushel. That was the concession which was made by one class to all other classes of the community. Immediately afterwards the price of wheat rose to nearly double that specified in the contract. For local consumption flour was thus sold upon the basis of 7s. 8d. per bushel for wheat, or £18 per ton, whilst the price outside Australia was £34. The farmers thus made a concession to Australian consumers of £16 per ton. Late last year that contract ended. The States representatives were called together to confer with the Prime Minister as to the quantity of wheat needed for local consumption for the ensuing year. It was computed that the quantity needed would be something in the region of 30,000,000 bushels, and they asked the Wheat Board again at what price they " could supply 30,000,000 or 33,000,000 bushels. Just a few days prior, the Board had sold something like 300,000 tons f.o.b. in Australia at 10s. 6d. per bushel; but, as this was  a  decent order, their quotation  was  below ' the market price - 9s. a bushel. It was a concession at the time; nobody knew any more than was known in the previous year whether wheat would rise or fall. Can any honorable member who is a sport, or professes tj be straight, say that the contract should not be carried out? </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the principle of the integrity of agreements will always apply.. The fact is that some £13,000,000 has been conceded to the consumers' of Australia by the producers. With regard to the second 9s. deal, there has been a .certain fall, checked somewhat by the fall in freights ; but, after all, if I understand rightly, it was intimated by the Prime Minister to-day that, if the balance of the wheat was sold at 7s. 6d. now, the average price of the whole of Australia's wheat, with the local consumption thrown in, would be in the region of 8s. 6d. Are the consumers to take the " ups " and not the " downs " in the deals ? I have not been in the habit, after buying a suit of clothes, of returning it to the tailor -when it becomes half worn; nor is it possible for me to buy a horse and return it to the seller if it gets a nail in its foot. In both contracts, taken together, the advantage must be in favour of the consumer. If the consumers of Australia desire to review the matter, and are willing to review last year's contract, and give as the market price for what they had from us under the last contract, I venture to think the Wheat Board, on behalf of the growers, would agree and give the difference on the present year's deal. </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing out how these matters affect Australia very seriously. We have fearful congestion  of population in consequence of the centralization policy in Australia. Nearly the whole of this sitting has been taken up in considering the case of men who are out of employment in another State. Loss of employment, is a serious thing, but we ought not to continue the spoon-feeding of one section of the community - we should not artificially build up, by means of the Tariff, factories in the centralized portions of Australia, which is naturally a primary producing country; for if we do we shall simply "kill the goose that lays the golden egg." After all, Australia, for the greater part, is manufacturing for those people who are primary producers; and if we make it impossible for the primary producers to compete with other parts of the world by increasing the cost of their machinery they will have to cease producing, and where then, I ask, will the manufacturer find himself? </para>

                    <para>If we are going to put loads on the backs and shackles on the feet of the primary producers, how are they to compete with other countries ? Under such circumstances the primary producers must come to the cities, which offer more attractions than the producing centres. Amongst the attractions are the limited hours of work, and the organization of employees and capitalists, who both cry out for cheap butter, cheap meat, and cheap wheat. The man on the land has to work from sixty to eighty hours a week; and is then asked to supply his produce at a cheaper price than it can be obtained, even, under tender, from any part of the world. This is not a square deal - it is not fair - and the time is coming when the levelling up must take place. It is the "maggot in the cheese" business; but the day is coming. We have only to look at statistics to see that the effect of Australian legislation, so far, has been to make the cities so attractive that not only has the whole increase in the population during the last twenty years gone into the cities, but people are actually drawn there from the country. It is evident that there is something wanting in the attractiveness of the country life. Can any honorable member, whether he be from the city or the country, say for one moment that it is not in the interests of Australia that the whole of the country's natural resources should be developed in order to create the wealth necessary to meet our national obligations? </para>

Countries like Canada and America are making the country more attractive by removing Tariff imposts from agricultural industries, because it has been seen that unless something of the kind is done, the people find their way into New York and other large cities. The future <inline font-style="italic">qf</inline> Australia depends on the development of her soil; and, to again quote <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rider</inline> Haggard, prosperity will follow the feet that tread the . fields, rather; than those that trip along the pavements. U other countries have been able to encourage immigration by the attractiveness of their land policy, Australia should be able to do the same. The other day one honorable member told me that he knew of a million acres of excellent land available in his own State. I know of another million odd acres in another State, all ,good land ; but it seems to me that with the power centralized in the various capitals of Australia, we are going round in a vicious circle, and no encouragement is given to people' to occupy these spaces. The people in the cities seem to think they are the only pebbles on the beach, that they can pay the national debt if only they can cut down the other fellow a little bit, and so long as the rural producer can afford, by working eighty hours a week, to buy from them. Yon cannot get over the Tariff wall which this Government is seeking now to build up, and look elsewhere for your trade, because you will then find yourself in competition with the producers of other parts of the world. In hitting the primary producer, you are killing your only customer. You should facilitate his operations and allow him to get ahead of you a hit if you expect to continue trade with him on legitimate lines. You should give him a fair deal because he is a brother of yours, and you should not expect to feed upon him. </para>

The leading papers of this city to-day are battling to get the wheat from the small, as well as the big, farmer in order to provide cheap bread for people. I think the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was quite right, in his statement the other . day in connexion with the proposed reduction of the 9s. guarantee for wheat. " The States," he said, "can do that if they like, because the wheat is theirs." It is all very fine to say that with the other fellow's property. You cut it down last year and saved £,11,000,000 on the transaction. It is yours now, this 30,000,000 bushels, and if you like to provide cheaper bread cut down the price. All I can say is that it is not going to be done at ,the sole expense of the producers. It was done last year; but now, if the producers are to get a fair deal, it must be done at the national expense. </para>

                            <para>- l'f the honorable member for West Sydney would like my view to be stated more clearly, I would point to the statesman-like attitude of the British Government in similar circumstances. They recognised that the agriculturist was entitled to get the market price for his wheat. Accordingly, they paid him market prices, and the wheat then belonged to the British Government. They said - ' ' It is ours now, but the price for bread is rather high." They accordingly reduced the price to make the position easier for the consumer, and I believe placed £50,000,000 on the Estimates to cover the loss. That policy was not given effect to at the expense of the agriculturist, because he sold his commodity at the proper market price, and then bore his share of the loss equally with other citizens of the Mother Country. In Australia last year the entire burden was borne by the producer, for instead of getting the market price for his wheat, it was cut down to the extent of £11,000,000. It is unfair to ask any returned soldier who has been put upon the land to grow wheat to make a contribution to the Commonwealth in the form of cheaper wheat for home consumption. The thing is absurd. There is nothing statesman-like about i,t; but, nevertheless, that is what has been done in the past, and that is what the leading press are seeking to do again. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry it is necessary to reply to that absurd interjection. During the war, owing to the lack of attractiveness in wheat-growing, the Australian producers reduced the area under cultivation by 4,000,000 acres, and in order to save the country - not to save the wheat-growers - they were given a guarantee by the various Governments of the Commonwealth. They never asked for one farthing either from State or Commonwealth Government. All that was done for them was returned with interest, and, therefore, it is absurd for any honorable member now to twit us with what was done for the farmer during the war period. </para>

                    <para>It is claimed now that the farmer must provide cheap food for a White Australia, and buy White Australian machinery manufactured under a high Tariff, with no Tariff upon wheat, and we do not ask for it. Give the producers as much as you pay to any one else. Call tenders for the wheat if you like, and let the Australian producer be a tenderer. Do not buy his wheat unless it is cheaper than the price at which it can be got elsewhere. That is all we are asking for, and that will be a fair deal. You will have to get over this little fence before you can induce me to vote for 35 or 40 per cent. Tariff on my machinery. You talk about defence. What greater defence can we possibly have than a robust rural population ? Nature makes it so. As a matter of fact, no country is strong without a great rural population. Look at the abnormal condition of Australia. It has no counterpart in the world, civilized or uncivilized. Twelve per cent, of the population of England live in London, which is not only the capital of the United Kingdom, but practically the capital of the world; 4 per cent, of the population of France live in Paris ; 2 per cent, of the population of Germany in Berlin; and 1.75 per cent, of the population of Russia in- Petrograd; while 50 per cent, of the population of the State of Victoria live in Melbourne. If we were only a manufacturing country there might be some justification for this centralization, but we are a producing country. By forcing people to carry food from where it is produced for consumption in the cities, we are adding to the costliness of living. There is a tendency to create artificiality, which not only increases the cost of living, but also weakens the nation. Through our centralizing policy we cannot establish factories in . healthy surroundings in country districts where facilities offer, and where the food can be produced to feed the workers in those establishments without heavy handling costs. Under existing circumstances, nothing can be done in Australia unless the food* is carted to Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, or Perth, at great expense, thus adding to the costliness of living; while burdens are heaped upon the man who has to grow it in competition' with cheap labour elsewhere. </para>

No. It shows the inconsistency of men who talk about decentralization when we find that they hold their annual shows in Sydney and Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- I did not hear the honorable member for Swan denouncing the Government for selling wheat cheaply to Germany, but if they sold it cheaply to the Australian people, to the people who provide the money for building the railroads which enable the farmers to go to the country and send their produce to market, it would be a different story. We have not heard a word . to-night from the, Farmers' party against the Government selling the wheat cheaply to Germany. </para>

The honorable member for Swan claims that Australia is not a manufacturing country. Why is that so? It is because for too long we have been relying upon imports from- other countries. The time has come for .this Parliament to" take steps to make it a manufacturing country. The honorable member talks about drawing men from the country districts to the cities. Surely the men who come from the country districts to the cities have intelligence enough to know which are the better places, and when they find that the cities provide them with facilities for amusement, why should they bury themselves in the country for the sake of populating Australia when we are producing more food than we. can consume? </para>

To help them to do what? To produce more, and have a glut of produce which they cannot get away ? They want free implements, but so far as I am concerned, they will not get them. </para>

                            <para>- They are built in the country now, or parts of them are. The honorable member will not deny that engines for those ships are being built in Castlemaine. Ships have been built at Williamstown and Walsh Island with a view to carrying Australian produce to the markets of the world. Had it not been for the shipping policy of the Government, which has helped to get our produce away, the farmers would have been in a very bad way indeed. One honorable member complained about the Government's shipping policy, and spoke about the virtues of private enterprise. Where was private enterprise during the war in Australia so far as shipping was concerned? If the Government had not taken the shipping over, the farmers  would have been the sufferers. The same honorable member demanded freedom to do this and that. I heard that yarn when it was desired to introduce cheap labour such as Chinese and Indians. </para>

                        <para>.- If, as the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> interjects, the address to which we have just listened is a fair sample of a protectionist speech, then this so-called Free Trade party in the corner has not very much to fear. The debate so far has been conducted in a somewhat loose and frivolous manner. We are dealing to-night with principles of vital interest to the people of the Commonwealth, and, so far as this Tariff is concerned, of particularly vital interest to the primary producers. I have wondered what is the object of this good, solid lump of a Tariff. What is behind it all? </para>

A sound and fair form of taxation means the taxation of all for the benefit, of all, but taxation through the Customs means the taxation of all for the benefit of a few. I still ask, "What is behind this Tariff." In introducing it, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> quoted the following passage from the Prime Minister's policy speech at Bendigo :  - </para>

                            <para>- If the Government were dependent oh my support, they would not occupy, the Treasury bench very long. I have made no secret of the fact that in season and out of season' I am going to do my best to shift them from where they are. I do not go behind their back and stab them when I make that statement. The Minister reiterated throughout his speech, and gave quotations intended to prove, that the Tariff would have the effect of cheapening tools of trade, particularly those used in primary production.. He quoted figures as to the price of machinery in the Argentine and New Zealand in order to support his contention. I hope that when he is replying he will answer the query which I now intend to put to him. Today the manufacturers of farm implements in this country are advertising, spending money, and conducting propaganda which are costing a good deal of money, in support of this Tariff. They are pleased with it. But if its ultimate result is to be to cheapen the. price of what they produce, surely the Minister does not mean to tell me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay and other farm machinery manufacturers are joining him in a campaign to reduce the price of farming machinery ? </para>

                            <para>- The old-time cry was, " Put on a little duty to enable us to start a factory so that we can get upon our feet," but the whole history of the Tariff has been one of steady increase, each Tariff higher and still higher than the last. As the business and . the factories of these people outside grow, so does the Tariff grow, and always in the one direction. In the first place, they ask for a Tariff to enable them to become  established, and the more soundly established they become the more insatiable is their appetite for higher duties. Is not the stock argument of the Protectionist that it is unfair to expect white men to compete with cheap coloured labour? </para>

Our primary producers are competing in the world's market to-day, and have been doing so for many years, against the black grown wheat of India, and the wheat grown with the cheap Spanish labour of the Argentine, and the ignorant peasant labour of Russia, and, in addition, are being charged the highest shipping freights in the world. They have to sell their wheat, not only over seas, but also within Protectionist Australia, at black labour rates, and some honorable members on the Opposition side would deny them even those prices. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and this Tariff will enable him to get a little more than 1]e, could in the- past. The poor struggling manufacturer, whom honorable members are so desirous of protecting, although he is getting cheaper coal, cheaper steel, and cheaper labour than can be obtained by any of his competitors in the outside world, does not fix the price of his commodity at what he can get in the world's market. He does not believe in competing in the world's market; he desires the creation of an artificial market in Australia, and he sells, not at the cost of production plus a fair profit, but at the price at which his overseas competitors can land their goods. If we impose an extra duty of £20 or £30 upon a machine, up goes the price, and organized labour goes to the Wage? Board or the Arbitration Court for a share of the spoils. </para>

                            <para>- I will make my speech in my own way, and will not be sidetracked by any honorable member. The Australian manufacturer fixes the price of his product at the import value. If the primary producer were to fix the price of what he has to sell upon the same basis, what would bc the price of wheat in Australia to-day? The price of wheat is, roughly, from 9s. to 10s. per bushel in the markets of the world. We will calculate it at the low price of 9s. in London. Upon wheat imported into Australia there is a duty, which, so far as I am concerned, may be struck out, for it never operates except in time of drought, as in the years 1902 and 1914, and then it is suspended so that it cannot operate. That is- what the Australian wheat-grower is getting from this grand policy of Protection. Take the price of wheat in London at 9s. per bushel, allow 2s. for freight, 2s. for duty, and ls, for insurance, wharfage rates and like charges, and the import value of wheat to-day becomes 14s. per bushel. If I had my way, I would- fix tie price of what I had- to sell upon the same basis as that upon which the Australian manufacturer fixes the price of the machinery which I use- in growing in,y wheat". If that were done, the present price of wheat in Australia would be 14s. per bushel. But what the high priests of Protection desire is that the farmer should purchase from the rest of the community everything he needs at Protectionist prices, and feed the community with primary products at black labour rates. I could take these champions of the working class, these staunch advocates of the eight-hours system, into many country districts and prove to them that there were men and women working eight hours - yes, but eight hours before noon and eight hours after noon. </para>

                    <para>Reference has been made by interjection to the price of 9 s. per bushel for wheat. "What is the price of a 4-lb. loaf in Australia to-day? It is sold at from ls.1d. to ls. 3d. per loaf, and the average is, therefore, ls. 2d. Honorable members opposite are blaming the farmers, who are the producers of wheat, for the excessive price of bread. Do they know how much wheat there is in a 4-lb. loaf, or what the farmer actually gets out of it? Can any of these so-called experts, who know so much concerning the production of wheat, give that information? There is no answer, because they know that to them it is a difficult question. I shall tell them- </para>

If the Australian wheat-growers grew wheat and gave it to the millers free of cost, the consumers would still be charged 7d. for a 4-lb. loaf, Honorable members opposite cannot have high wages, and short hours for the mill hands, neither can there be high profits for the millers if there is to be a cheap loaf. They cannot have a baker in North Melbourne delivering bread in South Melbourne, or a baker in South Melbourne delivering bread in North Melbourne, and expect cheap bread. They know it is impossible to have numerous drivers, employed at high rates of wages for comparatively short hours, chasing each other around the suburban areas, and at the same time have cheap bread. </para>

                        <para>- Order! I have asked that interjections be discontinued, and that the honorable member be allowed to proceed. The debate on the Tariff is different to the discussion on other matters, as there is no time limitation, and every honorable member will have an opportunity of speaking fully to the question, and will be able to express his views as often as he desires. In these circumstances I appeal to honorable members to allow the honorable member addressing the Chair to state his ease without interruption, because interjections ultimately lead to disorder, which is very undesirable. </para>

                            <para>- I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> and hope that the time which has been occupied by your speech will not be recorded against me. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> in introducing the Tariff, made a calculation concerning the extra population that we would have in Australia if all the iron and steel used in the Commonwealth were smelted locally, and said that if this were done our population would be increased by 300,000. In his search for arguments to bolster up this rotten policy he began to give a list - it is too long to read, but I will quote it if desired - of the main primary products we use, and endeavoured in some mysterious way to connect the consumption of our primary products, locally with the prosperity of the farmers. In his opinion, the quantity of wheat that these 300,000 people would consume would be 1,600,000 bushels. In his speech he advanced, the well-known Protectionist argument that the local market- was the best of all markets. If the Australian primary producers were able to fix the price of what they had to sell on the same basis that the Australian manufacturer fixes, the price of what he has to sell, that is a price far above the world's market price, there would be something in his argument. </para>

                    </continue><para class="block">What does it matter to the average wheat-grower in Australia where his wheat is consumed if he is only to receive a certain price. What does it matter whether the wheat I grow is consumed in Melbourne </para><para>Or in London if I receive only 7s. or Ss. per bushel. That is a definite answer to the oft-repeated statement concerning the local market. If the primary producer is given the right to charge above the world's parity, I admit the local market is the better of the two. But the local markets are of no use to us if we are not going to receive a higher price for what we have to sell. During the war the position may have been different, but we are now living in normal times. ' I do not know what the average price of wheat will be this year ; but if some honorable members iu this Chamber had their way, God knows how low it would be ! As a basis of calculation, we can take the average price for local consumption, which last year was 7s. Sd. per bushel, and the average price received throughout the whole year, averaging the overseas price from January to December, was approximately 12s. per bushel, or a difference of over 4s. a bushel. If we had had the additional 300,000 people to which the Minister for Trade and Customs referred, they would have consumed on 'his figures 1,600,000 bushels of wheat. In other words, we would have lost 4s. per bushel on this extra 1,600^000, making a total loss of more than £300,000. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yes; they are very staunch Protectionists, because, through organization, they are in the happy position of being able to do what the Australian manufacturer does. Although during the war they voluntarily sold their dried fruits in Australia at a price far below the world's market price, in normal times the policy of . Protection benefits them. I would like to see the same situation applied to all the primary producers. If I had my way I would organize them and take the same right - the same right as is demanded for the Australian manufacturer. </para>

                    </continue><para>I have made reference to the " cut " that organized labour is going 'to get out of the Tariff. I can quite understand honorable! members opposite going " bald-headed " for Protection. If I represented a city constituency I might be " all out" for a high Tariff also. I wish to refer to the position in which organized labour finds itself in connexion with the Tariff, particularly in respect of the wages paid to labourers employed in' machinery-making in Victoria. The wage rates are fixed under the present Wages Board system.. That system has treated the Victorian workers very well, for the reason that the tendency of all awards has been ever upwards. I do not say, of course, that that tendency should have been in any other direction. But I have never yet heard of a Wages Board being called together to consider a reduction of wages or increase of hours.. I have that in mind when I state that the system has treated the Victorian worker very well. But while the worker is on a good wicket, the implement maker is on an even better wicket- Like the man who plays " two-up " with a double-headed penny, he cannot lose. If his employees go for an increase of ls. 6d. per day, and he is able to resist the claim, the victory is obviously his. But if the workers get their ls. 6d., does the manufacturer pay it? Not at all. He immediately calls in his . old price-lists and issues fresh ones to his country agents, in which he promptly passes the burden of the increased wage-sheet to the poor old back-bone of the country. If we could put <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> or Id. or 2d. on to the price of our wheat to meet this extra charge we " would be in the happy position of having joined the great family of those who are engaged in the modern economic pastime of passing it on; but we cannot do so. When the manufacturer increases the price of his product in.  order to cover an addition to his costs, amounting to 1 per cent,or11/2  per  cent., he puts on 21/2 per cent., or 8 per cent., or 5 per cent. So the game goes on ; organized labour cutting at organized capital on the principle that the profits made in an industry can stand higher wages, and organized' capital always retreating and putting it on to some one else. In the policy of the party to which I belong there is specific reference to the Fanners' fiscal plank in regard to tools of trade - " Tools of. trade used in  primary  production made within the British Empire." That plank is there simply because we  are  asked to compete in the world's market; and, since  we  are compelled, to. sell our products in the world's market,  we  ask for the privilege of purchasing our tools of trade also in the world's market Now, I said that I would give some of these persistent interjectors my fiscal creed, and I shall do so. But as the hour  is  late, I should be glad to be allowed to continue my speech to-morrow. </para><para class="block">Progress reported. </para></speech>
