                    <para>- An honorable member has complained to me that in the course of a speech made by another honorable member certain passages were read from a letter which reflected on him personally, in a manner which the  speaker  would not have been allowed to do in the course of his own remarks. The rule of Parliament is that a member must not quote from documents, newspapers or letters, passages which reflect upon any other member of the House, or statements which he could not make in a speech. Were that not the rule, the practical effect of the quotation of such passages would be to allow some one, who was not a member of the House, to express in this Chamber opinions about a member which another member of the House would not be allowed to utter. With the concurrence of the House, I propose that, when matter of the kind complained of inadvertently gets into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I should instruct the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to eliminate it, because it would be grossly unfair to an honorable member to allow him to suffer under such circumstances. </para>

That is a proposal to which we cannot agree <inline font-style="italic">con amore,</inline> and we ask the Committee to refuse to comply with both requests, but we intend to bring in a Bill to increase the salary of the Senate&#39;s official.

                    <para>.- In order that we may judge fairly the proposal submitted to the House, and estimate the wonderful advantages that it may yield to Australia, it is necessary to briefly review the history of wireless in Australia, and to expose the bungling that has taken place from its inception in 1911 until the present time. In 1911, the Commonwealth Government decided to erect wireless stations in Australia, and a contract was let for the establishment of one station at Pennant Hills, Sydney, and another at Fremantle. As an instance of the remarkable workings of the Postal Department, a piece of ground at Pennant Hills, comprising 40 acres, and covered with bush and scrub, was selected. A firm in Sydney offered to grub and clear the ground, and pay the Department &#163;250 for the timber thereon, but the Department carried out the clearing for itself, at an ultimate cost to the Government of &#163;4,000, including the cost of erecting two small buildings. Then it was decided to manufacture wireless apparatus in Australia, and, whilst the suggestion was a good one, and whilst the work put into the locally-produced wireless gear has been of an excellent character, the designing of it has been faulty from start to finish. We endeavoured to make gear that did <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> infringe any of the master patents that were in existence throughout the world, and in that way the efficiency of the service has been jeopardized, and the country has not received that advantage from wireless that it should have derived. When the Government of the day decided to make wireless sets in Australia, the works at Randwick belonging to the late Father Shaw were selected for that purpose. Notwithstanding that officers were appointed by the Government to supervise the construction of those plants, the Government departed from the recommendations of their own officials; designs that were condemned by their experts were accepted and sent by them to different stations. For instance, a plant was installed at Mount Gambier that had been condemned three times by the engineer of the Department, and yet people wonder why that station did not work effectively for ten months. In addition to that, the Shaw works imported rotary converters from America, substituted their own name-plates for the American nameplates, and in this way endeavoured to prove to the people of Australia that they were manufacturing certain wireless gear in this country, when, in reality, they were not doing so. This sort of thing has been continuing ever since wireless has been in existence in Australia. It has never had a fair chance, although if there is one science that can be applied to the development of industry in the Commonwealth it is wireless telegraphy. I come now to the time when the Shaw Wireless Works at Randwick were purchased by the Government for &#163;50,000. Any one who is familiar with those works knows that the Commonwealth paid through the nose for them ; in my opinion we paid at least 50 per cent. more than the works were worth. </para>

                    <para>- Under the Balsillie <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> a great deal of bungling took place, for, apart from the things I have mentioned, the- officers were badly selected. Wireless is a science that needs close study, but the men selected to operate it were mainly mechanics from the telephone department, who had never handled wireless apparatus, and had no training or experience in connexion with it. Yet men like that were expected to make a success of the system. At the inception of the war the Navy Department took over wireless communication from the Postal Department, and confusion became worse confounded. Public money was poured into the gutters, figuratively speaking, and it was heartbreaking to those officers in the Department, who were enthusiastic in their work, to see the waste that took place. The Navy Department insisted on making receiving apparatus and supplying sets to every wireless station in Australia. These sets cost thousands of pounds, and they would do anything but receive messages. Our alleged experts, who designed them, thought they could do things that Marconi and the Telefunken Company and other big wireless concerns had been trying without success for years to do, namely, to produce receivers that would receive over a wide range of waves. So bad were these sets that the operators preferred to take their own detectors into the stations, rather than use those supplied by the Navy Department. </para>

                        <para>- Some of them. Quite recently, before the control of wireless was transferred back to the Postal Department, the authorities decided to provide a safeguard against a breakdown of the plant at Pennant Hills, and paid the Railways Commissioners in Sydney &#163;6,000 to run an electric main out to the wireless station, apart from the cost of the installation of extra gear, although a duplicate plant could have been bought for &#163;800. </para>

I placed upon the notice-paper a motion for the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the waste of public money in connexion with wireless, and to prove the incompetence of the officers who were controlling the Department. I have asked many questions in this House concerning wireless mismanagement, and the replies, in practically every instance, appeared to have been drafted with the object of deceiving the House. On one day I placed upon the business-paper sixteen questions, not one of which was answered correctly. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, who was the Minister for the Navy at the time, asked me if the questions were satisfactory, I told him that they were entirely satisfactory, having regard to my notice of motion, which was on the business-paper, because I could prove by them that the officers who had drafted such replies were not reliable. </para>

                        <para>- Ministers have to rely upon the answers given to them by the Departmental officers. I could talk on the history of wireless in this country for hours, but as time is pressing I must be brief, and come to the proposition that is now before the House. Both the Department of the Navy and the. Postal Department have mishandled wireless ever since its inception in Australia. If a person goes into any post-office in Australia, apart from the General Post </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Offices, and tries <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> send a wireless message to any ship along the Australian coast, he creates immediate consternation. No radio forms are to-be . found. The officers do not know what are the rates to be charged, and they cannot say whether any boat on the coast is in wireless communication with the mainland. There is no progressive country in the world in which wireless has been retarded as it has been in Australia. If the control were in the hands of a company wireless would be boosted, and placards would be posted inviting the public to utilize wireless. But the Department never thinks of advertising. I may mention one instance which shows the attitude of the Postal Department towards any officers who show any enthusiasm in their work. A lineman saw that by using ends of wire which he cut off, the Department could be saved a few thousands of pounds per annum. He made a suggestion to his foreman, who reported it to the supervising engineer. He in turn forwarded it to the engineer for the State, and it was referred to a Board. The Board approved of the suggestion, and recommended that the lineman be paid &#163;5 for it. Then the Chief Electrician in New South Wales was called upon to report as to why this idea had never been thought of before. Here is another instance of the wonderful working of the Department. There are wireless stations at Darwin and Townsville and in Papua. Regulations were issued providing that wireless messages from one land station to another must be sent through the nearest station. But if a man at Darwin desires to send a wireless message to Papua, notwithstanding that- the stations at Darwin and Papua can communicate direct, that message must; according to the regulations, be sent on the land line to Adelaide, thence through Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Townsville, whence it is transmitted by wireless to Papua. The reason for this round-about procedure is that Townsville is a little nearer to Papua than is Darwin. </para>

                        <para>- He is not a Minister now, but was controlling the Post and Telegraph Department. We have been asking for some time how much longer it will be before any advance is made with this science. Numerous requests have been made for an up-to-date system, and business people, particularly, are anxious, to have a more efficient  means  of carrying on their International transactions. It was announced in the press quite recently that a message had been received from Europe in one-fifteenth of a second. The speed at which a message travels is 186,000 miles a second, and although communications are transmitted over .long distances with such rapidity it took the Post and Telegraph Department five hours to send the same message from Melbourne to Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- With an up-to-date wireless service Australia would be able to keep in line with other progressive nations; we would be able to gather and distribute press news, and such, a service would also be of material assistance to business people. This is an excellent means of applying science to industry, and as that policy . has been advocated from time to time it is the duty of the Government to act when the. opportunity offers. I believe that the first proposition mentioned in this connexion is the most .favorable. The second relates to the Radio Communication Company Limited of London, and if the books of that company are investigated, it will  be- found that every one associated with its directorate is connected with existing cable companies. It is obvious, there-  fore, that the object is to delay wireless coming into competition with cable  services. </para>

                        <para>- The Radio Communication Company Limited. The British Government, some time ago,, appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Norman to make investigations, and he submitted a scheme to the Imperial Government.  In 1914&#39;, before the outbreak of war, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Norman got into touch with von Lepel,  of Germany, with the idea of bringing the von Lepel system into the Imperial wireless chain, and even at the outbreak of hostilities we found <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Norman in communication with, von Lepel. to ascertain whether he was to be mobilized for service with the German Army, or, if not, would he come to Westminster and meet the directors of the Radio Communication Com,pany Limited. If we are to achieve success we must have expert officers con-&#39; versant with the most modern practice, which, unfortunately, we have not at present. The policy of the Government appears to be to discourage efficiency, and grant promotion and preference on the basis of seniority. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, right through the Service. An officer displaying ability and initiative does not receive consideration at the hands of the head of the Department; and, even if he submits valuable suggestions, they are not considered, because the departmental head is always afraid of being displaced. Australia &#34;occupies an isolated position. There is no country in the world that is in greater need of up-to-date wireless communication, bub notwithstanding this it appears to have been the policy of past Governments to staff the Department with men who knew very little concerning the most modern practice. Objection has been raised by some honorable members concerning the directors of the company, and the share the Government will have in. its control. </para>

                        <para>- I have inspected the. plant, which is the largest in Australia, but I could not express an opinion as to its worth without examining it very closely. The longer we delay a. settlement of this question the more difficult it will be to have allotted to us a wave length that will give an efficient service. Long-distance messages are transmitted most successfully on a wave of between 10,000 and 20,000 metres, and the longer we wait the greater the difficulty will become. Three years ago we could have had almost any wave length, but to-day we are being surrounded by stations in the Pacific. America has five there; Japan has recently completed one station, and has another in course of construction. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say at the moment. In Java, at present, a high-power station is being erected to permit of direct communication with Holland. America is erecting a high-power station at Shanghai, and France is about to construct one at Raratonga and in FrenchIndoChina. Time does not permit me to deal with the wonders achieved by wireless, or to refer in detail to the efficient means of communication which were established to assist the Army on the Western and other Fronts. When an Army was stationary, the cable and telegraphic system proved efficient, but when the troops were scattered and on the march, nothing could compete with the wireless telegraphic system. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Australia received high-power messages from Berlin, from which point despatches were daily transmitted throughout the war. On a number of the battle fronts we received the news of the world. Our men were able to keep themselves in touch with the new*  with the aid of little pack sets, distributed among the &#34;. diggers &#34; themselves. We in Australia may be likened to a dumb man, who has his sense of hearing, but cannot reply to any one who may speak to him. For many years this continent has been in that one-sided position, while other countries have equipped themselves both to hear and to answer. I trust that this House will consider the proposition solely on its merits, and will &#34;give its approval to the scheme under review. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am . pleased that the Prime Minister has agreed that the wireless proposition shall be referred to a Committee for investigation and report. I trust that, in the best interests of Australia - both city and country - the Committee will insist upon the fullest probing of the whole subject, and ascertain without doubt which system among those offered is the best. I have been informed that the original scheme which was sought_ to be established in this country, if it had been carried out in its entirety, would have been scrapped before to-day. The Marconi interests have learned that they made a mistake in connexion with ,some of the wireless stations which they erected around the coast of Great Britain and Europe. When wireless was inaugurated in England, under the control . of the Imperial &#39; Postal authorities, I made myself acquainted with the subject through my close personal association with the then Commonwealth Postmaster-General, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer,</inline> who was an enthusiast in the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr&#39;. Frazer</inline> was to some extent responsible for the erection of a station at Epping, in New South Wales, and in encouraging the late Father Shaw to erect his wireless plant at Randwick. Father Shaw, I might add, was a wealthy mau before he set out upon <inline font-weight="bold">Ms experiments,</inline> but he died comparatively poor because of his efforts to establish wireless communication between Australia and the outside world. I strongly oppose the suggestion to permit private enterprise to control or maintain any interest in Commonwealth wireless activities. If tHere is one national service which should be entirely in the hands of the Government, it is wireless communication. Much of the matter which passes to and from the wire* less stations - and&#34; this applies most particularly in time of war - is of an urgent, secret nature,- and Government servants alone should control the whole business. In my view, the same should apply to our cable systems. It was originally intended, when the cables ,were laid in order that Australia might be brought into immediate touch with other countries, that the Government should possess sole authority. To-day, however, the public of Australia get really a very poor service by means of the submarine cables. Much of the news sent to us from the other side of the world is valueless. Too much of the space devoted to cable messages in the daily press consists of trash - choice tit-bits, for example, about the matrimonial infelicities of British aristocrats. It was never intended that the cable highways should be congested with such rot. </para>

                <para>I cannot help feeling that the private interests at present associated with the wireless scheme which the Government are asked to take up as part shareholders are anxious to draw the Government in because they fear they will not be able to carry on financially. With the Government behind them, these private interests would be able to fall back upon public money to compensate them in the event of loss, and remunerate them for what they have already put into the proposition. I object to the Prime Minister being given a free hand. There should be the closest scrutiny by a Committee of the Federal Parliament. There is no Commonwealth Treasurer to-day, and we know that the Prime Minister is absolutely reckless in his handling of public funds. The people interested in the wireless scheme have .got on the right side of the right honorable gentleman. He has lost his cautious balance, largely due, no doubt, to insidious propaganda carried on by friends&#39; of the Marconi system - lords and dukes, and the like - while the Prime Minister was in England. It would be fatal to the best interests of the Commonwealth if the right honorable gentleman were permitted to go ahead without check.  His  common sense and his usual able control of public affairs have been undermined. I do not suggest, of course,1 that there has been anything in the nature of questionable influence brought to bear on  him. But I know that the Marconi interests are not above that sort of thing. The Prime Minister would like to mesmerize honorable members with his persuasive voice and his flailing arms; but the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has saved the country, possibly, from a financial mistake by insisting upon a close investigation by a specially appointed Committee. </para>
                <para>When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer</inline> was Postmaster-General, at the time of the erection of the wireless station at Epping, I visited the place in his company, and took a keen interest in the subject, as my father had had some connexion with electrical matters. After the station had been established the Commonwealth naval experts advised that the Marconi system was not the best that could be installed. They expressed the view that the Telefunken system was better - that it was a more easily understood method, and was not so complicated, generally. Further, it was held by those experts that the Marconi system could only be employed over the city of Sydney at night-time, whereas, with the Telefunken installed, the station could carry on through every hour of the twenty-four. Honorable members will, perhaps, remember the Marconi scandal in England. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Godfrey</inline> Isaacs, a brother of the then Attorney-General, Sir Rufus Isaacs - now the Viceroy of India, Lord Reading - was one of the. leading personalities in the Marconi Company. It was stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rufus</inline> Isaacs himself held a considerable number of shares in the concern. The influence, or pressure, brought to bear upon the Imperial Government was so great that the Commonwealth Naval authorities were warned to keep quiet, and to refrain from favoring the Telefunken system. A controversy raged in this Chamber between the then Postmaster-General and the present State Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, who had been given a retainer to defend the Marconi interests in this country. I might mention at this stage that, as an outcome of a public inquiry in Great Britain, it was proved that a sum ranging between &#163;300,000 and &#163;400,000 was paid by way of bribes to members of the British Government, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rufus</inline> Isaacs was one of those who shared therein. I relate these details to lead up to the reason why the wireless works at Epping were not <inline font-style="italic">gone on</inline> with. Subsequently, a law suit was brought against the Commonwealth Government with respect to the erection of that station, and having to do with the failure of the Government to pay a royalty to the Marconi interests. I recollect that a compromise was agreed upon, but I do not know how much it cost the Commonwealth Government. </para>

I mention these details to emphasize the need for very thorough inquiry. I trust that the Government will take no further action until the report of the Committee shall have been received.

Honorable members should be especially careful to prevent the right honorable gentleman from taking any unwise action upon his own authority at the present stage, when the Government have been voted ample money to carry them on for many months. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to delay the House at this stage, as I know that there is an intense desire on the part of honorable members to bring our proceedings to a close. It is most unfortunate that such an extraordinary statement as that made this morning by the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> which is deserving of considerable debate, should have been put before us at the last moment, because I am convinced that if the whole question were gone into as it should be, even more would be disclosed than has been suggested by the honorable member. As it is, we can say practically nothing about the matter, as the House has its mind set on getting into recess as quickly as possible. The statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when submitting this proposed agreement was, in my opinion, unsatisfactory. He told us that wireless communication was necessary. I agree with him, and concur also in his view that Australia cannot afford to be left out of the stream of events. The right honorable gentleman told us further that a relay service would be unsatisfactory. With that the House, I believe, will also agree; but the fact that such a service would be unsatisfactory does not necessarily mean that we should approve of this agreement. On the scientific side, of which I know nothing, it may be satisfactory ; but on the business side it is certainly open to criticism. </para>

                        <para>- As to that we have also been told that the shareholders in the company will control the situation. In the case of an ordinary company that is so, but it is absolutely misleading to say that in this case the holders of the majority of the shares - that is to say, the Commonwealth Government - will do so. The holders of the lesser number of shares will appoint the greater number of directors under this agreement, so that whatever the majority may propose in general meeting can be overridden by the directorate. That is an absolutely improper position in which to place the shareholders of any company. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable member&#39;s correction. I repeat, however, that in respect of matters of general policy and control the directors will be able to override the will of the holders of the majority of the shares. That is a position for which I could never stand. I oppose this agreement because I believe it is unfair to ask the people of Australia to become shareholders in a company under conditions that a man would never think of advising a member of the ordinary public to accept. </para>

This is one of two proposals which the Prime Minister, on his return from England, put before the House, and concerning which he, himself, asked the House to come to a decision. The second proposal related to the question of airships. I am uncompromisingly opposed to both. I am against spending &#163;500,000 in put- ing the Commonwealth into this &#34;shandygaff &#34; company, and I am absolutely opposed to referring the agreement to a Select Committee on the understanding that it shall have the right, on behalf of the Parliament, to consent to the Government entering into it. </para>

                    <para>. - I protest against the Commonwealth Government entering into this semi-company-mongering scheme. Rather than that the Commonwealth should enter into this agreement, it would be better either for the Government to control the whole service as a national undertaking, or to allow a company to do so as a purely private concern. The agreement was brought before the House at practically the last moment, and every layman at once detected in it serious errors which ought never to have been made. I am quite prepared to allow a Select Commit- tee to be appointed to thoroughly investigate the proposals, not only of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, but of other companies which have been negotiating with the Government, but it must be on the distinct understanding that the report of the Committee shall be submitted to the House, and the House itself given an opportunity to determine whether or not the agreement shall be entered into. I shall never be a party to this House surrendering, even to a Select Committee of its own members, its right to deal with the finances of the country. If, as has been said, this is a question of extreme urgency, then let an arrangement be made by the Leaders of the three different parties in the House that Parliament shall be called together early in the year - as soon as the report of the Select Committee is ready - on the distinct understanding that it shall meet only for the purpose of deciding this question on the report of that Committee. </para>

I did not hear the earlier part of his speech, but I was present when ho went so  far as to father a charge which was made in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> of 6th inst., that, although the first wireless press message flashed from England to Australia in one-fifteenth of a second, the Postal Department, having taken charge of it, occupied five hours in sending it from Melbourne to Sydney. I interjected at the time that the honorable member&#39;s statement was absolutely incorrect, and I desire now to read to the House a letter received by the Secretary to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> managing director of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited thanking us for our courtesy and promptness in giving him authority to deliver the wireless message. The letter is as follows :  - 5th December, 1921. Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline> I wish to thank you for your courtesy and promptness in replying to my letter of this morning, and for the authority to deliver the wireless messages received at our experimental station at Koo-wee-rup from the Marconi station at Carnarvon. - Yours faithfully, E.

The Government will accept full responsibility for the matter. We have not only sought the approval of this House, but have also submitted the matter to the Senate as it has been submitted here.&#39; Admittedly the form is unusual, but the circumstances are unusual. It is an Imperial project, and was discussed at great length at the Imperial Conference. The motion I submitted in this House was to give effect to an agreement arrived at by the representatives at the Conference -British, Dominion, and Indian - and which they agreed to submit to their Legislatures, namely, the unanimous determination of the Conference to promote a scheme for linking up the Empire by a system of wireless. Already the British, Government have begun their part of the business ; but what they do will be quite useless unless the other parts of the Empire cooperate. If the Commonwealth do not take action now it will probably be eight months before this Parliament will be in a position to even consider the question. Immediately Parliament meets next year, it will have to concern itself with financial and other matters of the first importance. For&#34; that reason I am now asking the House to appoint a Committee which may satisfy itself that the contract with the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is the better of the two schemes submitted.

On this Committee the Government will be in a hopeless minority. I shall not be a member of it. The matter to be considered must stand on its merits. The Committee can do what it pleases. It will have access to all the documents. But an immediate decision is required, and for that reason I am asking the House to intrust to the Committee the task of deciding whether the scheme submitted will be a good one for the Commonwealth to undertake, and whether the contract in its present form will protect the interests of the Commonwealth. If not, I trust that the Committee will draft the contract in a form to which it- can give its approval. </para>

A  very important question, involving the Commonwealth in a heavy liability, is brought down late in the session, and the House is asked to appoint a Committee to investigate it, and submit recommendations which will enable the Government to shape their course, that is, as to whether they will carry out this wireless project or not. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> says that the Government are prepared to take the responsibility of entering into this particular contract, and, of course, the Government must accept responsibility for whatever they do. However, the Committee the right honorable gentleman has asked the House to approve of will also be obliged to accept some responsibility in the matter. </para>

In any case this matter is too important to be dealt with in the way proposed.. Parliament should decide this question, and it was for that purpose that I submitted my amendment, which has been defeated, to permit of the question coming before this House at a later stage for ratification. However, when the House re-assembles, the Opposition will exercise its right to criticise anything which it considers is not in the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

Our experience in connexion with some of the company arrangements made by the &#39;Commonwealth Government should warn us to be careful. We have had one &#34;wireless&#34; purchase already. The Commonwealth was to receive almost untold profits from the wool-tops arrangement, which was submitted to us by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> with even a greater flourishing of trumpets than we have had on this question. Where are those profits today? The procedure suggested in regard to the wireless contract is most dangerous. I shall not say a word against the proposed Committee,but I claim that it is wrong for Parliament to delegate its rights to any Committee, no matter how constituted. What is the alternative? We are told that it is absolutely necessary to rush this matter through in a very short space of time, and have it finally dealt with before Parliament meets in June or July next; but what is there to prevent Parliament being called together earlier for the special object of dealing with this matter? </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members seem to be anxious to come to a vote on this question, but we are being compelled by the procedure adopted to do what we do not want to do. It is not fair for the Government at the last moment of the session to attempt to force such an important matter through - the House simply because honorable members want to get away from their labours as quickly as possible. What are we here for ? We are here to protect the interests of the public, and why should the Government be allowed to make this proposition, which is not a proper business proposition - no one would so describe it - and, because it is the fag end of the session, tell honorable members that they are&#39; expected to say nothing. I know nothing of any arrangement or agreement between parties, or leaders of parties; so far as my own Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)is</inline> concerned, I have perfect freedom to say what I like, and speak as long as I like. The method proposed of dealing with the question before us is to debase Parliament. It is not opportune that important measures should be introduced at this, stage of the session, and honorable members denied the right of debating them. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Some honorable members may desire to leave for their homes this afternoon, but, in my opinion, it is time that we took a stand in defence of the constitutional rights of the people. The filching away of those rights has gone on for years - ever since by means of the War Precautions Act we gave the Government  a  free hand, with, I believe, the approval of the country. But I do not think that in these times of peace the people will longer approve of their rights and privileges being handed over to others, and their representatives being deprived of the right of criticism. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> commenced to-day to make revelations which, had he been allowed to continue, would have astonished the House and the country; and that honorable member knows it. But because we are near the end of the session, and the Government know that honorable members are in a great hurry to get to their homes, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> handed a note to that honorable member, who then concluded his speech as quickly as possible. That is not a fair position in which to put the House. I voted for the creation of this Committee, but it was in the belief that it would submit its. findings for the approval of this House. It may be that the Committee will not fairly represent the opinion of Parliament, even if it is composed of members of several parties; and unless we are given full and fair opportunity for discussion of its decision, we have no right to go into recess. I do not see why the Government should be empowered to act on its findings without any reference to Parliament.  I  feel very strongly on the question,  because,  during the last few years  I  have been watching, and I have seen the rights of the people being handed over to the control of a small autocracy in Parliament. This tends to destroy the belief of the people in parliamentary institutions at a time when such destruction of faith is dangerous. There should be no lessening of the confidence of the people in the public institutions; it ought to be restored and strengthened; and it is for us to show that we are careful of the public interests and capable of protecting them. I, therefore, protest against the amendment, and hope it will not be carried. </para>

                        <para class="block">I regret that the discussion of the subject-matter of my motion could not take place at the beginning of the consideration of the general Estimates, because what I propose should form part of a general scheme of economy, in which consideration might be given to our statutory obligations, as well as the ordinary appropriations for the year. By reason of the fact that it could not then be discussed, the discussion of the statutory obligations could not be directed with the energy necessary to make any attempt at alteration successful. I do not move this motion because I think that the allowance now paid to members of this Parliament is excessive; I move it because of the slump in the national income, and because of the altered position of the country&#39;s affairs since the allowance was increased to its present figure. This Parliament is the highest Court in the land, and it is incumbent on its members to take the lead in a movement for national economy. The country must live within its income, and we should show that we mean to face the issue of financial solvency. I  supported the measure which increased the allowance paid to members of this Parliament, and in this connexion I should like to repeat what I said when the proposal for an increase was being considered, because I do not withdraw one iota of the opinions I then expressed. This is from the official report of my speech - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>I recognise that there cannot be proper representation of every class in the community, especially the industrial classes, unless there is payment of members. Neither can there be stable government unless every class in the community is properly represented in Parliament. If, therefore, we are to have payment of members, the pay should not be skimped in any way, but should be ample to attract the best men. In the first place, it should bo ample, in order to increase the competition for the position, thus attracting the best men to the National Parliament. Secondly, I believe that an increase of salary will bring about much more quickly the further subdivision of Australia into self-governing provinces. The present cost of Legislatures must be lessened; and I think that, by making adequate provision for the payment of members of this Parliament, we shall bring the people of Australia much more quickly to a right state of mind upon this question. </para>
                            <para class="block">One consideration that influences me in now proposing the reduction of the allowance is that the question of constitutional reform seems to have been shelved by this House indefinitely. I went on to say - </para>
                            <para>My own position is that, before entering the House, I made up my mind as to the annual loss I could sustain, and I am willing to continue through this Parliament, and through any subsequent ones of which I may be a member, still bearing that loss. But I realize, from the short experience I have had in travelling between Melbourne and my own State, that there is no possibility of a member from other States, or even of a Victorian country representative, living within his present parliamentary salary. For that reason, I think it would be grossly unfair if I were to stand in the way of this proposal for no other reason than that I am a little more fortunately placed than are some of my fellow members. </para>

                                <para>- I have never agreed with the contention that Parliament has no right to fix the allowances of members. I maintain that it is its function to do so. But under present conditions, with the prices of primary products falling rapidly, it is the duty and privilege of honorable members to give the public a lead in economy by reducing their salaries. </para>

                                <para>- My professional income dropped several thousands a year by my entrance into Parliament, and this year it has declined still more. Last year Australia&#39;s exports declined to the extent of &#163;18,000,000, and in the first four months of the present financial year they have declined an additional &#163;4,000,000 over the decline in the corresponding period of last year, that is to say, our position in eighteen months has gone back &#163;3,000,000 a year in the value of exports. The prices of all primary products are falling. Wheat, which was 9s. per bushel, is now only 4s. 6d.; butter, which was 278s. per cwt., is now about 136s. per cwt. ; and practically all other primary products are dropping in like ratio. Likewise, the income of those on the land is falling, and a dairyman whom I know, who in October of last year made &#163;140, made only &#163;60 during October of this year, although his production of butter has continued about the same. </para>

                                <para>- No; he rents it. He has had to discharge one of his hands, and his wife and children have to work in the dairy to keep the place going. Many stockmen are similarly situated, and persons whose means of. livelihood are the dividends of companies in which their capital is invested are finding it hard to live, because of the reduction or passing of dividends. If we turn to the finances of the nation, we see that its income is falling; loans are coming due to the extent of something like &#163;390,000,000 within the next six years ; the Federal Government, and practically every State Government, is faced with a deficit on the year&#39;s accounts; and there is an apparent drift towards national bankruptcy. It is time, therefore, that this Parliament, like that of South Africa and New Zealand, gave a lead by facing the issue, and showing that economy, like charity must begin at home. It is obvious that our taxation is as high as the country can bear. Indeed, it is so oppressive that we must fmd some means of reducing it. Unless we economize in our own expenditure, we shall not be able to effect economy elsewhere. In New South Wales they have found it necessary to reduce the basic wage. Time will not permit me to speak at greater length on the subject, but I hope that the House will agree to .my motion and give a lead to the whole continent. </para>

                            <para>.- I am pleased that this question has been ventilated, and I wish to say briefly - because the time at my disposal is short - to our critics in the press and among the public that the members of the Labour party have never endeavoured to burke the discussion of this subject. Were that our object, we  could  have taken advantage of the Standing Orders to-day to prevent the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(&#34;Dr. Earle Page)</inline> from, moving hilll motion. I desire to make that fact perfectly . clear to those critics who tomorrow will publish comments on the debate. I am. surprised that the honorable member thought it necessary to move the motion, seeing that it is only eighteen months &#39; since Parliament determined, by substantial majorities, to increase the allowance paid to its members. It cannot be necessary to take this action in order to ascertain the -views of members on the subject of parliamentary remuneration, and the fact that the motion has been moved makes one wonder whether certain honorable gentlemen may not be afraid that an election is within a measurable distance. Should the motion have been moved with a view to influencing electors, it says little for those responsible for it. Men who come into Parliament should possess backbone, and be able to stand up to their opinions, despite the criticism levelled at them. I was glad that the honorable member said that he did not -&#34;question the right of Parliament to fix the remuneration of members; because some persons outside have represented our action in increasing the allowance last year to be on a par with the conduct of a burglar. They lose sight of the fact that section 48  of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to deal with the subject of remuneration. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. If it were not for that provision of the Constitution, the honorable member for Cowper could not have moved his motion. I understand that the honorable member proposes that our allowance should be reduced by  20  per cent. He said that he was sorry that the reduction could not be moved at the beginning of the consideration of, the Estimates because we could have followed it up with a general attack. Upon whom ? I suppose, upon the public servants and then upon, the workers of Australia. The workers of this country have had an uphill fight to get wages somewhere approaching the cost of living, and now that wages and costs are about on a balance, the honorable member for Cowper and those who follow his lead would reduce wages by  20  per cent., although the cost of living has not fallen to any extent worth speaking about. </para>

I have not during my public life alluded to my personal affairs, but whenever that question has been put to me I have answered it in. the affirmative. When I have been asked whether I am getting a fair remuneration for my services to the country, I have always replied &#34; No.&#34; I say without hesitation that we are not too well paid, and  1  say that despite the fact that before entering political life I had to borrow money to contest an election. Will any one here say that with  &#163;600  or  &#163;800  a year a man could put by anything for a rainy day? Are men not &#34;deserving of an adequate salary who hold high and responsible positions such as we do, who are, in effect; the directors of the affairs of the Commonwealth, and have been chosen by the electors themselves? </para>

In any event, a man who has. served his country in Parliament for a term of ten or twenty years is unable to return to the employment which he left, and is it fair that when at the end of such a term a man can no longer remain in Parliament, he should Be without anything to live on ?

                                <para>- What man&#39;s health is not impaired by twenty years of parliamentary service ? I do not wish to be personal, but I cannot help drawing attention to the fact that those who are moving for the reduction of the parliamentary allowance are chiefly men whose expenses in attending to their parliamentary duties are much less than that of their fellows, and that many of them have professional or business incomes which supplement their parliamentary allowance. Moreover, these men do not give the continuous service to the country that men like myself give. I hardly ever leave this House. When Parliament is in session I never travel my constituency, because I think my duty is to the country, and the country&#39;s work is in this Chamber. Any man who devotes the whole oi his time and such talents as he has been endowed with to his country&#39;s service, is surely entitled to a fair remuneration . I shall put before the House the facts of my own financial position. I desire them to go before the public. I have no wish to hide anything. In a period of nine and a half years, prior to the date when the allowance to honorable members was increased to &#163;1,000 a year, I received, at &#163;600 per annum, &#163;5,700. In that time I had to fight five elections, the cost of which I have estimated- at the low figure of &#163;150 each, although one of them cost me &#163;265. They absorbed &#163;750. The campaign in connexion with the amendment of the Constitution cost me &#163;60; the conscription referenda campaigns, &#163;40: and the loss of pay for six weeks during each of four dissolutions, &#163;300. My Melbourne expenses - twenty-six weeks in the year at &#163;3 10s. per week - amounted to &#163;864 10s. ; the income taxation for nine and a half years, &#163;270; and electoral expenses at &#163;2 per week, although I daresay they amount to more, &#163;988.* The total expenditure for the nine and a half years was &#163;3,272 10s., leaving a balance of &#163;2,427 10s., equal to the magnificent salary of &#163;255 10s. per annum for my services to this country. Will any honorable member say that that remuneration is fair? </para>

                                <para>- I doubt if mine do; but I have erred on the conservative side. I wish to hide nothing, and I have no hesitation in saying that I had to mortgage my house for &#163;300, and it took me ten years to pay off that debt out of my salary. This increase of the allowance to &#163;1,000 per annum increased my nett income to &#163;655 10s., but as an offset to that, Federal and State income taxation has increased by &#163;57 per annum, and my Melbourne board and lodging by &#163;2 per week, or &#163;52 per annum. Loss of pay for six weeks at the election period accounted for &#163;40 per annum. I lose, on the allowance, &#163;120 for three years, which is &#163;40 per annum. These figures make a total increased expenditure of &#163;149, which, taken from the &#163;655 10s., reduces my nett income to &#163;506 10s. There are honorable members in this House who have wealth behind them; others have professions or businesses from which they augment their parliamentary allowance. Those honorable members want to reduce my allowance by &#163;200 per annum. I am certain that when my electors, and those of other honorable members, know the facts, they will say that the proposal is ridiculous, and that they did not know that our nett income, after paying expenses inevitably incidental to our positions, is so&#62; small. What is the idea that permeates the criticism by the press, and some of those honorable members who are afraid to stand up and fight for a fair thing ? It is that we receive a nett income of &#163;1,000 per annum. We receive nothing like that. Deduct the expense of maintaining two homes, the cost of fighting elections, the loss of six weeks&#39; pay at election time, and contributions to charities - and a man must needs have a heart of stone to refuse many of the appeals that are made to men in our position - and mere than half of the salary paid to us <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> gone. Yet we are told that it should be further reduced by &#163;200. If our critics would analyze the position honestly, and with a desire to deal fairly with their fellow men, they would never attempt to reduce the salary which Federal members are receiving to-day. Membership of this Parliament is the highest position to which any man in the country can attain. Does a man enter this House without ability ? Many an honorable member has to force his way up from the very lowest rung of the ladder. Some of us have fought our way to Parliament from the pick and shovel. Men advance like that only by reason of ability and force of character. We give our services to the country; and will anybody say that the country has not benefited? Members on opposite sides of the Chamber have their political differences, but we are all animated by the desire to id&#39;o the best within our power for the country. And if we give conscientious service according to the measure of our abilities, we are entitled to expect reasonable remuneration. The increase of salaries by &#163;400 per annum distributed over Australia&#39;s population of 5,000,000 costs the people of this country less than 2d. per head per annum. Do honorable members  think that when the people know the facts they will think that we are overpaid? The constant reading of newspapers may create in the public mind a&#39; certain impression, and I am sorry to say that this daily newspaper propaganda influences a good deal certain members of Parliament who should know better. The people do not know the facts, and they, are led by the press to think that, instead of being honorable men intent on doing our best for our country, we are in these positions only for the sake of what We . get out of them. I have fought all my life to win better conditions for the working man. I have endeavoured to get wages increased, whenever I could. Always I have resisted strongly any reduction of wages, and I shall fight to maintain the salary which is now paid to hon.orable members of this Parliament, because it is no more than a fair remuneration for the services we give to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>.- The agitation for the reduction of salaries of honorable members is largely the outcome of the criticism of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> Newspaper Company is one of the greatest profiteers in the Commonwealth. The public are now charged 2d. per copy for that paper, which before the war was sold to them for lid., and honorable members will recollect that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> boasts  of having a circulation of about 160,000 per day. If honorable members will make a calculation they will find that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is charging for its papers about &#163;180,000 more than it did before the war, and it has also increased its advertising rates by 33 per cent. In all probability, if we could see the balance-sheet of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> we would find that its proprietary is amongst the most objectionable profiteers and extortionists in Australia. I hope that Victorian members of this Parliament will not be led by the continual vilification of this Parliament by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> into thinking that the public of Australia are likely to be affected by that campaign of abuse. Since the parliamentary allowance was increased to &#163;1,000 per annum the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> and the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hunter)</inline> have been elected to this Parliament. I venture to say there was no criticism of the salary of &#163;1,000 when those honorable members were before the electors, and I am reminded by an honorable member that the <inline font-style="italic">Age&#39;s</inline> so-called &#34; anti-salary grab &#34; candidate at the Ballarat by-election lost his deposit. </para>

                        <para>We are told that we did not consult the electors before increasing our salary. We did not consult the electors when we fixed the salaries of the &#39;Justices of the High Court at &#163;3,000 and &#163;3,500 a year. Did the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> .which sends its writers into the gallery to vilify members of Parliament, ask the public for permission .to increase the price of its paper or its advertisement rates? No; it knew perfectly well that because of its rich and powerful organization it is able to impose the increased charges upon the public. It takes a great deal of capital to start a daily newspaper, and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> feels secure against competition. Although a certain amount of increase may have been justified by the advance in the price of newsprint, that is not sufficient excuse for the profiteering charges which the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> now makes. After the eloquent speech delivered by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Charlton)  I would be quite willing to say nothing more, but the general public do not know anything of the duties of members of Parliament, and I doubt whether the majority of Victorian members in this </para>

                        <para>Some idea of the vastness of the Australian continent may he gathered from a map which, no doubt, honorable members have seen, showing that Australia could swallow up nearly the whole of Europe. . For further comparative study the areas given below will prove of interest : - </para>

                            <para class="block">The Barrier electorate is 76,824 miles in extent. It is larger than Belgium (11,373 square miles), Bulgaria, (24,380 square miles), Denmark (15,360 square miles), and Holland (12,048 square miles) combined, the total area of those four countries being 63,161 square miles. The electorate of Capricornia is 73,130 square miles in extent. Its chief polling place is 1,704 miles from Melbourne. Nearly a week&#39;s train travelling is required to get to Rockhampton. The electorate of Fawkner &#39; is only 4 square miles in extent. The chief polling-place is 4 miles from Melbourne.  The Federal division of Kennedy is 255,082 miles in extent, and the chief polling-place, Charters Towers, is 2,185 miles from Melbourne. The honorable member for Fawkner can go to his business place in Melbourne in ten minutes. The honorable member for Kennedy could not reach Charters Towers from Melbourne in less than ten days. Victorian members of the House of Representatives have stated that if the Federal Parliament did not meet in Melbourne they would not remain members, because their business interests would not permit of their leaving this city. Is it not unfair of those members to refuse to those who come from distant States a larger allowance than they themselves receive? Members of Parliament make the Commonwealth laws.Commonwealth Judges administer them. Members of Parliament who make the laws get &#163;1,000 a year, and no allowance for hotel expenses when travelling. The Judges who administer the laws receive the following: - Chief Justice, &#163;3,500 a year, and up to &#163;4 4s. a day hotel expenses for himself and Associate, besides railway, coach, and steamer fares when away from home. Other Judges receive &#163;3,000 per annum, and up to &#163;4 4s. a day allowance for hotel expenses for themselves and their Associates, besides railway, coach, and steamer fares when away from, home. Members of Parliament fixed the salaries of the Judges, and they appointed the Judges for life. Members of Parliament have to go up for election every two or three years, and have no fixity of tenure. We could have fixed our salaries at the same amount as that paid the Judges, namely, &#163;3,000 and &#163;3,500 per annum, but we did not do so, believing that &#163;1,000 per annum was a just and liberal allowance for members of the Federal Parliament. </para>
                            <para>I deeply regret that honorable members are not permitted to discuss this question fully. I have had very long experience of parliamentary life. I may say that I have, to attend to between 5,000&#39; and 6,000 letters per annum from correspondents in my own electorate. I have had to fight for my political life, on an average, every two years, and I am not permitted to draw any election expenses. When I am consulting my electors, in my efforts to secure re-election, I am in receipt of no salary. Altogether, I affirm that the payment of &#163;1,000 per annum to Federal members is not too large an allowance. In the United States of America members of the Senate and  i  the House of Representatives each receive &#163;1,560 per annum. In addition, &#163;500 for each member is paid as an allowance for a secretary, and every member is provided with two rooms in which to conduct his business. Members of Congress are also entitled to 10d. ner mile for travelling expenses whenever they depart from the Seat of Government. In hasty conclusion, I urge that the sum now being paid to members of this Legislature should certainly be- retained. </para>

                            <para>&#91;3.481 - I am sorry that I find myself unable to support the motion. By what process of reasoning the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has brought himself to advance such a proposition I cannot pretend to be able to understand. Circumstances are not materially different now from those which existed some months ago, when the original proposition for the increase of members&#39; salaries was introduced in this Chamber. That motion, I would remind honorable members, received the approval of a very large majority, including the honorable member for Cowper himself. The present suggestion is very far-reaching. I shall direct my remarks to that portion of it which has relation to the salaries of Ministers for State. I say without hesitation that the salaries paid to members of the Commonwealth Government are inadequate. Speaking for myself, I hold that it is a reflection upon the people of this country that they should pay the Prime Minister of Australia a salary which does not net him anything like &#163;2.000 per annum. </para>

                                <para>- Unless we are prepared to deliberately shut the door of this Legislature against ability, and to uphold the view that only those who cannot find scope for their talents outside may enter here - that only the mediocre may take their seats in the Federal Parliament - we should at least adhere to the present payment of members. Surely no one will say that this is a place in which public men - men of outstanding talent- may not come in order to do something for the benefit of their country ! Here is a country, the home of a Democratic community, of a people who make the laws under which they live, and by which they are conditioned. If, for the future those laws are to be made by low-priced labour - by mediocre personalities - we shall be damning Democracy as effectively as by way of the sword and revolution. I say nothing of the criticism always directed against public men. Criticism is regarded as the prerogative of the people in respect of their selection of public men. And, no matter how one in a public office may become irritated by that criticism, it is right and well that the people should be free to probe the actions and motives of their servants. But the people, having the freest choice to select the best men who may offer themselves, should be ready to pay salaries commensurate with the nature of the duties with which they are to be intrusted, and in keeping with the dignity of the positions which they are required to fill. When honorable members consider that there are dozens of men in this city who receive a higher salary than I do - and I have the honour to fill the highest position that the Commonwealth has to offer - it will surely be admitted that such a state of affairs amounts to a reflection upon Australia. Complaints have been frequently made that men of ability do not enter these halls. I know that such as do come here do so at great personal sacrifice. </para>

                        <para>I should have thought that the honorable member for Cowper would have had some regard for the circumstances of his own profession, or of mine. Would he suggest for one moment that a member of the British Medical Association should be free, and held blameless by his colleague, to practise his own peculiar form of etiquette and charge for his services just such a fee as he deemed fit, no matter how inadequate or disproportionate to those generally charged by other physicians ? One who behaved in that fashion would be rightly regarded by the British Medical Association as a &#34; scab.&#34; Members of the Federal Legislature, however, are to be looked upon as the wicked boys of the Commonwealth. While every one else is to have the full fruits of his labour, they must not dare to look for such a reward. If the people want cheap political representatives, in God&#39;s name, let them have them. </para>
                        <para>I shall now say this for outside consumption: I have never yet hesitated to make known the inadequacy of parliamentary remuneration. And I have never yet had one single question put to me: on the hustings concerning salaries. I have done my part, I think, to raise the wages of the people of this country. Is the labourer - the instrument himself, in this instance - unworthy of fair hire? If I can get into Parliament only by offering my services at a price which is less than the remuneration earned by my fellows in other walks of life I shall stay outside. I have always been, in this matter, one who has stood for the rights and privileges of those among whom I have worked in the sphere of law-making. I may be involved in many differences of opinion; but every honorable member knows that, if he does his duty in this most exacting sphere - one which unfits him for any other line of activity - he is by no means lavishly repaid. And he knows, further, that if he falls, he falls - like Lucifer - too often, never to rise again. At the same time, there is about public life a glamour of excitement. Even so, those who enter pay a heavy price. They draw deeply upon their reserves of health, and upon their pockets. </para>
                        <para>I say, unhesitatingly, that there are very few men in the Federal sphere of legislation who could not do better for themselves in other walks of life. I do not pretend that I must have more money in order to live; but I maintain that I should be paid, as a Minister of State, a salary commensurate with my position, and which might be fairly compared with the emoluments of those occupying similar but less onerous and far less responsible positions in commercial life. I will serve this Commonwealth, as a member of Parliament, or as a Minister, for nothing - if that should be necessary. But if I am to be paid, I ought to be paid that which I think is a fair salary. If the Australian people cannot afford to pay me, I shall be prepared to serve them for nothing. But I shall not offer my services, in the present circumstances, for less than I think is fair. </para>

                            <para>.- I desire to make a brief explanation regarding the speech which I delivered in this Chamber, upon this same question, more than a year ago. I then said it was my intention to take the increase of salary, and to give the amount, first of all, to a widow who had been unjustly treated by the Government, and whom they had refused to compensate, and then to others in my electorate. Thereafter, I added, it was my intention to hand over the greater part of the extra sum to the party to which I belong. I realized on second thoughts, however, that if it would not be right for me to take the additional amount, and use it for my own purposes, it would not be proper for me to employ it in other directions. Therefore, I have not drawn one penny of the increase from that day to this. </para>

                                <para>-  The fact of my saying that I respect one honorable member does not eliminate all other honorable members from my consideration. However, while I respect my leader, and have listened closely to his utterances, and am persuaded that what he says regarding his own case is true, I must assert that I am not compelled to view this matter from his standard. Upon a salary of &#163;600 per annum I can carry on, with enough to maintain my home, and to fight my election campaigns, and still have a little to spare. In my mind, however, this subject is not one having to do with a precise amount of salary. Honorable members ought to be paid what they are worth. The particular point which concerns me arises out of the manner in which the increase was brought about. </para>

                                <para>-  I admit that the Leader of the Country party said that it was within the power of this Parliament to do what it has done. I know something now of the ways of members of this Legislature. I have seen too many evidences, during my brief experience in these halls, to be in ignorance to-day. I do not wish to be unfair, and, possibly, I am wrong ; but it appears to me that the old members of this House had the whole scheme worked out in their minds before the last general election. If the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition had gone to the country, and announced their intention, upon returning to Parliament, to increase honorable members&#39; salaries. I would have felt vastly differently upon the whole subject. I am here, however, not merely to further my own interests, but as the representative of a large body of the public. When, within a few months of having been returned to the Federal Legislature, honorable members deliberately set out to increase their salaries by 60 per cent., they deliberately broke faith with the electors who sent them here. I do not believe that 5 per cent. of the people who sent us here even suspected that we would take that action so soon after our return, or at any time. I am going to do what the Deputy </para>

I honestly believe that we were wrong in increasing the parliamentary allowance. That being so, we shall not do right even by reducing it to &#163;800, since that amount is &#163;200 in excess of the allowance that was payable to us when we were elected. If it was wrong to raise the allowance from &#163;600 to &#163;1,000 per annum, it is equally wrong to support raising it to &#163;800. </para>

                                <para>- That is not what I  am  seeking. My point is that it is not within the province of the Treasurer  or  the Government to withhold from the public knowledge of the amount drawn by any servant of the taxpayers, whether it be the humblest office boy or the Prime Minister. The ex-Treasurer finally replied to my request for this list by saying, &#34;The honorable member, at all events, is not drawing the increased allowance.&#34; He evidently thought that I specially desired to have that fact published. Nothing was further from my thoughts.  My  sole object was to make sure it was impossible for any honorable member to declare outside that he was not drawing the increased allowance when in  fact he  was. It is for the public to judge whether or not any value attaches to the refusal of certain honorable members  to  take the increased allowance. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> spoke  of  public servants and the salaries paid them. I make bold to say that there was never an agitation on the part of the Public Service for increased pay that was so hastily given effect to by the Parliament as was this sudden agitation for an increase in the allowance of honorable members. If the Government would show as much expedition in doing justice to the lower-paid ranks of the Public Service as was displayed by them in this case, their action would be most commendable.

That also, I believe, is the opinion of the majority of honorable members. I am supporting the <inline font-style="italic">status quo.</inline> I supported the original motion to . increase our allowance from &#163;600 to &#163;1,000 a year, and I shall support the workers outside Parliament in resisting any attempt to cut down their wages just as strongly as I shall fight for the maintenance of the remuneration we now receive. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> has said that his chief objection to the increase relates to the manner in which that increase was brought about. He is the only one in thisHouse who has taken up that stand. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member also claims to adhere to that position. My point is that the same objection will hold good with regard to the original increase of the allowance from &#163;400 to &#163;600 per annum. That increase was made in precisely the same way as was this increase from &#163;600 to &#163;1,000 per annum. The honorable member for Angas, therefore, has no ground for taking exception to the way in which this later decision was arrived at. If his conscience will not allow him to take this increased payment of &#163;1,000 a year, it should not allow him to take &#163;600 a year. I do not wish to further occupy the time of the House. The only reason why I persisted in demanding a hearing was that I thought it most unfortunate that any honorable member should help our enemies in the press, in their propaganda against us, by submitting a motion which would enable them to say that those of us who believe in the increase would not allow the opponents of it in this House to give expression to their views. I would sooner remain here all night in order that every honorable member who is opposed to the increase might be heard rather than let such an allegation be made against the House. Let us go to the country, and if the people want other representatives who are cheaper in price, let them have them. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> I desire to make a statement in reference to a statement made in the course of a debate which recently took place here on the affairs of the Arbitration Court and arbitration matters generally. The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond),</inline> during that debate, made certain references to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, which were reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> to the effect that the Judge had &#34; set the bad example of announcing his resignation if a certain Bill were passed, without waiting for the Bill to become law.&#34; On behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins I have to say that the statement is quite wrong - that the Industrial Peace Bill was assented to on or about the 11th October, 1920, and that he did not announce that he  Would  resign until the 25th October. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins desires that this correction should be made. With the permission of the honorable member for Illawarra, I sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins a report of the honorable member&#39;s speech, in which it is stated that  His  Honour had announced that, owing to certain contemplated action, he would not hear cases that were brought before him; that from that announcement started the &#34; unhappy mixture of Judicial and Executive functions&#34; ; and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt,  President  of the PublicService Arbitration Court, ought to be exceedingly careful of the examples Judges set in the Courts over which they preside. In justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Justice Higgins, who is not in a position to speak for himself here, I have to say that he informs me that he never made any such statement. </para>

                    <para>.  - This amendment has reference to the qualification of those who are to be appointed Deputy Judges of the Arbitration Court. The Bill, as it left this House, provided that those Deputies must be barristers or solicitors, or Judges of the Supreme Court of a State. The Senate has amended the clause by providing that those appointed shall be of not less than five years&#39; standing in the profession. Naturally, the persons appointed to these positions will be of some experience, and, as in the case of other judicial appointments, there must be a reasonable qualification. </para>

                <para class="block">Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> proposes to accept it, and for reasons that are anything but satisfactory. &#39; The honorable gentleman states that he is prepared to accept the amendment because he thinks those appointed should be of sufficient experience to qualify them for the position. I have had considerable experience in Arbitration matters, even prior to my becoming a member of this House; I formerly did a great deal of Arbitration Court work, and it has been my duty to engage legal assistance on many occasions. I venture to say that, at any rate, in some cases, the men who proved to be most adapted for Arbitration work had not been barristers for five years. Why were they better fitted for such work than others with anything from ten to twenty years&#39; experience in the legal profession 1 Simply because, while preparing for the Bar, they had followed occupations which brought them in touch with industrial matters, on which, in consequence, their minds had become concentrated. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Will any one say that a man thus trained is not qualified to occupy a position on ,the Arbitration Court Bench? I see no reason why he should be regarded as ineligible simply because he has not been qualified for a period of five years. On one occasion, when a solicitor was required to act on behalf of an industrial organization, we found that of those in that particular town, most of them old-established, there were only two who could give us the benefit of any special knowledge in industrial law, and the one we found most suitable was not of &#34; five years&#39; standing.&#34; We had the same experience in engaging counsel. On several occa-sions King&#39;s Counsel have been engaged, but they did not have the same grip of industrial matters as some solicitors. I do not see the justice of the restriction made by the Senate. It would have been much better to leave the Bill as it was. The amendment limits choice; and if it be accepted, the Minister may find later that the most capable of the candidates have been qualified for only three or four years. I cannot understand what influenced the Senate in making the amendment; for the measure, -when it left this House, seemed to be quite fair; it threw on the Government the responsibility of selecting the best men from the widest possible choice. I regard the amendment as a step in the wrong direction, and I ask the Minister not to so readily agree to it. The Minister&#39;s attitude may be due to the fact that we are nearing the end of the session, and,&#39; desiring to clear up the business, he thinks the easiest way out is to accept this and other amendments presented to us. I do not think that is the proper course to pursue. Of course, if the Minister really thinks the amendment desirable, I can take no exception to his action; but if he is only acting from expediency, I cannot approve it. Our only object is to make this legislation a success, and the choice ought to be left quite open, so that the most suitable persons may be appointed, irrespective of whether they have been in the profession one year or twenty. </para>

                    <para>.- I am opposed to the amendment made by the Senate. . It is a pity to limit, not only the area of choice of judicial officers, but the discretion of the appointing authorities themselves. I grant that it is unlikely the choice will be made from a junior member of the Bar who has been qualified for less than five years, but such a thing may well happen. I &#39;suggest that the senior members of the profession are not likely to be much attracted to these positions ; and, that being so, it is all&#39; the more necessary to leave the way open for virile, active-minded young men who have given study to this class of legislation. The discretion, after all, remains with the Executive, who, I presume, are not likely to make a choice of an unsuitable man, especially for the position of Judge. At all events, I record my protest against any limitation which may exclude men who, from every point of&#39; view, are suitable. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not agree with the objections that have been voiced against this amendment. It is of the utmost importance that the best men possible should be secured for these positions. The qualifications of a Judge embrace not merely knowledge of the law, but general experience&#39; of affairs, and acquaintance with business and trading  methods, and capacity to judge the value of evidence. A young fellow who has been admitted to the Bar for only three or four years can hardly have obtained the necessary experience, nor acquired the judicial habit of mind necessary for adjudicating upon the questions which are brought before the Arbitration Court. A limitation such as that suggested by the Senate is not unusual. The same limitation is contained in our Judiciary Act, and I have seen a similar limitation in other Acts, but containing a term of seven or ten years. Having regard to the importance and character of the work of the Arbitration Court, we must take every precaution to insure the appointment to its Bench of persons of the highest qualifications. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall not take any objection to the course that is proposed beyond remarking that for the Government to introduce practically a new measure, right at the close of the year, after most members have returned to their homes believing the present business of the Parliament to be finished, is a strange procedure. This is, to all intents and purposes, new legislation. We are not supposed to know what happens elsewhere, but we know that the Government ought to have control of its business in both Houses of the Parliament. What has happened shows that, while it may have a majority in this Chamber, it has not a majority in &#39;the Senate, although that body is supposed to consist of Government followers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Senate has negatived this motion for the second reading of an important Government measure, and this House is being humiliated by the submission of a proposal that fresh legislation be passed to be sent to the Senate, and, in effect, to eliminate from the Bill which we passed a couple of days ago provisions, which a majority here consider essential. </para>

                        <para>- No. My contention is that the Government should have a majority in the other Chamber which would give effect to the wishes of this House. If it has not, the present Ministry should not be on the Treasury bench. The honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> may approve of .what has taken place, but he was in a minority on several matters when the last Bill was being discussed here. The honorable members who were with him, although they are Government supporters, seem elated by the fact that the measure that we had passed was rejected in another place. However, it is for the Government to say what is to be done. On behalf of the Labour party, I enter my protest against the course proposed. I have not known, since I have been in Parliament, such a course to be taken. I do not know whether other honorable members have knowledge of similar procedure. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and by-and-by we may find that the powers and privileges of this Chamber have dwindled away, and that it has become subordinate to another body. If the Senate, which is composed of Ministerial supporters, is not prepared to do the reasonable thing in regard to the expressed wishes of this Chamber, which is the people&#39;s House, the time is fast coming when, if we are to retain the reins of government, we shall have to fight it. </para>

                    <para>.- It is to be regretted that the Income Tax Assessment Bill, with which we dealt during our last sitting, was not introduced &#34; until the end of the session. Certain promises were made by the Treasurer in his Budget speech. He said that anomalies in the Income Tax Assessment law, under which many cases of hardship and injustice had arisen, would be removed. Practically the whole House was in favour of granting this relief. But the amending Bill that was introduced not only provided for the giving of relief in certain cases, but also attempted to impose further taxation in many directions. The taxation was to be considerably increased by provisions which were in the nature of a side issue to the original proposal. It is due to this House, to another place, and to the electors that they should have an opportunity to express their views on these new proposals for taxation. </para>

                    <para>. - I am thoroughly convinced, by the action the Government have taken, that they are a spineless and weak-kneed Ministry. They are not prepared to put up a fight against another place, which chooses to ignominiously &#34;boot&#34; out a measure sent to it for its approval after having been agreed to by a majority of honorable members here. The time has arrived when we should either double-dissolute the Senate or electrocute it; because there is a principle involved in this business when we find that we have such a weak Government that it is prepared to give way every time to the Senate and take no steps whatever to defend the privileges and rights of this House. </para>

                        <para>- I wish the little &#34; State Righters &#34; in this Chamber would remain silent, or put on national spectacles. At this late hour of the session, when we are so close to Christmas, I am not disposed to be acrimonious, but certain happenings during the past week in another Chamber in respect to the rights of this House have lowered the dignity of the House of Representatives, and there is hardly any protest except from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and the few followers he has who have not yet departed for their homes. I am sure none of them would have left if the position that has arisen had been anticipated. Honorable members seem to be treating the matter in a hilarious manner, possibly because their ideas have been carried into effect by another Chamber. Evidently they are prepared to agree to what the other Chamber has done. They are ready to bow the knee to Baal, and say, &#34; Thank God, we have another Chamber!&#34; However, we shall see what the Government propose in their new Bill which they have introduced in accordance with the instructions of another Chamber. It can be but a mere skeleton of what passed yesterday in this House. I accord with the protest honorable members opposite have raised; it is certainly not right, and it is not to the credit of the Government, that an important piece of legislation dealing with taxation and affecting a very large number of people should be brought forward at such a late stage of the session. If I am spared, never again will I allow such a position of affairs to arise in this House as has arisen in the last few days. </para>

                        <para>-No ; that part of their protest is legitimate, and if they had sought an amendment of the Bill as a means of expressing their protest against the action of the Government in remitting to them a measure of this important character at such a late hour of the session I would have agreed with them; but without the slightest regard for the feelings of this Chamber they have used a big military boot and punted the Bill right out of their Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- It is a flimsy excuse. Their proper course in the circumstances was to adjourn the discussion of the measure until copies were supplied. That is what would have been done here in similar circumstances. Some of our parliamentary pioneers would have scoffed at the idea of the people&#39;s House taking the action of the Senate lying down. I remember the fights between the Upper and the Lower Chambers in Victoria at a lime when there was not one Labour member in Parliament. The members of the Lower House in Victoria would never have tolerated the action the Senate have taken had it been taken by the Legislative Council; but our weak-kneed and spineless Government and their complacent followers are ready to give way. If honorable members are prepared to treat this matter as a huge joke I am willing to let them do so, but I shall continue to regard it in earnest, and demand my rights. </para>

                    <para>.- I have my seat booked for this afternoon&#39;s train to Perth, but I am prepared to stay here for another month rather than permit injustice to be done. I want to study the wish of other honorable members to conclude the session, but I appeal to those who appear to be treating this Bill, if not with levity, at least with inattention, to give it the consideration its importance deserves. The previous Bill was introduced in deference to a promise given, not to a lot of people who could afford to wait for any length of time to learn the effect of the new taxation proposals, but to a number of men in this Commonwealth who are, undoubtedly, doing something to help to  develop it. I .refer to miners, and I know what it will mean to a lot of prospectors if they are not given some relief in the direction proposed. I am not worrying about new taxation proposals, but I am anxious to see the relief clauses, which were in the Bill rejected by the Senate, passed into law. I am not excusing the Government for not having given the Senate the opportunity of realizing the contents of the measure on which they were asked to vo&#39;te. </para>

It appears from the buzz and hum of conversation in this chamber that those honorable members who have occupied the most time during the session, many of whom live close to their own homes, are not now prepared to give a fair deal to others of us from distant States who have been detained in Melbourne for the last four months. </para>

Are honorable members seized of the fact that our national income is not sufficient to pay our debts?

                    <para>No question as to the constitutional rights of the two Houses in relation to money Bills is at stake on this measure. This Bill is different from the one which has been rejected in another place. Clause 2 re-introduces the provision to exempt residents in. the Territory of Papua. This is done by an amendment of the definition of &#34; absentee.&#34; The definition of income is altered in order to give relief to members of co-operative companies as defined. Clause 3 exempts from taxation income derived from sources in Papua, and income earned there by personal exertion by any person while there. Clause 4 lays down an averaging basis for taxation of incomes from primary production. Clause 5 prescribes the principle for granting relief in cases of double and treble taxation. This was recommended by the Taxation Commission. Clause 6 gives that relief to prospectors and working syndicates concerning whom the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> is so anxious. Clause 7 increases the deduction allowable for each child from &#163;26 to &#163;30. That involves a remission of taxation to the amount of about &#163;30,000. Clause 8 repeats the clause that was contained in the other Bill relating to special deductions under section 19 of the principal Act. Clause 9 deals with the taxation of income of non-resident persons, such as those to whom the honorable member for Melbourne referred, whilst clause 10 provides for the creation of Boards of Appeal. </para>

The measure also does not deal with trading assets which have  reference to live stock. Further, it omits all reference to bonus shares; the whole of the proposed legislation bearing in that direction has been left out. There are retained, however, the references to mining operations which had been included in clause 6 of the previous Bill. There have been omitted portions of clause 7 ; this contained a re-definition of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-section 1 of section 18 of the Act. As to clause 12,_ which had to do with retrospectivity where that aspect was relevant to the other portions of the previous Bill now omitted the necessary omissions have been made. On the whole, the Bill is practically a relieving measure throughout. </para>

Without doubt, the measure now under consideration will prove a source of substantial relief.- Parliament has been placed at this advantage, namely, that the matters now included in the Bill have nearly all been investigated by the .Taxation Commission, The alterations of the Act&#39; provided for are of the most . urgent character. I refer particularly to that touching upon double taxation. The subject should have been taken in hand by the Government a long while ago. The Imperial Government, following upon arrangements which had been agreed upon, promptly performed their part. For months, however, the Commonwealth Government have failed to carry out their obligation. Substantial relief will be afforded to taxpayers in this direction, and it will be, particularly, at the expense of the British Government. An omission of which I complain has to do with bonus shares issued in regard to increase in value of capital assets. Serious embarrassment has been suffered by a large :number of companies which have made provision for the issue of bonus shares solely representing increase in value of the capital assets of the company Several in stances were mentioned by honorable members, in detail, when discussing the other measure. The present doubtful condition of the law has proved a source of confusion. The Government undertook to give relief in this connexion, but not as regards trading profits - for that is a controversial matter, and, for that reason, I do not desire to touch upon it at this stage. But I would like the Government to afford merited relief in regard to a great number of cases such as I have already spoken of. I know that a considerable amount of litigation would be saved by that course. </para>

                        <para>.- It is to be regretted that another place did not pay this House the courtesy of dealing with the measure presented to it in a proper manner, that is to say, by considering the Bill in Committee and making such amendments as may have been deemed necessary. I understand that the objections of honorable senators had to do with the subject-matter of specific clauses; there was no excuse, therefore, for rejecting the Bill upon its second reading. I do not know whether 1 rightly understood the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to .give the assurance that the relief given to co-operative societies, such as those, for example, in which miners are interested, will not be in any way interfered with by this new Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I take that for granted. Reference has again been made to the question of affording relief in respect of companies issuing bonus shares. My view is that they are already taking good care to provide themselves with relief from a considerable amount of taxation. These concerns have, in very many instances, done remarkably well in recent years, especially during the war. Huge profits have been piled up, even while large dividends have been paid; but a way has been found of evading taxation by putting capital to certain purposes. As the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> pointed out, some companies have so arranged their affairs as to absorb their additional capital and avoid being called upon to pay their just dues to the Taxation Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>.- This Bill, in so far as it applies to primary producers, is a great improvement on that which has been rejected by the Senate. The alterations that have been made in the provisions relating to the sale of trading assets are what the Country party desired. A proportion of the capital of a man who enters into a grazing business is necessarily invested in stock. The sale of that stock is practically a sale of capital, and it is not right that any tax should be levied on the sale&#39; of capital. The deletion of the retrospective clauses relating to section 10 are also an advantage. When we were discussing the original Bill the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> and the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> urged that the proposal in regard to the averaging of incomes was a concession to primary producers, and that it should be extended to every other person in business. Honorable members of the Country party hold that it is not a concession, but simply a restoration of rights. As to the suggested extension of this so-called concession to people engaged in trade or commerce, I have here a copy of a resolution passed by the committee of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, and sent to the various Chambers of Commerce throughout the Commonwealth. It reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable members generally are dissatisfied with the way in which taxation and other financial measures have been submitted to the House during the last two or three weeks. The way in which they have been conducted is not at all creditable to the Government. Some honorable members thought that I had no serious purpose in view in asking from time to time when it was proposed to appoint a successor to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook as Treasurer. As a matter of fact, I was anxious that a successor should be appointed in order that the financial measures might be properly brought before Parliament. With a Treasurer to look after such measures, the errors that have been made would have been avoided. It is impossible for the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to attend to the Treasury as well as to his own Department; he is compelled to leave to the Treasury officials many matters with which a responsible Minister only should deal. We have in both the Treasury and the Taxation Branch officers of whom any country would be proud; but it is not for them to deal with matters of policy, and they cannot be blamed for any difficulties that have occurred. I hope that a successor to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook as Treasurer will be appointed without further delay. I am glad to know that the Government intend next session to bring in comprehensive legislation based on the report of the Taxation Commission, and I hope I shall be well enough to vigorously criticise such measures. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding in regard to the bonus shares, but we know that, in their manipulation, the few individuals have benefited at the expense of the many. I have sufficient faith in the Taxation Commissioner to know that, in most cases, he and his officials are more likely to be right than are dissatisfied&#39; taxpayers. There is a natural propensity to growl at taxation, for no one is pleased at his assessment whatever the amount may be; but the taxpayer has not the advantage of the information possessed by the Taxation office. The honorable member for Kooyong, of course, is engaged in legal business, and, doubtless, views the matter from a different stand-point. </para>

                            <para>- I object to the railroad speed at which the Government are taking these Bills through in a House so sparsely attended as not to thoroughly represent the people of Australia. It is quite likely that honorable members who are absent might have important objections to voice against this Bill ; and I am sure that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is in accord with the views I am expressing, though, I suppose, he is anxious for a holiday after the undoubted hard work that he has been doing lately. At the same time, this haste is not in the interests of the community, especially in the case of a Bill so important as that before us, and so likely to create dissatisfaction and discontent. We ought to endeavour to make the Bill as acceptable as possible to all concerned, and honorable members should have the courage to express their opinions regarding it. I do not mind who knows that I refuse to stay here all night in order to unduly rush business through; and I am sure that if the Prime Minister were on this side he would be as loud as I am in his objections. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - I bring before honorable members a matter of great importance arising out of a decision of the Imperial Conference this year, on which I reported to the House on my return from England a few months ago. I mentioned then that there were two matters on which I hoped this Parliament would express its wish before the session closed. One of these was wireless telegraphy, in regard to which an arrangement has been come to. The other was air-ship communication between the various parts of. the Empire. I pointed out that the British Government had a fleet of airships which it was willing to place at the disposal of the Dominions if they would agree to co-operate in a scheme for the maintenance of aerial communication between the various parts of the Empire. I shall not weary honorable members by discussing the matter just now beyond saying that a Committee of the Imperial Conference, joined with experts - air-ship and aeroplane - made a. careful investigation of the matter, and submitted a report which covered a period of two years of experimental operations, which could be conducted, speaking from memory, for &#163;1,200,000, of which Australia&#39;s share would be about &#163;200,000. A decision in regard to the Imperial Government&#39;s offer is urgent, because unless the offer is accepted the air-ships that are available for the experiment will be scrapped after the 31st of this month. These vessels cost to produce &#163;40,000,000. That, of course, is not the value of the air-ships themselves, but covers the whole organization, for which there are only these air-ships, to be seen. Workshops, hangars, the provision of spares, and the making of arrangements of all sorts, has involved the British Government in the expenditure of that colossal sum of money. This is the only fleet of air-ships in the world. There is no means of speedier communication with Europe other than through the air. We might increase the rate of progress over the sea, but the increase will be slow, and, at most, the journey is not likely to be cut down by more than four or five days. As a matter of fact, it takes as long to travel to England now as it did thirty years ago, and the transport of the mails between Australia and England occupies a longer time than it did twenty-five years ago. Realizing that time does not permit of the discussion of this proposal that the circumstances warrant, I merely ask the House now to agree to this motion: - </para>

                        <para>That this House, recognising the vital importance to the British Empire of aerial communication, views with concern the prospect of abandonment of proposals for the establishment of an Imperial air-ship service, and expresses the earnest hope that the period during which the air-ships and other existing material will be available will be extended, in order that branch of the Legislature, but that desire cannot be carried to the point of sacrificing the legitimate interests of others. To arrive at a fair basis of adjustment regarding such matters, the  President  and I arranged that a conference of heads of Departments should be held in order to make recommendations in regard to the salaries of the junior officers and employees of this establishment. But it was never intended by me that any arrangement that was arrived at should apply to the chief administrative heads of Departments. The heads of Departments would scarcely have been asked to make recommendations as to their own salaries. I would not dream of attempting to dictate to the  President  as to what should be the salary of the  Clerk  of the Senate, and I do not think that I was bound to consult him in regard to the recommendation I made for an increase in the salary of the head of the House of Representatives Department.

                    <para>I have no desire to unduly occupy the time of honorable members, but the issue at stake is one of no little importance, and I desire, therefore, to give a brief <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale&#39;s</inline> service. Prior to Federation he was the head of a Department, namely,  Clerk  of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, for ten years. In 1901 he was appointed second  Clerk  Assistant of the House of Representatives at a salary of &#163;600 per annum, and, two months later,  Clerk  Assistant at a salary of &#163;750, which was later raised to &#163;775. In February, 1917, he was appointed  Clerk  of the House at a salary of &#163;1,000 per annum. In Victoria for many years, before the purchasing power of the sovereign was depreciated as it has been lately, the salary of the  Clerk  of the Legislative Assembly was, I believe, &#163;1,200. The salary of the  Clerk  in the South African House of Assembly is &#163;1,500. In Canada, as far as I have been able to learn, no departmental head receives a higher salary than the  Clerk  of the Parliaments. But I invite honorable members to compare <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale&#39;s</inline> salary with that of the heads of other Departments. In 1901 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> began at a salary of &#163;600, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd,</inline> now acting as High Commissioner, began at a salary of &#163;310. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castles</inline> was appointed at &#163;500 per annum, and was later made Crown Solicitor at &#163;1,000 per annum, and he is now receiving &#163;1,250 per annum. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> was first appointed at &#163;310 per annum, and he was subsequently made Secretary to the Treasurer at &#163;1,000 per annum, and is now in receipt of a salary of &#163;1,400. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> has had thirty years&#39; experience as a Chamber officer. For half of that period he has acted as second officer, and for the remainder of the period he has been head of the Department. This House did not attempt to interfere with the salaries of officers of the other Chamber, although it might have done so with more reason for its action than can be advanced in justification of the present interference with the salary of the chief officer of this that road we all desire to travel, I move - </para>
                    <para>That the requested amendment bc not made. My suggestion is made in the most friendly spirit.

I am putting forward the fervent, but subdued, hope that, during the luncheon hour, a <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> will be arrived at. I shall say no more. Perhaps I have said too much. I could say a good deal more, but I shall say it later, should the necessity arise. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a matter which I think I should not let pass without making some reference to it, because it revives a subject that has been the source of a great deal of trouble and worry to me in my capacity as presiding officer of this House. I am intrusted, by the Public Service Act, with the sole task of determining the appointments, promotions, and other conditions of employment of the officers of the Department of the House of Representatives, and making recommendations regarding the same. Honorable members in this Chamber passed the proposed increase of salary set down in the Estimates for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale,</inline> the  Clerk  of the House, without question, but when the Appropriation Bill was sent to another place a motion was adopted to request this House to reduce the amount by  &#163;250.  This I regard as an abrogation of the functions vested in me by the Public Service Act and also an encroachment on the rights of this House in regard to the control of its own officers. The Senate has taken up a position which is virtually an assumption of authority over the officers of this House, and it is for the House to say whether it is prepared to submit to what amounts to dictation on the part of the Senate in further pressing this matter. It is true that in the beginning of Federation difficulties arose on account of claims set up in another place that whatever, salaries were paid to officers of the House of Representatives should also be paid to officers of the Senate. There was, however, a conflict of opinion between the presiding officers of both Houses as to the relative merits of the officers of each House in respect to the hours they worked, the relative importance of the duties with which they were intrusted, and the general conditions of their work. As a consequence, an arrangement was made by which the Presiding Officers, with a view to avoiding further conflict of opinion between them, were to consult one another in respect to these matters and arrive at an amicable arrangement in respect to them. That course has been followed1 as far as practicable, but I am in this unfortunate position - as a result of that arrangement - that, although it seemed to me that when certain requests made to me in regard to promotions and increases of salary were reasonable and should have been agreed to, there have been occasions when I found the  President  of another place not in agreement with the views I held, and action which I desired was not taken. There is no arbitrator to decide a point in case of differences of opinion between the two Presiding Officers; and, if I were to give effect to my opinions and do something which was not concurred in by the  President  of the Senate, whatever was done in respect of this House would be made a pretext for similar action in another place, regardless of the fact that the circumstances there are entirely different. ! can foresee that, in the desire to avoid collision with the  President,  the withholding of increments and promotions may involve grave injustice to the employees of this House. That is one of the reasons why I suggested that matters affecting the salaries and appointments of officers of Parliament should be dealt with by another tribunal. In actual practice, the present system gives the  President  of another Chamber the right to control, not only salaries in his branch of the Legislature, but also the salaries in the Department of the House of Representatives; because, unless the  Speaker  is agreeable to accept his views, he must act independently and do something in conflict with those views, and, similarly, if the  Speaker  withheld consent to a proposal by the  President  for an increment to or promotion of a Senate officer, the  Speaker  would virtually control the situation as far as the Senate was concerned. In those circumstances a very undesirable condition of things would be set up. I have every desire to live in amity with the.  President  of another </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">House, for, without any desire to disparage the importance of the work of the officers in another place, it cannot be denied that the work of the officers of this House is far more onerous, more exacting, and more strenuous than theirs. As evidence of that, I may mention that of the Bills passed into law during the last two Parliaments, at the time of the proposed increase of salary to. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale,</inline> only thirty-five originated in the Senate as against 210 in the House of Representatives. All the special work of the Committees of Supply and Ways and Means, including the immense amount of labour inseparable from dealing with the Estimates and examining the Appropriation Bill prior to presentation for assent, is performed in the House of Representatives. A fair criterion of the relative amounts of work in the two Houses is afforded by the number and times of the respective sittings. In the present session, for instance, up to the 25th November, 1920, the Senate sat on only seventy-five days as compared with the 113 days on which the House of Representatives sat, whilst the Senate&#39;s hours of sitting totalled approximately only 298 as against 812 hours sat by the House of Representatives. To the 6th December last the Senate sat this session on 151 days, a total of 735 hours. The House of Representatives sat on 204 days, a total of 1,472 hours. The  Clerk  of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Monahan)</inline> has served at the table for six and a half years, as against the thirty years&#39; service of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale.</inline> Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> is eligible for appointment to other positions carrying a higher salary, but if he secured such a position all his valuable parliamentary experience gained during thirty years would be lost to this House. In view of the facts I have stated, I think I was fully justified in recommending the increase of salary, and I feel sure that my action meets with the approval of honorable members. One other point I may mention in conclusion. The  President  is wrong in saying that the Senate alone promoted an officer from a lower position in this House to a higher one in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy,</inline> the officer referred to, was first promoted from a secondary position at the Senate table to  Clerk  of the House in this Chamber. </para>

                                <para>- I thank the honorable member for confirming my view. The title has been abolished, I understand, since 1908. Peculiar conditions arose at that time which justified its abolition. But it has been rumoured - I have certainly been given plainly to understand - that the title has been restored. At any rate, efforts are being made to resuscitate it. While I agree entirely with the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> both as regards the far greater length of service of the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives and the incomparably heavier burden of work entailed by the sittings of this House; yet, so far as I know anything at all about parliamentary procedure, covering a period of thirty years&#39; experience, wherever there has been a  Clerk  of the Parliaments that office has been attached to the Upper Chamber. </para>

I am sure honorable members must often have wondered, &#39; with myself, at the accuracy with which the members of the staff have been able to report the proceedings, in view of the disturbing influences which frequently occur and centre round the corner of the table where they sit. I have the greatest difficulty myself at times in following what is being said, and I am sure that to those whose duty it is to record the utterances of honorable members, the thanks of members will be heartily accorded for the excellent manner in which that duty is performed. I wish the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, honorable members, and the officers a prosperous new year and a very happy and enjoyable Christmas. Before sitting down, I should like to express the hope that, on our re-assembling, we shall find the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> attending to his duties here fully restored to health and vigour. </para>

Without <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> our words would be but empty air, and without the press our names would be written in . water. I hope that the officers of the House, who have laboured long and zealously, will derive what satisfaction is possible from a sense of work having been well and faithfully done. To my fellow members 1 offer the compliments of the season, and my very best wishes. We have had, indeed, a most strenuous time during the last few days ; and if any men sigh, and sigh in vain, for an &#39;eight-hour day, it is the members of this Parliament. However, it is for us not to complain, but to do our duty faithfully in that state of life to which it has pleased God and the people to call us. I trust that honorable members will come back from their well-deserved recess like giants refreshed ; and then, I trust that, as they are strong, they will be merciful.  During the recess we .shall have opportunity to consider those measures that it is still necessary to press on the attention of the House, and, at this time next year, when we have to go before the people, we shall be able to do so no matter what differences of opinion there may be amongst us, conscious that we have done our best in the country&#39;s interests.  </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to say a few words, and they will not be about the press. At the beginning of the year an episode occurred which should be regretted by the honorable members of this and another place, and I cannot let this occasion pass without commenting on what I regard as a huge conspiracy to ruin a young man. I refer to the case of the lift attendant, Robert Denholm. It is very hard for an honorable member to say anything against men with whom he is associated, but I do say that the conspiracy which caused his dismissal was unworthy of any body of men associated with Parliament. We have endeavoured to right this injustice, but have failed. This young man was dismissed after having served this Parliament for ten years. He had been subjected to a certain inoculation, the results of which prevented him from earning his livelihood outside, though there were many positions which he could have obtained had the state of his hands permitted. Although we are told we have no control over the officers who dismissed him, his case should have consideration, and, in my opinion, the year has been spoiled by one of the greatest conspiracies I ever knew. </para>

                    <para>I can only add to what has already been said by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and. the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> an acknowledgment of my own personal indebtedness to the officers of the House, and the attendants, for the manner in which they have carried out their duties during an usually arduous session. I should like to refer particularly to the work of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, which has been carried out with remarkable efficiency under very trying circumstances. I am sure honorable members must often have wondered, with myself, at the accuracy with which the members of the staff have been able to report the proceedings, in view of the disturbing influences which frequently occur and centre round the corner of the table where they sit. I have the greatest difficulty myself at times in following what is being said, and I am sure that to those whose duty it is to record the utterances of honorable members, the thanks of members will be heartily accorded for the excellent manner in which that duty is performed. I wish the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, honorable members, and the officers a prosperous new year and a very happy and enjoyable Christmas. Before sitting down, I should like to express the hope that, on our re-assembling, we shall find the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> attending to his duties here fully restored to health and vigour. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to thank the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> for their remarks with regard to myself, and to take this opportunity to indorse all that has been said in regard to the manner in which the officers of the House and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff have performed their arduous duties. It has been my lot, as  Chairman,  to come very closely into contact with the officers of the House, and I can say, without hesitation, that no better or more loyal set of officers could be found. I desire also to especially thank the Temporary Chairmen of Committees for their assistance. They have always responded willingly to my call, sometimes at the sacrifice of their own time; and this I appreciate very much. I now wish honorable members, the officers of the House, the Temporary Chairmen, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and others, the best of times during the coming Christmas and a happy New Year.I trust that their brief rest before we re-assemble will prove of benefit, and that they will come here in full strength and rigour to carry out their duties in the interests of the people of Australia. </para>
