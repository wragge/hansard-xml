                        <para>- I should have liked notice of the question, and thought that the honorable member would give notice of it. Speaking from memory the instructional staff At Jervis B ayn numbers thirty-three, and the ratings and other men employed there ninety-six.  In  justice to the institution, I should add that the ratings employed there would have to be maintainedbytheNavyDepartment else where if their services were not being used at the College. They must be available in time of war, and the cost of their maintenance is not rightly charged to the College.Itmust not be forgotten, too, that the College at  a  distance from any town, and is consequently more costly to maintain than a similar institution near to a city would be. It has to find its own water supply and its own electric light supply and these and other services add to itscost. </para>

It is also reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that supporters of the Canberra movement are agitating for an expenditure of &#163;100,000 at the Federal Capital this year. I should like the right honorable gentleman to inform the press that we are asking for an expenditure of not &#163;100,000 but &#163;500,000 this year. </para>

Where it can be proved that it would be unprofitable to build a new house for a soldier - that a house already erected could be obtained for less than it would cost to build a new one, or where there is a surplus of houses, or- other special circumstances of that kind, the purchase of houses already erected will be considered justifiable. It is not intended that there shall be a complete prohibition of the purchase of houses already erected. Where we can get a better asset for the soldier, and at the same time not render more acute the shortage of housing accommodation by purchasing a house already erected, that policy will be pursued. </para>

He now desires to bring out from the Old Country his wife and. son. He did not serve at the Front, but having regard to the fact that he is in permanent employment here he desires to know whether any concession in respect of the passage money for his wife and son would be made by the Immigration Department. The question of immigration is very much in evidence just now, and a statement on this subject by the Acting Prime Minister would be of general interest? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> interviewed me some days ago and introduced a deputation of these nurses. Numbers&#39; of other honorable members have interested themselves in the same matter; and have made various representations; I have submitted the whole proposition for reconsideration to Cabinet, and this is what we have decided to do - subject, of course, to the approval of Parliament, since the proposal involves a tidy sum of money : There were 126 of these nurses, who went away from Australia under what is known as the Queen Alexandra scheme of nursing. All of these nurses volunteered for service with the Australian Imperial Force, but; because they had been sent away in connexion with the Queen Alexandra scheme, they have not so far been accorded the benefits and privileges which our own nurses of the Australian. Imperial Force have received. These 126 nurses; went overseas and performed their nursing duties in just the same manner as other Australian nurses. After they had departed from Australia, under the auspices of the Queen. Alexandra scheme, there were despatched overseas nearly 1,000 Australian nurses to perform the same duties as the 126. Care was taken, however; to include them in the Australian Imperial Force. Thus; was set up. a distinction between the two classes of nurses, who, however, were doing precisely the same class of work and; serving under the same conditions. The facts must strike honorable members as being inequitable. The Government have decided, therefore, to place them all on a parity. That is to say, where Alexandra nurses have received gratuities from the Imperial Government, the amounts involved will be taken into the equation and the Federal authorities will make up the difference between what they have received from Imperial sources and the amount given to the nurses of the Australian Imperial Force. We shall have to make up this difference to the Alexandra nurses in the shape of gratuity bonds. I do not recall at the moment the exact amount of the estimate, but a rather considerable sum is involved, and the passage of an Act of Parliament will be required in order to authorize the payment. I feel convinced, however, that the Federal Legislature will be so unanimously of opinion that the proposed payments should be authorized that I may safely anticipate its approval. I propose, then, to proceed to make up the difference in the payments to the Alexandra nurses in anticipation of the passage of a small measure which can be passed when honorable members meet again. Upon &#39;this implied understanding I shall proceed to adjust matters. </para>

                            <para>- The distinction is that the Australian Imperial Force nurses were sent from Australia. We did not send that nurse who was in London upon active service with the Australian Forces. She is in precisely the same position as some thousands of other Australians who happened to be in England when the war broke out. My son was among this number. He joined up asa private in England and did his best to get into the Australian Imperial Force. Our specific regulations, however, kept himout.This nurse who joined up in London, and those Australian fighting men who did the same thing, have had to accept the disabilities arising from their serving with a Force, the remuneration of which was less than the payments made to members of the Australian Imperial Force. </para>

                    <para>- About a fortnight ago the Acting Prime Minister promised that he would call for reports from the various State Governments with -respect to the unemployment unhappily existing to-day in Australia. The idea indicated by the Acting Prime Minister at the time was that an endeavour might be made to cooperate with State authorities in order to relieve the unemployment situation. I wish to know if those reports have yet been secured, and, if so, what measure of assistance the CommonwealthGovernment have determined to give. </para>

                        <para>- That has to do with another matter. I have been asked to give a ruling whether, in view of a notice of motion having been given for the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, that motion should not take . precedence of any proposed Government business or amendment thereto. The practice which has been followed by all the Speakers who have occupied this chair has been, when an intimation of this character has been given, to permit questions to be put without notice, and answered; whereupon the formal motion for adjournment has been put. I have been waiting for that stage to arrive at which questions without notice would be concluded. During that period the honorable member for Darling has risen on two or three occasions, upon either of which he might have taken the opportunity to move his &#34;motion. Since he rose, however, to ask questions without notice, I purposely delayed calling on other business. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> then intervened by presenting a paper and moving that it be printed; upon which motion the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> moved his amendment. I must rule that that procedure was in order, and I emphasize that I do so in pursuance of the invariable&#39; practice of this House. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment which I have moved is, to my mind, entirely different from the amendment moved by another honorable member earlier this week. The amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition to the Supply motion instructed the Government, to take steps to insure a continuation of the Wheat Pool. I am asking to-day merely that the Government shall use their influence with the State Governments in connexion with this matter. </para>

The honorable member&#39;s amendment instructed  the Government to do certain things in connexion with the continuance of the Wheat Pool. My proposal only asks that the Acting Prime Minister should bring his influence to bear upon the State Governments with a view to getting certain action taken for a definite period. The purposes of the two amendments are entirely ~ different, and I contend, therefore, that my proposal in no way contravenes the Standing Orders. </para>

                            <para>- I ask, for a ruling upon a point of order. The paper which is the subject of the Acting Prime Minister&#39;s motion relates to flour. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> deals with a .Wheat Pool. The two subjects are entirely different, and I ask whether it is competent for an honorable member to move an amendment which is not relevant to the original motion? </para>

                    <para class="block">Board. I congratulate the honorable member on his efforts to achieve a political victory rather than to do something in the interests of the farmers. Any person with parliamentary experience must recognise that the tabling of an amendment such ,as that moved on Wednesday by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition was tantamount to a. motion of want of confidence in the Government. In my opinion, the amendment was moved, not for the purpose of doing anything in the interests of .the producers, but simply in . order to gain a. political advantage. We all know perfectly well that it is outside the power of the Federal Government to initiate or carry on a Wheat Pool except by co-operation with the State Governments. Ever since the Pools were instituted there has been an arrangement between the wheat-producing States and the Commonwealth Government. To-day I am asking the House to instruct the Acting Prime Minister to use his influence with the State Governments to secure $ continuance of the Wheat Pool for the next season. </para>

                            <para>- Or the agitators. The Pools were instituted as a war measure, and it is as a war measure that I desire the Wheat Pool continued for another season. That course is necessary owing to the unsettled trading and financial conditions which obtain as a result of the war, and it is for that reason alone that I ask the Government to use. their influence to get the Pool carried on, not as a permanency, but merely to cover the 1921-22 harvest. The Premier&#39; of Victoria says that he has received satisfactory assurances that private companies will be able to purchase and finance the wheat in the coming season. But it seems to me to be impossible to get a satisfactory guarantee that there will not be a danger of insufficient, money being available if the financing of the crop is left entirely to private enterprise.- I desire the continuation of the Pool merely as an expedient to provide a longer time for conditions to become normal, and .for .the producers to mature a scheme of their own for the future handling of their wheat. I am convinced that the farmers will be able to do big things by cooperation, just as big things have been done in that way by the wool-growers. It would have been wiser if the earlier counsels had prevailed in .connexion with the Wool Pool. There is no member in this chamber who is more averse than I am to continuing the restrictions upon trade and! commerce, but to lift them at the present, moment, within a few months .of the garnering of the harvest, will involve a grave danger of &#34;the producers being left wholly at the mercy of one or two large trading concerns. I wish to derive no political advantage for my party from this action. I have interviewed the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and asked that the Commonwealth shall come to the assistance of the farmers in Western Australia in the formation of a co-operative Pool, Having heard that the South Australian Government have decided that&#39; they will have nothing further to do with the Pools,, and a similar .decision having been come to  by the Victorian Government, I desired to protect my own State, and on behalf of the farmers there I asked the Commonwealth Government to guarantee a co-operative Pool to the extent of 50 per cent, of the value of the wheat voluntarily put into it. We agreed that the Pool should be subject to any restriction which the Government chose to impose in regard to export. If they desired that certain quantities of wheat should be set aside for local consumption, we were ready to accept that condition. Nobody can say that in asking for a 50 per cent, guarantee we were making anything but a reasonable financial proposition. The farmers of Western Australia are almost unanimously in favour of a Pool, and the ballot of growers in Victoria has resulted in 73 per cent, of them recording a similar opinion. I am not asking anything for the future, but desire an arrangement for this year only in order to give the farmers of Australia time to put their house in order. I have no desire to again quote the speeches of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in favour of the co-operative movement; but I do not think that any honorable member here would be more desirous than the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)-</inline></para>

I feel sure that we in Australia can do equally as  well as  the farmers have done in Canada, for there are brains and men of grit amongst us. In Canada every effort was made, by banks, exchanges,, and other financial, organizations tq destroy the cooperative movement.; indeed, on .one occasion the Canadian Government had to come to the assistance of the farmers and enable- them to hold their own.

                            <para>- I am merely trying to show that by means of co-operation the Australian farmers may be enabled to place themselves in the same sound position that their Canadian brothers occupy. In the early days in Canada the wheat-grower had to take advantage of the nearest aud quickest market, but after a while, by means of co-operation, he found himself able to avail himself of the markets of the United States of America, Canada, England, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> elsewhere. Co-operation would be an advantage, even if confined to separate State movements; but I look forward to an Australian co-operative scheme. </para>

As a member of Parliament, I am quite prepared to stand aside, beyond affording a little assistance in the early stages of the movement. If the policy I am supporting is carried out, the farmers will find themselves quite able to deal with outside organizations. We are told that South Australia refuses to come into the movement; but if Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia enter upon some reasonable scheme, I hope the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will  use his  influence  with  the State Governments to see  that  the necessary assistance is given. My main desire is  that the  Treasurer shall endeavour  to have an  arrangement  made for this year, and this  year only. </para>

                    <para>The wheat referendum ballot, which was conducted by the Victorian Farmers Union and the Chamber of Agriculture, and for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C</inline> E. Merrett, the  president  of the Royal Agricultural Society acted as returning officer, closed at noon on Saturday, 11th July last; 19,816 ballot-papers were issued to farmers  who had wheat in the 1920-21 Pool. Of these, 15,002 were returned prior to the closing of the poll.   </para>
                    <para class="block">While the ballot was in progress the Victorian Government definitely and finally decided against the Pool. It received a deputation representative of wheat5* shippers, speculators, and middlemen&#34;.  local and foreign, and having heard their views, decided against a Pool without awaiting the result of the ballot. Therefore, although the number who voted was higher than is usual in a parliamentary election, it was not as high as it would have been had the Victorian Government not done its best to kill the project. </para>
                    <para>A count of the first preferences revealed that 10,832 favoured a compulsory Pool controlled by the growers, 2,057 an open market, and 1,633 a Government Pool; whilst 480 votes were informal. Of the latter, 173 indicated their preference for a Pool controlled by the growers, 115 for a Government Pool, and 06 for an open market. It was impossible to classify the remaining . 96 informal votes. </para>
                    <para>When the second preferences of those who favoured a Government Pool were examined, it was found that 1,381 desired a Pool controlled by the growers, and 252 an open market. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the ballot-papers mentioned above,868 were issued to farmers who submitted statutory declarations that they intended growing at least 10 acres of wheat during the coming season. </para>
                    <para>Many returned soldiers, and some others, who had put in their first crop this year, represented that it was not fair that they should not be allowed to express their views about the formation of a Pool to deal with the wheat of the coming year, and it was agreed that those who would sign a declaration before a justice of the peace that they intended to have at least 10 acres under wheat for the coming season should be given ballot-papers. </para>
                    <para>Of these, 760 were returned. The first preferences were 677 in favour of the growers&#39; Pool, 42 for a Government Pool, and 32 for an open market. The second preferences of those favouring a Government Pool were 41 for a growers&#39; Pool, and 1 for an open market. There were nine informal votes, of which four indicated a preference for a growers&#39; Pool, and two for a Government Pool, whilst the remaining three could not be classified. </para>
                    <para>The aggregate first preferences indicated that 11,509 farmers desired a compulsory Fool controlled by the growers, 2,089 an open market, and 1,675 a Government Pool. The second preferences of those favouring a Government Pool were 1,633 for a growers&#39; Pool, and 42 for an open market; the grand total, therefore, being 13,142, or 86 per cent., of the valid papers returned for a Pool controlled by the growers, and 2,131, or 13.9 per cent., for an open market. </para>

                    <para class="block">Because of that impudent assertion, we applied to the  deputy  returning officer for an account of the second preferences of those who had voted for a Pool controlled by the growers, and we were informed that 12,140 voted for the Government Wheat Pool, and 1,002 for an open market. I have quoted these figures to place them on record, and to show that in the State in which a fair and impartial ballot has been taken there is an overwhelming majority of wheat-growers in favour of the establishment of a Pool. It is hardly necessary to reply to what has been said by the Labour party about our action in voting against their amendment, or, as they put it, against the Pool. Undoubtedly the establishment of a Pool is of vital moment to the wheat-growers of Australia, and the members of the Labour party endeavoured to take political advantage of the fact, and have since sneered at the members of the Country party because they were not simple enough to fall into the trap obviously set for them. </para>

                        <para>.- The manner in which the business is being conducted by the Government to-day is rather surprising. Speaking for the Labour party, in the absence of the  Deputy  Leader, I have said that we desire to facilitate business, so that there may be an adjournment from to-day, and it is, therefore, a shock to find that the. Government is allowing the Country party this opportunity to try to redeem itself in the eyes of its electors for its negligence the other day in regard to their interests. In these circumstances,&#34; it seems unlikely that we shall be able to deal this week with the business requiring attention. Earlier in the week the Labour party moved an amendment to the Supply motion, the terms of which were practically the same as those of the amendment now under discussion. </para>

                            <para>- According to the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> the amendment merely asks the Government to use its influence, and if Ministers say that they are not prepared to do that, there is an end of the matter. Strangely enough, we hardly heard a word from the Country party the other night when there was an opportunity to discuss the establishment of another Wheat Pool. Members of that party then sat dumb. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but this amendment of the Country party means nothing. It is. the firing of a blank cartridge. Members of the Country party having failed in their duty to those who sent them here, wish to obscure the fact. It is members of the Labour party who represent the majority of the primary producers of New South Wales, and we have endeavoured to do our duty by them. Directly we knew that the wheat farmers desired the continuance of the pooling system, we took action to secure it, anticipating . that we should have the support of the Corner party. </para>

                            <para>- I shall endeavour, sir, to obey your ruling. I submit, however, that I was justified in replying to statements made by honorable members who were allowed to state why they did not support an amendment dealing with this very question, which was .submitted on Wednesday last by the Opposition. I have been endeavouring to show the House and the country how inconsistent honorable members of the Country party are, and how negligent they were of the interests of those whom they claim to represent, when they voted against the amendment which we submitted calling upon the Government to arrange for the continuance of the Wheat Pool. There may have been some element of doubt as to the attitude of the farmers on this question, but that doubt no longer exists so far as the farmers in some of the States are concerned. They have made it known that they desire the continuance of the pooling system. They have made representations to that effect to honorable members of our party, and, I presume, they have also made known their views to the Country party. That being so, when we submitted an amendment calling upon the Government to continue the Wheat Pool the Country party should have backed us up. Had they co-operated with us in that effort, I am certain the Government would have at once accepted our proposal. Their failure to support the action taken by us then is responsible for our being called upon to discuss the question again to-day. I hold that this: is only a death-bed repentance on the part of the Country party. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and the Country party were not prepared to accept it. I believe that Pools controlled by the Government, and dealing with not only wheat, but all classes of commodities,-. would be in the best interests of the producers and consumers alike. It would be well for us to organize along those lines. In that way we should at once bring about co-operation as provided for in the paper which the. Acting Prime Minister has laid on the table of the House. Much could be done to reduce the cost of living by a system of Pools with properly organized Government control. I notice that the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> carefully refrained from saying a word on behalf of the consumers. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member urged that the Wheat Pools should be continued in the interests of the producers. He said nothing about the interests of the consumers. My contention is that they should be continued in the interests of the producers and consumers, and to the detriment of the middlemen, who should be wholly cut out. In order to achieve that object, we should have representatives of both the producers and the consumers on these Pools. If we are to have true co-operation, both interests must be represented. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to answer it. I have just ascertained that the debate on this motion will close at 1 p.m., and, therefore, I shall have to curtail my remarks. As to the right honorable gentleman&#39;s question, I would point out that if we are to get back to normal times the world&#39;s parity for wheat will be much less than it has been of late years. I did not advocate the payment of the world&#39;s parity, during the war, for wheat for local consumption. I said that,  having regard to the increased cost of living, the price paid for wheat for local consumption should be such as would- give the producer a fair return, and that for the surplus sold overseas we should get as much as possible. The world&#39;s parity is falling. </para>

                            <para>- I have already answered that question ; but I will answer it again. When the world&#39;s parity was exceedingly high I took up the position that everything that we produced in our own country should be supplied to our own people at prices that would allow the producer fair and reasonable conditions, having regard to the cost of production, and that we should get as much as possible for the surplus which we sold overseas, since the bigger the return the better for the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- No; I say that everything points to the price of wheat before very long falling below a rate which would give the farmers of Australia a fair return for their labour. The payment of world&#39;s parity for wheat for local consumption in such circumstances would not give the producer a -sufficient return. I am not in favour of that. My contention is that very much of the increased cost to the consumer is swallowed up by the profits of the middleman. The middleman should be cut out, and that is what would happen under a proper co-operative scheme. I move - </para>

                        <para>. -  It is apparent, to all honorable members, and I hope and believe it will be equally obvious to the people, that the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> and his colleagues of the Country party have found themselves in an ugly dilemma during the past day or two. I have never previously known or heard of such a situation as has developed in this Chamber. A definite amendment was moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party, the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> which, if it had been agreed to, would have entailed direct and specific action. It would have had the effect of bringing about what the great bulk of the wheat-growers desire, namely, the continuance of the Wheat Pool. The only .reason why the Country party voted against it was that the amendment would, if carried, have endangered the Government or compelled it to do something. Since their&#39; ignominious display in voting against the amendment, honorable members of the Country party have very evidently been in close collaboration with the Acting Prime Minister. The Government and the Country party have put their heads together in order to find a way out for the honorable member for Dampier, who has attempted to fool his supporters and the wheat-growers -of Australia generally. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly he &#39; did ; but now he has let his wheat-growing constituents down. The reason why members of the Country party did not support the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney in favour of the continuance of the, Wheat Pool system was that they were, afraid that by so doing they would hurt the Government. They felt in duty, bound: to support the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Hughes),</inline> who has violated his pledge&#39;&#39; given to the wheat-growers in the course: :of his policy speech at -Bendigo at&#39; the last elections. Surely the immunity granted&#39; by the Country party prior to the departure of the Prime Minister for London did not. mean that its members would be willing to permit the Government to violate the pledge given to the primary producers! The Prime Minister said, in the course of his campaign speech, that the Federal Government would stand &#39;behind the - wheat-growers for this season. Now, however, the Country party have agreed to a violation of that promise. The members of the Country party have agreed to connive at the breaking of the Prime Minister&#39;s pledge. They say, &#34;We have entered upon a truce with the Government.&#34; The wheat-growers must be shown that when it became a matter of saving the Prime Minister or the wheatgrowers of Australia the Country party decided upon the former course. Members in the Corner preferred to allow the Prime Minister to break his pledge, and thus they have betrayed their wheat-growing constituents. </para>

                            <para>- But the pledge which he gave at Bendigo, when he undertook to stand behind the wheatgrowers for this season has been violated because of the tactics of the Country party. The Acting Prime Minister has said, &#34;We want to be rid of this whole business ;&#34; and honorable .members in the Corner have replied, in effect, &#34; Very well ! Although there has been a violation of the Prime 1 Minister&#39;s pledge, rather than put the Government out, and let the Prime Minister down, we will undertake to betray the wheat-growers.&#34; That, in a nut-shell, is the attitude of this so-called Country party.

I have been informed that the honorable members for Echuca and Wimmera have been spurring on their State colleagues to fight for a continuance of the Pool. They do not mind sending the State members of the Country party to the country, but they themselves, together with the honorable member for Dampier, take mighty fine care not to send themselves back to the electors. That kind of procedure is good enough for their State colleagues, but it will not do for them! </para>

                            <para>- The worried look on the faces of honorable members in the Corner during the past twenty-four hours has been a regular study. The country will learn that this amendment, launched from the Corner, really means nothing. It is a sham and a delusion. If the Country party wanted to do anything practical, they had their opportunity a day or two ago, when, if they had voted for the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydney, they would have forced the hands of the Government. Now, after having been in collaboration throughout yesterday and half of last night with the Acting Prime Minister, the honorable member for Dampier comes forward with his little scheme. He has obviously been appealing plaintively to the Acting Prime Minister to let him and his colleagues out of their awkward situation. However, the wheatgrowers will learn of the false game they have played. They are not yet out of their dilemma. The honorable member for Dampier has been a really good bridge builder for the Government.  His  services have been most useful; but 10,000 such amendments as he has launched will not suffice to explain the attitude and tactics of the Country party with respect to the amendment moved by the Labour party earlier this week for a continuance of the Wheat. Pool. I repeat that, had that amendment been carried, something definite must have followed. The Acting Prime Minister does not want anything definite to happen in the direction of the continuation of the pooling system. The Government and the Country party have put their heads together in order that the members of the latter may let themselves out. It is my bounden duty to expose the whole sham for what it really is. No more words of mine are necessary to emphasize the dilemma of the Country party and the manner in which they have let down the people who, in mistake, sent them to this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I ask for a ruling whether any further stage of the motion can be entered upon at the present juncture, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker (Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> has on several occasions ruled that motions such as that at present under consideration must automatically lapse after two hours. When I made my protest a few minutes ago, you, sir, indicated that I could not take any such step during the progress of a division. The House is not at this moment being divided, and I submit, therefore, that the motion must lapse, the time permitted for its consideration under the Standing Orders having expired. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of any previous ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> upon this point. If honorable members will consult the Standing Orders, they will see that it is imperatively laid clown that all such motions, together with amendments thereon, must be completed before an adjournment or suspension is granted. That procedure is clear, and it is my duty to interpret the Standing Orders. So far as the motion at present under consideration is concerned, I point out that, before the time for the automatic conclusion of the debate thereon had been reached, the process of dealing with it and with the amendments attached thereto had been entered upon. It thus became the duty of the Chair, according to the Standing&#39; Orders, to carry the procedure through to finality. Such is now my intention. </para>

Warrants charge able to the Navy Department are issued to officers and men given . Christmas leave, from Sydney and Melbourne, in respect to the journey beyond Adelaide or Brisbane, to their homes, such ranks and ratings themselves meeting the cost of the journey as far as Adelaide or Brisbane. It is regretted that, in view of the present shortage of funds, it is not possible to grant further concessions. </para>

                        <para>-  The honorable member for Darling can only at this stage move a suspension of the Standing Orders and test the feeling of the House immediately, and I doubt if he can do even that without leave. He is now proceeding to debate the matter before the Standing Orders are suspended. He cannot do that. The standing order clearly refers to &#34; cases of urgent necessity.&#34; Is there any urgent necessity about this matter? </para>

                <para>I contend that the honorable member, for Darling is perfectly in order in stating reasons why the Standing Orders should be suspended in order that he may deal with a matter which is of urgent necessity. We talk a great deal about the financial position, and the honorable member&#39; desires to show that the Government are spending thousands of pounds needlessly, and that- money has been wasted. Is not that a matter of urgent necessity? </para>

                        <para>- I have already intimated that I am not in the position to be called on to say whether this is a matter of urgency or not. I have read the standing order, which permits honorable members to do certain things, and the Chair is powerless to intervene; it is a matter of the alteration of the Standing Orders. The standing order is perfectly clear; and my interpretation of it is that, while a general debate cannot be allowed prior to the motion having been stated from the Chair, the honorable member, so long as he confines himself to reasons why the Standing Orders should be suspended, is within the standing order. </para>

                        <para>- I have been vainly endeavouring to give reasons why the Standing Orders should be suspended. I have been continually interrupted by the Acting Prime Minister, who, apparently, is not himself this morning. In his de sire to get on with the business of the House, he has continually obstructed an honorable member who is desirous to bring up matters of urgent public importance. I have not deviated from giving reasons why the Standing Orders should be suspended. I endeavoured to elicit information with regard to the particular matter with which I desire to deal, and failed to get it. I endeavoured to find out what the Government intend to do with reference to the curtailing of certain extravagant expenditure. Last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> I handed you a letter in which I intimated that it was my intention to move the adjournment of the House to-day to deal with a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the cost of the maintenance and upkeep of the Royal Naval College at Jervis Bay, and of the Military College at Duntroon. Although I rose in my place several times to-day, you did not call me. The custom of the House has been for yourself or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as the case may be, to call on the member who has given notice; but this morning that was not done. The Acting Prime Minister was called on and he read, and laid on the table, a paper, obviously in order to prevent me from submitting my motion. This is a matter which concerns every member of the  House. Huge sums of money are involved. Is the Acting Prime Minister now trying to arrange with the Country party to move the &#34;gag&#34; on me? </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not think I need add much to what was said about the Bill by the Acting Prime Minister last night. &#34; Parliament voted &#163;270,000 to encourage the production of oil from shale, and &#163;84,680 lis. 3d. has been paid in respect of 7,870,022 gallons of oil produced, so that about &#163;186,000 is still unexpended. It is expected that claims for about &#163;4,000 will be received in connexion with production since the 17th June last. The Act expires on 31st August, and the Government proposes to look thoroughly into the whole question of the production of oil in the twelve months for which this Bill will extend its operations. If the Tariff Board be appointed, as we anticipate; this is one of the matters to which it will be asked to give attention. The experience we have had in this matter has not been altogether satisfactory, but we want to discover whether or not there are reasonable grounds for believing that the continuation of this kind of assistance to the industry will produce more permanent results than up to the present would appear to be likely. </para>

Every one knows that the history of the company carrying on operations at Newnes has not been altogether satisfactory. We desire an opportunity to look into the whole question; we want particularly to find out to what extent new fields are likely to be developed, and whether there is a probability that these new fields will give more satisfactory results than those which have been worked have so far done. </para>

                        <para>.- When the original Bill was before the House, the then Minister for Trade and Customs presented to us a glowing picture of the future of shale oil production in Australia. The period in respect of which the bounty was payable under that measure is about to expire, and we are asked to extend it for a further term of twelve months, since the whole of the money provided for this purpose under the principal Act has not yet been expended. What is the history of the company at Newnes, which alone is claiming the bounty ? It is producing a crude oil and drawing the bounty, in my opinion, under false pretences. Instead, of conferring any advantage on the people of Australia, it is merely selling the crude oil which it produces to gas companies in Auckland, and Christchurch, New Zealand, as well as to the Sydney, North Sydney, and Manly Gas Companies. Surely this bounty was not designed to enable gas companies to pay bigger dividends. Messrs. Fell and Company have not gone beyond the production of crude shale cil. </para>

                    <para>The one redeeming feature in the speech made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is the statement that the Tariff Board to be appointed will be asked to investigate this matter. &#39; I have visited the works at Newnes and have seen kerosene being produced from crude oil. In the process of refining, paraffin wax and other by-products are secured. During the war period, when the price of kerosene oil was enormously increased, and when it waa difficult to obtain supplies, no effort was made by the Newnes company to produce kerosene oil. It seems to me that this bounty has been misplaced. Those who have been drawing it have not done the fair thing by the country. Had they  made an honest effort during the war to produce kerosene from the crude oil, and so to relieve the people of the Commonwealth who were being called upon to pay enormous prices, I would not have protested against the continuance of the system. I would not object to John Fell; or any one else, drawing the bounty as long as he did the right thing in regard to it. But this company has not done the right thing. It has simply been producing crude oil, and selling it to various gas companies, so that we have been feeding people who are already well fed. I am  not in favour of the continuance of the bounty unless we have a guarantee that these people will produce not only crude oil, but kerosene oil. In the absence of any such&#39; undertaking I shall vote against&#39; the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I supported the original Bill when it was before the House some years ago, and I shall support this measure, but I think it is possible to improve it. All that the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. 4 Riley)</inline> has said concerning the company carrying on operations at Newnes may be true; but other companies are arranging <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> produce crude oil, and I hope will go much further than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fell&#39;s</inline> company has done. A company, has been formed to produce, oil from shale deposits in Tasmania. It will not produce kerosene, because the shale to be treated does not lend itself to the production of that class of .oil .: but it yields a very excellent crude oil, and many valuable by-products. When Admiral Henderson visited Australia some years ago, he declared that the oil produced from. the shale in question was very suitable for the ships of the Navy, and steam-ships generally, and I believe it is the intention of the company which is taking over the working of these, deposits to erect retorts, and to break down the oil in a refinery in this State. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Out of the amount originally set apart for the payment of a shale oil bounty, a sum of &#163;1S6,000 yet remains to be expended, and it is proposed by this Bill to extend the payment of the bounty over a further period of twelve months. I should prefer to make the bounty payable for the next three years. I do not ask that the amount shall be increased, but merely that the payment shall &#34; be spread over three years instead of one. It is hardly possible for new companies to come in during the next twelve months and secure any part of this bounty,- but if the period of payment were extended for three years instead &#34;of twelve months as proposed in the Bill, the result, I am sure, would be beneficial. When we go into Committee I shall move accordingly. </para>

                            <para>- For some years I have been urging that a Tasmanian company should be given a contract for the supply of crude oil to the Australian Navy, but, so far, my efforts have been unsuccessful. That company, owing to the failure to obtain such a contract, has not been able to raise the money necessary to develop its leases; but another company, whose head -quarters, I understand, are. in Melbourne, has made arrangements with the holders of those leases to work them under the royalty system. The retorts are being erected, and, according to the manager, the field is developing just as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Twelvetrees,  who was geologist for Tasmania, predicted it would do. It would appear that, just as he and other authorities predicted, large deposits of shale are opening up. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> knows that the industrial world is using more and more oil, so that crude oil propositions which twenty or thirty years ago would have been of no value are today very profitable. I hope the Minister will agree to extend the period for three years instead of twelve months. </para>

My impression is that it would be better to give a bounty on the products of the crude shale oil, and that is why I think it wise to extend the period of payment .for only twelve months. By that time, we shall have obtained information that will enable us to decide whether the period should be further extended, or whether the bounty should be given only on the products of the crude oil. </para>

Even if Parliament made &#39;the period three years it would not be a highly immoral procedure if, at the end of twelve months, a repealing measure were, if necessary, introduced.

                        <para>. - I trust that there will be no extension to. seven years. It is evident that the mere production of crude shale oil is not very beneficial to the community. I believe that if the bounty is given upon the refined products - and there are very many of these, as laboratory experiments and demonstrations will make apparent to any investigator - it will be far better for Australia. There will be a greater amount of employment arising from refining processes, and these latter undertakings will be entered upon much more extensively than to-day. </para>

                        Having been a consistent supporter of the bounty system for many years, and, particularly, in respect of the extraction of crude shale oil, I  am . able to say that it was never intended that the bounty should be given upon the crude oil, and, at the same time, that that commodity should be exported out of Australia. As the honorable member for South Sydney has remarked, this practice has been going on for some time. A company has now taken up the Latrobe shale oil deposits, in the electorate of Wilmot, and it has erected refinery works at Yarraville The proposal of the Minister is a good one. If it is to be understood that the only reason why the extension for a year is proposed is to enable the authorities to review the basis on which the bonus is payable, I shall agree to the Bill without further parley. There is one very strong point which I desire to make. Any one who cares .to read the report of &#34;Viscount Jellicoe will be uncomfortably impressed with the fact that the supply of oil for the Australian Navy is unsatisfactory. It is only too fully  realized  that the Australian Navy is dependent on the fuel oil which comes here from Sumatra or Borneo; and experts have pointed out that a couple of hostile torpedo boats, lying up in those island waters,  Could  very easily cut off our Naval supplies. In his report upon naval  defence,  submitted to the Commonwealth in 1919, Viscount Jellicoe said -

                        <para>Whilst the coal question is in a highly dangerous state, the supply of oil fuel to  ships  on the large scale that would be necessary in the event of active service is equally unsatisfactory. The whole question should be treated as very urgent. In this connexion, it is noted that the reports on the shale oil field in northern Tasmania are uniformly most satisfactory. It is very desirable that early action should be taken in developing this source of supply. </para>

Steps are being taken in that direction. I thoroughly agree with the honorable member for South Sydney that if a bounty is given to a company to produce shale oil, and our Navy requires that commodity, its export should be prohibited. If the proposal of the Government is that the bonus shall be granted more upon the refined product than upon the crude oil, it will be in keeping with the views and desires of all those who originally supported the bounty principle. Here, we have a company which is  spending  a very large sum of money in erecting refineries. The true object of  the  bonus is now, perhaps, for the first time, about to be given application. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire some information concerning the means by which the bonus is paid upon crude shale oil. I understand that the oil is transported over the railways in specially-constructed steel trucks, and that the procedure by which the quantity of oil is gauged for the payment of the bounty is to place a, measuring rod into the oil in the tank upon the truck. Suppose, however, that the tank is half full of water. I have been given to understand that it is possible that under this system of measurement a bonus can be secured upon the whole of the contents of the tank, irrespective of whether or not it is entirely oil. The suggestion is that the Government may be defrauded. </para>

Summarized, the cost of the installations, including land purchases, will be &#163;90,043. The condition of the service in Brisbane is such as to necessitate this work being proceeded with as early as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not take up the attitude that these works should not be proceeded with; but I point out that whilst we are. carrying out big works of this character in the metropolitan areas, it is not fair to the country that they should not be provided with better facilities than are being offered to-day. They are calling out for postal and telephonic conveniences, and, apparently, there is no chance of their requests being complied with. Yet we are increasing and improving the larger works in the capital cities. I believe these works are necessary, and should be carried out, and that there may be similar works in other capital cities that are equally necessary. But I question whether the country districts are given fair consideration in comparison with the cities. The expenditure on postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services is limited, and I question whether it is fairly proportioned between city and country. I am inclined to think that we spend much the greater amount in the cities. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member speaks as one who represents a city constituency, and represents it well; but whilst I take no exception to money being expended in the cities, I am asking that the country districts should get a proportionate share. I do not say that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> is at fault, but because of the difficulty of obtaining raw material and the shortage of money for many years past the country services have been starved. During the tenure of office of the last Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster),</inline> the expenses of the Department were cut down wherever possible, and very often the country districts suffered. In parts of my own electorate facilities which had been enjoyed for upwards of twenty years were taken away; but the present Postmaster-General has restored some of them. Therefore, I am making no complaint against his administration ; I am merely asking that country requirements should not be lost sight of when expenditure on postal and telephonic facilities is being apportioned. If &#163;2,000,000 were available for expenditure in this way, I do not say that the country and the city should equally divide it; but, having regard to the sparseness of the rural population, there should be a little more expenditure in the country in order to establish a fairer proportion. I avoided speaking on the Supply Bill in regard to this matter, although I would have liked to address myself to it as it affects the rural population of Australia generally. Honorable members will admit that country people are at a considerable disadvantage in consequence of the limited amount of money expended, and the difficulty in procuring the necessary appliances for telephone installations. Even where services have been established in the country the settlers have had to guarantee certain amounts to insure that the services would be payable. Even when those guarantees have been given, the services have not always been established. It is not fair to require pioneers, who desire facilities which will keep them in touch with civilization, to guarantee an amount of money in addition to the ordinary&#34; revenue, so that the service may be payable. If a guarantee against loss is to be required in connexion with every proposition of the kind, the settlement and development of the country will be retarded. When people go into the backblocks, and try to improve the country, we should assist them by giving them facilities, without asking them to pay more than is paid by subscribers in the city. I hope the Postmaster-General will not lose sight of these facts. We are on the eve of a short recess, during which these matters will require to be considered by Cabinet, and I ask Ministers to see if there cannot be a better allocation of the expenditure by the Postal Department than there has been in the past. When &#163;89,000 is being spent in one city and &#163;100,000 in some other city, whilst at the same time not even &#163;20 can be provided for. a country service, a very unfair position is created, and it makes difficult the position of those who represent country constituencies. People ask why it is that so much money can be expended upon city works and so little made available to the country, and why, even when a service is given in the country, the poor, struggling settler has to guarantee to make good any deficiency. The whole system should be altered in order to give greater encouragement to settlement. We are constantly talking about decentralization and providing for the settlement of people in country districts, and we should give practical encouragement to that idea, by providing people who do settle in the distant rural areas&#39; with reasonable facilities by which they can keep in touch with the outside world. </para>

                    <para>. -  I quite agree with the remarks made by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and I have kept that aspect of the matter in mind when dealing with the requirements of country districts. We cannot give a telephone service to every country town that asks for it without requiring any guarantee at all, but we made a very great concession last year by reducing the amount of such guarantees. For instance, if there is likely to be a deficiency of  &#163;20,  we ask the people to be served to guarantee  25  per cent, of it, the Department providing the balance. I am doing all I can with the funds at my disposal to extend the facilities in the country districts as far as possible. As a representative of a rural constituency - and a pretty rough one in parts - I know the wants of the people in the country, bub we can expend only what money the Treasurer is able to give us. Last year he allowed u3  &#163;900,000,  which was considerably more than the vote for the previous year, and he has allowed us to anticipate a vote of  &#163;900,000  for the current year by ordering material in advance so that it would be coming to hand this year, instead of our having to wait until the money was voted before placing our orders. I hope we shall be able to get more money this year in order to enable us to overtake arrears of work. I assure the honorable member for Hunter that I am fully alive to the necessity for extending all these facilities. </para>

                    <para>.^ The honorable member for Hunter  (Mr*  Charlton) spoke of the requirements of people in the country districts. I assure  the honorable member that there are people in the city requiring telephones more urgently than do people in the country. If I were to describe the disabilities in connexion with the telephone service in Sydney, the honorable member would agree that, by comparison, the country is being &#171;very fairly dealt with. In anticipation of the opening of one automatic exchange, which is partly finished, one firm spent  &#163;900  three years ago in preparing its establishment for the new system, in accordance with the Department&#39;s request, but to-day that firm is without any telephone service at all. The automatic system is within two or three streets of the premises, and the firm is left entirely in the dark as to what future developments will be-. I remind country members that the facilities given to city establishments greatly assist in the conduct of their business, and reduce the cost of handling the transactions of country districts. There is one firm in Sydney that has a turnover of from  &#163;1,000,000  to  &#163;1,750,000  per annum solely iu dealings with country people, and it has frequently complained of telephonic disadvantages, which delay the conduct of business and cause a great deal of irritation to them and to their country clients. City representatives are prepared to do all that lies in their power to assist the country districts to get telephonic services, but their own districts are even worse victims of the present inadequate system than are the country districts. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am afraid that the officials of the Department are using this country city cry a little more than is warranted in connexion with these applications. About a year ago I made application for an urgent suburban service, and received in reply a very pretty little essay dealing with the necessity for the extension of telephone services in country districts, and mentioning the conditions of the isolated farmers, settlers, and so on. Seeing there was no hope of getting the suburban service, I sent in an application on behalf  of a poor, isolated, struggling farmer, and it met with the same fate. The other day I visited the locality and I found &#34;it one of the most intensely settled dairying  districts of New South Wales. The farmer who had applied for the telephone was living a little over two miles distant from the exchange. The report to the Department was to the effect that the installation of the telephone would he very expensive, as he waa the only man in the locality; but if he liked to pay &#163;162 he could have a private telephone. Failing that, the Department were unable to do anything for him. When I visited the locality I was astonished to find that this farmer was surrounded by other farmers and small settlers, all of whom could be connected with the telephone exchange at a very reasonable cost ; so I am convinced that no examination on the spot was made in that case. </para>

                        <para>- Lacking a telephone, he was isolated from other farmers and from his market just as if he had been living in that district alone. In his case the Department failed to live up to the sentiment contained in the little essay which they send to city representatives who support requests for connexions with the city exchanges. My constituency includes all sections of the community. In it are rural producers, suburbanites, and city people; everything except wheat-growing is carried on there, so I am interested in this question of an efficient telephone service for all classes of the community. We were told only yesterday by the Minister that all the money required for the purposes of the Postal Department was available. I think that statement had been made repeatedly in reply to honorable members&#39; complaints, and yet T have, over the signature of the Postmaster-General himself, a letter which discloses an extraordinary attitude on the part of the&#39; Department towards the big industries of this country. There is, at Port Kembla, one of the biggest industries in Australia, the management of which have repeatedly asked for a direct line from the Kembla works to their city office. It is situated in a district that is continually complaining of the overloading of the main line; and it is admitted that the main line from Wollongong to Sydney , is constantly overloaded, but it is stated that from want of materials the Department is unable to remedy that state of affairs. This industry to which I refer is one of the greatest users, and, therefore, the construction of their private line would greatly relieve the public line. The management have offered to supply the wire for a direct telephone line to Sydney and pay the rent, which I think, amounts to &#163;5 or &#163;6 per week. The letter from the Postmaster-General contains a number of interesting conditions which have to be complied with before the service may be given, and after the hopes of the people interested have been raised in this way. for a couple of pages we come to the concluding paragraph in the letter - </para>

                <para class="block">This intimation is made in the face of the statement that ample sums are provided for the purposes of the Department, and in the face of the fact that if this private company were allowed to construct the line it would relieve the Department of many of its difficulties in connexion with the main, telephone line. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to know if the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> is prepared to make any statement in connexion with the extension of wireless telephony, which .is being developed in other countries of the world? In Russia, where the people are supposed to be in such a disturbed condition, wireless telephony has reached such a stage that it is possible to carry on conversations over a distance of 3,000 miles, and I gather from information which I have that numerous power stations are established throughout that country. In Australia, with a scattered population and long distances, wireless telephony would be a great boon to the people. I should, therefore, be glad if the Postmaster-General could indicate if his Department is keeping in touch with the advanced experiments that have been made in other parts of the world, and from which it is likely we would reap some important advantages. </para>

                <para class="block">I was very much surprised when I found that there was no trunk line telephone communication between Sydney and Brisbane. I had the matter submitted to the Public Works Committee, which, after due consideration, expressed the opinion that a trunk line should be erected as proposed, and recommended accordingly. The report of the Committee states that the revenue to be derived from this trunk line is estimated at  &#163;2,250  for the first year, rising to  &#163;5,100  in the second year. In the first year it is estimated that there will be a loss of  &#163;601.  That loss was first estimated at  &#163;970,  but it was found possible to take the smaller amount owing to the fall in the price of copper wire. In reply to the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> I may say that I told him some time ago that the Government are establishing wireless communication between Camooweal and Powell&#39;s Creek, and canvassing the various stations with a view to the erection of wireless plant in order that there may be communication with the terminal stations, and so with the whole of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the expert or manager of one of the wireless companies in Sydney travelled on the. same ship as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to England, and it would be interesting to know whether we may expect developments in this method of communication between two States, or throughout the States. If wireless is to be established throughout Australia, in the near future, there will be no need for the proposed trunk line. I understand that the Prime Minister is very anxious that there should be general wireless communication throughout the Empire, and, if that be possible, it certainly should be easy to have wireless between one State and another. </para>

                <para class="block">I should like the Postmaster-General to consider whether he cannot expend pub-&#39; lie money in a more remunerative way than in the construction of a telephone line between Sydney and Brisbane. Where services can be established and become immediately payable, they ought to be established before the Department undertakes works such as that proposed, especially when we find the Public Works Committee estimating the loss on the first year at &#163;60 1. I understand there are many Queensland proposals, telegraphic and telephonic communications that would pay immediately, and it is to these that attention should be devoted, and not to others, where success is problematical. It may seem strange for me to take up such an attitude; but the great work before us is the settlement of people on the land and in our country towns. We see huge cities like Sydney and Melbourne growing, while country towns are being depleted; and, after all, this trunk line will only tend to still more centralize business in Brisbane and Sydney to the further detriment of the inland centres. If there is any urgent business as between Brisbane and Sydney, it can now be done by telegraph. Although the evidence given by the Deputy Postmaster-General, Brisbane, is not altogether consistent, that gentleman finally told the Public Works Committee that it is problematical whether the proposed line will ever pay. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> can have read very much of the evidence taken by the Public Works Committee in regard to this particular matter. That evidence was overwhelmingly in favour of the construction of the proposed line. If the honorable member will take the trouble to carefully read the evidence, he will see that every witness called by the Committee was in favour of the erection of this particular line. The facts and figures which were submitted convincingly prove that the undertaking will prove a sound financial proposition from its very inception. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. We should thus be practising true economy. What is the position of the north coast of New South Wales ? It is only during the past nine or ten years that that district has come into prominence. For years the residents there struggled to obtain a railway, and eventually the Government of New South Wales decided to construct one. Since the construction of the north coast railway the district through which it passes has gone ahead by leaps and bounds. Settlement has greatly increased there, and many big estates have been cut up. That railway will eventually link Sydney with Brisbane, and the telephone line between the two cities might well follow it. The honorable member for Cowper advocated this before he entered the House, as he has done since, because he knows the justice of it, and I, who represent a portion of the district through which the line would pass, hold the same view about the matter. At present, the people of that district cannot get the telephone communication that they need. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that a telephone line between Brisbane and Sydney is not needed. My argument is that it would be cheaper to take it along the route of the north coast railway, which will ultimately be the direct route to Queensland, because it is more than 100 miles shorter than the present route. I believe that it would be well to send back the proposal to the Works Committee for the investigation of this suggestion. </para>

I do not take exception to expenditure which is absolutely necessary, because I believe in giving all the facilities for communication that can be given to the people in the country districts, and the necessary connexions between capitals should be made; but I .still think that it would have been better to take this line along the more direct route to Brisbane.

The Committee points out that the- proposed  line  would be, utilized for both telephone and telegraph purposes, the interest on its capital cost being divided between the two services; and that it would pay from the beginning. The report says that the Committee, after carefully considering all the facts placed before it, was unanimously of the opinion that the line should &#39;be erected as early as possible. </para>

                        <para>The Committee took evidence in regard- to this matter in Melbourne, and constituted a Sectional Committee to take further evidence in Western Australia. </para>
                        <para>In the course of the Committee&#39;s  investigations,  it was ascertained that this Perth to Eucla line really forms a section of the through Inter-State line between  Perth and Adelaide; and that the existing lines are insufficient to dispose of telegraph business within a reasonable time. The actual number of telegraph messages carried daily during 1920 is stated to have been 3,216, and, as the indications are that this traffic is rapidly increasing, it is urged that necessity exists for the erection of a new line to deal with this traffic. </para>
                        <para>The coast line, which it is proposed to Tei place by the line now under consideration, is 1,006 miles in length, and was brought into use in the year 1878. It is an iron wire of a weight of 400 lbs. to the mile, and this fact and the fact that it is in close  proximity- to the coast leads to heavy leakage of current,  which has the effect of : considerably slowing . down the traffic. Inquiry was made as to the feasibility of re-erecting the existing line, but it was pointed out that to do this would cost approximately &#163;85,295, as .against &#163;4*2,030 for the present proposal. It was further pointed out that, &#39; in case of breakdown, the existing line .is difficult of access, and the result is that messages are often considerably delayed before repairs can be effected. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>If approval be given to construct the line now proposed, it is intended to recover or abandon the material of the existing line between Israelite Bay and .Eucla, and to recover 17G miles of wire, insulators, spindles, and. brackets between Albany and Hopetoun. </para>
                    <para>Financial Aspect. - Estimating the cost of construction at &#163;42,030, and allowing 10 per cent, to cover interest on capital, depreciation, and maintenance, it will be seen that the annual cost of this new line will be &#163;4,203. </para>
                    <para>As against this, it is estimated that the saving on the cost of maintenance of the existing service will bo &#163;3,731, and that the estimated increased annual revenue will amount to &#163;2,000, or a total amount of &#163;5,731; so that the annual saving on this project will amount to &#163;1,628. </para>
                    <para>It is pointed out that, in estimating the cost of construction of this line, the price of copper wire was taken at &#163;180 per ton. Since that time the price of electrolytic copper has fallen) so that the wire will now cost approximately &#163;130 10s. per ton. Consequently, the original estimated cost may now be reduced by perhaps &#163;0,000. 1 </para>
                    <para>While on this subject, the Committee desires tff point out that prior to the war copper was obtained for departmental purposes at the current price of electrolytic copper, plus &#163;17 per ton to cover manufacture and freight. Since that time a plant for the manufacture of copper wire has been established at Fort Kembla, New South Wales, and the wire now costs the Department &#163;57 10s. per ton more than the quoted price of electrolytic copper. </para>
                    <para>Inquiries were made by the Committee as to whether, in the case of lengthy telegraph lines of this nature, it would be possible for settlers along the route of the line to be allowed to make use of the line for the purpose of sending telephone messages, but it was stated in evidence that, as the line will be used for sending telegraph messages practically for the whole of the 24 hours of the day at fast speeds, the effect would .be to create a buzzing noise, which would render it impossible to hear  a  telephone message. The Committee, however, thinks this question merits further consideration, and hopes the Department will devise some method .of enabling facilities to be given to remote settlers to use the line for telephone purposes for a short period during the most convenient time of the day. </para>
                    <para>After a careful consideration of the facts, the Committee is of opinion that the erection of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> proposed line is justified, and recommends that the work be put in hand as early as possible. </para>

                            <para>- My difficulty is to know exactly where we are going. I do not want to agree to anything that will plunge the country into expenditure, especially at this juncture, when the Treasurer is so economical. Many public works are standing still to-day because we have not the money for them. The question is whether the line is to traverse a satisfactory route. I read all the Committee reports that come before the House as far as possible, but during the last three mouths, when we have been deal-, ing with the Tariff, I confess that I have not been able to keep in touch with them all. The Minister states that the present line has broken down, and that there is no communication at present between the two places. It will take &#163;85,000 to repair the existing line, and the Committee recommend the construction of the new line for &#163;42,000, which shows a big saving. The Public Works Committee have done good service, and are justifying their appointment. In this case they are saving the country a good, deal of money. They report that the work is absolutely necessary, and that to patch up the existing service would cost, practically twice as much as will be required for the new service. As members whose districts are traversed by the line have said nothing in opposition to it, I pre-   sume  it is in the best interests of their constituents, and, therefore, I shall do nothing to prevent the recommendation of the Committee being given effect to. </para>

                            <para>.- I take an entirely different view of the matter. It is the duty of the members of the Works Committee, while their report is before the House, to assist the Minister. I should like to hear from some of them who have heard the evidence on this matter. They should be here to back the Government up. The  chairman  of the Committee is a Western Australian, and, no doubt, would recommend that the work should be carried out. </para>

                            <para>. - The remarks made by the honorable, member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> were offered in a jocular spirit, but when they appear in cold print they may be taken literally. As a member of the Public Works Committee, I therefore tell the House that we exhausted&#39; every channel of information, and had before us witnesses who had been all over the route. We were absolutely uninfluenced by State considerations, and were convinced that the line would pay. What is more, it will afford settlers between Eucla and the transcontinental line an opportunity to get in touch by telephone with doctors, business people, and friends, and will prove a very great boon to them. These people are living in absolute isolation, and I would afford them a facility of this kind even if I thought the line would not pay. Public convenience should take precedence over all questions of .profit, so far as the services of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department are concerned. I repeat, however, that the Committee exhausted every avenue of information on the subject, both at Adelaide and Perth, and was convinced that the line would not only afford great facilities to the people, but prove a payable proposition. </para>

                    <para>. - Before we adjourn, I desire to direct the attention of honorable members to a recent decision of the House Committee, which I believe was arrived at at a very small meeting of the: Committee, and which interferes very considerably with the privileges of honorable members who do not reside in Melbourne. The matter should have been brought forward at an earlier stage, as many honorable members representing New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia have left to catch their trains, and, consequently, are not able to express their opinions. For many years past, honorable members have had the privilege during the recess of using offices at the other capital cities in which to transact their official correspondence. The accommodation provided is somewhat similar to that available in Melbourne; but the House Committee, for some reason&#39; or other which has not been disclosed, has seen fit to say that those members who do their work in other cities shall be penalized, whilst those who reside in Melbourne can take advantage of the facilities provided in this building. It is a highly improper proceeding on the part of the Committee. </para>
