                            <para>- A Select Committee has been appointed by the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia to conduct an inquiry which will undoubtedly involve a review of the exercise of Federal functions. The State Legislature is, of course, perfectly entitled to do what it thinks fit in investigating the conduct of land agents and other operators within the State ; but, before it inquires into the operations of the Federal Government, there is a proper course to be taken, and that course has not been taken. What should have been done is this : The Premier of Western Australia should have communicated with the Prime Minister of. the Commonwealth asking that the attendance of Commonwealth officers at the inquiry might be permitted, and the production of necessary papers sanctioned. That course was not taken. The only communication we have had from the Premier of Western Australia is a telegram intimating that the Legislative Assembly of the State had ordered our officer to produce certain papers. Honorable members will see that that is not the way to proceed. But I say, firmly and decisively, that it is the desire of this Government to render every assistance in its power for the elucidation of matters such as that into which the Committee is inquiring; and I have, therefore, intimated to the  chairman  of the Committee, and to the Premier of Western Australia, through the Prime Minister, that I propose to despatch an officer from Melbourne on Friday next to assist our officer in Perth in making a full presentation of the case. We have no desire to refuse useful information; but we cannot be ordered by a State Government to produce information. </para>

I do not intend to go beyond that remark. As to the intentions of this Government, we propose to go to the London market when  we  borrow. My reply to the question, "Shall we go on the American market?" is " No." </para>

Having looked into the matter, I suggest to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that there is at least one motion still before the House having reference to the speeches made by the right honorable gentleman regarding the Imperial. Conference and kindred subjects. The Prime Minister made three separate speeches, and concluded each with  a  motion. " That the paper be printed." The third pf these motions has undoubtedly been disposed of, but I contend that the other two have nqt been disposed of in accordance with the Standing Orders. The motion as put on Friday was as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>- The only motions relating to Ministerial statements which appeared on the business-paper as Orders of the Day to be dealt with on Friday last were, "No. 1, Ministerial statement as to Washington Conference re disarmament," &amp;c, which, together with certain amendments, was put and disposed of, and Order of the Day No. 2, which was a motion for the printing of a paper and certain resolutions. When I called upon the honorable member who on the previous date had secured the adjournment of the debate on that motion he rose in his place and said that it was not his intention to continue No other honorable member. Having risen to get the call from the  Speaker,  as in duty bound, I put the motion to the House, and it was passed. So far as the question of procedure is concerned, I think it well to explain that the only matters that I have before me are those set out on the business-paper, and that it is for the Government to arrange its business as it thinks fit. Speaking, however, from recollection and subject to correction, my impression is that, although the Prime Minister made two separate statements, he desired that they should be covered by the one motion. That is how I and the officers of the House understood the position, and that is 'how the business was set down on the notice-paper as printed. In any case, it would be too late now to raise a point of order in regard to this matter. The time to raise it was when the matter was before the House. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Honorable members are aware that this is a Supply Bill for one month only. I know of nothing in it that is of a contentious character, but if there be any votes that need explanation I shall be glad to give it. The total sum asked for is £1,997,262. The amount now asked for, together with the amounts granted in the two Supply Bills already passed provides for the expenditure to the end of October. Provision is made for salaries payable on the 14th and 28th October. The position in regard to supply is as follows: - The total of the three Bills aggregates £9,618,065. There are special payments which should be deducted from that sum before one arrives at the ordinary normal expenditure forecast and recognised in the Supply Bill. For instance, there is an. item of £1,319,881 for interest and sinking fund payable to the British Government, and included in the last Supply Bill. Then there is the Treasurer's Advance of £1,500,000, and arrears of overseas mails payments amounting to £200,000. These amount to £3,019,881, and if we deduct that from the £9,618,065, we have, net, £6,598,184 for the four months of the year. One-third of the annual votes for 1920-21,' other than the special votes for Treasurer's Advance, and interest and sinking fund due to the British Government, is £8,024,185. " Therefore, so far as the ordinary services are concerned, this Supply Bill gives a total which is less by £1,426,101 than for the similar period in last year's votes. The interest and sinking fund payments referred to were included in the Supply Bill No. 2, and were payable on the 30th September under the funding arrangement, which has already been presented to Parliament. The £200,000 for overseas mails was included in the first Supply Bill, and represents arrears due to the British Government in respect of mail services during the year. The present Supply Bill includes provision for four months' expenditure on a number of relatively small items. The expenditure to date under these heads has been temporarily charged to the Treasurer's Advance, but is now included, in Supply in order that the Treasurer's Advance may be recouped. Apart from these items, the Supply covers the usual month's requirements, except in a few cases where the expenditure under the vote is not payable in regular amounts each month. Sometimes we have amounts that cannot be divided into twelve monthly parts, and then the rule is to take, sa}', &amp; quarter or a half year as the payment has to be made. That is the case, for instance, with the payment of £53,115 which is included in this Bill as payment to the South Australian Government to make good the loss on working the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta Railway. This amount is payable on the 15th October, and if it is not paid then interest will be charged until 'the. date of payment. This arrangement is in accordance with the agreement with South Australia, which provides for the payment of the loss within one month from the date of the presentation of the balance-sheet. That is why this item is included in this Bill, under the arrangement we have with the South Australian Government. Whether the arrangement is satisfactory or not does not very much matter now; we have to pay our debt in this respect. </para>
                <para class="block"> The Supply Bill includes several amounts under the heading of war services for the settlement of old war accounts. When we reach the Estimates honorable members will find that we are still paying war obligations. The other day I saw that a. gentleman had been writing to the newspapers and asking whether the Treasurer had forgotten that the war is over. There is no danger of the Treasurer forgetting any such salient fact. The war is over, but payments on account of the war are not, and will not be for some time to come. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> that this is a Supply Bill covering only the requirements of administration in regard to the payment of the public servants, old-age and invalid pensions, soldiers' pensions, and so forth, and that it must be passed before the end of the week, I do not intend to deal with it at any great length, but to reserve my remarks for Wednesday next, when the Budget will be before us. It is very- evident that the Treasurer is endeavouring to keep within the proportion of the annual estimated expenditure, inasmuch as he states that for the four months that have expired the expenditure is £1,400,000 less than the proportion estimated. I am glad in one way to know that that is so. I hope that the right honorable gentleman is keeping a careful eye on the Defence expenditure, in which I include the expenditure on the Navy, and even on the Air Service, and that he will see that there is no additional expenditure until the House has had an opportunity to express its views. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I desire to take this opportunity to deal with one or two matters. I have, as honorable members know, on very many occasions brought under their notice the treatment extended to returned soldiers in connexion with their war pensions. I am sorry to say, however, that my efforts in this direction1 have met with little or no success. It would appear possible to show here that these men are having their pensions cancelled or considerably reduced, and to get a promise that the cases will be investigated j but that seems to be* as far as one can get. Not that the promise has not been carried out; it has been carried out in every specific case in respect of which the Minister has asked for particulars. But it appears that the doctor to whom the matter is referred is the same as he who originally advised the cancellation or reduction of the pensions. There is no re-investigation by an independent person. Up till October of last year we had very little trouble in regard to soldiers' pensions. On men returning from the Front they were examined by departmental officers, who decided whether they were wholly or partially incapacitated by war service, 'and pensions were granted or refused accordingly. Last October another medical officer was appointed in New South Wales - I speak particularly of that State - who reviewed all the pensions then in existence, and reported that many of the pensioners were not suffering disability on account of warlike operations. I again urge a point, which I have often stressed previously, viz., that if 'a man was accepted by the Government as fit for active service, was sent abroad,' and returned partially or wholly incapacitated, surely we are in duty bound to see  that he  gets a pension. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I have mentioned individual cases, often only to find that they have been referred back to the same officer who originally recommended the stoppage of their pensions, and whilst he does not deny that the men are incapacitated, he says that the incapacity is not due to warlike operations. I know men who are earning only half what they earned before they went to the war, and others who are earning nothing at 'all; but their pensions have been interfered with. Parliament never intended that. It is all very well to practise economy; but it should not be practised ait the expense of men who sacrificed everything for us during the war. I contend that an independent medical officer should be appointed to re-examine these cases which are the subject of complaint. What is required is a local Medical Board before which these dissatisfied soldiers could appear, so that an independent decision, might be given as to whether or not their incapacity has resulted from warlike operations. I  thought  something like that had been done, but in reply to a question the Minister informed me recently that no additional medical officers had been appointed. Yet letters which I have received in reference to two cases refer to the applicants having been examined by a travelling Medical Board. If no additional medical officers have been appointed since October last, what is the' travelling Medical Board ? It is time that the House was informed exactly in regard to this very serious matter, which is causing heart burnings in some quarters. There are men who, because of their treatment since their return, are sorry they went to the war. Any man who has a family, and who is even partially incapacitated should be provided for by the Government. I could quote instances of men who are eager to work, and who have endeavoured to follow employment, only to find that in consequence of the disabilities they suffer through having gone to the war they are unable to do so, and they are without any income at all. I ask that the matter be given more consideration, and shall not be satisfied with a promise that the Minister will refer ft back to the Repatriation Department, because the Department will only pass it on to the medical officer who first reported, and who naturally will adhere to1 his earlier decision. These pensioners should have the right to appeal to an independent Tribunal.  I hope this is the last time I shall have to make this, appeal. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but if a man was accepted as medically fit to go to the Front and he returned from abroad, incapacitated, no matter in what way, surely his incapacity is due to warlike operations. But it appears that, in the opinion of some medical officers, a man was not incapacitated by warlike operations unless he was hit by a bullet <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> a shell. There are men incapacitated through warlike operations who perhaps never saw the firing line. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the Assistant Minister does not infer that if a man was crippled by rheumatism during active service his incapacity was not due to warlike operations. There are hundreds of such cases, and they should be provided for. Every man who was accepted for active service overseas, and subsequently came back genuinely incapacitated, should receive a pension according to the extent of his incapacity. If he is totally incapacitated he should get the full pension provided by the Act. The present method of administering the War Pensions Act is unsatisfactory. Hundreds of returned soldiers have been denied pensions, or have had them cancelled or reduced from the amounts they were entitled to receive. I do not say that a man who is .not entitled to a pension should be given one, but I claim that we ought to do justice to those who should legitimately receive pensions or sustenance from the Repatriation Department. </para>

                <para>Speaking at Bendigo yesterday, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> reiterated the advice he gave prior to his departure for England. He said that the only way in which Australia could improve its position financially and provide more employment for its people was for every one to produce more. It is advantageous to any country to produce in plenty. For one thing, it means providing- a great deal of employment; but the Government are open to the charge that they have assisted in reducing avenues of employment. Some months ago I pointed out to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> both inside and outside the chamber, that there would be trouble in connexion with the. coal mining industry. Since the war, new collieries have been opened and old collieries have been increasing their output. The men have been working as hard as human beings can work. Production has increased to such an- extent that last year 's output was a record, and this year, notwithstanding the fact that there are large numbers of coal- miners unemployed, the export of coal for the past nine months has exceeded the export for the same period last year by 700,000 tons! While the war was- in progress, the Commonwealth Government had control of coal. </para>

                        <para>- When the embargo was thus extended, stocks of coal were being built up in the other States, and there was every likelihood of the demand being lessened. I do not think that the officer on whose advice the embargo was extended knew much about the coal mining business before he received his appointment, otherwise I am sure he would not have made such a recommendation. The immediate effect of it was to prevent the Bore Hole proprietors from chartering vessels. They found that there was no profit in chartering a boat with no guarantee that it would not be laid up at Newcastle for weeks or months, subjecting them to very heavy demurrage charges. The consequence of the cessation of chartering was that the markets for our coal in the East were lost. Owing to the scarcity of coal throughout the world at that time, it was essential for those Eastern countries to get our coal, but when the Newcastle proprietors were unable to export, they had to lose their contracts with other countries. In one case, a contract to supply 100,000 tons of coal to the Philippines for naval purposes was lost, and went to Japan. At any rate, the general effect of the extension of the embargo was to considerably interfere with our foreign coal trade, and ever since the Bore Hole mines have been working only intermittently. One mine worked one day for one fortnight, five days in the next fortnight, and four days in the next, and during this last fortnight has not turned a wheel. How can the men employed in these mines live in such circumstances ? Meantime the Maitland proprietors, who were so solicitous to get the embargo extended, have been working regularly, because they have command of the Inter-State trade. </para>

                        <para>- I am endeavouring to show that, because of the increased output brought about by the men employed in the mines and by the colliery owners themselves, no steps should have been taken to curtail Australia's overseas markets. I have no desire to appeal to the Government, as I did on a previous occasion, to do something to relieve distress in the Newcastle district occasioned by the stagnation in the industry owing to the Government's action, but it will be a considerable time before we can pick up our overseas trade again. Some of it we will never recover. We can ill afford to lose it, and ought to take every step possible to increase it. I told the Treasurer, before the House adjourned a month ago, that Australia would have a surplus of 1,500,000 tons of coal above local requirements, but there is no one to buy it from us. </para>

                        <para>- No. The fact that our export has so increased only serves to prove that we have lived up to the Government's request, and produced as much coal as we could; but the Government are to blame for having cut away our opportunity for getting rid of our surplus. </para>

Japan, which has always been a competitor with Australia in the Eastern coal markets, has during the last two or three months got a better foothold, because of the Commonwealth Government restrictions at Newcastle. </para>

I do not wish to reflect on the officer at Newcastle, but men who have spent a life-time there say that he probably had not sufficient experience of the coal trade, and that no one could properly advise the Government unless well acquainted with the trade before the war. This officer, I am told, was in business in Townsville before joining the Navy, and after a short time in the Navy was appointed to the Newcastle post. It is a pity that an embargo was placed on the Newcastle coal trade, because it has interfered with the prosperity of the district. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to discuss the Budget, but there are one or ,two matters to which I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer. For many years now we have been distinctly and definitely promised by the Government that balance-sheets drawn on commercial lines would be presented to Parliament in each financial year, to show the working of the business' activities of the Commonwealth"; but so far no such balance-sheets have been submitted to us. Information of the kind to which I refer is specially needed now that the Government has embarked in the shipping business, and is expending such large sums of money in it. Parliament is justified in demanding the fullest information regarding all the business activities of the Government. Personally, I do not wish for Government interference with private industry. Governments can foster and maintain industries by giving subsidies when necessary, but the interference about which I am speaking is not beneficial. I have just returned from a visit to the north-west of "Western Australia. Every member of this Parliament desires that this continent shall be populated. Unless we develop and fill our empty spaces it will be impossible for us to retain our Territory. We cannot hold idle millions of square miles of country. But when population goes into remote districts, both the 'Commonwealth and the State Governments should endeavour to bring it into direct touch with the markets of the world. Yet some time ago the </para>

                <para class="block">Government pf Western Australia embarked in the shipping business, with the result that, whereas before the war it cost from 35s. to 37s. per head to send cattle from Derby to Fremantle, it now costs £6 10s. per head on the State steamers, and £5 10s. per head on the private steamers which trade between Singapore and Western Australia. Recently, I was informed by a large pastoralist that two and a half months ago he was £200 out of pocket by sending 500 head of cattle from Derby to Fremantle, the charges he had to meet, including freight, amounting to £S 12s. per head. He lost over 500 head of cattle, and was £200 out of pocket as well. Others have assured me that it has cost them as much as £8 15s. per head to send cattle over this route. That is one instance of the. result of Government interference with private industry. This Government has been asked what it intends to do in regard to Vestey Brothers, and the question prompts me to draw attention to the Western Australian Government Meat Works at Wyndham. The Government of Western Australia has spent something like £1,200,000, including accumulated interest, on meat works at Wyndham, and further expenditure will be needed before there is sufficient storage capacity to provide a full load for any steamer that may go to Wyndham. The working losses there during last year were no less than £63.000. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. A case like that should make us thoughtful. Then we have the report on the operations at the Cockatoo Island Dock. The loss suffered by the public through the want of. proper supervision there was very large: but things must be much worse when Government money is being expended in remote districts. I hope that the Treasurer will tell us that the most complete information will be available as to the working of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and other Commonwealth Government enterprises. </para>

                <para>Questions have been asked concerning the taxation of certain companies. In 1915 it became apparent to the Government that a special examination should be made of the transactions of certain companies, and an amendment of the law was made. The Vacuum Oil Company and the British Imperial Oil Company do most of the oil business of Australia. I understand that the former have about one-third of that business, and has paid a large sum in income taxation, whereas the latter, which has two-thirds of the business, has shown a loss on its Australian transactions. We know that it is a pup of a big combination, that it is a member of a huge Combine, of the ramifications of which I have a statement. The Income Tax Assessment Act of 1914 empowered the Commissioner, if he were not satisfied with the returns submitted to him on behalf of a company, to charge 5 per cent, on the company's business. That provision was repealed; I do not know why. These matters have been brought before the Department of the Attorney-General, and especially before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran some years ago.  His  attention has been directed to a method of doing business which seems intended to evade income taxation. .1 hope that die Treasurer will be able to tell us later what attitude the Government intend to adopt on this matter. </para>
                <para>I agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> in what, he said about repatriation and pensions. I have had brought before me recently one of the worst pension cases that has come under my notice. I? knew the man concerned years ago, on the gold-fields of.' Western Australia, when he was a prospector. In the early days he applied, for a reward for the discovery of a goldfield. When war broke out he enlisted,, although a married man with five children. I do not think he got into the fighting line, but he was sent away from: Australia, and returned practically demented. When I saw him he was almost, in convulsions, and a pitiable case. He was granted a pension, and, later, application was made for a permanent pension at the highest rate. The doctors were sure that they could cure him, and it was advised that he should enter a hospital for medical treatment. But, being almost insane, he was fearful of the doctors, and' declined to go into a hospital. When I was in Perth a medical man told me that the Department were considering the advisability of stopping his pension to compel him to do so, though the Department says to-day that that is not correct. Thecorrespondence that I have seen proves. that it waa the intention of the Government to force the man into a hospital. I have here a letter from the Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> in which, writing under date 1st November, 1920, in regard to the claim for a special rate of pension for this man, he said - </para>

                <para class="block">It is clear that up to that point the medical officers of the Department were satisfied that this was a war risk. The man had been receiving a pension for two years. The evidence shows that he- was accepted for service and sent to the Front, and that from the date of his return up to this time the departmental authorities were perfectly satisfied, as the result of medical examinations, that he was entitled to a pension. When I was in Western Australia last year, I was told that the Department was considering the  advisableness  of stopping the pension, so as to compel the man to submit himself to treatment in hospital. That action was taken contrary to the advice of the local branch of the Repatriation Department, and contrary to the opinion of the State Board. I am advised that they were opposed to the stoppage of the pension. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Kenny</inline> recommended in his report that the patient should be left quietly at homo foi: the next twelve months, and said that he did not recommend further efforts- to induce him to submit him- self for treatment, which he now thinks "would be useless." He was of opinion that the pension should be continued. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. McWhae</inline> concurred in the departmental . officers' report, "except that stoppage of pension might in the course of months induce him to accept treatment. I therefore recommend stoppage of pension." <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stawell,</inline> the expert physician referred to in the Minister's letter, stated that, in his opinion, the anti-typhoid inoculation, could not be regarded as having in any way induced or aggravated the man's symptoms, " for the disease must be regarded as having shown itself five years previously, and then remained latent." This man's wife assures me that throughout their married life he had not a day's sickness, save that on one occasion he had an attack of influenza, and that at no time before he went away did he display any symptoms of paralysis. But because <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stawell</inline> says that the disease must have been latent and that in any circumstances it would have developed in the course of a few years, this unfortunate man's pension has been stopped. </para>

                    <para>.- I should not have risen but for the statement made by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that the Government should not be responsible for the maintenance of returned soldiers who have been incapacitated as the result of diseases developing after their discharge. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> and his officers, and also the military officers, know that some of the men, when they returned from the war, could not get out of khaki quickly enough. That was not because they were ashamed of the khaki, but they had got into khaki quickly enough in order to do their duty, and, having done their duty, they wished just as quickly to return to civil life. Many of the men did enter civil life suffering from war ailments, and submitted themselves to examination by the branches and at the various base hospitals. In  the case of the medical examination at the hospitals, they were in many cases asked by the medical officers if they had anything wrong with them, and some of them were able to say that they had not, and the medical men granted and graded the pension on the word of the men themselves. These are the men to whom an injustice has been done, and there ought to be a review -of their cases. I feel sure that money spent in this direction would be well spent. These cases cannot be dealt with, in bulk, but each case must be dealt with on its merits ;.no two cases can be exactly similar, and there ought to be a Board of independent civil medical men in each district of each State, sitting as a Board of Review, to decide what pension shall be granted, according to the circumstances. In nine-tenths  of  the cases, such as that cited by the hon.orable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> the ailments have developed after the granting of the men's discharge. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. If a man on enlistment was given a certificate showing that he was fit to go to the Front, the certificate given him on his discharge should show him to be in the same perfect health before he is deprived of a pension. Every metalliferous miner suffers from rheumatics or has it in his system, and no doubt the war would develop this weakness to a greater extent than would have been the case in civil life, although, of course, -the doctors say that such men would have developed rheumatism in any circumstances. As  I  say, the best way is to judge each case  on  its merits, and to create Boards such as  I  have suggested. I feel sure that if this means of review were provided ninety nine men out of every hundred who had had to appeal to them, would decide that they had had a " fair go," no matter what the result might be. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> is at. present out of the chamber, because I desire to deal with the coal position. As I understood the right honorable gentleman, he, by way  of  interjection, said that ' the fact that some of the mines are not working today is not due to the export embargo, 'but to other causes. The reason given  for  placing the embargo on the Bore Hole coal was that it was not fair to have it only on the Maitland coal, for which an overseas market was desired.. If the Treasurer refers to his own speeches, he will find that he solemnly stated that Australia requires the whole of the output  of  Bore Hole and Maitland coal at the present time; that was one reason the honorable gentleman gave for the imposition  of  the further embargo on the Bore Hole coal. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that point. The officers who advised the Treasurer at that time evidently did not know the coal trade in any particular. I have always maintained that the embargo on the Maitland seam alone is injurious, not only to the Newcastle and Maitland people, but to the whole of the people of Australia. There is not one person in the coal trade, whether owner or miner, who does not say, not only . that there should be price fixing for the Australian coal on the Australian market, but that Australian trade should have the first call on. the coal. To show how wide of common sense the steps taken by the Government are, I may point out that, first, at the request of some people, possibly interested people, an embargo was placed on the Maitland coal only, much as it was wanted for gas-making purposes in the East and elsewhere. There was a big export trade in this coal, but it was decided that it must be retained for Australia. It should be remembered, however, that Australia requires other coals besides that from Maitland, but those requiring it had to use the latter whether they liked it or not. That went on until the whole of the Maitland trade overseas was lost. Then an embargo was put on the Bore Hole seam, thus shutting the door altogether to export. It was not many weeks before the mines began to lie idle; and now we are told by the Treasurer that the mines are idle because the Australian market is full. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Government should have from the very first appointed an officer to control the industry, and the mine-owners and shippers should have been told that Australia must be supplied first with the various classes of coal required for local use. The Government did not choose to adopt that method; it was too simple to suit some people. A bigger price was offering for coal overseas than could be obtained on the home market, and the Government thought it would be a good thing to prevent the coal-owners from getting that extra price by placing an embargo on exportation. Certainly, coal should be available to our own people at a reasonable price, but surely it would have been sufficient to assure that without preventing the producers of coal from getting the world's price for their goods on the overseas market. It would have been a simple proposition to have said " Australia must be supplied first, and, having done that, get the best price obtainable overseas for the balance." </para>

                        <para>- Nonsense! An embargo was placed on the whole of the output of the Newcastle district. When  the second embargo was imposed no coal could be sent overseas; but it is a remarkable fact that no embargo was placed on coal from the southern district or the western district, although I admit that the latter does not export. </para>

                        <para>- They did, and the result is that steamers are bunkering in the south to-day that formerly bunkered at Newcastle. Not only was the outside trade thus affected, but inside Australia trade was diverted from one part of the Commonwealth to another. We were told that after Australian requirements were supplied, New Zealand should have first call on our coal export. The Minister for Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> told us to-day that the embargo was only provisional. Does he know that only recently New Zealand imported 12,000 tons of Welsh coal, because, on account of the embargo, it could not get coal from New South Wales? </para>

That, is the result of direct action on the part of the Government, and it  is  their duty to try to repair the damage they have done. .

                        <para>- I am not blaming the officer for carrying out  hi9  instructions, but the people who imposed these restrictions. Ships had to wait three, four, and five months for permits, and many went away in ballast. The Government seem to think that they have only to remove the embargo and in a moment ships will be at Newcastle to lift the coal. But once a trade connexion is broken it takes a long time to reestablish it. This business has been so badly handled by the Government that it is their duty to try to do something to rectify the harm they have done. </para>

                <para>In regard to the cancellation or reduction of war "pensions, I support those honorable members who have contended that the Government should accept responsibility for those men whom the military doctors certified to be medically fit when they enlisted. I make no claim -for those men who shirked their duty, but in respect of others the Government should be liable for any ailments contracted by them on account of their war services. The cases of many dissatisfied pensioners have come under my notice. I know of one man who was in perfect health and weighed 13 or 14 stone when he was accepted as fit for military service, but who returned to Australia physically affected to such an extent that he can walk only with the aid of a stick. He has three children and is living in a War Service Home. He cannot get a pension, although five independent doctors, including the one who passed him originally as fit for military -service, have certified that he is incapacitated. Of course, the reply of the Department in this case was that the man in question was not suffering from incapacity as the result of warlike operations. Another phase of the question is that of the man who, possibly through arduous training or heavy marching during the war, finds that an old injury long healed up prior to his enlistment, and not affecting him in the slightest in his pre-war occupation, has begun to cause him trouble. He was passed by the medical men as fit for service ; but in all cases where any semblance of a prior injury can be found claims for pensions have been turned down. </para>

I do not say that the Government turn down these claims deliberately ; but all men are not as scrupulous as we would like th«m to be, and it is quite possible that even medical men who examined volunteers for enlistment, and passed them as fit for service abroad, would not say the right thing in the interests of these men, who, now that the war is over, are seeking their just dues from the Repatriation Department. Many cases of hardship and unjust treatment have come under my notice through the operation of the provision dealing with incapacity as the result of warlike operations. It is time that some new system was adopted by which justice could be done to claimants for pensions. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not propose to discuss the Supply Bill at any length. It does not give sufficient information to enable any honorable member to do so, but the feature about it which strikes me at a casual glance is the enormous amount provided for contingencies. I estimate that 25 per cent, of the amount authorized to be expended by the Bill is represented by contingency items, and in view of the clamour throughout the Commonwealth for economy, it occurs to me that here is a very fruitful cornucopia, or means by which departmental officers can exercise extravagance. It would be interesting to know if Ministers have gone closely into these items. For instance, although we are asked to vote not more than £700 for salaries in the office of the High Commissioner, the estimated expenditure on contingencies is £3,000. Again, in the Taxation Department, although the salaries do not amount to more than £30,000, we are asked to vote the same amount for contingencies. In quite a number of cases the vote for contingencies exceeds the amount estimated to be spent on salaries. For instance, in  the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Office, the expenditure upon salaries is £2,630, while the amount set down for "contingencies is £3,370. Honorable members who have been longer in the House may have a better knowledge than I have of the meaning of the word " contingencies," but in ordinary business life I have been accustomed to look very closely -into contingency expenditure. It is manifest that under this heading very great extravagance could occur without any person not in the particular Department spending the money being any the wiser. </para>

                <para>This occasion affords me the opportunity of calling attention to the disability imposed by the Navigation Act upon certain portions of Australia. I had intended to move the adjournment of the House in order to bring this matter under the attention of honorable members. I wish to call special attention to the effect of the Act upon Albany and the important district of which it is the port. Albany was first settled ninety-five years ago by Captain Lockyer. It was the first portion of Western Australia occupied by white people. King George's Sound, its harbor, is one of the finest in Australia, and for many years was the chief port of call for the mail boats running from the United Kingdom to Australia. It has always been a regular port of call for the boats of the White Star Line. Albany has no direct communication with the eastern States except by water or by a roundabout railway journey by way of Perth, but the White Star steamers made the port one of its ports of call and gave great convenience in passenger service and cargo trade with the eastern States and the United Kingdom. I could tell honorable members of the quantity of fruit, wheat, wool, and timber exported in this way, but I refrain from doing so, although I should imagine that the Committee would be interested in the progress and development of the large district which Albany serves, one nearly as extensive as the State of Victoria. I am not here to discuss the pros and cons, virtues, or otherwise, of the Navigation Act, but I want to point, out the disabilities it imposes upon Albany by taking away from it the facilities it has hitherto enjoyed. If, in order to give to our own shipping a trade which previously went to overseas vessels, this House passes legislation which deprives any part of Australia of certain facilities, it ought to see that the locality in question does not suffer. But Albany is suffering the loss of advantages it enjoyed in the past, and I am taking this opportunity of appealing to the Government to see that the port is fairly treated. It is the task of this Parliament to give every portion of Australia a chance of making progress in the industries it is endeavouring to develop. It' is certainly not to the interest of Australia that the development of any district should suffer by reason of the operation of the Navigation Act. In the same connexion I want to allude to the centralization tendency existing in Australia to-day. Although during the last ten years the population «of Western Australia has increased by 48,000, the population of the city of Perth, the capital of the State, has increased by 51,000 in the same period. Thus Perth has not only taken the whole of the increase, but has also robbed the country districts of 3,000 persons. Can any one regard these figures with equanimity? It is a retrograde movement. Facilities should be given to other portions- of Western Australia than the central port of Fremantle. It is true that the effects of the Navigation Act on the north-western ports of Western Australia have been temporarily suspended, but for six months only. It is altogether too short a period. On such a tenure no shipping company would undertake to maintain a service to any port. ' </para>

I do not speak now as an apologist for the Government ; but I refer to this matter because what was said was to some extent a reflection on a Committee on which, in company with the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> I acted for about nine months. </para>

                <para class="block">That Committee spent many days in the taking of the evidence of ' experts in the coal trade, concerning both the operation of the mines and the shipping of' coal. There has never been a total prohibition of exportation. While serving on the Committee, I was as active as any one in trying to provide that the export trade in coal should be considered, as far as that could be done, consistently with the supplying of Australia's demand for coal. A restriction on exportation was imposed originally at the instance of the Committee, and the restrictions developed as the Committee's inquiry proceeded. Honorable members will recollect that at the, time every part of Australia was demanding that the Commonwealth Government should do something to increase the supply of coal for local consumption. Some of the State railways had not sufficient coal for more than three weeks' working, and all of them, except the New South Wales system, were exceedingly short, and in mortal dread of trouble. </para>

                        <para>- I was going to add that industries, particularly in Victoria - because the shortage of coal was felt industrially more heavily in this State than in any other - were being crippled, and that ordinary domestic consumers of electric light, gas, and coal fuel were having to submit to irritating and hurtful restrictions. This condition of things obtained everywhere except in New South Wales, and it. was the business of the Committee to make recommendations for the improvement of the situation. So far as my knowledge goes, the Government did what was asked of it, and no more. I admit that the exportation of coal from a part of the Newcastle coalfield was absolutely prohibited. That was because the coal from that area was needed for the railways. A good deal is to be said for the forbearance of the coalowners, while the export trade was being limited, because orders were crowding in on them from abroad at prices double what they were getting in Australia, and <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> New Zealand price was not much higher than the Australian price. </para>

                        <para>- Probably I want something the Treasurer is not in a position to supply. I do not criticise the Government's shipping activities in an unfriendly and carping spirit; but I  have been for a long time alarmed at the magnitude of the expenditure, and honorable members should be supplied for their guidance with proper balance-sheets, statements of revenue and expenditure, stock sheets of values, and profit and loss accounts. We ought to know what are the values of our commercial assets today, and should not pass the Estimates until we get this information. I am prepared to make allowances for the abnormal conditions under which the shipping business was entered upon, but we are now again in normal times, and require a clear and definite statement of the accounts. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> stated the other day that he would be prepared within a few days to make a statement on the whole question of the shipping operations carried on by the Government, and that it would then be the business of the Parliament to determine whether or not those operations should be continued. Parliament is not in a position to determine that question unless it has the fullest information, and I hope that it will be forthcoming in regard to not only the shipping operations of the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth Woollen Factory, the Commonwealth Harness Factory, the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, and all other business enterprises upon which the Government have embarked. Like the honorable member for Dampier, I was never a believer in the Government undertaking business enterprises that might well be left to private citizens. </para>

                        <para>- It is a sound business argument. I have taken up this attitude for the last twenty-five years. Over twenty years ago, when State Governments first began to compete with outside enterprises, I insisted that all such Government undertakings should be submitted to the test of public tenders. In that way alone can we have a safe and effective test. If the Government, in competition with outside firms, can do certain things for the people better than they can be done for them by. private enterprise, well and good. </para>

                    in regard to the case or a returned soldier in Western Australia, whose pension has been stopped. Even if the disease from which that man is now suffering was latent at the time of his enlistment, I think it the duty of the Government to care for him, and, indeed, for all whose incapacity has arisen from similar circumstances. Even if the man had gone so far when volunteering as to induce some one else to submit to medical examination on his behalf, I would say that the Government having accepted him as fit for active service, must take the responsibility for his maintenance, just as it should be responsible .for the maintenance of every man in the community who is unable to work.
                </para>
                <para>I have had brought before me by three different Labour organizations a somewhat peculiar action, on the part of the Department of Trade and Customs. Under the Customs Act the Minister, very properly, is allowed by regulation to remove a Customs duty relating to any commodity the free admission of which is essential to an industry. In other words, if a new industry is to be established here, and the machinery required by it is not, and cannot be, manufactured in Australia, the Department would be quite justified in allowing that machinery to' come in duty free. Where a commodity is not, and cannot be, manufactured here, the imposition of a duty is not sound Protection, but mere revenue Tariffism. I agree, therefore, that it is essential in the interests of industry that such a regulation should exist under the Customs Act: It was never intended, however, that it should be' used to give preference to one manufacturer as against another. While I have at times to take up a stand in the interests of large  manufacturers who employ a great deal of labour, it is not that I have any keen desire to look after the interests of such people, but because I am convinced that unless their business enterprise can be run on financial lines it will be impossible for them to employ the people who send me here. I have been told more than once that I have been f looking after the interests of big manufacturing firms, but this explanation on my part should be a sufficient answer to all such statements. When I am told by the men working in a large manufactory that something has been done by the Department of Trade and Customs which is inimical to their interests, I must consider it. We have been endeavouring for some time to build up the confectionery industry in Australia. We began in the face of a good deal of opposition-. I can well' remember the taunts that were hurled at us when we commenced, some years ago, to endeavour to encourage the manufacture of sweets in Australia. I am glad to say that our efforts have proved successful, and that confectionery of first-class quality is being made here to-day. We have two firms which claim that their chocolates are not only as good as- the imported article, but superior to it. They have established a record business, which they claim will hold its own with that in any other part of the world, as long as they have not to compete with the cheap labour of other countries. It matters little to me whether the cheap labour which unfairly handicaps a local manufacturer is that of Great Britain or Japan. I want the local manufacturers to be as -well protected against the products of the cheap labour of Great Britain as from the output of the cheap labour of Japan. The manufacturers of chocolates in Australia started in a small way, and in many cases have built up large establishments. Their trade has increased to such an extent that manufacturers from overseas, no doubt as the result of the Tariff, have been induced to set up operations here. Nestles have spent a good deal of money in establishing their industry in Australia, and other overseas firms have also commenced the manufacture of chocolates and sweets here. Quite latterly, as the result of the duties we have imposed, an amalgamation of the firms of Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall has entered upon the manufacture of confectionery in the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pascall</inline> is in Australia to-day. The firm came along with a great flourish of trumpets, and brought with them a good deal of British capital. We have opened our arms to receive that capital, but I hope we are not prepared to do anything to the detriment of Australian capital and Australian workers. This firm has commenced manufacturing in Tasmania, where it has been able to secure cheap land and cheap power, and where, I may say in passing, it hopes also to get cheap labour. The Tasmanian Government, thinking, no doubt, that the establishment of such a factory would be a good thing for Hobart, gave the firm free of cost a branch railway line to its works. This line cost the State Government about £3,500. Then the firm approached the Department of Trade and Customs, saying, " We want to import for the manufacture of confectionery here machinery that is not made in Australia and cannot be made here. We therefore ask that it be admitted free of duty." </para>

                        <para>- I am laying the charge that- it has been so applied, and it is for the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to refute it. A secretary of one of the trade unions which are interested in the matter came to me yesterday with a letter from another secretary, and an appointment was made with a third, who told me that the Customs Department had admitted this machinery duty free, and that the effect would be to deprive Australian men of work. It is for the Minister for Trade and Customs to show that this machinery is not made in Australia  but even if it is not being made here, those who are using similar machinery already have paid duty on it, and, moreover, are paying Australian wages. If manufacturers who, in the face of great difficulty, have established this confectionery industry here, and have paid duty on the machines they use, it is only just .that duty should be paid by any new firm- entering into the field ; if not, it is indisputable that the new men are given' an unfair advantage. I must say that when I heard of the circumstances I was quite surprised, and I await the departmental explanation. When these men came to me I said that I supposed this machinery could not be made here; but my informant said, " What nonsense; the machinery associated with the confectionery trade has been made in Australia, and is being made here now, not by one firm, but by, many." There was some newspaper controversy over the matter. For instance, the secretary of the shop assistants' organization complained in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the undue advantage given to the new firm, and expressed a fear that those belonging to his union would suffer in consequence. That, of course, may be a selfish view to take, and I suppose I shall be told that the existent manufacturers of confectionery are selfish because they do not like competition. They cannot complain, however, so long as the newcomers are not given an undue advantage. In connexion with this matter the following appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> onthe 10th instant : - "It is easy to say these things, but hard to prove them," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oakley,</inline> Acting  Deputy  Comptroller of Customs, to-day, criticising a letter written by the secretary of the Shop Assistants' Union, and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> on Saturday. In his letter, the secretary said that machinery had been admitted free of duty to facilitate the commencement of operations in confectionery manufacture in Australia by overseas firms. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oakley</inline> added that he had no time to consult the files, but the policy of the Department was consistent, and he was sure that the Customs concession was not allowed in respect of any items of machinery that could be manufactured in Australia. It would be found, if the files were consulted, that Thompson's, of Castlemaine, were consulted on the matter, and that duty had been charged in respect of all such articles as that firm were capable of manufacturing. "Cadbury's have paid thousands of pounds in duty," he added. </para>

                <para class="block">I am told by one of the officials of the engineers' organization that Thompsons, of Castlemaine, deny the statement that they were approached on the question in any way. Thompsons' firm made a chilled roller refiner' for MacRobertson's in 1920, and they have delivered one since, while a third is being built for the same firm. This, I understand, is a machine of the kind that it is proposed to allow in free in the case of the new firm.. Along with two other honorable members of the House I was invited to visit MacRobertson's confectionery establishment in Fitzroy, and there, to my surprise, I found the firm making machinery for its own use on its own premises. The firm has gone to the trouble and expense of erecting and equipping a machine shop, and paying Australian wages, for the construction of the machinery required, and now it is asked to compete with cheap imported machinery introduced by Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall, and, as I suggest, with the cheaper labour in Tasmania. If the Government can refute the statements I have made, well and good; if not, it must be admitted that a mistake has been made somewhere. Men employed in engineering establishments are just about as conversant with, and as critical of, the work carried on in them as are their employers, and I am assured by such men that the machines required in the confectionery business are being made here, and made well. At MacRobertson's I said to one of the representatives of the firm, " Would you make these machines for other confectionery manufacturers if you were asked?" and "he replied, " Of course, I have this machine construction establishment, and I wish to keep it going." </para>
                <para>I should now like to show how extensive the manufacture of these machines is in Australia. The MacRobertson firm has made, and has under construction, machinery to the value of about £40,000, and there are other manufacturers in Australia who have turned out similar machinery to the value of £17,000 for MacRobertson's. The value of the various machines made by outside Victorian engineering firms, and used by MacRobertson's, is shown in the following: - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">Besides that list I have another of all the machinery- made by the firm of MacRobertson itself for its own use. </para>
                <para>We ought to give to the ironworkers in Australia all the work' we can; and the Customs Department is remiss if it allows commodities to come in duty free when they can be manufactured here. No doubt, Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall, when they came " spying out the land," selected their present site with the idea of producing more cheaply and underselling other firms. That is all right if it be legitimately, done, but, as I have said, I am rather inclined to think that they contemplate cheaper labour in Tasmania, seeing that the Factory Act there is not on the same level as the Factory Acts of the other States. If the Government assist this new firm under the circumstances they are not acting fairly towards either the employers or the workers already established in the same business in Victoria and elsewhere in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am more concerned about children being better housed, clothed, and fed than I am in the price of the lollies they eat; and if the honorable member will assist me in seeing that children are better housed, clothed, and fed I shall be pleased. With one exception, the confectionery firms at present in Australia have been established with Australian money, and the profits are distributed here; whereas this new company is a foreign company, whose profits will be distributed elsewhere, and this I regard as detrimental to the interests of the Australian working classes. Even at this stage I think the Minister for Trade and Customs ought to see what can be done to rectify the mistake, if a mistake has been made. If Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall are allowed to have these machines admitted duty free, then those firms which in the past have paid duty on the machines they are now using, ought to have that duty refunded. I do not know whether such a course would require a special Act of Parliament, hut it would be only just. No section of the community, through any Act of this Parliament or any Department associated with it, should be given an advantage over another section. I may be told that the attitude I am taking is parochial - that my objection is to the establishment of this new factory in Tasmania and not in Victoria. I know that the confectionery manufacturers of Australia have not reached the demand for high-class confectionery here, and that there is room for others; all I say is that if concessions are given to one firm, it will come here with cheaper machinery and cheaper labour, and enter into unfair competition with those who have built up their businesses under great disadvantages in the past. I ask the Minister for Trade' and Customs to make full inquiry into all the circumstances. </para>

                    <para>. -  When I heard that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> intended to refer to the admission of machinery under item 174 I made some hurried inquiries in order to ascertain the facts. I am not in possession of the whole of the particulars, but I find that up to the time of which the honorable member was speaking, approximately £90,000 worth of machinery had been used by the firm to whom he referred in the establishment of their works. Of that total, about one-fourth had been made in Australia. I think a little over half of the remainder was admitted in the ordinary way and paid duty, whilst in regard to the remaining one-fourth, the firm made application for the admission of the machinery under item 174 on the ground that it was not manufactured in Australia. It was highly specialized machinery, and I assumed that the Department was satisfied after the full investigation which is always made in respect of applications of this sort, that this particular plant was not made in Australia. It was on that ground alone that admission was granted under item 174. </para>

                        <para>- That may or  may not be so; it depends on the circumstances. I cannot say offhand whether or not the two machines do compete with each other. In regard to the operation of item 174, the Department works with the object, firstly, of protecting the revenue to the utmost possible extent, and, secondly s of encouraging as far as possible manufacture in Australia, whilst at the same time safeguarding the makers of those articles for which free admission is sought. There are quite a number of considerations to influence our judgment in these matters. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say whether that machinery was imported or made by MacRobertson, but when we are satisfied that a machine can be made in this country we never allow any remission of duty. If, on the contrary, we are satisfied that the machinery cannot be made locally, and a definite request is made to us for its admission free of duty, we make full inquiry, and then put item 174 in operation as Parliament intended and empowered us to do. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> represented that in some circumstances the operation of item 174 might appear to give a preference to one person over another. To some extent that is inevitable in the operation of the Tariff. One manufacturer might have established his works in 1914 when there was no duty on the- machinery he imported. Today another manufacturer, establishing the same class of factory, and importing the same machinery, may have to pay a heavy duty. Either by the imposition of duties or removal' of them . it must frequently happen in the course of years that one party has to pay duty whilst a competitor has not. v </para>

                        <para>- That depends. If it is shown definitely that this particular class of machinery is not made in Australia, and the Minister decides that under those circumstances it should be admitted free of duty, I do not think he should take into consideration the fact that in days gone by some other person may have paid duty. If he were to enter into considerations of that kind the duty could never be lifted from a particular article. The operation of item 174 is very complex, and I have asked Parliament to relieve me from the responsibility of its administration by the creation of an Advisory Board; but we have tried to do what is right, and ~I am satisfied that it will be found on a full investigation of the whole of the circumstances, that in this instance the Department has not erred. </para>

I read correspondence to show that, whilst the <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba</inline> landed passengers at Albany, stud stock that was being imported for the adjacent district was not landed, but was carried on to Fremantle, and thence railed over 200 miles to its destination. I further said that this action was too preposterous to be allowed by any Government to continue ; so I wired to the honorable member for Katanning in the State Parliament, who had reported the circumstances to me, and asked him if it was not through some State quarantine legislation that the stock were not allowed to land 'before examination.

That is the way our rural industries are developed. I bring this matter under the notice of the Government in the hope that if they are giving any preference to local shipping firms under the Navigation Act they will see that those firms provide the facilities which are necessary for the development of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The Victorian confectionery manufacturer to whom the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> referred was unable during the war to obtain machinery models from abroad, and started his own workshop at considerable expense. He made his own models, and purchased lathes and other machinery at high prices in order to supply Australia's requirements of confectionery. It has been stated that the other firm which is now importing machinery made inquiries in Australia, and discovered that the class of machinery required was not manufactured in the" Commonwealth. Machinery makers, who were able to make these machines have denied that any such inquiry was made of them. It might not be thought that confectionery business requires a large engineering establishment, and honorable members may be surprised to learn that the pattern makers, turners, fitters, and others employed in the production of machinery by the Fitzroy firm number fifty-two. It is a serious thing for the Department to give one firm advantages over its competitors. MacRobertson is not the only confectioner who is affected by the concession that has been given to Cadbury. It seems that an error has occurred through mismanagement. If a person required a, sewing machine he should not be entitled to import one under item 174 simply because the machine made in Australia was not the brand which he preferred. It is the height of stupidity to say that there is anything so complicated that it cannot be made' in Australia. Such a statement is an insult to the industrial and professional sections of the community. Of course, departmental officers, like all other human beings, are likely to err, but I hope that in the future nothing of the kind will happen and that thorough inquiry will be made by officials as to whether the machinery required can be made in Australia before they permit it to be imported free of duty. </para>

                <para>I desire to refer to a matter in regard to which I have been able to obtain no satisfaction. About eighteen months ago a man was appointed to the postal service as a temporary employee, and after serving, apparently to the satisfaction of the Department, he was . dismissed without rhyme or reason. <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> was discovered that he was the father of six children and that under the basic wage award he was entitled to an increased payment on that account. The Government sacked him on the day following that discovery, and a returned soldier was appointed to the vacancy. I know, a good deal of the spirit that animates returned soldiers, "and I do not Relieve that any of them desire to put out of work a man who has six children to support. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see that no other cases of a similar character occur in his Department. I tin der stand that any person who wishes to export metalliferous ores or concentrates must do so through the Metal Producers Association, and make a sworn declaration as to the consignees overseas.. This information is supposed to be secret, but, nevertheless, the purchasers abroad frequently .find that certain people in London are fully informed of the fact that they have bought this material, and they are told that if they attempt to make any f  further  purchases from Australia they will be prevented from doing so. I want to know how this information, which is supposed to be kept a close secret here, can get abroad in this way, where it can be made use of to the disadvantage of purchasers of pur ores? The Broken Hill Proprietary are the principal members of the association here, in fact, they practically control it. Evidently their monopoly of the metal products of Australia is not sufficient to satisfy their gluttonous wants, and they are seeking to extend their control to the other side of the world. At any rate, if the Government compel these sworn declarations to be made, they ought at least to see that the information supplied is kept a close secret. I shall not occupy any time now in commenting upon the stupid blundering of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> in his conduct of the issue of the recent Diggers' loan. The cost of the flotation was tremendous. However, I shall deal with that matter upon the Budget. </para>

                    <para>. -  I want to emphasize some remarks I made on the adjournment of the House the other day in reference to the cases of soldiers who have been refused the maintenance given to soldiers in military hospitals, because military medical men have sent them to military wards in civilian hospitals. For a long time I have tried to get a hearing for these men's claims, but the responsible Ministers tell me that the matter has been made one for Cabinet decision, and that the decision is adverse to the men. I fail utterly to understand how Cabinet could have arrived at such a decision. No. 4 Military Hospital at Randwick having become filled, provision had to be made elsewhere for patients. Accordingly an arrangement was made with the Prince Alfred Hospital, a public institution' in Sydney, so that a ward could be set aside for military patients. The men selected to be sent to that hospital were the very worst cases at Randwick at the time. They were the men who had come back from the war unfitted to fight the battle of life. It was quite natural that these men who had suffered most by their devotion to the cause of their country should expect to bs treated in exactly the same way as they would have been treated had they remained at Randwick, but they found themselves deprived of privileges enjoyed by patients in military hospitals who went later to the war, and came back with less injuries. I cannot understand how patriotic men, looking at a case of this kind, could take up the attitude Cabinet has taken in regard to it. These men have every claim to the treatment meted out to those in military hospitals. There is nothing to differentiate- between them and the patients in the Randwick Military Hospital, except the fact that they were sent to a military ward in a hospital a few thousand yards away. It is pathetic to have these men approaching one in the condition of these sufferers. They are deprived of the opportunity of earning the livelihood they had before they enlisted. They have suffered the highest degree of penalty in the service of their country. Their claims upon us are greater than are many we have recognised since the war, and I appeal again to Cabinet to reconsider their position, and at least do justice to those who, by direction of the military doctors, have been compelled to leave military hospitals and go to military wards in civilian hospitals. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry I cannot agree with the statement of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foley)</inline> that the Government are out to do justice to returned soldiers. My experience has been that very often the Government have done everything but , justice to many soldiers whose cases have come under my notice. I could give many specific instances which have led me to come to that conclusion, but to-day I shall refer only to one with which I have been dealing for the last twelve months. It is the case of Private McDougall, of Hilltop, near Mittagong. I am not sure whether he was married before or after his period of service, but he has now a wife and a baby twelve months old. Immediately he came back from France he was granted a pension, and it was paid to him for a while. However, he was taken ill, in fact, his life was despaired of, and just at that time, when the wife was agitated and disturbed about whether the life of the husband would be saved, an edict went forth from the Repatriation Department to the effect that the pension had been cancelled. The Department knew the circumstances of the case, and surely common humanity would have dictated a better time for letting the axe fall. The man eventually recovered a little, but he is to-day a helpless invalid. The only means of sustenance he and his family have are the possible earnings of the wife, who has also to nurse a sick husband back to health and look after her baby. If this is the way in which the Government propose to treat returned soldiers, they are not only false to the promises they made to the men prior to enlistment, but are also failing to act according to the dictates of common humanity. I went to the Department in connexion with this case. I wrote numerous letters. I was told that Private McDougall had received every consideration. I then wrote to the Minister, and finally I was told that it was of no use my proceeding any further in the matter, because the medical testimony was that the man had not contracted his illness from war-like operations, but had the germs of the complaint from which he is suffering in his. system prior to enlistment. I ascribe the action of the Department to the attempt on the part of some one to cheese-pare. Some one is endeavouring to economize in repatriation expenditure so that the money thus saved may be spent in another direction. While the Government is cheese-paring and depriving men of their rights, it proposes to spend immense sums on armaments and military preparations. It proposes to spend nearly £1,000,000 more on the preparation for the killing and maiming of men, and yet allows other men who fought in defence of their country to remain helpless in sickness, and will not put forth a hand to help them. I have brought before the Department the case of a hopeless invalid whose wife has to nurse him while trying to earn a living for him and for their child. This man received a pension for a time, when he could do a little work, but it was stopped when he was stricken with illness and almost at death's door.  His  is a case which carries absolute condemnation of the Government's treatment of returned soldiers. Obviously the direction has gone to the Repatriation Department to cut down useless expenditure wherever it can. </para>

                    <para>.- The first matter about which I shall speak is the need for doing something for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Lawson, the greatest writer whom Australia has yet produced. I think that we might well stretch a point to help this man now that he is sick and in trouble. I need not speak of Henry Lawson's work.  His  writings are familiar in every household throughout Australia, and well known to the world at large, but he himself lies in poverty and sickness in a public hospital near Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawson</inline> draws £1 a week from the Australian Men of Letters Fund, but the Minister in charge of that fund, in answer to a question asked to-day by the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> said that the allowance could not be increased because the fund was practically all allotted. I do not question the truth of the reply, but in view of the services that Henry Lawson has rendered to Australia in literature and art, the least we can do is to provide him with the necessaries of life now that he is practically down and out. I think that the Commonwealth should see that he is given an income sufficient to maintain him in decency. </para>

                        <para>- No ; he, has nothing but the allowance that I have just mentioned. Lawson has given of his best to Australia, and has done much to place Australian sentiment on a high level. His writings have advertised this country throughout the world. I am not mentioning this matter by way of finding fault with Ministers; but I urge the Government to do something for this unhappy genius. </para>

                        <para>- No. It is not a case for bargaining. I feel sure that my suggestion will be received sympathetically by the honorable gentleman and by the Treasurer. I hope that Australia, at least, will see that her literary men when sick and in trouble are not left uncared for, as the geniuses of many countries have been in the past. Not a few of those whose works and names the world now holds in the highest honour were allowed by their fellow countrymen almost to die in the gutter. </para>

                        <para>- I shall now refer to a matter -that calls for a rather full explanation from the Minister in charge of shipbuilding, and that is the action of his Department  in  either hiring or leasing the ferry boat <inline font-style="italic">Biloela</inline> to a firm known as the Island Transport Company. 'There surrounds this transaction something which needs clearing up. It will be remembered that the management of Cockatoo Island has been materially altered. The Government have placed the Island under a Board of Control,  which, has seen fit to alter many of the conditions existing before it took charge. Acting under instructions from the Minister, the Board on taking over its duties ceased to convey the workmen from the mainland to the Island free of charge, and  informed  them that they would have to make their own arrangements. The only course open to them was to make some scratch arrangements with motor launch proprietors, and the result was that the launches were dangerously overcrowded. </para>

                        <para>- I was just coming to that point. The representatives of the men waited on the Board of Control and said that, as they were no longer to be carried to and from their work free of charge, they were prepared to lease or hire the ferry boat <inline font-style="italic">Biloela</inline> at whatever the Board might consider to be a fair charge, and that failing, that if the Board would undertake to run the boat they would pay whatever fare it considered to be reasonable. That was a very fair offer, but the Board under instructions from the Minister contemptuously rejected it. The  chairman  of the Board of Control, in a contemptuous manner, laughed at the men when they made the offer, and said, " You cannot lease the boat." The agitation still went on. I continued to draw public attention to the way in which the motor launches running between the mainland and the Island were being dangerously overcrowded and then secretly - behind the backs of the workmen at Cockatoo, and behind the backs of the people of Australia - an arrangement was entered into with a private firm to charter the <inline font-style="italic">Biloela to</inline> convey the men to and from (heir work. The workmen said, " This is not fair to us. Who are the people to whom this 'boat has been leased?" They discovered that the arrangement had been made with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> W. Scott Fell, one of the staunch political friends and supporters of the Nationalist Government.  In a secret way - behind closed doors - an arrangement was entered into with the Island Transport Company to charter this huge ferry boat, which is quite as large as the ferry boats which ply between Circular Quay and the north side of Sydney Harbor, for a payment of £15 per week. The men, however, refused to travel by the boat. I want to know first of all why this arrangement was secretly made, and, secondly, why when the Island Transport Company found that the running of the boat was not a paying proposition the Government relieved them of their liabilities under the lease. The Minister must give some reply to these inquiries. If it were desired to lease the boat, why were not public tenders invited? Why was it not open to any one to tender? Why was this arrangement made behind the backs of "the workmen? After all, the . Island Transport Company is only a " cuckoo " concern formed for the particular purpose of running this ferry boat. On proceeding to the RegistrarGeneral's Office to discover who were the shareholders in the company, I found that its registered office was given as "16 Loftus-street,' Sydney." I discovered, further, that the company was registered with a capital of 1,000 shares of £1 each. That at least is the statement set out in the prospectus. A list of shareholders has not been filed in the Registrar-General's office. I found that there had been filed there the names of only seven shareholders, the minimum requirement under the Companies Act. The list ia as follows: - P. J. Everett, clerk, Union Bank Chambers, Sydney, one share; J. W. Scott Fell, one share; L. C. Saunders, one share; T. A. Ferguson, one share; G. Orr, one share; J. Simpson, one share; G. W. Waddell, one share; and A. Lundie, one share. With the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> Fell, all these individuals are in the same office. This is a mushroom company, which was created suddenly for the purpose of taking over the running of the ferry boat </para>

                    When it was found to be a nonpaying proposition the Government came to the relief of their political friend - one of the men who engineers political moves for the Ministry - and freed him of his liability. The ferry boat to-day is tied up at the Island.

                        <para>- The point is that the Minister made arrangements with the company to lease the boat for £15 per week, and that when at the end of the very first week it was found that the running of it was a non -paying proposition, he immediately relieved the company of its liability. The fact that the company had the boat for such a short time makes the position, so far. as the Government is concerned, still worse. It goes to show that collusion existed between the Minister at the head of the Department and the Island Transport Company, which is really <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> Fell, of Sydney. The Minister refused to give the men an opportunity to tender for the leasing of the boat. He refused to allow them or any one else, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> Fell, to lease the <inline font-style="italic">Biloela..</inline> Will he now give the men or any private firm an opportunity to obtain the boat on the same terms? It is for the Minister to explain this matter. Will he also explain why representatives of the . citizens of North Sydney, who waited upon the Board of Control, and asked that the boat be leased to them, so that they might compete with the monopolistic Sydney Ferries Company, were refused an opportunity to lease it? The Parliament should demand an explanation of the whole matter. </para>

                <para>While dealing with Cockatoo Island, I desire briefly to refer to another incident relating to it. A young man named  Sheiles,  who takes a prominent part in trade union matters, and was secretary of the Vigilance Committee at Cockatoo Island a short time ago, obtained the Labour indorsement of his candidature for the Federal constituency of Illawarra at the next Federal elections. Almost immediately following the public announcement of that fact he was barred from obtaining work at Cockatoo Island. The door was slammed on him. This is a clear case of victimization. First of all, because he is a prominent unionist; and secondly, because he is to- oppose one of the Nationalist members at the next general elections, he is debarred from obtaining employment at Cockatoo1 Island. He is  victimized  and prevented from obtaining his livelihood in Sydney. I hope the Minister will also look into that matter. </para>
                <para>I wish now to address myself to the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers).</inline> I have here three or four cases of almost vital importance. I shall not mention the names of the individuals concerned, because I do not think it right to make public the private affairs of individuals. I shall hand the Minister the papers in reference to all these cases. The first is that of a man to whom I shall allude as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A,</inline> who enlisted and did three and a half years' service abroad. He and a number of other  men, however, committed some military offence, for which they were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. The complaint I have to make is that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A</inline> applied for his war gratuity he was told that under section 6 of the Act he could not obtain it, inasmuch as he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding twelve months, whereas other men, who committed the same offence, and some of whom were sentenced to a longer term of imprisonment than that which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A</inline> was required to undergo, obtained their gratuity bonds. Will the Minister explain why this man's application was refused ? </para>

                        <para>- No; but I wish to see this man receive his bond. However, I have another similar case of a man who was absent without leave during service, and received ninety days' field punishment. After he had served his ninety days he was deprived of all his pay at ls. per, day, amounting to £46 4s., and of his deferred pay, amounting to £73 3s. Remember that this money had been earned before the offence was committed. </para>

Of the eight men three have received their gratuity bonds, while the others did not, and amongst , the latter is the man to whom I am referring. Why was this man's gratuity stopped ? This is the sort of thing that is bringing the administration into ridicule ; and I hope steps will be taken to remove the stigma of favoritism which the cases seem to imply. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not intend to speak to-night on. .the general proposition, but merely to bring forward a couple of definite cases on behalf of returned men. However," since the, matter of the coal position has been raised by the honorable member for New - castle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins),</inline> I wish to say a word or two regarding it. The coal position is a very serious one for Newcastle, and, indirectly, for the whole of Australia. Unfortunately, here, as everywhere else, when such a question is raised a great deal of class feeling is shown. We had the honorable member for Newcastle claiming that the fault is all on the side of the Government, and the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> claiming that the fault is all on the side of the men. That seems £o be the chief trouble in our coal business. There can be no question that on many occasions the miners themselves have been to blame for stoppages of work; but on this occasion - and I happen to know something of the matter - the chief fault lies in Government interference. When the Government imposed the restriction on the Maitland coal they went a long way to stopping the development of the coal propositions in the north, where there are scores of possible propositions awaiting to be worked. The coal wealth of Newcastle and the northern districts is practically unlimited. There are many places where some of the old seams are still awaiting opening up, while new seams are calling every day for capital investment: but when the Government imposed this re striction they immediately put a damper on all attempts at further development. And the Government were not satisfied with this; finding they had disturbed the position, they went further and put a restriction on Bore Hole coal, which resulted in confusion worse confounded. It is now extremely difficult to get any one to invest money in the development of the tremendous coal, wealth of Sew South Wales. </para>

We used to be afraid of the restrictions that were threatened by the Labour party. Many a time I have stood on the public platform and warned the people that if the Labour party attained to power they would impose restrictions that would interfere with primary production. But no restrictions the Labour party have ever placed upon primary production have been worse than the way in which the present Government have treated the coal industry in New South Wales, and I hope that as the Treasurer has removed the restrictions on coal, the Government ' will extend that policy by removing the restrictions from all articles of production, and giving the producers fair play. </para>

The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> may take a different view, but I have been connected with the wool industry all my life, and I know a great many leading men in the production and disposal of wool. Whilst some people may hold the opinion that these restrictions have helped them, those engaged in production have infallible proof that 'they are doing more harm than good. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has told us that the export trade in coal has been lost because other countries are producing more cheaply. I would like the right honorable gentleman to tell us where production is cheaper than in Australia. " </para>

                        <para>- Yes; that is because the railways are better managed in America than in Australia. The fact is, however, that despite the Government's interference, Australia can put coal on the boat for export as cheaply 'as can any country in the world t quality for quality, and if the Government will leave the industry alone we can defy competition. The only reason why I speak on this subject to-day is that I wish to remove the idea that there are only two points of view in regard to Coal, and those two points of view must depend on the class to which the  speaker  belongs. The coal question is a wide and broad one, and our minds should no more represent the men than the owners. The two interests are, in their broad issue, one. The influences that tend to the increased production of coal make for the benefit of both -owners and miners. 'I deprecate the cross firing which took place this afternoon, one member speaking only for the men - a position into which he was driven - and another member speaking only on behalf of the owners, thus antagonizing the two interests, which, if they work together, will make Australia one of the greatest coal producing countries in the world. But while the Government interfere and antagonisms between miners and owners are fostered in this House and throughout the country, we shall have little chance of exploiting the enormous wealth of coal which, is awaiting development. </para>

                <para>In this Chamber I have often mentioned various complaints concerning returned soldiers, and when I have spoken on general principles I have been told that there are so many individuals to deal with that there must be individual complaints, and that merely general complaints lead nowhere. I shall to-night deal with individual complaints by quoting two letters that are fair samples of those I receive every mail. These cases are not isolated; there are scores, hundreds, and almost thousands of them. The first letter relates to an application for a War Service Home, and is as follows : - </para>

                    <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline> I would like to know if you could give a little assistance in the matter of my application for a War Service home. I  will just state my case, and if you think it a genuine grievance I would esteem it a favour if you could give me a help along with my application. Last October, I sent in an application for a War Service home. I filled in my application under the mortgage system. Under that system one has to guarantee 10 per cent, of the* £800 made available under the Act. - I explained in my application that I would give to the War Service Homes Commissioner my £50 15s. gratuity bond and a £50 war bond as my 10 per cent, deposit. I also sent in a memorandum of transfer, plan, and a certificate granted, by the Scone Shire of the block of land I have bought. I was in Sydney a month after I sent in my application, and called at the War Service Homes Office. I was taken to a gentleman there, and we both went over the application. He told me that my gratuity bond and the price of the land, which is £50, would stand for my de- posit, and that my f 50 war bond was not required. He also informed me that my application was marked urgent, and that I was to go back home and everything would be along in due course. Later on, a gentleman came along to see my block of land, for which I had to pay£1 ls. I did not hear any more for a long time, and I wrote the Department again, but was told that my application would not come forward again until after 27th July. My father was in Sydney, so I told him to call and see what they were doing in the matter. They informed him that I was first on the list after 27th July. About two months ago, the Department sent me along the memorandum of mortgage forms to get signed, and I was to send on my gratuity bond, which I did. I also paid another bill for £4 63. Altogether, the War Service Homes Commissioner has received from me £5 7s., plus my bond for £51 15s., and up till the present I have received nothing. I have paid rates amounting to 3s.9d. to the Scone Shire. At present, I am living in Aberdeen, paying 10s. a week for a house, and as I am working with my father on Blairmore Limited it is not very handy to my work. By the month of December I will have paid in rent £26, and am no nearer to getting my application dealt with. </para>

                <para>That letter is typical. I receive similar letters in dozens, and sometimes scores. The second letter refers to a war pension, and it reads :  - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. -</inline> I have been instructed to write you concerning the case of a returned soldier, J. E. Gleeson. Considerable correspondence through the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia has taken place. He has been examined again, and the net result - his pension raised 6d., and his wife's reduced the same amount. Local people who know this man well, and the local Returned Soldiers' League, are of opinion that this man should be in receipt of half-pension rates. In conversation with the local Government doctor, he informed me that the trouble with this man is a form of sciatica and rheumatism caused through the action of malaria on the sciatic nerve. He is a bushman by trade, sleeper cutter, anything in the timber line, and a genuine worker when able, as his fellow workers have told me. He is able to work at intervals at present, but a little while' back done nothing but lie on his back three months out of six, and I understand he is classed as entitled to one-tenth pension. I guess the man who was entitled to a full pension in comparison would be dead about three times over. This man has bought a piece of land at Warnervale, about 3 miles further on. Tradespeople and other local people held a couple of socials  to raise funds to keep his payments going. He has had no assistance from the Repatriation Department. He has a wife and child. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That letter is also typical of cases which so excite the sympathy of the local people that they go to the trouble of raising funds by concerts and other means. Yet these men, who undoubtedly suffer war disabilities, are being refused a reasonable rate of pension. I ask the Minister to make a note of these cases, but I draw attention to the fact that these things are happening every day and all over Australia. The cause of the trouble is beyond our ability to determine. One is constantly battling for these cases and, in respect of the majority, is ultimately successful. But it takes a long time to get justice, and meanwhile the soldiers, and often their wives and children, are in dire distress. </para>

                        <para>- We should not. The whole process should be automatic These men should be receiving at least something of what they were promised before they went to the front. What hurts me most is that not only are the men suffering, but their unfortunate wives and children are in distressing circumstances. In the different cities of the Commonwealth women have come to me with tears running down their faces to tell me of the trouble they have been experiencing. Some of them are women who have been well reared and desire to rear their children well and give them a proper start in life, in recognition of the circumstances in which they were born and the traditions of their fathers. Some of these women, with their children, are living on money that was left them by deceased soldier relatives and parents. Others are almost starving, and their circumstances are such as to make a man feel ashamed of his country. I have put before the Treasurer a suggestion which has found favour with the Soldiers' Leagues throughout the Commonwealth, that something should be done to help women who are unable to earn a living. Nobody wants the total spent in pensions te be increased, but we desire it to be allocated in a proper manner. There are some people drawing a pension who, though they have a right to it, have no need for it. The pensions voted by Parliament are sufficient, but the allocation of them is all wrong. The only way to meet the situation - and this suggestion has the approval of soldiers generally - is that the widow should be given a pension, in much the same way as disabled soldiers are, according to their disability to earn a living. It does not matter -whether the woman be the widow of an officer or a private, if her upbringing has been such that she is unable to earn a living, or if she is prevented by the care of small children from doing so, that fact should be considered a disability. Many of these women are working themselves to death in trying to earn a living for themselves and their children. They are going through commercial schools in an endeavour to equip themselves to fight the battle of life, in many cases having to neglect their children to do so. In other cases they have widowed mothers, sick brothers and sisters to care for. All these things come. under our notice every day. The only way in which the Government can adequately meet the situation is by recognising inability to earn a living. I admit that it is difficult to draft a perfect scheme, but surely it is easy enough to formulate one which would be an improvement upon the present system. </para>

                        <para>- The discretionary powers of the Deputy Commissioners are already fairly adequate, but the trouble is that there is a screw loose somewhere, and an overseeing eye is required to see that matters are put right.

I have had many cases in proof of his contention 'brought, under my notice, and one I propose to place before honorable members. A tram driver returned from the war suffering from neurasthenia. On his discharge he returned to his pre-war occupation ; but the officials of the Tramways Department in Sydney, considering that it was not in the best interests of the safety of the public that a man suffering from his ailment should act as the driver of a. tram, found him a minor position of cleaner. However, later on his health broke down, and he was sent to a nerve hospital at Five Dock. ' I have had this man's case ' before the Department for a long while, without getting any satisfaction, and I propose to read portions of one communication I received from it. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Noble,</inline> in charge of the nerve hospital, a recognised nerve specialist, says that he considers that the hysteria from which this man is suffering resulted from war service. The Department says that the papers show that he was only under- conditions of stress for four days. To be under conditions of stress for four hours was very severe in some parts of the war front, and if this man stayed under them for four days in some sections, it is not to be wondered at that he came out a nervous wreck. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Noble</inline> reported later that his general condition was brighter, and the Department contended that, as he was only suffering a 10 per cent, disability, he was not entitled to a pension. This man, by the way, has a wife and five children. The people of Australia have a right to see that a man who cannot follow his prewar occupation, on account of his war service, does not suffer thereby.  Once the departmental doctors say that a man is not suffering from war service they will not stultify their previous decision by altering it, no matter how much one may appeal. The two medical officers who examined this man said,'" We are of opinion that his neurotic condition is a pre-existing one and not the result of his service." But they had nothing on which to base that decision. Possibly they had had no previous experience in nervous complaints. At any rate, their view was diametrically  opposed to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Noble,,</inline> whose opinion I prefer to accept. There ought to be an Appeal </para>

                <para>The War Service Homes Department has come in for very serious comment, and even ridicule in some respects, from the public, and particularly from soldiers. If it cannot build a home for a man the officers ought to tell him so. I have had a case brought under my notice in Sydney, in which considerable injury was done to a 'young soldier through the Department's neglect to let him know that it was impossible for them to build him a home. In June, 1920, he applied to the Sydney office for a home. He was told that they could not build him one because they had already 13,000 applications to deal with, but they advised him to buy a block of land and get a contractor, and they would make arrangements with the latter to build him a home and finance the transaction. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, this young fellow picked a block of land. He paid no money on it, but he went to the Department and told them of it. Subsequently an inspector viewed the block, and reported to the Department that the site was a good one, and that the price was reasonable. The applicant went to the Department again, and was informed that the site had been approved of, and that if he was prepared to hand in his war gratuity bond the land would be bought for him. Accordingly, he handed in his war gratuity bond, amounting to £100, and the Department purchased the land for cash and took possession of the deeds, which they have held ever since. They told the applicant that if he would bring along a contractor they would make arrangements with him. The contractor, who happened to be a personal friend of the soldier's, called at the Department, where he was shown a set of plans for a house which would cost £700. Subsequently, when the allowance was increased to £800, the Department advised the applicant to have1 his plans altered, in order to take advantage of the increased advance. The contractor made the alterations, and the altered plans were ultimately approved. The Department then informed the contractor that the matter would be finalized within a fortnight, and the latter accordingly cancelled another -contract in order to build his friend's home, which he was prepared to do at a very reasonable price. But the case has not yet 'been finalized, and a month or two ago, when I made inquiries at the Department, I was told that it was the 350th on the list. When the lad himself called the other day he was told that they did not know where his case stood. If they had told him at once that he stood no chance of getting his home built for years he could have spent his war bond in purchasing a home on his own account, and by this time would have had it partly paid off. I know that the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> is trying to do his best to rectify matters of this kind, and I have had every satisfaction from, him in respect to the cases I have brought under his notice.

                <para>When last year's Estimates were under consideration the Postmaster-General promised that an amount of money would be placed on the Supplementary Estimates for the purchase of land and the building of a telephone exchange on the Belmore line, at Lakemba, in New South Wales. But no money was so provided on Supplementary Estimates, nor can I find any such provision on this year's Estimates. The Post and Telegraph Department for a long time past has had, and for a very long time to come will have, very serious problems to overcome in connexion with overtaking the backward condition of our: telephone system. That cannot be done in a day. Two years ago the Postmaster-General's Department was short of cables and of wire. The wire difficulty has been overcome to a great extent, the cable difficulty is being overcome, and the shortage of instruments is being made up. I do not know why there should now be any shortage of instruments, because plenty are available. In my district, although some applicants have been kept waiting eighteen months and two years for telephones, on the ground that wire or cable was not available, .  I have seen connexions being made to the dwellings of other persons. No doubt the Postmaster-General is doing his utmost to meet public requirements, and I hope that the Treasurer will give him all the money that he needs fox this purpose. One gets tired of hearing the complaints of Sydney residents about the telephone system. Along the Belmore line to which I have referred, there is one of the largest suburban populations connected with the metropolis, and yet those residing at Hurlstone Park, Canterbury, and the other stations along the line have to be connected with the exchanges at Ashfield or Burwood, which are, on the average, three miles away. A thousand connexions with those exchanges from places on the Belmore line would mean, with the metallic circuit, 6,000 miles of wire and innumerable poles. Experience teaches that the best practice is to have subscribers close to an exchange, because of the saving in wire and in poles. <inline font-style="italic">J.</inline> hope that the Postmaster-General will favorably consider the request for an exchange on this line, and that he will satisfy our constituents in regard to postal and telephone requirements, so that they may cease to harass us. </para>

                    <para>.- I  do not propose to use the motion as a weapon for killing the Government by depriving them of the means whereby they live; but I join with members on both sides of the Chamber in the complaint against . the administration of pensions. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> mentioned cases in which returned men who had manifested symptoms of sickness which they had contracted on active service were met, when they claimed pensions, by the departmental reply that their disability did not result from active service, and therefore their claims could not be allowed. In my opinion - and I hope that the Committee shares it - when there is a doubt in a case of this kind, the returned man who is an applicant for a pension should get the benefit of it. The law should be interpreted liberally, especially as the evidence of the facts is in the nature of the case not easy either to corroborate or to disprove. The Pensions Department should nob constitute itself both prosecutor and judge, first making out a case against the applicant for a pension, and then deciding it against him. I feel so strongly about a case to which I invite the Minister's attention that I propose not to speak on any other this evening. To use the words of the. honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> it . is typical of a number of others. I shall designate the soldier to' whom I am about to refer <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. X,</inline> to distinguish him from the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A,</inline> with whose case the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> so ably dealt. The correspondence now before me does not make it clear whether a letter bearing date 6th September, 1921, addressed to the applicant himself, and in which I am ignored altogether, is te be taken as the  end of the matter, or whether I may anticipate a reply to a long and detailed statement which I troubled to make out in support of the claim. </para>

                    <para>In the latter part' of 1915 I  was  transferred to Rabaul, and was regularly treated  for  cough. This continued until well into 1916, when definite symptomatic chest pains manifested themselves. I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Major, or</inline> Captain, Mahaffey, medical officer, who examined me, stating that  I  was in  a  very low state of health, suffering from influenza and malaria. He prescribed for me. I was a bed patient for about ten days. In November, 1916, I was sent to Australia on furlough. A few days out from Sydney I took bad again. Had  a  recurrence 'of malaria. Wired Brigadier-General Pethebridge that my health was no better, and he wired back my discharge on 5th January, 1917. </para>
                    <para>During 1917 I hod several- attacks of malaria, and the cough never left me. I was engaged with Messrs. Goldsbrough, Mort, &amp; Co.

The head of <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> deportment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Quinlan)</inline> asked me why I 'did not get a pension.

                    <para>Early in 1919 I was seriously ill with cold and chest trouble, which continued- more or less till Juno, 1919, when I was laid aside definitely with pneumonic influenza, attended by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Brown.</inline></para>
                    <para>In June of the present year I was taken to the Caulfield Hospital suffering from the old trouble. </para>
                    <para>While getting convalescent I applied for sustenance allowance, and, as I told <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. (Major) Irving, I was refused on the ground that my state of health was not due to war service. Major Irving expressed surprise, and said, in the presence of Sister- ,  " That is all nonsense," or</inline> words  to  that effect, and - 'he added, " I will see Colonel Fetherston.- -.Put - 's name. down," which Sister.-!- <inline font-style="italic">.</inline> - did. </para>
                    <para>A month later <inline font-weight="bold">Major Irving</inline> expressed the opinion to me that no medical authority could say that my lungs were not affected while I was away on active service.

There is no doubt that it had an earlier origin, having regard to the fact that there is no history of tuberculosis in our family on either side, and that I brought into war operations a strong constitution, and that of -my own knowledge I contracted severe colds,- with consequential pains, under conditions of extraordinary hardship in Rabaul </para>

                <para class="block">I do not wish to make party capital out of a matter of this kind. I feel too deeply about it, and am happy to know that honorable members on the other side join with us in criticisms of. the kind I. am addressing to the Department. I kn6w that the Minister is a trustee of public funds, and I am not so innocent as to be unaware that sometimes service abroad, or alleged service, is used as a plea by very undeserving persons. Here, however, is a case which I have investigated, and which apparently has been investigated to only some' extent by theDepartment - a case that will stand the closest searchlight so far as the good faith and character of the man are concerned. He is a married man with two young children, and he finds himself today dependent on the generosity of his employer, who has continued to pay him his salary. I do not know whether he is still paying it, but he should not be expected to go on doing so indefinitely. It should be the task, not of a private employer, but of the general public, to bear such a burden in proper ratio. But for the generosity of his employer, this man would find himself to-day a proper subject fiar any charitable home that might see fit to give him shelter.This is not the way in which men of this type should be treated. Where there is a doubt, the man. should get the benefit of that doubt, even though it should happen that in some cases the undeserving are thus helped. It is far better that in certain oases the undeserving should receive relief than that ' deserving cases should be treated with apparent callousness. I have also in mind . the case of a young man named Howard, which is somewhat similar, and also -pathetic. If a more generous interpretation is given to the Act, I shall bring his case up later; but in the meantime I wish to force attention on the case before me. I know the whole history of it. I. know the family, and I know the man. He was the type of man that the military authorities were most anxious to secure during the course of the war, and he left a comfortable home and position when he enlisted. He went away in the full strength of his manhood without taint of any kind of disease, and he finds himself today laid aside by disease which he feels strongly, as I do, is clearly attributable to his war service. If the Commission is still further considering his case, I ask that it be expedited, and I hope to receive soon the. pleasing news that this man is at least given the pension which I think he has. undoubtedly earned. </para>

                    <para>.- I have to bring before the Committee a very serious matter. I refer to the action of the Department . of Repatriation in helping to aggravate the disaster of centralization by closing two vocational training schools in country towns. The result of this step on the part of the Department is that some of those engaged in these schools are to be dragged to the metropolis. While I sympathize very deeply with the grievances of various persons, and perhaps large classes of individuals, which have been brought before the Committee this afternoon, I would point out that this is not a mere grievance, but it is a question of grave national importance. Every one, in theory at all events, deplores the depopulation of the country towns and districts which is going on in all the States of Australia and the aggregation of population in the great metropolitan centres, But this question is to be fought not by means of generalities, but in detail. For every case in which people abandon the land or leave country towns in order to live in one of our cities there is a cause. Those causes ought to be sought out and pointed out so that remedies could be applied. ' It is the one great misfortune associated with Commonwealth activities that they are almost entirely confined to the great metropolitan centres. On visiting a country constituency one finds that practically from one end of it to the other there is not a Commonwealth employee, with the exception of officers of the Post and TelegraphDepartment and a handful of people engaged in military duties. The colossal expenditures of the Federal Government are made in our great cities. It is true that, in connexion with vocational training schools for returned soldiers there was, three years ago, some attempt made to distribute a little of the expenditure of the Commonwealth in country towns, and to afford a means of employment and training in those towns, so that every one concerned would not be dragged into our cities. But this was top good to last. I have two cases that have been brought under my notice within the last fortnight where a departure is to be made from this practice. The one is from Daylesford, and the other from Maryborough, Victoria. </para>

The whole of the people of Maryborough and Daylesford are seething with indignation because of the partial closing of the vocational training schools in those towns. Their cases are practically identical, and I shall read a letter I have received from the registrar of the Daylesford Technical School. </para>

                    <para>The expense of running the class is made up as follows: - Instructor's salary, £6 a week, and cost of raw material. To offset against this, the Department would incur an extra expenditure of £5 a week to reimburse the married' men,' and they would have the same outlay approximately for raw material. As a matter of fact, the material costs the Department very  little  here, as we do so many outside jobs that sometimes no expense is incurred for the month. We have on hand sufficient outside work to keep the men employed, with, no expenses to the Department, for another month. </para>

The matter is clinched, and the system broken up without any opportunity being afforded to those who know the circumstances to present the facts. These men have homes at Maryborough and Daylesford, and, no doubt,- most of them would in due course have found employment and settled there. We all know the difficulty there is in inducing people to build houses in country towns, and also the difficulty in getting men to go into the country, although, at the same time, there is unemployment in the cities. Here we have two cases of men who are anxious to remain in the country being dragged into the city against their will. I would say, however, that the Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> is entirely free of. blame.

                        <para>-  It certainly does. I am glad to have the assurance of. the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to-day that it is his intention to send an officer of his Department to Western Australia, where a Select Committee of the State Parliament is holding an inquiry into this question. When I was a member of the Western Australian Parliament last year, I discussed the matter with the honorable member for Collie, who is the  Chairman  of the Select Committee, and I knew that it was his intention to have such an inquiry. We all know that there have been some little happenings between the Committee, the Premier of the State, and the Commonwealth Treasurer regarding the giving of evidence by the sub-Treasurer in Western Australia before the Committee; and, therefore, I' am glad, that the Treasurer is sending over an officer, who will be able to advise the Commonwealth representative there, and help the Committee to elucidate a business that all concerned earnestly desire shall be elucidated. The subject-matter of the inquiry might at first sight lead people to believe that there have been wholesale scandals in connexion with the cashing of bonds; and I take it to be the duty of the public men of Australia to show that there has been no such wholesale scandal, and to disabuse the minds of the people of any such idea-. It is an easy matter for persons here or elsewhere to make charges of people gaining money in this or that direction, but the question is to prove them. </para>

                        <para>- The payments made have been in cash. Then there are the caveat cases, in which the payment is divided between the soldier and his dependants. I believe I have as large an experience of this work as any civilian in Australia, because I was Complaints Officer in the western State, and every appeal came before me ; and, in my opinion, the majority of the soldiers, and the majority of their dependants, " play the game." There are, however, cases in which dependants do not play the game, and also cases in which soldiers have not played the game to those they left behind. The Government or the Department concerned did not say that the money should not be paid simply because of this fact; they held that it was the duty of the country to pay the money to somebody, and various Boards had to decide to whom it should be paid, and - to what amount. As Complaints Officer I have dealt -with 98 per cent, of the caveat cases that the Board had to deal with. _ There were complaints with reference to separation allowances, the overpayment of separation allowances, and so forth. If a soldier's wife proved unfaithful while he was away fighting and he had dependants other than his wife, a trustee o,r guardian of those other dependants might lodge a caveat with the Gratuity Board, which would consider the circumstances and arrange' an equitable distribution amongst, the parties. In the majority of these cases payment has been made in .cash. There are thus left only two classes of cases. The majority of those soldiers who could establish necessitous circumstances have been paid in cash, but whether they were or were not paid, the Gratuity Board, which consisted only of returned fighting soldiers - not Horse-ferry-road heroes - gave them a fair deal. </para>

                <para>Mr.FOLEY.- Many of the officers who were members of the Gratuity Boards joined the army as privates, and even though there may have been favoritism in some instances, the majority of privates who gained promotion during the war deserved it. These Gratuity Boards considered all applications for cash on account of necessitous circumstances, and the soldiers have had a fair deal. When the gratuity bonds were issued provision was made for their cashing by two classes of persons. Firstly, there  Were  those people who, for patriotic reasons, cashed bonds in order to help soldiers to pay deposits on houses or land, or purchase goods. </para>

Many men and women came forward from  the  purest of motives with offers to cash the bonds of soldiers. The second class of persons who did this comprised traders, land agents, and insurance companies. It was originally provided that the private individual could only cash one bond, but that the trader, the land agent, and the insurance company might cash more than one bond. In order to prove the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the persons providing the cash, an officer representing the sub-Treasury had to take into consideration the calibre of these persons. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. Some traders cashed their employees' bonds in a spirit of true patriotism, not lip patriotism, and for that they are to be applauded. Again, there were traders who cashed more than one bond for soldier customers and thereby did a good turn to men who were in need of the money. Of the insurance companies I shall say little, except that from equally pure motives they, too, cashed bonds. The insurance companies of Australia will bear comparison with those of any other part of the world. </para>

                        <para>- If there was anything wrong or ulterior in their actions the Committee in Western Australia will have an opportunity of finding it out. Some of the land agents did not play the game. A soldier who had a bond worth, say, £100, and was desirous of getting it cashed, would approach a land agent who would sell him a block of land for £40, and give him <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> in cash. It has been proved, to my satisfaction at all events, that some of the blocks of land thus sold did not represent value for the money paid for them. I have brought specific cases before the Government, and in every instance where it could be proved that the value placed upon the land was too high, the Government have re-assessed it, with the result that many a soldier has been recouped some of the money that was paid to the agent. It is to cases of this kind that the inquiry will be reduced. And I am glad to know that when the whole matter is sifted it will be found to be not as bad as it appears to be on the surface. The  chairman  of the Select Committee in Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. A. Wilson, honorable member for Collie),</inline> is a returned soldier, and no man will be more pleased than he if the inquiry should prove that there has been no corruption at all. The attitude of the Commonwealth Government has been in the direction of helping to elucidate these cases, and I am sorry that a little friction has occurred recently. In March, 1920, the Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth Government desired to help the soldier ; so do the Select Committee, and I am glad that the Government are sending before that body an officer who will state the facts as they affect both the Commonwealth and the soldier whose interests it is sought to protect. No bond was cashed unless a statutory declaration was made by the holder, and another by the person providing the cash. In those circumstances how hard it would be for a Select Committee to prove fraud. The soldier who had his bond cashed made a statutory declaration before the subTreasurer that he was receiving the full face value of the bond plus accrued interest. The person cashing the bond also made a statutory declaration that he was paying full value plus accrued interest. Are the Committee likely to set soldiers to come before them and say that they committed perjury when they made that statutory declaration but that they will tell the truth now ? If the person who cashed the bond adheres to his original declaration, then no Court can commit him for perjury, and the Committee will have to weigh against his evidence that of a soldier who admits that he committed perjury when he signed the statutory declaration. For these reasons, I do not think the Select Committee will discover a great deal, but if cases of fraud are sheeted home I trust that an effort will be made to bring to book any person who evaded the regulations governing the cashing of war bonds. I again stress the point, however, that before any substantial result can come from this inquiry soldiers must go before the Committee and make statements different from their statutory declarations. Either they must commit perjury now or admit that they committed perjury earlier. </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that adjustments have been made in connexion with land purchases. I have gone very deeply into this question, and I am satisfied that on account of the action which the Commonwealth Government have taken, no soldier need be a sufferer by any land transaction in connexion with the cashing of his bond. Trouble is bound to occur when soldiers endeavour to get cash for their bonds. I could mention many cases in which discount has been charged, but I have nothing but praise for the Commonwealth officers in the various States, who have done all they can for the soldiers; for the soldiers themselves, who have played the game, as also for their dependants, who, likewise played the game when bread-winners were away fighting at the Front. For the other class I care nothing. Although very little may be ascertained by this inquiry, there is always a possibility of a certain amount of dirt being flung at the officers. However, when the time comes, I hope honorable members will have the opportunity of dealing with it to the fullest extent. </para>

                <para>I cannot understand the Treasurer's objection to one of the Australian States going to America to borrow money. I well remember that financial genius, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley, the father of the Commonwealth Bank, drawing my attention to the fact thirteen years ago, that money was being borrowed by the City of New York at 2 per cent. when the Bank of England rate was3½ per cent. Why should objection be raised to Australia borrowing in New York when the Motherland itself and France resorted there for money in their hour of need ? It is a matter for regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Philp, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Cowley, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> should have gone to England to form a cabal there with the purpose of preventing their State, which has perhaps more potentialities than has any other State of the Commonwealth, from raising money in the Old Country. However, New York offered it, and it is but another instance of the bond of affection between the two great English-speaking nations of the world. There are more English-speaking people living under the Stars and Stripes than live under the Union Jack.However, I want to know why the citizens of Australia, who put their savings in the State Savings Banks or in the Commonwealth Bank, cannot draw interest equal to that which we pay the foreign moneylenders. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> will never forget an interesting interview I had with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller some years ago.

Two lady shorthand writers from the Bank staff were present, and recorded what happened. Each deputationist  spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> the thoughts that each had. I was not interested in academic problems. We had certain machinery in existence, and I wanted an acknowledgment from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> of the power of that financial machinery, and an expression also from him of his willingness or otherwise to use the power already existing. I asked, ' What is the power of the Commonwealth Bank to finance Australia? ' He said, ' This Bank is just as powerful as the Australian Commonwealth is.' I said, <inline font-weight="bold">'Sir Denison,</inline> you did finance Australia for £350,000,000 for war purposes, and had the war continued you could have financed it to another £350,000,000 for war. Is that not so?' <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> replied, That was the case.' 'Then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison,'</inline> I said, 'are you prepared to finance Australia for £350,000.000 for productive purposes' He replied, 'Yes, I will do my best.' I said, Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison,</inline> that is the point.' I wrote down what had occurred, and read it back to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison,</inline> stating at the time that I only wanted what- he would indorse, as the matter would be made public, and he replied, I will indorse that.'" "A pretty big deal that," risked our representative. "Yes," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> remarked, 'this is the biggest deal ever made by Australians in money. No American millionaire even ever did a single deal for an amount like that; but something of more importance than the amount is the new principle created. I remarked at the time that the interview was the most important that had ever occurred in Australia. We had opened the door into a now realm of thought that has no ending. A number of citizens had gone straight into the Governor of their own Bank, setting aside members of Parliament, and arranged for what might be looked upon as the impossible. It is really opening up the possibility of a new form of government." "What does it all mean?" asked our representative. The reply came, " It simply means this - that the Commonwealth Bank is powerful enough to take Australia right through the unemployed problem and every other money problem, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller is willing to use all his ability and his power to the very utmost if the people who own the Bank, that is ourselves, can only grasp- in some degree its significance, and will . give their earnest and loyal support." </para>

"Have you seen <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller since the deputation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott?"</inline> our representative asked. "Yes,"' was the reply, "I was with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller in the Bank just lately, on Thursday, 1st of this month.

                <para class="block">Are honorable members aware of the action taken by the United States Government with reference to the death of a man named Richardson in Japan ? The British Consul summoned the Consuls for Holland, France, and the United States of America to consider the position, and they demanded an indemnity from the Japanese Government. Unfortunately, one Japanese noble fired upon one of the European vessels, and by way of reprisal the gunboats shelled two Japanese villages. Japan paid the indemnity, but an investigation made subsequently showed that Richardson richly deserved his fate, and so incensed were the United States Government at the injustice meted out to Japan that they returned the whole of the indemnity, just as they had returned to - China the indemnity received in connexion with the Boxer rising. A monument erected in Yokohama records this act of generosity on the part of the United States of America. In that little brochure which I published a few. years ago there appears a statement by the Japanese Commander-in-Chief of the army in the war against China to the effect that in the middle of this century Japan would probably be fighting in Europe for the domination of the world, and he hoped that she would be able to play her part with honour to herself and credit to the other nations. I am grateful to Japan for the help she rendered us in making it possible for our men to cross the seas in safety during the recent great conflict. She played the game then. No one can censure Japan for any act of hers during the war. Our White Australia policy offers no offence to Japan. We are merely following her own example, based upon Herbert Spencer's advice to Japan. </para>
                <para>I strongly resent the attitude of those pseudo Australians, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Philp, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Cowley, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh,</inline> in regard to recent attempts by Queensland to obtain money in London. I am glad to know that the United States is prepared to help us monetarily, just as she helped the Motherland and France in their recent great difficulties. </para>
                <para>I desire now to speak upon another matter. We have among us one who has made the name of Australia known  wherever the British tongue is spoken. He is ailing in a hospital, and has only£1 a week to live on ; I allude to Henry Lawson, the great Australian writer.  His  present position resembles that of Robert Burns, who ended his days in Scotland in need and misery. Surely we do not wish this man, whose poems and stories have given pleasure to thousands of Australians, to end in that wav. Could not the Men of Letters Fund be increased a little? The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> when leading the Government, introduced a Bill to provide for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith an old-age pension of £5 a day, although that gentleman had received from Queensland and from the Commonwealth some £86,000 for his services. Having given him so much, could we not give Henry Lawson a little more than a paltry 20s. a week? I offered to contribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith's support, had he lost his money by injudicious experiments in finance, what I was then paying in income tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith translated into the English vernacular part of the works of that great Italian poet Dante Alighieri. That book is in the Library, but I know of no member who has read it. Certainly for every person in the community who has read it there are thousands who have read Lawson's works. Lawson has written words that live and burn, and will be read in years to come. If a collection was started among members, I think that each would be glad to give something to assist the man whose greatness is shown in his splendid poetry, which pictures so well the beauties of the Australian bush. How many Scotchmen have I heard regretting the last days of Robert Burns? Do not let us have similar regrets regarding Lawson. To Lady Bridges Parliament voted £4,500 because she had lost her man at the front, who perished with 60,000 other Australians. No doubt he was a good fellow, but he had had more chance to save money than the ordinary private had had. </para>
                <para>I am tired of the travesties of justice that occur in the Northern Territory. There a lawyer, a keen Englishman, who does not like my politics, although he may like me personally, a gentleman whom, I think, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has met, applied for leave to appeal to the High Court; but the Judge to whom the application was made said that he could not hear it, because he had tried the case, and it was from his decision that it was desired to appeal. One newspaper has spoken of the procedure as an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. A person desirous of appealing is denied the opportunity of <inline font-style="italic">going</inline> to the High Court. No one would have complained more bitterly about the present state of affairs in the Northern Territory than would <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> were the Territory still in the constituency of Grey. </para>

A meeting of coloured people passed a resolution pledging themselves not to pay poll tax till the legality of taxation without representation is tested. It was decided to ask: the Government to prosecute one of their number as a test case. </para><para>Cannot the Government see their way to cease irritating men who, at all events, are standing upon the principle accepted in every British community, that taxation without representation is an infamy and a fraud? It is quite a small matter, and concerns only a few hundred men and women who were allowed to vote on the conscription issue, and when attached to South Australia to vote also for the Legislative Council and House of Assembly, as well as for the Senate and House, of Representatives. I would willingly attach them to my constituency if that could be done, and I am sure the Minister for Home and Territories would not object if they were included among his constituents. The Minister is not one who believes in robbing electors of the franchise, and if such action were taken in his electorate he would strongly oppose it. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Resolution reported. </para><para>Standing Orders suspended; report adopted. </para><para>Resolution of Ways and Means, covering resolution of Supply, reported and adopted. </para><para class="italic">
