                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I find my position as, a member of the House Committee anything but a pleasant one. The Committee is a Committee in name only, because its members have no power. I find that a young man who has been employed in the capacity of lift attendant in this building for the past ten or fifteen years has been given notice of dismissal. During that period he has been courteous to every honorable member, and most assiduous in the performance  of his duties. But he has now been discharged, under the pretext that there is no room for him. The real trouble is that, some time ago, when the Wages Board increased the wages of lift attendants, he made an application for the increase. He was so insistent that the authorities here had to grant his application.  Since  then he has been a marked man. This is proved by the fact that when other officers of this Parliament were granted a bonus last Christmas he was not permitted to participate in it. As a result he saw his superior, officer, to whom he stated that he. had been robbed of the bonus. For having made that statement he was fined &#163;2. Upon four or five occasions this young man attempted to enlist for active service abroad. He was obliged to subject himself to inoculation because of certain epidemics in&#39; Australia, with the result that to-day one of his hands- is maimed. . We are now casting him adrift, and .1 refuse to remain upon a Committee which allows that sort of thing to be done. </para>

I wish to a3k the Minister for Trade and Customs whether such a letter has been, sent, and, if appointments to the Board  of Trade are to be of a political character, why. an invitation to make a nomination has not been received by the Country party? </para>

                        <para>- I have no knowledge of such a letter having been sent. Board of Trade matters are under the direct control of the  President  of the Board <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell).</inline> As a member of the Board of Trade, however, I know that it is intended to associate with the Board a direct representative of the workers, but the appointment is not meant to be in any sense a political one. We are anxious also to fill a vacancy on the Board caused by the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McRae, president</inline> of the Primary Producers&#39; Association of New South Wales, as a represent tative of the primary producers. If the honorable member, as  Deputy  Leader of the Country party, can suggest to the Government the name of an. individual who would be prepared to act in that capacity on the Board we should be pleased to receive it, since we are very anxious that a satisfactory appointment shall be made. </para>

Does he not think that this is strange, seeing that the vessels of the Commonwealth line and others are laid up for lack of cargoes?

I should like, therefore, to read a reply which I have received from the Administrator of the Territory in reference to the particular meeting to which allusion has been made.

                            <para>- In view of the statement which the Acting Prime Minister has just read from the Administrator, who was not present at the meeting at which the resolutions in question were&#39; passed, but who substantiates the contents  of the telegram which I read here last night, will the right honorable gentleman take the position into&#39; his careful consideration? After all, I should say that the  Mayor  of Darwin is in a position very much like that of the Mayor of Melbourne or any other city. </para>

Is there not reason to suppose there is room for investigation when the two statements practically coincide as&#39; to the resolutions which were passed? Will the Acting Prime Minister, in the interests of the public, see that the matter is probed to the bottom ? </para>

I am awaiting the return of the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> who confirms what the Administrator says by describing the position of Darwin at the moment as a &#34; reign of terror.&#34; I have never before stated that fact to the House, but it is the Minister&#39;s expression in regard . to the condition of Darwin. I hope the House will not be too much impressed by these telegrams which, pur- . port to come from the council, but which really come from one man only, not the council. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, in answer to a question by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks),</inline> I stated, amongst other things, that this year the Commonwealth had advanced to New South Wales more than &#163;2,000,000 as a general advance, in addition- to a special advance of &#163;250,000. The question was asked without notice, and, as accuracy is essential, I wish to amplify my reply yesterday by saying that the general advances this year amount to &#163;1,100,000, plus a special advance of &#163;250,000. In addition, the Commonwealth has permitted to be carried over previous advances of &#163;1,130,000. This makes a total of &#163;2,480,000 advance to assist soldier land settlement in New South Wales. Recoupments on certified accounts have also to be considered. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe every statement made in the press, and therefore, I should like some verification of one made quite recently. We are informed that the cost of deporting the Reverend Father Jerger was nearly &#163;1,300. Does that represent the total cost? Will the Treasurer have the accounts audited and tell us whether the same expense was incurred in the deportation of every other German? </para>

                        <para>.- Under this item, duties of 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 10 per cent. are proposed for news-printing paper. It seems to me that there is room for some explanation of the proposal. Most of this news printing paper comes from foreign countries, and particularly from Scandinavia. I am under the impression that there should be a greater preference than 5 per cent. given to Great Britain in connexion with the importation of paper of this kind. From what I have heard, I believe that Great Britain, if given a reasonable preference, can supply the requirements of the Commonwealth for this kind of paper. Under the Minister&#39;s proposal, Great Britain is given a preference of only 5 per cent., as against countries where the conditions of industry are not equal to the conditions prevailing here or in Great Britain. As only the United Kingdom is covered by the British preferential Tariff, most of the importations of this class of paper will be dutiable under the general Tariff. I understand that the intermediate Tariff makes it possible for reciprocal relations to be established with British Dominions, and perhaps the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will make a statement, showing where this class of paper is obtained, and will say whether he has any objection to increasing the preference to the United Kingdom now proposed, and whether some provision cannot be made to give some advantage to Canada, where this class of paper is manufactured, over countries outside the Empire. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a subject to which we have given a good deal of consideration, and in regard to which representations of various kinds have been made to us. First of all, the proprietors of newspapers, who are, of course, the great users of news printing paper, are anxious that fixed rates should be substituted for the <inline font-style="italic">ad valoremrates.</inline> I think that they asked for a fixed rate or an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, whichever would be the lower. Heretofore, the duty on newsprint has always been a revenue duty, and I think it will be some time before the manufacture of this paper can be successfully undertaken in this country. How long that will be it is very hard to say, but it will not be in the immediate future, and in the meantime any duty imposed on the article must be a revenue duty. The Government are not prepared to go the length of surrendering revenue under this item to the extent that has been asked. </para>

                            <para>- No; for the reason that the prices which have been paid in the past have been enormously high, running, I think, up to &#163;80 per ton. The duty has always been collected on &#39;the home consumption value. Honorable members know that an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty must be collected on the home consumption value of the goods in the countries in which they are produced. The home consumption value fixed for newsprint is considerably below the export value. We collect duty, not on the invoice value of the goods, but on the home consumption value fixed by the authorities in the control of prices in the countries from which the paper comes. </para>

                            <para>- The practice is somewhat similar to that we adopted in the case of wool. The law compels us to collect duty, not on the export or invoice value of the goods, but on their home consumption value. Consequently, in those cases - and there are quite a number of them - the actual amount of duty collected is less than that which the invoice value of the goods would give. Since the period just indicated, the prices of paper have fallen materially, so that the invoice value would now return somewhere about the same sum as in respect of home consumption value. The difference between the latter and the invoice prices of the goods is such that we now collect about the same amount of duty as hitherto. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. We may anticipate that paper will stay at about &#163;20 per ton for some time. The Government are prepared to substitute for the present schedule rates of 5 and 10 per cent, a fixed duty. We propose to make that duty 10s. per ton, British; and &#163;2 per ton, intermediate and general. We expect that by this alteration we shall get a rather less total volume of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- A comparison must depend on the price of paper. Suppose that we take &#163;20 per ton as a basis; the value for duty is 10 per cent, in excess of the &#163;20; and, so long as the Tariff is 10 per cent., the .duty collected amounts to about &#163;2. Operating in regard to the United Kingdom, if the price of paper is &#163;20, the amount, of duty would be &#163;1. We are, therefore, slightly increasing the British preference. There will now be about 10s. per ton added to the British preference over and above what would be derived under the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. </para>

                            <para>- I have endeavoured to explain that more than once. We must fill in all the columns in regard to every item coming under the Tariff. We do not propose to extend reciprocity, in regard to paper, to any other country thana British Dominion - that is, if it is ever so far extended. The Tariff is, therefore, arranged in this way. It is for the Committee to say whether it prefers a further adjustment of the intermediate Tariff. The intention is that the intermediate rates shall only be capable of extension to countries other than British Dominions. I will put it in this way: Negotiations between foreign . countries and ourselves can only be in respect of the intermediate Tariff. As for negotiations with other portions of the British  Empire,  we can extend the British preference, if we so desire. The proposals which I am now making will result, as I have indicated in considerable loss of revenue compared with what has been collected during the past few years. Taking the importation of news-print to be 45,000 tons - which is about what we import every year - and taking the duty to be &#163;3, the revenue derived from that source totalled &#163;147,000. </para>

                            <para>- In fixing the duty at &#163;2 we recognise that it means losing a considerable amount of revenue ; but , I think it will be some time before the whole of the importations to Australia will come in at &#163;20 per ton. The probabilities are that we shall find in collecting duties this year, if we keep it at 10 per cent., that we shall get considerably more than the fixed rate will produce. If values come down we may receive slightly more revenue than we would if we kept the rate at 10 per cent. We will probably balance the ledger &#34;if we leave it at 10 per cent.., but this allows a slightly increased preference to Great Britain over other countries. </para>

It is quite possible that in the near future Great Britain may be a strong competitor in the printing trade. In the past the bulk of our supplies have come from Canada and Scandinavian countries, and at present these are the only sources to which we can look for our requirements. </para>

I think the Minister will agree that during the war period the duty imposed on paper, coupled with the enormous price charged, involved the country press in very serious losses. I am not arguing in the interests of the big metropolitan newspapers, because they can pass on their costs to their customers. </para>

When city industries are under consideration, every effort is made to give them protection to the &#34;fullest possible extent; but when it is a matter of assisting those who are endeavouring to carry on under adverse circumstances in country districts, very little help is forthcoming. Honorable members cannot help recognising the injury that is being done to the proprietors of small country newspapers, not only by the greatly increased prices of paper, but by the heavy Customs imposts. </para>

                            <para>- That is on account of an arrangement made with the State Governments, who give special facilities to the proprietors of metropolitan papers. No effort is made to build up a sound provincial press, although there is every possibility, in such places as Geelong, Ballarat, and Bendigo, as well as in some of the large towns in New South Wales, to have influential country newspapers. In my constituency about a dozen papers are published, the proprietors of which have had a particularly trying time, especially during the war period. Many of them have ceased to publish owing to the impossibility of competing with other papers in consequence of the high cost of production. I trust the Committee will view this matter favorably,&#39; having regard to the fact that we are not manufacturing this class of paper in Australia. As the Minister has stated, it is merely a revenue duty. </para>

If the same quantity of timber is imported in future as in. pre-war years, there will be an enormous increase in the Customs revenue from that  source  I estimated that the duty to be derived from six items would be about &#163;730,0.00, so that the Minister has a margin for concession on this item. There has &#39;not been much reduction of duties in this Tariff, but several have been increased. </para>

                            <para>- I have had communications from a large number of country  newspapers ; representatives of the provincial press have interviewed the Minister on many occasions, and they have held meetings recently. They will be quite content with a general duty of 30s. per ton; but I think the Minister should realize the heavy cost of producing a newspaper nowadays. We cannot expect a complete reversion to the old conditions; the price of paper is bound to keep up, and that will mean an increase, in the cost of producing a small newspaper. The proprietors of these journals deserve some sympathy. As a rule, the circulation of country newspapers is not very large, but these journals play an important part in the rural life of the community. Honorable members know with what avidity the chronicles of matters of local interest are read in country towns. The representatives of the provincial press are agreed that a general duty of 30s. per ton would not press upon them too heavily. Prior to the 1914 Tariff, paper was admitted free of duty, and the country realized the great importance of newspapers in the dissemination of news and the education of the people. The country press particularly has been of great service in that way. I therefore ask the Minister to give further consideration to this matter. If honorable members so desire, I shall be only too pleased to propose that paper from Great Britain shall be admitted, free, but I  think  that duties of 10s., 25s., and 30s. would give the necessary incentive to British manufacturers to try to develop the paper trade with Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. In the laboratory in Perth marvellously good work has been done in testing the possibility of producing paper pulp from Australian timbers. The first paper produced there was made entirely from the silky oak; then experiments were made with mountain ash and karri, and it was proved that many of the Australian timbers would produce pulp which could be converted into a very fair quality of paper. The large newspapers, with, I think, one exception, provided &#163;250 each . foi  the purpose of carrying on these experiments,  with a view to the development of paper manufacture in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Not* at all; I am satisfied that when it is shown that the industry can be developed, the Government, through the Bureau of Science and Industry, will render assistance. As soon as Parliament realizes that there is a possibility of paper being manufactured in Australia upon a commercial basis, it will be only too pleased to vote a reasonable subsidy for the development of the industry; The manufacture of paper in Australia on a large scale would give a great filip to re-afforestation and would encourage the planting of trees that are particularly suited for pulping.  But while the industry remains at the experimental stage it would be absurd to impose high duties in the hope that, in the dis.tant future, we may be able to manufacture paper from Australian wood pulp. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has said that he will introduce a Bi,11 to provide machinery whereby Parliament can be kept regularly informed of the progress of various industries, and we shall be able to follow up any successful experiment. I am sure every honorable member would be pleased if we could develop in Australia a paper industry like that in Canada and Scandinavia. It would produce enormous wealth directly, and would give an impetus to a policy of reafforestation. At the present time there is no hope of producing paper on a commercial scale; therefore, these proposed duties can only serve to produce revenue. If the proprietors of the large metropolitan  newspapers make big profits, we can reach them by means of the income tax. Complaint is made that the price of the metropolitan daily newspapers has been increased  from id; - to 2d., but I  remind the Committee that in the Old Country the price of newspapers was raised much earlier. I am not here to champion the proprietors of the big newspapers, but it is impossible to have a duty which &#34;will discriminate between the country and metropolitan press. </para>

                            <para>- The. manufacture of printing paper is another industry which is being neglected in Australia, but which, if undertaken here, would give considerable employment and also, incidentally, a very fair return upon any capital invested in it. I want to draw the attention of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to the fact that by lowering the duty upon, printing paper, which is also largely used for wrapping purposes, he would be bringing it into unfair competition with the output of local manufacturers of this class  of  paper. The Minister proposes to have fixed rates of duty of 10s., &#163;2 10s., &#163;2 upon printing paper, described under sub-item c, if imported in sheets not lees than 20 inches by. 25 inches. I ask him to alter the item and provide that these sheets must not be less than 15 inches in width, which would mean that the paper would have to be cut before being used for wrapping purposes, and that a certain degree of protection would be&#39; accorded to the local manufacturer. When the 1908 Tariff was under review, I endeavoured to have a high duty placed on printing paper, with a view to its local manufacture; but when T approached the Australian paper mill proprietors, &#39; they told me candidly enough that they were not prepared, at that stage, to make that class of paper commercially or in sufficient quantities. However, they pointed out other ways in which Parliament could help them, and what they asked for was done. During the war these people made good profits. Previously, their business had not been too payable, because the industry had not got a great deal  of  assistance from, other  protected  industries,  but the money they made has been spent in providing new machinery and in extending their mills for the purpose  of  increasing production, not with any philanthropic object, but in order  to  increase their gains.  Naturally,  in doing this, they anticipated receiving further assistance from the Government, in the shape of increased protective duties, but their anticipations in this respect have not been met. They waited upon the </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister, and he received them and listened to their representations with every courtesy, but courtesy, although it may be very nice,, fills neither pockets nor stomachs. The local manufacturers were anxious to learn whether, as the result of their representations, increased duties would be proposed on some of the lines they produce, and I was raised to the seventh heaven of delight last Tuesday when the Minister asked the Committee to defer the consideration of this division of the schedule, because I thought that he had come to the conclusion that, from a Protectionist stand-point, the duties upon paper were useless, and that he should bring down a revised schedule with substantial increases. However, I do not gather from his remarks to-day that this is what he intends to do. He can afford some degree of assistance by rectifying anomalies, such as the one I have just pointed out. I have in my hands an exhibit of the work performed bv one local maker, showing that he can produce a very fine quality of paper. This firm makes both white and brown wrapping paper, and has recently spent a considerable sum of money with a view to producing, not only all sorts of paper, but also paper of a higher commercial value. The local manufacturers, after considerable efforts, have at last produced a craft paper which is most suitable for wrapping and other purposes. Then there is the question of  leatherboard  strawboard, or millboard. </para>

                            <para>- Before the war the manufacture of newspaper or, in fact, of any form of paper or board in Australia was not encouraged in the way it should  have been  and during the war we found, as in other cases, what an awkward  position  we had placed ourselves . in, and were very thankful to the local manufacturers of these necessary commodities who had carried on under very slight encouragement. Since the war a good deal has been done. The honorable member for Dampier and myself saw examples of what has been done, to produce paper in Australia in a laboratory connected with the Institute of Science and&#34; Industry. We agreed that those efforts were likely to succeed, and I look forward to the successful production of paper in Australia in the not far distant future. During the war other industries, which had to use newspaper, strawboard, and other forms of paper or board found that, if it had not been for the local manufacturers, they would have had to go out of business. The firm I have mentioned did not take advantage of the fact that importations were blocked by overcharging for their products. Yet to-day those who use strawboard in other industries are objecting to the duties proposed. In my time, I was associated with a trade which used cardboard boxes, and I am willing to admit that the raising of the price of board was a certain charge on that trade, but it would have been much worse for those in the trade if they had not been able to obtain supplies during any considerable period. The Australian mills did not charge for strawboard and other paper anywhere near what the importers of the Japanese article were asking. They did npt avail themselves of the high market price as they might have done. I do not pretend to know why they took up that attitude. Unlike most others in business, they might have felt some qualms of conscience, but the fact remains that they did not take the full profits that they might have taken. They can manufacture enough strawboard to supply the full requirements of Australia. Sp far as the price is concerned, the increase would be infinitesimal on certain- boxes used for trade purposes, and cannot injure traders in the wry that they are suggesting. T do not say that an increase of duty will not, in certain instances, raise the. price to a small&#34; degree, but it must not be forgotten that, but for the existence of the local manufacturers, the importers would have raised the price still higher.&#39; I do not  feel inclined to go into the case, exhaustively at this stage, because I know that we can do little unless the Minister is willing to help us. If this division were, fully debated,  it  would take us months to get through  it,  and  it  will  be to  the Minister&#39;s advantage to let us know exactly where we stand. In order to prevent paper from being used for purposes other than what it is intended for, and to encourage the local manufacture of paper for wrapping purposes, will the Minister agree to add after the word &#34;width&#34; the words I have indicated? There are many items that I should like to see altered. For instance, I should like to add to both paragraphs 1 and 2 of item 334, sub-item d, the words, &#34;Plain, not printed, coated, or waxed.&#34; If the paper comes in plain, the printing, coating, and waxing will give work in Australia. I should also like to see sub-item f transferred to item 338, sub-item a, in order to obtain better conditions for the manufacturers. I expected an increase in the duty on strawboard, because the rates at present in the schedule are of no use to the local manufacturers. Will the Minister announce his intentions? It might be more convenient to the Committee  if  the honorable member for Dampier would first withdraw his amendment and move  it  later on; otherwise  it  appears that discussion on the whole  item  will be blocked. Instead of saving time, that is likely to lead to longer debate. </para>

                    <para class="block">Without replying to the honorable  member  for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> regarding the question of wrapping and other papers, which are not associated with the particular subject-matter that we are now discussing, I desire to say that the Government feel that the proposals they are making in regard to news print are  in  all the circumstances justified. The times are difficult; the revenue requirements of the Commonwealth, owing to the tremendous war debt we are carrying, are very considerable, and the Government do not feel, inclined to go any further in the direction of surrendering revenue. Had it not been for the position of the country press, which we recognise, and with which we sympathize, we should have asked for somewhat higher duties. We feel, however, that it is quite impossible to dissociate one user of news print from another in collecting revenue, and while it is possible for the big metropolitan dailies to pass on the charge, we realize that it is not possible for the country papers, in many instances, to pass it on at all. </para>

                            <para>- I can only say that I can recollect a good many instances of&#34; small country newspapers starting, and disappearing in a remarkably short time when the price of paper was much less than it now is. Having given the matter  most careful consideration, the Government feel that, in all the circumstances, the duty for which they are asking on-, this occasion is justifiable. </para>

                        <para>.- I should have been glad had the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)been</inline> able to agree with the amendment. It would have been in the interests of users of paper generally. The class of paper to which it relates is not being manufactured here, so that the duties being proposed by the Government are of a purely revenue character. I recognise that we need revenue, but the educational benefits of the country press, and indeed of the press generally, are of advantage to the whole Commonwealth. Many of our country newspapers are struggling to such an extent that they have to be content with the publication of secondhand news. They cannot afford to pay for that briskness and brightness of news which the city newspapers, because of their larger revenue, are able to provide. If by these additional duties we add to the cost of country newspapers, they will continue to struggle, and will not be marked by that briskness and up-to-dateness which is due to newspaper readers in the backblocks, as much as to those who reside in our cities. I should, therefore, be extremely pleased if the Minister would agree to duties of 10s., 25s., and 30s. per ton. The press in Western Australia has been very anxious to bring about the local manufacture of news print. Newspaper proprietors there have been putting their hands in their own pockets, to a great extent, to accomplish that object, and in the elementary stages of paper production have achieved wonderful results. The time is not far distant when we shall have manufactured in Australia the necessary news print. We have been able, in Western -Australia, to discover processes for producing the most suitable papers, and I have here samples of paper manufactured in that State. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to give notice that I shall move a further amendment, providing that the duties per ton shall be - British, 10s.; intermediate, 25s. ; and general, 45s. I understand that the duty on news print is of a purely revenue character, and since we have to import this class of paper, I would encourage the use of that produced in Great Britain rather than that coming from Scandinavia, Japan or other countries. We have boasted from time to time of our patriotism and loyalty to the Mother Land. Here is an opportunity to demonstrate it - here is a chance to prove that we prefer to use paper made in Great Britain rather than that coming from other countries. If the amendment moved by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is agreed to, imports of this class of paper will come from Scandinavia and Japan, or, at all events, from countries other than Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- And apparently honorable members opposite do not wish us to do so. The daily press of the metropolis is particularly anxious to secure cheap paper, no matter from where it may come. During&#39; the war they made much use of the cry of &#34; Love of the Mother Country,&#34; but they are not very much concerned about the welfare of the Mother Country so long as they can get cheap paper. The Protectionist section of the metropolitan press is everlastingly writing of the value of trading with the Mother Country. They have here an opportunity to encourage that trade. By obtaining our supplies of newsprint from Great Britain we shall provide more employment for the paper manufacturers there. We are not manufacturing this class of paper in Australia, and, desiring, therefore, that Great Britain shall be given the fullest possible preference, I propose to move on the lines I have mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- Even so, the importations from the United Kingdom were relatively small. In respect of an item of this kind, we should make the British preference as strong as possible; but it stands to reason that the United Kingdom cannot grow much of the material from which paper is made. It must import a great deal of the raw material and work it up. </para>

                            <para>- That, I think, is very desirable. In this case the competition is between foreign countries and different parts of our own Empire. We all know that the raw material for the manufacture of paper comes principally from the softwood forests in the colder regions, the greater part of which are outside the British Empire.I am strongly in favour of the Tariff on paper being so framed that all our trade in paper shall come through the Empire. If we can make such a difference between the British preferential Tariff and general Tariff as will lead to the paper pulp actually coming from our own countries, wherever the raw material may be produced, we shall be doing something to improve the trade of the Empire generally. Personally, I am rather in favour of importing paper pulp from the Old Country, for the simple reason that we must have oversea vessels coming here to take our produce away. It seems to me that this Tariff would have been framed upon very much better lines if the question of inter-Empire trade had been kept more prominently in the foreground. </para>

                            <para>- That is one of the natural results of the war. But it has not been kept prominently enough in the foreground, and here is an opportunity for us to&#34; make the position more pronounced. I think that we should admit newsprint from the United Kingdom free, and impose a duty of 30s. per ton upon that commodity under the intermediate and general Tariffs. That would impart quite a stimulus to the interEmpire trade. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, I would prefer to see the duty imposed which I have suggested. The Minister, no doubt, has studied this question exhaustively; but whilst, under his proposal, trade within the Empire would be increased, it should be increased in such a way as would avoid crushing many of the country newspapers, which are now struggling for an existence. We have been told that country newspapers come and go. I know that the life of a country newspaper proprietor is a precarious one. </para>

Every honorable member is aware that during the past two or three years, country newspapers have been dying at an alarming rate, so that it is really time we gave them considerable help, not merely in the interest of those who are conducting them, but in the interests of country residents generally. Everybody who has had anything to do with rural areas knows that in every district great interest is exhibited in the local newspaper. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the attitude that has been adopted by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> He has wisely taken into consideration our need to obtain revenue, and also the desirableness of granting a preference to Britain in connexion with the supply of printing paper. Many honorable members are not, I fear, aware of the fact that during the war period the paper mills of the Old Country did not produce the quantity of paper that they had produced previously, owing to the fact that their mills had been commandeered by the British&#39; Government for war purposes. But Great Britain is now in a position to supply the requirements of Australia in this connexion at a reasonable price. There are people from Britain out here at the present time who are anxious to enter into contracts for supplying the press of Australia with paper. It should be our aim to encourage the production of that article there in preference to encouraging its production in countries which treated us very unfairly during the war. In some instances those countries not only combined for the purpose of charging prohibitive prices for paper, but they also prevented the shipment of supplies, except in vessels loaded by themselves. To-day Great Britain has paper-mills standing idle - mills which are in need of orders to enable them to restart operations. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that there are British firms which would like to come here and start the manufacture of paper. But it is not possible for them to undertake operations upon the scale that would be necessary to meet our requirements, within the next six or seven years. That being so, we must ask ourselves what is the next best thing to do. In my opinion, it is to grant a preference to Great Britain. The Minister&#39;s original proposal was that a duty of 10s. should be levied under the British preferential Tariff, and of 40s. per ton under the intermediate and general Tariffs. If the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> will eliminate the 10s. duty which he has proposed upon paper coming from the United Kingdom, I think  that his amendment is a fairer proposal than that of the Minister. Of course, I am speaking only of newsprint. </para>

                            <para>- During the war period, the British manufacturers could not continue to provide newsprint because the paper they were manufacturing was being used for another purpose altogether. I desire that Britain shall be granted a preference, especially over two countries which I have in my mind. I do not wish to see Japanese paper coming into Australia; but I do not think that we need entertain any apprehension under that heading; because the Japanese cannot manufacture paper. But I .would like to see Britain granted a preference over Sweden. To my mind, it is questionable whether, during the war period, certain so-called neutral countries were neutral in the truest sense of the word. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going into that phase of the question. We can do no more in the case of Britain than make paper free, but with a lowered price of paper the Minister&#39;s proposal will prove very much greater than the duty at present in force. Newspapers, irrespective of the varied opinions in the community, have played, and do play, a big part in public affairs. I am told on good authority, which I have verified in one or two instances, that the newspapers were of a greater importance during the war period than, perhaps, many would believe. At one time news-print was almost unobtainable, and, indeed, was quite unobtainable in France, and it is said that, as a result, the <inline font-style="italic">morale,</inline> not of the French Army, but of the French people suffered in the absence of news from the Front. Before paper was contraband it was going to Germany, there to be used, not in the production of newspaper, but in the production of cartridges and other munitions of war; but the British Government realized that newspapers were a power, and, though they required paper for the production of cartridges, and so forth, sent enough to enable the French newspapers to be published, with gratifying results. An institution of such power as the newspaper press is worth preserving. The duty proposed by the Minister is certainly high, and while it will result in revenue, it will also penalize an Australian industry. I suggest that, with Great Britain on the free list, the intermediate duty should be 25s., and the general duty 30s. This would, in my opinion, prove of great benefit, not necessarily to newspaper proprietors, but to the Australian public. </para>

                        <para>.- There are large paper mills, not only in my district, but elsewhere in New South Wales, and also in Victoria, engaged in the production of wrapping paper. If newspaper from Britain is admitted free, there is great risk of its being used for wrapping purposes, with consequent injury to the Australian industry. These mills have been established at great expense, and employ many people. </para>

                            <para>- Is it not more silly to suggest that they might get their paper for nothing? The newspaper   industry was &#34; hard hit &#34; during the war, and many country proprietors were ruined in their small way. Those interested in the country press have already made strong representations to the Minister, and, certainly, they should be given consideration. I do not think the impost is a fair one, inasmuch as it falls so heavily on one section of the community. If the Minister will agree to my suggestion to make the duty in the general Tariff 40s. or 10 per cent., whichever is the lower, he will give satisfaction to that section. </para>

                        <para>. - I have done my utmost to meet the wishes of the Committee in this matter. Bearing in mind the representations that have been made, and the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Gregory)</inline> knows that there have been many, the Government were prepared to sacrifice some revenue under this item at the present time. We should get considerably more revenue if we adhered to the proposal as it stands in the Tariff, 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 10 per cent., than we shall receive under the proposal to which I have consented. Recognising the justice of the claims in many instances, particularly in regard to the country press, we have given the fullest consideration to the recommendations which have been made. If the country press were the largest users of news print in Australia, the situation would be somewhat different. But they are not. The proportion of news print they use is comparatively small. The vast bulk of this paper is used by the big metropolitan dailies throughout the Commonwealth. I have tried to meet the views expressed by the honorable member for Dampier, and by other honorable members, and as I have said, I am prepared to amend the original proposal put before the Committee and to agree to a proposal that news print shall be free from the United Kingdom, and that the duty  in the intermediate (and general columns shall he 40s. I do not feel justified in going further than that at the present time. If any additional preference were given it would have to be within the Empire, and as the British preferential rates can be extended to the British Empire, there is no necessity in this case for any adjustment in the intermediate column, and we prefer, in the circumstances, to make the duty in the intermediate column the. same as in the* general column. </para>

                            <para>- We should vote against the honorable member&#39;s proposal. At the present time, the 40s. would be the lower duty, and we would collect on that. We are proposing to give away revenue now by the amendment to which I have agreed. If we were to accept the proposal of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> when the balance, if it did, turned in the other direction, we should lose still further revenue, and that, in the present financial &#34;circumstances of the Commonwealth, we are not prepared to agree to. </para>

                        <para>The proposal submitted by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is one of the most remarkable that has ever been propounded in this Parliament. He proposes that whatever may be the lower duty under this item shall be collected. Under the Customs Act it is provided that when foreign prices reach the dumping point the fixed duty or the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, whichever is the higher, shall be imposed, but the honorable member for Dampier, in some particular interest, proposes that the very reverse of the principle provided for in the Customs Act shall be adopted in this case.  His  proposition is that if the price of newsprint comes down to &#163;10 per ton the Government shall collect the lowest possible duty on it, and the lower the price of the imported article the lower the duty to be collected. </para>

                            <para>- Yea. What the honorable member really proposes is a bonus for the dumping propositions of foreign corporations. The fundamental principles of this Tariff are, first of all, the creation of industries within our own boundaries, and then, if we cannot do that, our object is at least to give a preference to Britain. Under this particular item there is practically no attempt made to give effect to either of the principles. So far as the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is concerned, all that he wants to do is to collect in this case a purely revenue duty, and even that he is prepared to forgo at the present moment, in order to meet the situation. There is no item in the Tariff which interests me more than this does. It is not a question of the Tariff at all, or a question of the country press. It is a question of sham, fraud, and iniquity, and of bogus Imperialism and bastard patriotism. Under this proposition we are asked to forgo everything for which we have stood for a long period, and I propose to say a few words on the item. First of all, in connexion with Protection, we have great industries in this country, and we have refrained from imposing duties on much of the machinery which they require and the raw materials which they must use. We have had constitutional government in this country for fifty or sixty years, and we have never, so far, made any attempt <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> establish the manufacture of the paper used for the printing of newspapers. Whatever may be the argument put forward for the establishment of industries for the production of various articles in this country, they have never been applied to the production of newsprint. There, Protection has ceased. Our supplies of that particular article are imported from abroad. They are imported, not merely from the centre of our Empire,but from Scandinavia or Japan, wherever they can be got most cheaply. So long as those interested can g et their supplies of newsprint cheaply from the Empire they are content to do so, but if from anywhere outside the realm of our Empire they can get cheaper paper, then, so far as they are concerned, the Empire can go to hell. </para>

                            <para>- That is where they will be, probably. In the first place, there has been no effort to impose protective duties for the establishment of the manufacture of newsprint in this country. Every effort to establish it has met with great hostility. We possess in this country a large amount of the raw material necessary for the production of newsprint. We have thousands of tons of the straw and other materials used. We have the clay, which constitutes one of the raw materials of the industry. We have certain woods from which wood-pulp can be provided. We may require some other things, and the mere fact that we do not produce every item of the raw material required for the manufacture of newsprint in this country is no reason why the industry should not be established here. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In other countries the same thing is done. Great Britain carries on immense industries, such as the cotton industry, for instance, the raw material for which is not produced within her own boundaries. Other countries that produce paper import some of the raw material required for thepurposes.Aftersome sixty years of constitutional government,wecannot lay the foundation of this particular industry in the Commonwealth. I have said that there has always been hostility to it. The only thing that remains is that we should give effect to the second principle of our Tariff, and, by giving a preference, trade within the Empire. We should link up with the Empire in an indissoluble union, and whatever products we require we should get them, if possible, within the Empire, and particularly from Great Britain. Prior to the war, we imported a large proportion of our newsprint paper from Great Britain. But for the most part, before the war, it can be safely said that a larger volume of the Imperial sentiments expressed in this country, and of the patriotic effusions that appeared in the press of the Commonwealth, and much of the denunciation of our movement, were linked up with foreign nations. Two-thirds of the newspapers&#39; of this country have been printed on foreign paper with foreign ink, and in very many cases the articles appearing in them have been written by men with foreign names. The advent of the war cut off our supplies of newsprint from Great Britain, and we have had to obtain our supplies from foreign sources. We have had to obtain them from Scandinavia and from Canada, where the manufacture of this paper is largely owned and controlled by American capital. Within the last hour, a paper which I have been able merely to skim over has been circulated amongst honorable members. It is signed by a gentleman named Shakespeare, of the Country Press Association. If I read some of it, it will enable me to cut short some of my remarks. He says - </para>

                    <para class="block">The gentleman goes on to say that in New Zealand the conditions were worse than in Australia. Through Great Britain&#39;s inability, owing to the stress of the war, to supply us with the newsprint paper we required, the newspaper proprietors of this country were left entirely at the mercy of American and Scandinavian controllers of their raw material, and as a result they had to pay. up to&#163;75 per ton for the paper they required.  I find that the Country Press Association, after sitting in conference, decided to wait as a deputation on the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and protest against the duties which were fixed in March, 1920. Theduties then fixed on this item were 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 10 per cent. </para>
                    <para class="block">The market price at the time being round about &#163;75 per ton, they complained to the Minister that, at the date of their deputation - the 5th August, 1920 - when the price of newsprint was &#163;75, the duty was &#163;7 10s.; so that it was costing them over &#163;80 per ton for newsprint to carry on their industry. The Minister saw that they were under some misapprehension of the application of the duty, and pointed out that the duty was upon the fixed price&#39; in Canada. He said that that did not apply to Scandinavia. These people had no time for the Canadians, whom they regarded, in this connexion, as a race of buccaneers and exploiters. They considered that the Australian proprietors had suffered victimization at the hands of the Americans who were controlling the raw resources of Canada. They pointed out that the duty at that time amounted to 10 per cent. on the Canadian home consumption price, and that the latter was about &#163;20 per ton. That is to say, they had to add 10 per cent. upon that price, while at the same time the duty was &#163;8 per ton on the Scandinavian product. The proposition was put to the Minister that they were quite willing, in this hour of their country&#39;s agony, to pay &#163;3 per ton, but that they did not want to pay &#163;8. They emphasized that the duties upon Canadian paper were levied on &#34; home consumption &#34; values, but that the same did not apply to Scandinavian paper, whereas it should do so. The Minister, in reply, said, &#34; This shall be done.&#34; And not only did these people get their way in that respect, but the Minister said, further,. &#34; Australia has been bled white by those controlling the sources of supply&#34;; and he added that he would give relief at once, expressing himself thus, &#34; The duty does not pretend to be protective; its sole object is to raise revenue.&#34; Thereafter, the duty of &#163;8 per ton upon Scandinavian paper was reduced to shout &#163;3. That was the concession which the Minister made. But he went even beyond that, namely, to the extent of giving these proprietors a refund upon the amounts which they had previously paid. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. . I am not blaming the Minister. Now, the duties to be imposed had to be upon the fair values of the exporting countries; but, in this particular case, it was not so much the values that would fairly and ordinarily have obtained, but the values fixed by the markets of those countries in respect of &#34; home consumption &#34; - values fixed in an arbitrary manner by the Canadian Government and by the Governments of the Scandinavian countries. The arbitrary price fixed by Canada was &#163;20 per ton, and by Norway about &#163;30. The price here was &#163;7* per ton, so that the Canadian -people were putting on &#163;55 to their home consumption price, and the&#39; &#34;Norwegians &#163;45. In August of 1920 - less than twelve months ago - the Associated Press of this country were prepared to pay &#163;75. That is, indeed, what they had to pay the foreigners, plus a tax of &#163;3, making the cost of the commodity &#163;78 per ton. Since then, however, there has been a considerable fall, and now the price is &#163;25 per ton. But what is the view-point and attitude to-day? These Australian people object to ask the foreigner, who has been putting up his prices tremendously, to &#34; battle &#34; with the duty of &#163;3. They hate so to hurt and handicap these producers who have &#34; sold &#34; them in the market-, places of the world. </para>

                    <para>In January last the price was still &#163;75, so far as foreign suppliers were concerned. But the English prices, ranged between &#163;40 and &#163;50. England was beginning to recover from the ravages of war. The English paper merchants had re-organized and reconstituted their manufactories. During the war the English firms were literally out of the market; their mills were largely devoted to the production of warlike material, to the output of such essential commodities as containers for jam and requisites associated with shell manufacture. As a matter of actual fact, then, through the years of the war, the British newsprint people were unable to contribute any paper to the markets of the world. Not only was that so, but the Scandinavian countries had placed an embargo on the exportation of sulphide pulp, which,  had  formerly gone chiefly to, Britain; but which was now. being sold to Germany as a substitute for cotton. Ultimately, the British paper producers, backed by the British Government, were compelled to secure large forest areas in Canada, and to purchase timber rights over them. Their power of control over the raw resources of- Canada now constitutes a factor and a force which they had never previously possessed. In addition, as I have just said, they thoroughly re-established their home industry; and, to-day, they have some of the finest newsprint machinery in the world. So superior is the latter that the Scandinavian and American makers are now trying to get hold of these special machines. England is coming once more into the world&#39;s markets. </para>
                    <para>In January last the Scandinavian and American price to buyers in this country was still &#163;75 per ton, while, for English paper, the quotation was in the&#34; neighbourhood of &#163;50. It was at this stage that some gentlemen in Australia, representing the big metropolitan dailies, became suddenly imbued with a burning Imperial sentiment and a deep love of Empire, simply because paper was cheaper in Great Britain than in Scandinavia. So these ardently patriotic gentlemen sent delegates to England and got- hold of several thousands of tons of British paper. But, at the present moment, Scandinavian and Japanese paper is quoted below the British rate. Therefore, the patriotic sentiments of these good Australian folk are not so bright and strong as a few months ago. </para>
                    <para>Next came a representative of the Amalgamated British newsprint manufacturers to Australia. He interviewed representative city and country press proprietors, and put forward a certain proposition. Supposing that a great British corporation were to come to this country, interested in wool or timber or steel; a*nd suppose that it promised to establish great industries here either now or within reasonable prospect, would not that proposition - being a matter of such tremendous national interest - be made known generally through the p,reG3 ?  Would not the  newspapers  publish the particulars from one&#39; end of the land to the other? In this particular case, however, there was, all over Australia, an organized conspiracy of silence on the part of the newspapers. It was determined that the propositions of the amalgamated British firms should not be made known to the public. I repeat that the British makers got their agent to come out here. This representative gentleman was. associated particularly with the  Donside  Mills. of Aberdeen. Probably the Scots were canny. Naturally, they selected the best man they could get. They considered that if an appeal to the pocket3 of the Australian proprietors were vain, an appeal to their sentiments might succeed. -So they selected and sent a man who was not only a commercial director, but had  been  a soldier, and who carried an empty sleeve to demonstrate that he was not only a lip patriot, but had been a patriot in action.  His  propositions were advanced somewhat after this manner: &#34;Gentlemen, you want 50,000 tons of paper. That quantity is equivalent to 65,000 cubic tons measurement for purposes of maritime transport. We are prepared to supply you- in any width or colour, and to deliver at any British port for the same price as our products are supplied to British newspapers. That is to say, at the cost of production, plus 15 per cent. And these particulars you may verify, if you desire, with the aid of your own auditors.&#34; He added, &#34;But if you will not accept that proposition, we are prepared to supply at a price not exceeding current market prices in Europe and America, but not at dumped &#34; prices in Australia.&#34;  This visiting Scottish representative proposed, further, to ship all the paper in vessels of. the Commonwealth Line of Steamships. He undertook, also, that all reductions in freight which might be made as a result of exclusively using those ships should go to the newspaper proprietors of Australia, in the form of reduced rates for -the actual commodity. This latter proposition had nothing to do with the matter of foreign ships or foreign flags, and it might have been thought that such an offer would have appealed to patriotism. It did not, however. The representative of the amalgamated British interests added, in. still further concession, that when Australia was prepared to go into the manufacture of its&#39; own newspaper supplies the British corporation concerned would be ready  to guarantee, if so desired, to furnish half the capital, and any special machinery over which it was holding patent rights, and to send out trained, experts and technicians from its own mills, in order to thoroughly and properly establish the Australian industry. The representative finally added - </para>

                    <para class="block">If that proposition had been advanced in connexion with any other of our industries, would not the public have been given some information &#39; But there was no word of publicity. These bargainers of Emp*ire, these protectors of the flag, these lovers of their King and country, were willing to exploit anything and everything, and anybody and everybody, in the search for individual advantage. But, at first, they fell on the neck of this representative of the British corporation. Here, they said, was a man who would relieve them of the rapacity of the Scandinavians. And he was flooded with letters of warm welcome, and  testimonials and effusions breathing the love of freedom and bubbling over with patriotism. One of the Australian gentlemen interested wrote to him on the 23rd May last - </para>

                        <para>The re-entry of British newsprint manufacturers into the Australian trade is the one real pleasure wc have had for several years. Even &#39;before the war, Britain did not have a fair look in at pur markets, owing to so many of our merchants placing profit before patriotism. </para>

                    <para class="block">One can&#39; picture him writing that stuff as he sat at his desk, a little flag stuck into something at each side of him, a statue of the King in front of him, and pictures- of Empire subjects surrounding him upon the walls. On the 1.4th June this same writer pointed out that the newspapers of Australia had been for years the victims of &#34; the cruel exactions&#34; of the paper rings, not only of Scandinavia, but of America; and, further, he said that the press proprietors of Australia - had a clear and unanimous objection to any preference to newsprint manufactured in Canada, where the mill-owners have combined to rob Australian consumers of several millions sterling. </para>
                    <para class="block">Thus  our-  Australian  newspaper proprietors set a limit  upon  the. Empire because they have been subjected by fellow members of the Empire - Canadians, to wit - to &#34; cruel exactions.&#34; They refer to having been robbed of millions - not of modest thousands. These are the poor half-starved wretches who are living on the verge of poverty by the production of Australia&#39;s newspapers! The same writer went on to say to the British representative that, for these reasons - every newspaper proprietor, throughout the Commonwealth welcomes- the news that the Mother Country is about to re-enter the Australian market, and warmly supports preference being granted to her products. </para>
                    <para class="block">Everything was very fine and serene; but did the visiting gentleman get an order? One can hear him saying, &#34; Thank you ! Your speeches and sentiments are grand. Will you now place an order within the Empire, or do you propose to go outside of it?&#34; No, he could not get an order. They coldly said, &#34;What is your price?&#34; That- is at the bottom of it all. Six months ago the home price in Canada and in Scandinavian countries ranged from &#163;20 to &#163;30 per ton. The selling price here was &#163;75 - that is, roughly, &#163;45 to &#163;50 over the home consumption price in those countries. At that time, these patriots in Australia, who were so anxious to re-enter the markets of the dear old Motherland, sent a special representative to England to see if the British mills would supply better paper than those in Scandinavia. Later, the price of newsprint dropped, and, although the home consumption price was &#163;20 to &#163;30 in foreign countries, we were being charged &#163;40 over that figure. In a few weeks the price slumped, and newsprint is now selling below those prices in Canada and Scandinavia. What do these patriots now say? &#34; We shall treat you as Englishmen on condition that you follow the market down.&#34; These newspaper proprietors, who told the Minister that he must introduce legislation to prevent dumping in this country - directly and indirectly through their agents, within and without this chamber - said that he must not interfere, but must permit the British manufacturers to follow the dumped prices. The price came down to &#163;25 per ton, and they then said to the men of the same race and blood, &#34; We will  trade with  you Englishmen: &#39;if  your  &#34;prices come down.&#34; </para>
                    <para class="block">They asked the British manufacturers to follow the prices down. The newspapers were paying &#163;75 per ton, plus duties of &#163;3 and .&#163;8, for the paper they were getting twelve months ago. But now they are using their influence to prevent the Minister imposing the duty upon thu foreigner which he did twelve months ago. At that time, the. price was &#163;75 per ton, plus duty, and to-day it is &#163;25 per ton, plus duty, and they say they cannot pay the duty. Was ever such a proposition submitted to the Parliament of any country? Consider the reduction of the cost of newsprint, which means a saving of between &#163;2,000,000 and &#163;3,000,000 to the newspaper proprietors of the Commonwealth. Whilst the price of paper has tumbled from &#163;75 to &#163;25 per ton, and the total cost to them has dropped from &#163;1,500,000 to &#163;500,000, the newspaper proprietors have increased the cost of their publications to the general community from Id. to lid., and later to 3d. per copy. These newspaper proprietors are the gentlemen who refer to us as the  purloiners  of public funds; but they take more out of the pocket of the people in one day than we do in twelve months. This is the situation with which we are confronted. The great metropolitan newspaper proprietors, who boast of their* purity, and who pose as guardians of the public safety, are prepared to sacrifice their country in this deplorable way. They met in secret at Menzies Hotel, on the 11th, 12th, and 13 th May, with a policeman guarding the door so that no one could hear the negotiations proceeding. Then a new situation arose. We were informed that the Minister was not prepared to go on with this item because it had to be reconsidered by the Government. The policeman was removed from the door after the interested parties had come to a decision, and some one came forward and said that there should be no such proposal for British preference, because it would not pay them. It is most unfortunate for the newspaper proprietors, who applied to this Minister twelve &#39;months&#34; ago&#34; and asked if they could pay &#163;3 instead of &#163;8, pa&#39;rticularly as prices have dropped by &#163;50. They asked for further consideration. They claim protection. But why? </para>
                    <para class="block">Because they are the agents of the Government&#39;s propaganda. They said they want a, duty of 30s. per ton on all newsprint. A gentleman came along and said, &#34;Let us confer with the English representative at a round-table conference, and see if we can meet him.&#34;  Down came the price, and, of course, they were no longer patriots. They wanted the price still lower, and at last they said, &#34; We have no further use for you.&#34; They wanted to adhere to the proposition that the duty should come down to 30s. per ton. There was another round-table conference, and it was said that the conference had decided upon 30s., and the executive could not alter its decision. They further said, &#34; Of course, we may have sufficient influence as an executive to nullify the conditions if new data are submitted.&#34; This was not in writing; but it was so imperative and so important that it had to be whispered through a keyhole to an intermediary. That intermediary is in the vicinity of this chamber listening to what I have to say. He came over from Sydney as a confidential representative. He was not satisfied at receiving merely his travelling expenses from Sydney, but required &#163;50 for his expenses. If the British firm would not pay &#163;50, they would send another gentleman. This&#39; gentleman submitted a proposition, in spite of the decision that there  might  be an alteration and British preference secured if new data were submitted. The new data meant a sole agency for one man of all British newsprint on a 2$ per cent, basis, roughly, &#163;30,000. With this, new data at command, and the new power of conversion, the all-British proposition would be enthusiastically indorsed. Since that has been turned down, they have changed their opinions, and have come to the Minister with a request to reduce the duty from &#163;3 to 30s. These are the men who did not want Canadian or Scandinavian paper, as they were absolutely oppose! to the importation of foreign supplies. But what are they now prepared to give ? </para>

                            <para>- It is one of the finest I have had since I have been in Parliament. That is the proposition they have made. They propose that the rate shall be - British, 10s.; Canadian, 25s.; and Scandinavian, 30s. The newspaper proprietors of this country, who, twelve months ago, . were speaking of how the Scandinavians had robbed them of millions, and of their cruel exactions and robberies, are not now prepared to impose more than a 5 per cent. duty. A 5 per cent, duty on these robbers ! Why ? Because the British have come into the market, and have become the instrument of reduction. These gentlemen are asking for a refund of the amount of money of which they were robbed. The foreign makers of newsprint now say, &#34;We robbed you of millions, but now we are down to dumped prices,, and will rob you no more, but will give you back a little of that which we previously took from you.&#34; And as they can put money into their pockets, the newspaper proprietors are prepared to allow their patriotism to go into the dustbin. They serve their Empire merely when it pays them. I have never prate.d about my loyalty; but these men are hypocritical scoundrels, and mere  paraders  of words, who would sacrifice and prostitute their sentiments and loyalty for the sake of profit. They are prepared to say to the Empire, &#34; You can go to hell if you cannot undersell the foreign product.&#34; I ask the Minister if he is not prepared to submit an amendment which will be the means of affording some protection, for the simple reason that we should have some proposition which will give us an opportunity of&#39; establishing an industry of some kind in the near future? Is there no way by which we can give Imperial preference? Does the Minister mean to give it? I would like him to say &#34; yes &#34; or &#34; no.&#34; He is silent. &#39; Is1 he &#62;not, prepared to give a clear and definite preference?&#34; &#39;What  does that preference consist of? The Minister has told us that he needs revenue, and I can quite understand that. If he needs revenue, what amount does he wish to raise? He said quite recently that on a duty of &#163;3 per ton the Department raised from &#163;125,000 to &#163;150,000. If that is so, why should we not collect &#163;150,000 on imported paper? But the revenue should be&#39; derived from imposts on paper manufactured in the Empire, not in foreign countries. Does the Minister know what I have here? This is Japanese paper. Does he know who are asking him for help to bring in foreign products as against the British ? They are the gentlemen for whom the honorable member for Dampier speaks. Some of the Imperialistic newspapers in this country are already using Japanese paper. Even the American paper and the Scandinavian paper is too dear for them. They have no affection for the men of their own race, because their product is too dear. The white man&#39;s product is too dear for them, and so they go to Japan. </para>

                            <para>- Already there is a newspaper in this city printing upon Japanese paper. Here are samples of a new importation. The <inline font-style="italic">Tango Maru</inline> left a Japanese port on the 10th June, and has already arrived with a cargo consigned to the people for whom the honorable member for Dampier speaks. Those are the men who want to knock out the protective and preferential rates. The Minister&#39;s duty, if I may presume to tell him so, is not to listen to the voice of the press. He is responsible to this country, in the first place, to help to establish within Australia, if he possibly can, industries which are owned by Australians, and which are run for Australians. Secondly, his duty is to see that whatever comes into this country shall, if need be, be the product of men of our own race and blood, manufactured under the cover of that flag which is so often spoken about by these so-called patriots, who are patriots only when it does not interfere with their pockets. If the Minister wants revenue, let him raise it upon goods that come from England. If he imposes a 10 per cent. duty on paper from Britain, let him give Britain a preference of 15 per cent. by making the duty on Japanese and Scandinavian paper 25 per cent. That would . mean, on a basis of &#163;25 per ton, a preference of &#163;3 to &#163;4 per ton on British paper. What does the Minister say to that proposition ? Apparently he is against it. If he wants British paper to come in free, then let him impose a duty of 15 per cent. on the Japanese and Scandinavian product. I do. not care how he fixes it. I do not mind if he levies a duty on the British paper or not, but I do want to see a margin of 15 per cent. in favour of the British as against the Japanese, Scandinavian, and Canadian article. First of all, we should stand by our local industries, and, in the second place, we should stand by what honorable members have all professed so long to believe in, that is, Imperial preference; but when we do give a preference to Great Britain, let us make it real, and not a sham, a fraud, and a delusion. The honorable member for Ballarat proposes a duty of 45 per cent. on the foreign article. If that is agreed to, let us make the duty on the British article 15 per cent. lower; but the 45 per cent. proposal will not be carried. If it is not, we can try 40 per cent. ; but we will fight this thing from point to point. I put this to the Minister as my last word: &#34; Stick to what you were prepared to do by giving a preference of at least &#163;3 per ton to British goods. Let that be your sheet anchor and your hope, believing that, in spite of the press of this country, you can stand on any. platform and justify your attitude to the people of Australia.&#34; </para>

                        <para>. - I indorse generally the remarks of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> with the exception of some of his forecasts. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> fails even yet to realize the importance to Great Britain at this moment of a real protection to her paper industry. It is quite evident, from what has gone on during the past few weeks, that Britain&#39;s foreign competitors are prepared to send into this market, at considerable loss, the paper that is needed by local newspaper producers. If they succeed in that, they will be able to cripple the paper industry of Great Britain for quite a long time to come. During the war, that industry was pushed out of every overseas market because of its patriotic devotion to the needs of the Empire. It devoted the whole of its energies to the production of the paper necessary for the manufacture of munitions and for war services. During all that time, the people buying paper here were exploited in the most scandalous way, and now the British industry finds itself faced with the prospect of extinction unless it can regain some of its outside markets. If there is any industry that ought to appeal to the people of Australia and to this Committee, it is an industry that has made the sacrifices that the British paper industry has made in the common cause of the peoples of the Empire and the Allies. I hope we&#34; shall yet be able to obtain a greater preference in favour of the British product. If we do not secure such a preference as will enable Britain to retain the market of Australia, we shall repay the patriotism of the paper manufacturers of the Old Country by hastening their extinction in the interests of their competitors. I have heard, during these debates, many requests for the imposition of duties of 35 and 40 per cent., and even higher, in order to establish some very small industry in Australia; and on this occasion we should go very much further than a 10 per cent, duty in favour of that great industry in Great Britain which did so much to help to win the war, and which, because of what it did then, is likely to suffer the loss of this market unless this Parliament gives it that protection which our many professions of a desire for the preferential treatment of the Old Land might reasonably have led it to &#39;expect. I hope we shall get a little higher duty than the Minister proposes, but ,I am not prepared to go quite so high as 45 per cent. We ought to go at least to 25 per cent, in favour of Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- I- wish they were also. I should- be very proud to command the honorable member&#39;s language; but I have not got it, and I know it. The honorable member, in spite of his great outburst of - patriotism on this occasion, has . been very silent about Great Britain all the time the Tariff has been going through this Chamber. Night after night we have battled for special preference for Great Britain on other articles, but the honorable member has either been away altogether or has been completely silent. Why, then, this sudden outburst? We know that, during the war, not only have the Canadian and Scandinavian importers been exploiting the people of this country, but in Great Britain the enormous profits made by firms like Coats and Company have been something scandalous. There has been exploitation on every hand, and efforts should have been made to prevent it. If it could not be prevented, the State should have tried to commandeer some portion of the money which was extorted from the public. No one here is- in favour of the exploiter. On the other hand, we must consider those who are building up industries in Australia, and newspaper production is quite as much an industry as any other. Right through the Tariff there will be found very fair preferences in favour of British goods, but in this item, which has been standing in this schedule now for over twelve months, the British rate is 5 per cent., as against a general rate of 10 per cent.,, and I have not heard the honorable member for Bourke, or any one else, make any special complaint about it. </para>

                            <para>- It is only within the last&#39; few days that the British agent has been here, and he has done his share of intriguing. A few&#39; days ago he told me that he was endeavouring to arrange contracts for British firms. I told him to see the country press and endeavour to make contracts with them, and that I would want to hear from the country press if anything in the way of reasonable contracts had &#39; been obtained ; that I could have no association with the agents. Honorable members cry out about Japanese paper, but only about &#163;10,000 worth&#39; of paper has come from Japan. There has been practically no trade with that country in paper, and we do not anticipate any. Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Finland are supplying us, and we hope that Great Britain will come back into the market. When I proposed my amendment,, I said that I would much prefer to put Great Britain on the free list, but that I did not think the Minister would accept that, because he had included in the schedule a duty of 5 per cent, on British and 10 per cent, on foreign paper, I thought if I proposed 10s. per ton British and 30s. per ton general, I would be giving 100 per cent, more preference to Great Britain than the Minister did. I am pleased the Minister has gone so far now as to propose to make British paper free. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know, unless the fact has come to the Minister&#39;s knowledge that Great Britain is desirous of getting into the trade again, and that its agents are- coming to Australia. . I am satisfied that the Minister has a keen desire to give preference to Great Britain. It is true that, on several occasions, when I asked for a larger British preference he would not agree to it; but, taking the Tariff right through, honorable members will see that what may be looked on as fair and generous preference has been given. The agent who supplied the honorable member for Bourke with his information asked that British paper should be allowed in free, and a duty of &#39;&#163;4 per ton imposed under the general Tariff. The question we have to decide is whether that amount of preference is not too great. I have just been handed a letter from one of the newspaper people. The writer refers to the fact that these people have put proposals before one of the large newspaper companies. In reply, the company writes as follows.: - </para>

But Japanese  strawboard  is very inferior, and we know that only a small quantity of printing paper has been imported from Japan, and that, very likely, because of the impossibility of importing sufficient from elsewhere to meet the big demand here.  I do not suppose that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> can trace other importations from the same source. </para>

I am aware that the British manufacturers are buying spruce forests in Canada with a view to pulping for their requirements, but the only question before us to-day is whether we are giving sufficient preference to Great Britain. The rates of duty set out in the. schedule are British, 5 per cent, and foreign, 10 per cent. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has now come forward with a proposal to allow printing paper to come in free from Great Britain, and impose a duty of 40s. in the intermediate and general columns of the schedule. My original proposal was to make the rates 10s., 25s., and 30s.; but I am quite in sympathy with the Minister&#39;s proposal to impose no duty upon printing paper manufactured in Great Britain. If we were to impose the rate of duty asked for by the representatives of the British manufacturers, namely, &#163;4 per ton, the duty payable upon newsprint imported from other countries, would amount to &#163;280,000 a year.

Although not personally interested, I have felt very keenly the fact that&#39; the&#39; press of Australia were being bled white by those countries which were supplying us with printing paper, among which, I am sorry to say, is Canada;  because people of our race in Canada associated themselves with American manufacturers, and fixed upon a price of &#163;75 per ton for the paper they agreed to supply to Australia, and also imposed very heavy shipping freights upon the carriage of it to this country.

The trouble is that those people who have been charging us the excess between this reasonable price and &#163;75 per ton are in a position to utilize , the immense profits they made during the war - proceeds of robbery I call them - by furnishing&#39; us with paper at- a cheap price in order to drive the British manufacturers out of the market. I wonder what would &#39;have been the price &#39; of their paper now if they had not ascertained that British manufacturers were prepared to come upon the market and charge us a fair price. In the circumstances it is only fair that we should give a preference to Great Britain. I sincerely trust that the Minister will not accede to the request for a lower duty against foreign countries. On the other hand, I hope he will increase the rate against those people who penalized us during the war, when we had to depend upon them for supplies of paper. The paper makers of Canada were able to -make contracts with America at certain fixe&#39;d prices, but refused to make such contracts with Australia, simply saying &#34; Give us your&#39; orders  and we will execute them at our own price, and carry the stuff in our own vessels at our own rates of freight.&#34; If that be so, we have no right, on the pretext f trying to help the press of Australia, to prevent the imposition of an effective Protective duty. In view of the offer which the British manufacturers have made, how can it be said that the press of Australia will be penalized ? The only course is to protect those who have made this offer, for five years if necessary, and so prevent dumping by those who took advantage of us in our time of need. </para>
                    <para>Mr.FENTON (Maribyrnong) &#91;3.46&#93;. - Thehonorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> has certainly opened up a new avenue of thought in relation to this item. Some of the particulars which he gave to the Committee were known to honorable members, but we were not in possession of all the facts he has related. One of the most pleasing features is that our own kith and kin, with big financial backing, are prepared, as soon as Australia is ready, to establish the paper industry in our midst, if practicable. That is the only way in which a great industry like paper-making can be established, and some of us have been putting forward that argument throughout this debate. The Minister, too, has made that policy one of the cardinal principles of- his Tariff, and has mentioned instances of the promise of Protective duties having induced big British firms to establish works in Australia, although we had been told a few years before that there was no possibility of anything of the kind. The timber industry is closely related to paper-making. Already Australian paper mill owners have carried out experiments, and the samples before the Committee prove that from our own woods a very good class of paper can be manufactured. I do not know that we possess those words in sufficient quantities, but the experiments have not yet exhausted all varieties of Australian timber. In any case, I understand that close handy in the Pacific Islands are vast forests from which considerable supplies of timber can be obtained for the manufacture of newsprint in Australia. As one who knows something about printing papers, I pronounce the samples before the Committee to be far superior to the paper upon which any newspaper in Australia is printed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but our mills are already turning out good job-printing paper. I know there is a difficulty in obtaining the pulp, but it has been demonstrated that even with the present machinery and plant very fine paper can be produced in the Commonwealth. Investigations should be carried a little further. Australia now has one of the best opportunities ever presented to it of establishing a big industry. With the present plant and material backed by British capital, and perhaps a few leading hands from the Old Country, and the establishment of pulp-making plants, we shall be able to produce in Australia, if not all, at any rate, a reasonable proportion, of the paper we require. In regard to the imports from Japan, it is a known fact that during the war, and even earlier, Japan got her nose into the paper and strawboard trade, and it will not be long before she gets her whole body in. </para>

                            <para>- According to the <inline font-style="italic">Tariff Book,</inline> in  the  year 1918-19 printing paper to the value of &#163;7,058 was imported from Japan, and &#163;59,000 worth from  the  United Kingdom. It must be remembered that during the war British factories were converted for the production of munitions, but now they have returned to their former business, with the advantage of improved machinery. In the same year the value of the other paper imports was from Canada, &#163;371,000; from Newfoundland, &#163;46,000; from Straits Settlements,&#163;220; . from Norway, &#163;291,925; from Sweden, &#163;121,000; and from the United. States of America, &#163;988,000. We know that the printing trade in America has progressed, and that practically the whole paper production of that country can be absorbed locally. But the capitalists of  the  United States of America have put their finger in the Canadian pie, and now control the prices of paper in that Dominion. When Australian journalists went to the Canadian mills, they were quoted 3&#189; cents, but they were referred from place to place,  and person to person, until finally the quotation had advanced to 13&#189; cents. That indicates that Canada has adopted the truly American principle of trying to fleece the people whenever the opportunity is afforded. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the distribution of goods in Australia is costing the consumer too much. The consumer is not brought sufficiently close to the producer; but when the producers have got rid of the middlemen who are riding so heavily on their backs, they will reap more of the reward they ought to get for their industry. It is safe to say that some of the keenest business men in the world are to be found in Japan, and that country is now operating very extensively in Siberia. There are in Siberia great forests, control of which has passed to Japan as one of the results of the great war. It will be recollected that some years ago the Oriental Timber Company was formed in Geelong, and it was proposed to import great quantities of timber from Siberia. Our late friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Hirsch, visited eastern countries for the purpose of obtaining supplies In eastern Siberia, Japan has an almost inexhaustible supply of very fine timbers ; and unless preventive measures are taken by means of this Tariff, the present importation of paper from Japan to the value of &#163;7,000 will increase by leaps and bounds, to the vanquishment of every other competitor. </para>

                        <para>That the House do now adjourn,  may I be permitted to express the hope that next week we shall make an effort to conclude the consideration of the Tariff schedule? That seems to be not an unreasonable request to make at this stage of our proceedings and having regard to what lies ahead of us in that schedule. When we have dealt with the Tariff, there are three other Bills to be presented to the House for consideration. In all the circumstances, therefore, we must make up our minds to conclude the consideration of the schedule next week. </para>

                        <para>.- So far as honorable members upon this side of the Chamber are concerned, we will do our best to assist the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to dispose of the Tariff next week. But the honorable gentleman must realize that there is likely to be a heavy discussion upon two or three items. There is, for example, the item of paper with which we have been dealing to-day, and we have also to consider the duties to be imposed upon cardboard and explosives. With the exception of these items, I do not anticipate that there will be much discussion of the schedule. We shall certainly do our best to expedite the transaction of business. </para>

                        <para>. -  Since I announced my resignation from the Joint House Committee this morning, I have learned that a horse has been engaged to work in this building. Having dismissed the lift attendant, the  President  of the Senate has imposed upon one of the employees here by requiring him, in addition to his other duties, to clean the Queen&#39;s Hall. The other cleaners in the building admit that this man, whose name is Peffiter, will have to do three times the amount of work that they do. They are laughing at the joke of the President&#39;s imposition upon this man after his dismissal of the lift attendant. I cannot countenance this sort of conduct, and, consequently, I have resigned from the Committee. </para>

I requested the  President  of the Senate as  Chairman  of the Committee to furnish me with a full report of the action of which complaint has been made. From his report, which I shall read for the information of honorable members,I gather that the appointments to which exception has been taken are not within the purview of the Joint House Committee at all. They are under the control of the Public Service Commissioner and the Auditor-General, who have several times requested the authorities here - the head of the staff and others - to take action. </para>

                            - You,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline>
                            have stated that, after inquiries from different sources, it has been found that the case of this young man is not one for the Joint House Committee, but one which concerns the Auditor-General, who has, on different occasions, drawn attention to the fact that he has been employed here as a temporary hand for a longer term than is sanctioned by the Public Service Act Regulations. I have no doubt that that statement is correct. The Public Service Act Regulation, if my memory serves me aright, provides that a temporary employee cannot be retained for more than nine months, whereas this young fellow, to my knowledge, has been employed here for ten years, or thereabouts. During that period I have always found him most courteous and obliging; indeed, I do not think there could be a better lad employed in this House. I have quietly interested myself in the case for the last three or four weeks. It became known to me that there was a move to dismiss this lad, and I felt very keenly for him. He is in ill-health, consequent upon being, inoculated at the request of the Joint House Committee, and is now unable to follow any other employment than such as that he has been engaged in here. I interviewed an officer on the Senate side, who pointed out, as you, sir, have done this afternoon, that efforts had been made by the Auditor-General to have him displaced on the ground that he was not a permanent employee. I do not wish to go into the whole facts of the case, hut I remind you,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline>
                            that this young man could be created a. permanent official. The strange thing is that two other young men, who entered the parliamentary employment six or eight months ago, or, at any rate, quite recently, have been gazetted as permanent officers. It is true that these are returned men; but we notice the great difference in the treatment. This liftman endeavoured to enlist for the war, but was rejected as unfit.

During the influenza epidemic he was compelled by the parliamentary officials to undergo inoculation, and it is this which has led to his present ill-health. As a returned soldier&#39;, and a member of the Soldiers League, I can say that the official body of that League  would not  sanction the displacement, in favour of any returned soldier, of a young man who had offered his services to the country. I- trust that between now and Tuesday the matter will be reconsidered, and a satisfactory solution arrived at. </para>

It might happen occasionally that one had to ring the lift bell more than once, but he could always be heard running to the lift from some place where possibly he had been delivering a message. Quite recently there has been an appointment made in another place, and, although it is said that this man&#39;s services are not necessary, we find a new man in the lift to-day. It has been- said that the lift attendant has been seen under the influence of liquor, but while he was working the lift, and, before that, when he was employed in the Refreshment Room, I never saw any sign of liquor about him. </para>

                        <para>.- Some time ago I asked whether the employee in charge of our lift received wages up to the award made for liftmen outside. I am of opinion that the Government should pay their employees award rates in every instance. I understand that this young man&#39;s wages amounted to &#163;2 8s. per week. The award for liftmen is lis. per <inline font-style="italic">day,</inline> and from the time that was mentioned a certain gentleman holding a position in another place has been very much offended with me for making inquiries in connexion with the matter. I will not say what he said, but certain words passed, and there has been evident a desire to remove this young mau, who possesses British pluck, and, like myself, will stand up for his rights and damn every one who tries to deny them. </para>

                        <para>.- Older members of the House have spoken, and I think it is right that, as a young member, I should say that I have always received the utmost courtesy from the lift-boy to whom reference has been made. In my view, it is regrettable that his services have been dispensed with, and that another person should now be doing the work at which he was previously employed. There is no question of economy at issue, though there seems to be some misunderstanding on that point. I should fail in justice to this young man, who has an invalid sister and elderly mother dependent upon him, if I did not say that I had always received the utmost courtesy from him. I hope that he. will be restored to his former  position, and will continue to merit the affection of members of both parties in this House. </para>

                        <para>.- I also appeal to you, sir, to -see that justice is done to this young man. The fact that he has rendered service here for ten years sufficiently indicates that his service was not unsatisfactory. I have been a member of the House for about four years, and to say that this young &#39;man was anything but courteous and efficient is to utter a travesty of the truth. There is another aspect of the question which should be given- consideration. From time to time honorable members have made inquiries as to the salaries paid to parliamentary attendants. There seems to he, on. the part of those in control of those attendants, a tendency to resent any application by them for better conditions. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has touched upon the real trouble, and that is that the House Committee apparently, has no say in connexion with the appointment of attendants upon Parliament. The  President  is  Chairman  of the House Committee, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is also  a member  of it. It is  a  Joint Committee in every respect, and should be given more extended powers than it has. I had the honour of serving on the Committee at one time, and .1 know that questions concerning the wages of the refreshmentroom staff were considered and determined by that Committee. Why one section&#39; of the wages staff of Parliament should be under the control of the Committee and another should be removed from that control has always been a mystery to me. The right course to pursue is to give greater power to the House Committee to control the wages staff. So far as this particular young man is concerned, I may truthfully say that during the last eighteen months, while acting in an official position, as one of the Whips of the Ministerial -party, I never found him anything but obliging to the utmost degree. If there has been urgency in advising honorable members that a division was about to take place, or it has been necessary to inform some honorable member that his presence was urgently required, .this particular lad was always found willing .to render assistance in a marked degree.&#39; Few honorable members have had .as much running about this building as- I have had in the last eighteen months, and, in common with&#39; my predecessors in the position of Whip, I can assert that this young man has always been most obliging and respectful. I cannot for the life of me understand why. he should be penalized after ten years&#39; service. </para>

                            <para>- It was a complete surprise to me to hear that the services of this lad had been dispensed with. As one who has had something to do with the Returned Soldiers- League, I join with the honorable member for- Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> in saying that, while it is the policy of the league that there should be-&#39; preference to returned soldiers, it has never asked that men who .genuinely tried and failed to go to the Front should be displaced to make room for returned soldiers. The league has always contended that where fresh appointments are concerned, returned soldiers should be  given priority; but that is a different matter altogether. I feel that on this occasion one is bound to say what he knows of the young man in question, and I hope that, as a result of this debate, some definite action will be taken to give this lad, at an independent inquiry, an opportunity to state his case in detail, or, failing that, that the House Committee will be armed with much more extensive powers than it possesses to-day. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to explain the reason for the injury to the arm of this unfortunate young man. During the influenza scare, the officers and other persons attached to the staff of this Parliament were asked to undergo a serum injection. The man in question opposed that, because his medical adviser had expressed the view that he was not in good health, and that it would not be well for him to be inoculated. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stevens,</inline> who. is a very good man, and who was tha departmental officer Who was doing the inoculating, asked that he might make an examination of him, and then said, &#34; In. my opinion  you are fit to have serum injected.&#34; Thereupon the young man underwent the necessary treatment. The consequences, however, were so severe that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stevens</inline> did not give the second injection.- To my knowledge, this unfortunate individual has been attending hospital for massage and other treatment, month after, month, and his arm. is not right at the present- moment. Conservative  minds in the medical and surgical world are not too strongly convinced concerning the ultimate effects of serum treatment. &#39;Great results certainly have been, obtained by it. This. cas.e is .the only one in which the inoculation did .not prove satisfactory among all those dealt with in this establishment. The  honorable  member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> myself, and the  President  of the Senate, had experience on one occasion of certain vaccines, and we were the unfortunate </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Ones.  Serum  treatments frequently give results which .are anything but desirable. I am sure every honorable member is sorry that the young man&#39;s mother has been dragged into this vendetta. It was stated that she had written a letter saying that her son had told untruths about his hours of attendance in this building, and, in other words,, that, he was not re- liable. I have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie for the honorable position he to.ok up in this matter. In the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of 26th November, 1920 (page 707), there will be found a complete refutation of. the accusation, for the letter was never seen , and could not be produced. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> ari.nounced some time ago that, on account of the increased cost of living, a certain allowance would be granted  to various employees in this building, and the amount- &#163;10 - was ultimately increased to &#163;15. The young man- in question, in company with several of &#39;his fellow workers, was opening -his pay envelope in the presence of the Senate .officer who was making the payment, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Broinowski,</inline> and he found that he had been given only &#163;12 10s., whereas the others, had received &#163;15. He turned round, and. said, &#34;Look! I have been robbed.&#34; The, paying officer reported this remark to -the  President,  saying, however, that the young man had said that he (Broinowski.) had done the robbery. The other fellow employee was present throughout, the. whole incident,, and he, as well as the young man immediately concerned, is willing to give sworn evidence that the words were not used as the Senate officer complained. The young man was ready to go before a Select Committee of the Senate, in order to give evidence; but he was not permitted to be a witness.. On two distinct occasions he was summoned by the Committee to appear before it, and he actually- obtained permission from the head of his Department <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. U&#39;Ren)</inline> ; but the  President  told him that if he dared,&#39; to give evidence to the Committee, drastic action would be taken against him. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> tabled a motion in this chamber proposing an inquiry into the position of the employees of the Parliament. Unfortunately, its immediate discussion was objected to by the late honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> and by another honorable member on the other side of the House. Thus the desired appointment of a Committee from this side of the Parliament to act with the Senate Committee was frustrated: Had such a Committee been appointed&#62; it would have acted in conjunction with the Senate Committee, and some final understanding would have been arrived at. It  is  absurd that we should have two authorities controlling the affairs of this Parliament, the one governing this House and the other governing Senate matters, and that either, or both, should at times come into contact with the Joint House Committee. The result of it all is that we do not know where we are in regard to the control of our employees. I feel sure that honorable members will give this young man a chance. It is idiotic to say that a man is temporarily employed when he has served in this building for ten years; it is wicked, as well as absurd. Permanency of employment is the greatest incentive possible to good service. </para>

                            <para>- I have carefully noted what has been said in regard to this matter. I can only present the report of the Joint House Committee as it has been submitted to me . I referred specifically, first to that portion of the report of the Committee which stated that the employee concerned has not been dismissed; and, secondly, to the statement that no one has been appointed to take his place. As to the permanency of his employment, I do not see that any inquiries of mine can lead anywhere, or take matters any further. The young man is apparently under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, who is governed, of course, by the Public Service Act. The Auditor-General has repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that persons placed in positions such as that of the young man in question are temporary officers, and, as such, cannot be retained in service beyond a certain period. Acting upon this, the Joint House Committee has taken action. I have done all that is possible in the limited time at my disposal. I have interviewed &#34;the  President  and every member of the House Committee who was present at yesterday&#39;s meeting, I have submitted this report to them individually, in order to ask for their corroboration, or approval, or rejection of the statements contained therein, and each of those with whom I spoke has assured me that the report, as it has been presented, is absolutely correct; that is to say, that the Committee, as a Committee, did not take independent action in this matter, but simply had to obey the law. </para>

                            <para>- I think I should not be expected to answer that question. The Public Service Act makes provision that a certain period - I think the maximum is nine months - shall be the term of service of a temporary officer, and there is the further provision, I believe, that he may after an interval be reemployed. Distinctly, however, the limit of continuous temporary employment is nine months. It was not the intention of the Act that any one classed as a temporary employee should be retained in service for ten consecutive years, without becoming a permanent officer. I do not know why that procedure was not adopted in this instance. </para>
