                        <para>- The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works is a Committee created by an Act. of Parliament, and is the servant, not of the Government, but of Parliament. This House refers matters to it for investigation, and it is the Committee&#39;s duty to report direct to the Parliament. Last year, among the references to the Committee were two for the investigation of proposals to continue the railway north from Oodnadatta and southwards from the Northern Territory. The references were to the whole Committee, but, so that the investigations might be made as economically as possible, the Committee decided that the work should be done by a sectional Committee. The Act prescribes that a sectional Committee shall consist of not less than three members. There are, however, difficulties in the way of getting three members to go on this journey. Personally, I should much like to make an investigation of the country that the railway would traverse,andIthink,notwithstanding the criticism about the cost of the proposed inquiry, that it would be of great advantage to this Parliament to know much more of the interior and northern parts of the continent. However, owing to engagements in connexion with the Tariff, it is impossible for me to go. What I wish to ask now, though I am in doubt as to whom I should address the question, is whether Parliament will withdraw these references, should it be thought undesirable to carry out the investigations, or ask the members of the existing Committee to tender their resignations, so that other members may be appointed who would give effect to the instructions of Parliament?  I  do not know if the Acting Prime Minister can tell us what the Government desire in this matter, but I think that one of those courses should be taken. Any investigation that is made must be made during the winter months. Motor oars have been purchased for the work, and, fuel and food supplies have been sent  along  the track. If the Committee is to make the investigations this year it must start within the next few months. </para>

                    <para>- The Government - and, I take it, the Parliament - desires that these investigations shall be proceeded with. Apparently the Committee, after asking for a vote to provide for the proposed expedition, is now on strike. It is rather a pity that members of the Committee did not, before they incurred all this expense, say that they would not make the investigation. I do not know any details about the matter beyond those that the honorable member has given me. The position is that the House has instructed the Committee to make these investigations. </para>

The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department was informed of the error, and the  Deputy  Postmaster-General for New South Wales admitted it to be the fault of a depart mental official, but he said that the Department could not, under any circumstances, compensate the person who had been damaged.  I  ask the Postmaster-General if he will give the assurance that in cases of this kind the Postal Department, and- not the senders of telegrams, shall bear any loss that may be caused by the mistakes of departmental officials. </para>

                            present contract with the Orient Steam-ship Company Limited was entered into on the 15th November, 1907, and provided for a fortnightly mail service between Australia and Great Britain, which alternating with a fortnightly service entered into between the British Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, gave us a regular weekly mail service. The Orient Steam-ship Company Limited gave us twenty-four calendar months notice of their intention to terminate the contract, which will expire oh the 18th September, 1921.In view of the approaching termination of the present agreement, negotiations were entered into by the Government with representatives of the Orient Steam-ship Company Limited. The latter stated that, in their opinion, it was desirable to  treat the immediate future as a transitional period, and that it would be unwise for the Commonwealth Government to enter into commitments of an onerous and far-reaching character at the present level of prices, whilst the same reason, combined with the uncertainty as to future revenue, would make such commitments wholly unacceptable to the company. They therefore proposed an arrangement of a temporary nature, which would cover the transitional period referred to, and which could be terminated by either party giving twelve calendar months&#39; notice at any time. Their proposal provided for thirteen despatches per annum each way at four-weekly intervals (which was the most frequent service they could give with the vessels at their disposal), and was based generally on the terms and conditions of the present contract. The. result of the negotiations was that an arrangement has been entered into under which the Orient Steam-ship Company Limited have agreed to continue to carry mails under the terms of the present contract subject to the following alterations: -

And will he, in order to see that our -people are properly safeguarded, read such imported literature himself? </para>

I understand that previous rulings which have been given from the Chair regarding the rights of honorable members in the matter of moving amendments have been reviewed. In view of that position, I wish to know whether, before the Committee comes to the stage of item-by-item consideration, it would not be wise if honorable members were informed exactly of their rights and privileges in this respect. </para>

When the question indicated by the honorable member arises during the discussion in Committee upon the Tariff schedule, item by item, the  Chairman  of Committees will then, no doubt, make known his ruling in the matter. It will be for the Committee thereupon to accept or dissent from his ruling and, by its vote, to determine whether such decision shall stand. </para>

                            <para>A number of Senior Cadets of the two junior quotas have attended drill in their civilian clothes. During the training year 1920-21 there has been no shortage of uniforms for either the Citizen Forces or the two elder quotas of Senior Cadets. The Government decided, late in 1920, to supply an athletic outfit instead of a military uniform, and supplies of these had then to be arranged for. It is not considered there would ordinarily be any justification for compensating youths who wear plain clothes at drill, but exceptional cases of destruction or severe damage due to accident whilst in the performance of military exercises receive full consideration. </para>

                        <para>- The war-time profits tax was paid by the societies referred to in respect of the year 1915-16 only. When the amending Act was passed exempting these societies from the tax, the question of making the exemption retrospective was carefully considered, and it was decided that it should apply only to the year then current and future years. I see no reason for now reversing this decision. </para>

Although the Government, on the recent celebration of the day, gave its servants a holiday on full pay, the only proper method by which a holiday could be given, many large employers of labour gave their workmen a forced holiday without pay. The Government could not justify the holding of a pageant except by paying the men who took the day off in order to assist in it, and when they announced their intention to do this, I asked the Prime Minister if he could manage to get the Employers Federation and the Chambers of Manufactures to show their loyalty by paying the employees to whom they would be giving the day off. There are many large manufacturing establishments in the Melbourne Ports electorate who displayed their loyalty by closing their establishments, but; unfortunately, their workmen drew  no pay for the day, although I am certain that, at the end of the year, the profits of these firms would not be affected if they had chosen to pay their employee&#163; for their lost time. According to a letter 1 have received, the Dunlop Rubber Company gave their employees a forced holiday without pay. I think the Government, either by moral suasion, or by legislation, should take steps to prevent  flag-waggers  from putting their men off on Anzac Day without paying them. The occasion is one that can only be fitly commemorated by men who are &#34;not losing their wages through not working on the day. In most cases, the soldiers who took part in the public proceedings were paid; but I am led to believe that many private employers did not pay their men. I should like the Government to take into consideration the desirableness of making it compulsory that employees who are granted a holiday on Anzac Day shall receive payment for it. The War Precautions Act, during the war, was used against me, and many other- supporters of the principles of the Labour party, and if any part of it is in operation next year advantage might be taken of it to compel employers - who in war time waved the flag to some purpose in the shape of larger dividends and increased bank accounts - to pay their men for Anzac Day. It would be better, however, to introduce special legislation on the subject. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to draw the attention of the Government to .an important matter relating to invalid and old-age pensions. There is in existence at the present time a most remarkable regulation dealing with invalid pensions. The man who rears a largo family does a service to the community, and the cost should be a community charge. If he has, amongst his family, an invalid son or daughter, that iii valid, after reaching the age of sixteen years, may in certain circumstances claim an invalid pension; but I know of many instances where men bear the whole cost of the maintenance of such children. In pre-w.ar days the Department had a method of calculating the cost of keeping a family of four or five, and if the earnings pf the father of an invalid child were in excess of that amount the invalid could not obtain the pension.&#39; </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. If the father of an invalid son ordered him out of the house, that son, as soon as he left home, could get the pension. But if it is desired that such an invalid , shall remain in his own home, in order that he may receive the very best attention, the pension is not forthcoming. The maintenance of such cases should be a community charge. Where a man is maintaining an invalid child, there is no reason  why  that child should not receive the full invalid pension, since the payment of it would help to make his life, perhaps, a little more tolerable than it is. In any event, the payment of an invalid pension is not likely to be of long duration in any one case, and I am, therefore, at a loss to account for the attitude of the Department. I do not blame the officials. I have endeavoured to induce the Treasurer to reframe the regulation, with due regard to the present-day purchasing power of the sovereign, in determining what is necessary to maintain .a family. I think that the whole regulation should be wiped out, and that a re-.assessment of what is necessary should be made. I am surprised that this matter has not been taken up more vigorously  by  the press, and that the newspapers have not endeavoured to show the Government what is their duty in this direction. I have no desire to attack the Treasurer, but would urge him, in preparing the Estimates for the coming financial year, to&#39; provide for the payment of pensions to invalids living in their own homes. If these people were turned out of doors  by  their parents, and told a friendly policeman that they had no homes, and were crippled or suffering from some disease which made it impossible for them to earn their own living, they would either be granted an invalid pension or would be placed in a home. </para>

                    <para class="block">That, however, is a very roundabout way of securing help, and there should be no necessity for it. Invalids who are maintained by their parents should have the additional assistance which a pension would afford them. </para>
                    <para>There is another question to which I desire to refer. Those who fall by the wayside in fighting under our present economic system, and find it necessary on becoming aged to enter a benevolent institution, cannot obtain an old-age pension while they remain there. Inmates who got the pension before entering the asylum are made an allowance of 2s. per week; the rest of the pension goes to the institution itself. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the point. What I wish to emphasize is that, while a section of the inmates of charitable institutions receives 2s. per week, there is another section which gets nothing at all. It is absurd that two men who have given equally of their strength to the community, and who are equally deserving of consideration, should be Sup.jected to this differential treatment. Until the last two or three years I used to visit various benevolent institutions, hut - I do not know whether it is that I am reaching the stage at which most men cannot look after themselves - I find that I cannot continue the practice. </para>

The individual members of the Government must have had cases of the kind brought under their notice by their constituents, and certainly the time has arrived when the whole matter should he reconsidered and new regulations drawn up in order that justice may be done.

                            <para>.- I support the remarks made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> in reference to the pensioner inmates of our public institutions. It is most unjust that these men and women should be deprived of this paltry 2s. a~ week. Those who entered the institutions prior- to the passing of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act are denied this payment, with the result that many have left institutions for a few months or so, applied for an old-age pension, and,, on it being granted, have re-entered and claimed the allowance. This is not the first occasion on which I have referred to the matter, but the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has, so far, not seen his way clear to grant any relief. These inmates do not ask for any favour, but simply for justice; and, once again, 1 lodge my protest against the attitude- of the authorities. </para>

                                <para>-Iregret that the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> is not present, because the case with which I am dealing specially concerns his Department, by which this ex-warrant officer has been subjected to great injustice. Little was intrusted with certain responsibilities when with the Forces in Alexandria, and was, as I say, the victim of a conspiracy on the part of certain native and Greek contractors for billeting of men. Little made repeated complaints of the inferior food supplied by these contractors, and threatened the cancellation of contract. They then charged him with having endeavoured to secure certain consideration from them, alleging that he had complained because of their refusal. </para>

                        <para>General Boyle, an Imperial officer, reviewed the evidence of an inquiry conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Major C.</inline> S. Cunningham, but found that there was insufficient evidence on which to come to a decision, and recommended that Little be returned to his unit without prejudice. Yet later, he was sent back to Australia, and discharged without a further investigation, and with a most unsatisfactory discharge. </para>
                        <para class="block">He is suffering to this day, because of the conspiracy of natives in Alexandria whose evidence was contradictory, and could not be substantiated. As he did not get a clean discharge, he bears the stigma of unfaithfulness to duty while abroad. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Major C.</inline> S. Cunningham noted upon a document in connexion with this case that the evidence of the native contractors was most contradictory. Not only has ex-Warrant Officer Little suffered in reputation through not getting a clean discharge, but he has had to submit to a reduction of his war gratuity. In the usual course he would have received &#163;128 9s. 6d., but he has been paid &#39;only &#163;47 15s. 6d. Had he not enlisted and gone abroad, and thus become the victim of the conspiracy to which I have alluded, he would now hold a higher position in the Defence Department than that which he fills. It is strange that the Department, if it thinks him guilty of the wrong-doing charged against him, employs him in any capacity, even though it be a lower one than that in which he was employed before he left Australia. I ask that an inquiry be made to give an opportunity for Little to prove his innocence, and the Department to establish a case against him. This is a summary of the facts. Little embarked on 20th October, 1914, and arrived in Egypt on 3rd December following. He was recommended for commissioned rank about November, 1915, and returned to Australia on18th July, 1916. He was not sent back for misconduct - as letter 82036 of the Defence Department&#39;s correspondence will show - nor was he sent back at his own request. He was under medical treatment for about three months before he left Egypt, and was ill on. the voyage home, and for two years after he got back to Australia. He received a pension, which was stopped in May, 1918. He was in a military hospital in Melbourne for about five months after his return, and subsequently was treated by a specialist in Sydney. When he thought himself sufficiently strong he applied to be reinstated in his position in the Defence Department, but was refused.  His  first request on getting back to Australia was to be allowed to re-enlist, but that was refused point blank. He was told that the state of his health would not permit of his being re-enlisted, but he endeavoured to keep this information from the authorities until he had got redress for the reckless way - to put it mildly - in which he had been treated. He has never had an opportunity to remove the suspicion that has been cast upon him by the affair in Alexandria. During his civil and military life he has never been guilty of a crime, nor of any act unbecoming a soldier. He served two periods in. the South African war, and in his discharge his character was described as exemplary. He says that he was wrongfully treated as a member of the A.I.F., and that the manner of his discharge has done him grave injustice. He declares that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Cunningham&#39;s</inline> references to the case exonerate him. Last year I endeavoured to get the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> to give favorable consideration to the case, but after conferring with the departmental heads - who, I understand, have great influence with him, and at times too much - he announced that the case could not be afforded that inquiry desired by Little. Many other men have suffered injustice because of the autocratic methods of the heads of the Defence Department. If Ministers will not act, Parliament should take this matter into its hands, and order investigations, so that those aggrieved by ill-treatment may establish their innocence. If I thought that a motion having as its object the setting up of a tribunal for the purpose would be discussed, I would give, notice of it. But as I know that it would not, I intend to take every opportunity which may present itself for the voicing of grievances to solicit the sympathy of members and the public, until a feeling of indignation sweeps through the land, and a public inquiry is demanded. The request is not unreasonable. A man should be given an opportunity of vindicating his character before his fellow citizens, and obtaining his just dues in regard to the war gratuity and appointments in the Government Departments. A returned soldier should be treated on his merits like any other citizen, and if a charge has been made against him which is operating to his detriment, he should be afforded an opportunity of establishing his innocence. </para>

When he was given his discharge he pointed out to the Defence Department that it might work to his detriment in obtaining employment in future, but he was not given a reasonable opportunity to secure justice.  His  fears have been confirmed by the fact of his having been deprived of portion of his gratuity, and being under a disability in regard to appointment in the Government Service. I am pleased that there are in this House, and in another place, members who are prepared to support the claim for an inquiry into the treatment of soldiers who allege that they have been wrongfully accused. I am pleased that there is in Parliament such a person as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> who has already been very outspoken concerning the grievances amongst returned soldiers, and I hope that as a result of representations by him and other parliamentarians who are in sympathy with those who have been harshly treated by the Defence Department, we shall be able, ultimately, to secure justice for them. </para>

                            <para>.- I rise to support the remarks made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> regarding the amounts paid to old-age pensioners in institutions. I am fully aware of the facts of these cases, and I know that the officers administering the old-age and invalid pensions are not responsible for the present state of things. The policy they adopt is the outcome of the decision of the State Premiers in Conference. At the time a Liberal Government was in power in New South Wales, and the Liberals have not the same sympathy for the workers as has a Labour Government. They contended that the payment of old-age pensions was, a liability of the Commonwealth, and that if a State maintained a pensioner  the  pension should be paid to the institution instead of to the individual. It was arranged that out of the total pension 2s. per week only should be paid to the pensioner, and that the balance should go  to  the State institution. I, like many others, thought that a very mean action. But the Commonwealth Government acquiesced in the proposal of the State Premiers. Hardship is experienced also by unfortunate persons who are suffering  from  tuberculosis or miners&#39; diseases. I know of men of between fifty and sixty years of age who, because of having worked in sewerage tunnels, were so helpless that they were compelled to enter institutions. The disease which they contracted required a lot of attention,  and  it was not safe for them to live with their families in the small houses which they are compelled to occupy on account of the high rents. Once a person has entered an institution he is debarred from getting an old-age pension. Many of these inmates of the institutions have no homes, and I have advised them to leave the institution during the warm weather and sleep in  the  Domain. They could then go to the Pensions Office and fill in an application, stating their residence as &#34; The palace called the Domain.&#34; In this way they  may  qualify for their pension. When  cases  of this kind come under my notice, I go to the Pension Office, fill in the  forms,  and do not leave until the registrar has assured me that everything is in order. Unfortunately, when the pensioner returns to the institution, the State, in its avarice, takes all the pension except 2s. per week. That allowance of 2s. was fixed when the pension was 12s 6d., and it is still the same although the pension has been increased to 15s. The State Governments have not shown a liberal spirit. Many of the old pensioners have said to me, . &#34; They might have given us half-a-crown, Jack.&#34; I agree with them, and sometimes I give them a little help from my own pocket. However, I exonerate the officers in the Pensions Department from all responsibility for this parsimonious policy. I have given some attention to the case of a pensioner who Las now reached the age of seventy-six years. Being a Scotsman, he in his younger days saved sufficient money  to  buy for himself an annuity of &#163;30. When he applied for his old-age pension the Department deducted the amount of the annuity, leaving the old fellow a pension of only &#163;4 per annum. The wealthy people in our midst are for ever preaching thrift to the workers, and the reward of this old man for his foresight and thrift was a reduction of his pension to &#163;4. That was not the worst; the Department further capitalized the annuity and claimed the right to deduct a further &#163;9, so that he now does not receive a threepenny bit from the pension scheme. That instance ought to make Ministers think when they draw their own salaries. When I get my cheque at the end of each month, I wonder how the old fellows who get nothing are faring. I feel a good deal of sympathy for all these cases, because I have always made it a practice through life to imagine myself in the position of others less fortunate than I. I know of a German, eighty-five years of age, who until a few years ago worked honestly for his living. He was brought to Australia by the Queensland Government about fifty years ago as an instructor in the making of bread in the northern part of the State, where the heat has a detrimental effect upon the yeast. For many years he worked for the Government,but, unfortunately, he contracted rheumatism, and in ten years spent every penny he had put by for a rainy day in trying to relieve his pain and agony. The fine spirit of the man is shown by the fact that he was a trade unionist all his life; and if it were not for the brotherly love that exists between unionists he would not have been able to live when illness overtook him. </para>

                                <para>- That does not ease the situation of &#39;the unsatisfied pensioner. We have in the Victorian Government an individual - I refer to the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson</inline> - who has done, his best to wipe out the compassionate allowance. There are cases in my constituency wherein parents have had to practically order an invalid son from their home in order to put him in a position, to receive the invalid pension. I have specifically complained to the Department, and have been told that a calculation has been made that it costs only &#163;26 a year to maintain the father of a family. That is absurd. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> parent could hope to live nowadays upon such a sum. However, upon that basis the Department holds that a father, if he&#39; is earning a certain wage, is in a position to support his invalid child. I know of a man who is between thirty and forty years Old. and who, because his widowed mother has a small income, is not entitled to the invalid pension. As a consequence, he has had to go away from her home and live in a hut in a condition of semi-starvation. Only by such means has he been able to qualify to receive the invalid pension. With respect to inmates of benevolent institutions, if those who applied f <inline font-style="italic">09</inline> a pension prior to their admittance can receive 2s. a week from the Treasurer, the least we should do is to give 2s. also to those who made application after their admittance. </para>

                        <para>Much has been said in this Chamber in support of an increase in the general rate of pension. Honorable members on both sides have spoken strongly, and appeals have been made for an addition of at least 5s. per week; so far, however, their .pleadings have been in vain. It is almost impossible for old folk to maintain themselves nowadays on 15s. a week. -I know of hundreds of cases in the city of Melbourne where old-age pensioners are required to pay as much as 8s. weekly out of their pension for their rooms. With the balance they cannot hope to purchase even one square, meal a day. We owe so much to our pioneers, and we are always talking about our debt to them; yet we continue to allow; them to go on to the end of their days in what is not less than abject misery. If honorable members cannot appeal successfully to the Treasurer for an increase of the pension rates by 5s. all round, I ask that he will grant a bonus of 5s. weekly to those pensioners who have no homes of their own and have to pay rent, and whose  circumstances  are absolutely necessitous. These people would represent, I estimate from careful inquiry, about 20 per cent, of the total number of recipients of the pension. Upon that basis the payment of a bonus of 5s., as I have just indicated, would involve about &#163;180,000 a year. If the Treasurer would only grant that increase for the coming winter months it would mean the difference between poverty and comparative comfort to very many old people. </para>
                        <para>I jim sorry that neither the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> nor the Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> is present. Had the former been in the chamber I would have supported the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> even more strongly than I intend to do in his demand for the holding of an inquiry into the circumstances of those returned soldiers and officers who consider that they have just grievances, and who desire a reconsideration of the sentences imposed on them while on active service. I am aware that a gentleman in another place - a gallant brigadier-general - has been making a similar appeal. However, I do not attach much importance to any appeal that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> may make. I remember how utterly inconsistent br* has been during the past twelve, mon tha. </para>
                        <para class="block">I recall that when a certain reverend gentleman wrote a play, which was presented in Bendigo, in which he referred to British troops having run away at Amiens, the loyal people of that city convened a public meeting of protest. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> was invited to speak in support of the fact that the British soldiers did not run away. The honorable senator made a very strong speech and bitterly denounced the reverend gentleman for daring to suggest that British troops had run away at Amiens. If honorable members care to examine the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> reports of about two weeks ago they will find that in another place <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> quoted from a report which he had submitted to his commanding officer, in which he bitterly complained of the conduct of British soldiers who had run away from the enemy. In the circumstances I do not put too much faith in anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> may say in support of the grievances of returned men. But there are many grievances, and none has a stronger case than the individual referred to by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. Here was a warrant officer who refused to take bribes from native contractors in Egypt.&#39; For so refusing he was tried, but he was found not guilty, and was ordered back to his unit, without any prejudice attaching to him. Immediately thereafter, however, he was ordered back to Australia, and his papers were marked, &#34; Services no longer required.&#34; Do they want only thieves in the Army? This warrant officer was honestly performing his duty; but for doing so he was stigmatized as unworthy to continue to be -a non-commissioned officer in the Australian Imperial Force. He was sent home in disgrace, and was not permitted even to re-enlist. Every citizen, moreover, looked upon him with suspicion; and, undoubtedly, he felt his position keenly. </para>

But nobody knows better than does the honorable member that every officer who returned - on my transport or on any other - and whose papers were marked, &#34;Services no longer required,&#34; was in the unenviable position of being only too well aware that everybody on the ship was cognisant of the fact. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foley.</inline> - It was not right that any one should have known. </para>

                                <para>- I say that it was only right. One of the matters I have complained about is that if a private did anything wrong he was thrown into the &#34; clink &#34;; he was severely punished. But no officer was thrown into the &#34;clink,&#34; no matter what might have been the nature of his crime. All that happened in his case  was  that his papers were marked, &#34; Services no longer required.&#34; He was permitted to come back home, in full uniform, and to participate in all the privileges available to an officer on board ship. Nevertheless, all on the transport knew that he had been sent back either because he was guilty of some wrong-doing or because he was incompetent. And I repeat that it was only right that that should be known. In connexion with the case of ex- Warrant-Officer Little, the honorable member for Hindmarsh has clearly explained that at his trial he was acquitted. No evidence was adduced to show that he had done any wrong, and he was returned without prejudice to his unit. Yet he was .sent back home under a stigma, and was not permitted to reenlist,* at a time when the cry was going up all over the land that men could not be obtained to go to the Front, and when we . were asked to confiscate by conscription the lives of our remaining young manhood. I do not hesitate to say, referring to the case of Little, that some of the native contractors in Egypt were in league with certain officers in the Australian Imperial Force. It was because Little offended these people that he was sent back in disgrace, ruined  in  the eyes of his fellow-Australians. After his return he demanded an inquiry, but all the satisfaction that could be secured from the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was that no such inquiry could be granted because similar requests for investigations would be altogether  too numerous. Were there, then, so many of our officers sent back with their papers marked, &#34; Services no longer required &#34; ? Were these not among the men, and the type of men, who were praised as the bravest in the world? </para>

                                <para>- The fact remains that not an individual in the Australian Imperial Force was sent home with the stigma, &#34; Services no longer required,&#34; but that his follow-citizens, and, at any rate, his intimate friends, knew of it. And, even if no one knew of the circumstances, the man himself would be all too unhappily aware of his disgrace. If he had been unfairly treated, surely he should have the right to secure vindication, if only in his own conscience, and in respect solely to his own good opinion of himself. I strongly join with other honorable members in demanding full inquiry into all these cases. I could fill a sack with cases of favoritism, due not to political influence, but to social influence. On one occasion a general came to a battalion and found a private there who was looked upon as fit only to take care of the sanitary depot. Within four days that private was made a lieutenant. Another man who was in the &#34; clink &#34; as a private was immediately released, and within a few days made a lieutenant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has talked about General White. It is well known that when General White commanded the 1st Division he would not give a commission to a private unless he could prove that he had attended one of the public schools of Australia. It is also well known that all that those who attended the officers&#39; training school had to do was to learn how to manicure their nails or clean their teeth. We do not want a repetition of that kind of thing in another war. We must be free from the Imperial crowd who were running the last war. I hope that if ever Australian troops engage in another conflict they will be commanded by Australian officers, and will be absolutely free of the British Army Act. </para>

                        <para>When the Government were anxious to have conscription adopted, they spread broadcast among the soldiers in France and England pamphlets in which they stated their intention to spend from &#163;50,000,000 to &#163;80,000,000 on them upon their return to Australia. Yet to-day they have practically ceased to build homes for these men. Land has been acquired in Ballarat for months past, and every week inspired paragraphs appear in the press to the effect that it is the intention of the War Service Homes Department to call for tenders for the building of homes there, to let contracts, and to commence building operations, but so far not one home has been built in Ballarat. The same remarks apply to every inland city in Victoria. I have not heard of one soldier&#39;s home being built at Geelong or Bendigo; I know that not one has been built in Ballarat, and I want to know if the Government have come to the determination to build no further homes. There are soldiers in Ballarat who relied on the promises of the Ministry, and believed that they would carry them out. They thought that they would be able to acquire homes on cheap terms, but although month after month these paragraphs appear in the press announcing that it is the intention of the Department to build homes for them, so far nothing has been done. I hope that the Honorary Minister will be able to explain why soldiers&#39; homes are not being built in the inland cities of Victoria. </para>
                        <para>The Government have apparently cut off the living allowance paid to widows who have lost their sons at the war. A month or two ago I sent a letter to the Repatriation Department in reference to the case of a widow who had lost her son. at the war and who was getting a pension of &#163;1 a week plus a living allowance of 30s. a week, but was informed by the Department that her living allowance would no longer be paid. In the letter  making this announcement the Commissioner, who is paid &#163;1,500 a year, pointed out to the widow that her daughter, who was earning 30s. a week, ought to contribute towards the support of the family. Had the boy lived, or had he not gone to the war, the mother would not have had to apply to any one for assistance. What was the promise made before these boys enlisted ? They were told that their dependants would never want, yet this mother is told by the Repatriation Department that a sickly daughter, who has intermittent work, should pay out of an occasional 30s. a week, which is hardly sufficient to keep herself, portion of the cost of maintaining her mother and a younger sister. And when one writes to the Minister to complain, he does not even get a civil answer. I am sick and tired of writing letters to the Repatriation Department complaining about the treatment of many of those unfortunates who gave their all in what they believed was the best interests of their country. I hope that the Government will take action to see that insolent letters are not sent to widowed mothers of our deceased soldiers in the terms of the communication to which I have just drawn attention. </para>

                        <para>Another matter for complaint is the employment of lady doctors to examine returned soldiers. One lady doctor, who recently examined a returned soldier in the Ballarat district, told him that he either ought not to have a pension, or that it ought to be reduced. In any case, she informed him that the Government had determined not to continue for very long the payment of pensions such as that which he was drawing. I want to know if the Government have issued instructions to these people that pensions are to be reduced all round. It looks very much as if this has been done when we find pensions being reduced and allowances cut off, promises broken, and doctors telling returned soldiers that the Government do not intend to pay pensions for ever. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. In the Ballarat constituency there were two or three medical men who had been to the war and knew what the soldiers had suffered, but evidently they were too sympathetic for this Government, because they were ignominiously dismissed, and other doctors were chosen for the purpose of examining returned soldiers every six or twelve months. I protest strongly against this, and I hope that upon the Estimates, or upon the consideration of the Defence Bill, or perhaps upon some Ministerial statement, I will have the opportunity of submitting a concrete motion dealing with the matters to which I have now drawn attention. </para>

                                <para>- That is so.I know an invalid who is living at a farmhouse practically as company for the people there. He does a little work, but next to nothing, and for this he receives a few shillings a week and his food. He made an application for an invalid pension, but owing to the fact that he was receiving these few shillings a week and his food the Department estimated that he was in receipt of a contribution of something like &#163;1 a week, which under the regulations would prevent him from drawing a pension. If the Act, or the regulations, prevent the payment of a pension in a case like this, I think the Act should be amended or the regulations altered. A pension would be a god -send to some invalids who receive a few shillings a week for the services they can render. Under the Act, or the regulations, as at present drawn up, they are debarred from participating in a benevolence which they are perfectly justified in receiving if they wish to draw the invalid pension. </para>

                        <para>I think that, on the whole, the returned soldiers in my constituency have been fairly treated. Of course, there are odd cases to the contrary, in which the  fault can be attributed to the Local Repatriation Committee; but in many instances the trouble can be traced to some other cause apart from the Local Committees or the Minister for Repatriation. However, I have a complaint to lodge in regard to the Post Office, which should receive the support of honorable members. Quite a number of returned, soldiers are temporarily engaged in various post-offices,, but it, is only a matter of time when their services will be dispensed with to make room for permanent officers. In one town in my electorate, a young man who gave his best during the war, in which his only brother was killed, has been employed in the local post-office. He has married in the town and he has no desire to leave it. He has recommendations, so far as qualifications and character are concerned, second to none, and the residents of the town have petitioned the Postmaster-General not to remove him from the district. Yet, although he has given the very best of satisfaction in the work upon which he has been engaged, he has received notice that his employment must terminate. At least, he has been offered a temporary appointment in Melbourne for a few months, but at the end of that period he will have to go. In cases where a soldier has given good service to his country, and entire satisfaction to the postal authorities, employment should be found for him in some other Department if it cannot be provided in the Post Office. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. Probably the whole scheme . of pensions should be revised. Possibly some men are receiving pensions who are not entitled to them, and where if that is clearly shown to be the case they should be discontinued. I have just been interviewed by a young friend, whose paltry pension was cut off a little time ago. With the object of having the departmental decision reviewed I used what little influence I possessed with the Minister, knowing that the young man was thoroughly honorable, trustworthy, and deserving of a pension, and after a lapse -of two or three months the Department has just announced that it has decided to review his case. No pension should be discontinued until the fullest inquiry has shown the wisdom of such a course. The administration is only exposed to criticism and suspicion when pensions are cut off and later on renewed. &#34;With regard to the question of War Service Homes, I have heard complaint made by some honorable members that no soldiers&#39; homes have been erected in their constituency. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline> for instance, has said that no War Service Homes have been built in his electorate. There may be a good reason for that. The honorable member&#39;s electorate is somewhat congested, and I do not think it would be wise to build soldiers&#39; homes there. There are many rural- . towns, however, in which they might well be built. The valuations made on behalf of the Department in many country towns are of an imperfect character. I claim to know as well as any man the value of land and town buildings in the north-east of this State, and I know of a house in my electorate which was offered to the Department as a home for a soldier at a very reasonable rate,  but the application in respect of it was turned down.&#34; The officer who was sent up to make the valuation did not even look over the building. There was no one at home when he called, and without making any inspection of the interior he left and turned down the application. Reliable and trustworthy men in the town support my view that the price at which the building was offered was very reasonable. I endeavoured to have the matter reopened, but after a lapse of two months the applicant was informed that the original decision of the Department would be adhered to. While there are occasionally cases of this kind, I do not wish it to be understood that I am condemning the work of the Repatriation Commission as a whole. I should be sorry to do anything of the kind, because I believe that the Department has done wonderful work. There are, however, a few matters which need to be &#34; screwed up.&#34; As the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> has said, there may be in the Department some official who slightly oversteps the mark. If such an official were dismissed and a capable returned soldier employed in his stead, as might appropriately be done, many causes of complaint would be removed and much greater satisfaction obtained. These are matters to which the Minister should attend since he is too often, blamed for the mistakes of officials. </para>

                            <para>.- I wish to offer a few observations in regard to the position of the great army of defenceless men and women usually referred to as invalid and old-age pensioners. Some considerable time ago the pension rate was increased to 15s. per week in the belief that that would be sufficient to supply pensioners- with the ordinary comforts of life. Since then, however, conditions have so materially changed and the .cost of living has so increased that much hardship is suffered by this deserving section of the community. I asked the. Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> some time ago whether he would consider the desirableness of increasing the invalid and old-age pensions to &#163;1 per week.  His  reply was that it was impossible to grant an increase, inasmuch as the Government were face to , face with grave financial difficulties. Every one recognises that the Government are confronted with&#34; huge financial obligations, but it is not justified for that reason in shirking its responsibilities so far as invalid and old-age pensions are concerned. One of its first duties is to see that the old men and women who practically pioneered our country are cared for in their days of adversity. I have repeatedly come into contact with quite a number of old-age pensioners, and recently ascertained from two or three of them what they were able to purchase with their pension of 15s. per week. One old man gave me a statement showing that for rent he pays 5s. per week, and that his other items of weekly expenditure are - as follows : - Four loaves of bread, 2s. ; 3 lbs of meat 2s. ; 2 lbs. of sugar, at 6d. per lb., and a quarter lb. of tea at 2s., ls. (3d. ; vegetables, ls.; clothing, 2s.; and tobacco, ls. 6d. In that way he spends his weekly pension of 15s. No one will say that in respect of any one of these items he is guilty of extravagance. If an honorable member were asked to live on such rations he would strongly object. Those who know the prices ruling for vegetables will not say that ls. per week is too much for an old man or an old woman to spend on such . a necessary article of diet. Then, again, 2s. per week is a very scanty allowance for clothing, and 2s. a week for meat is still scantier. These people, however, have to exist on such rations, while the Government express the view that the pension is ample to enable them to secure ordinary conditions of comfort. Much has been said of what is likely to be done for our invalid and old-age pensioners, and during the last twelve months their claims have, been strongly agitated. The Government should at once consider the advisability of freeing our old-age pensioners from rent payments. If they can build homes for soldiers - and I am very pleased that the Government have entered upon a gigantic scheme for housing our returned men - they should be able to concentrate a little attention on the welfare of these old people who have blazed the track for us, and provide them with free homes. They should also enable them to secure a greater degree of comfort. A pensioner is allowed nothing for medicine or medical attendance. In the event of illness he has to depend for relief upon the charity of others. </para>

                        <para>During the last two or three years large sums of money have been spent, and recklessly&#39; spent, I venture to say, by the Government, but no consideration has been given these old people. Military officials have been granted increases,, and quite recently we ourselves accepted a very fair increase in our allowance, although.&#39; we knew at the time that there were tens of thousands of old men and women in this country badly in need of an increase in their pensions. A fair amount of money has also been spent in sending abroad parliamentary representatives attended by quite an army of officials. Millions of pounds have likewise been spent on naval and military defence; but no further consideration has been given to these old people, who so richly deserve better treatment. The time is not far distant when we shall have a vote on this question, and the Government may rest assured that the old men and women of Australia will then, for once in their lives, score a victory. If we are permitted to take a vote, then, however much opposed the  Ministry may  be to an increase in the invalid and old-age pension rates, a majority of honorable members will be found voting for an increase. </para>

                                <para>- T lie Treasurer informed me quite recently that the Government could not increase invalid and old-age pension rates, because they were face to face with financial difficulties. The suggested increase, it was said, would involve an additional expenditure of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. Consideration of cost did not influence the Government when they were improving our military and naval conditions, and appointing military officials to high positions, nor were they prevented by such a consideration from sending round the country an army of officials, and particularly of military officers. Such a consideration has weighed with them only when the claims of invalid and old-age pensioners have been brought forward. War pensions have been increased during the last year or two, and the people to whom I refer are equally entitled to an increase. I do not object to the increase in soldiers&#39; pensions. I have, indeed, repeatedly voted for such an increase, knowing the work that our soldiers did for us. But we must not lose sight of the fact that thousands of old men now drawing the old-age pension were just as anxious as any young man to enlist, and would willingly have gone to the Front had their age permitted them to do so. Merely because they were unable to go they were not placed on the same footing as are soldiers in the matter of pensions. There is really no difference between the old-&#39; age pensioner and the soldier, so far as this matter is concerned, and there should be no difference in the pensions paid to them. Then, again, where a man who  applies for a pension is living apart from his wife, or where a woman is living apart from her husband because, for some reason or another, they are unable to agree, the application is refused. An old man is told that because he is living apart from his wife he is not entitled to a pension. The Treasurer said, to-day that the Commissioner was allowed to use his own discretion, but I have ample proof of what I say. I may mention a case in which a man, because his wife left him,. was denied a pension. </para>

                        <para>I have repeatedly asked the Treasurer to favorably consider the granting of temporary pensions to partially incapacitated men and women, but the idea has been rejected. I know scores of cases in which  people have been temporarily incapacitated for, perhaps, three years, and yet they are entitled to no relief under the Act. If the Medical Referee agreed to give a certificate of total incapacity, a pension could be granted, but not otherwise. My suggestion is that in such cases a temporary pension should be granted for the currency of the incapacity, the pension to cease on the person&#39;s recovery. If such a person should be unfortunate enough to become again incapacitated temporarily, the pension, I submit, should be renewed until he recovers. At present a person may be quite incapacitated for years, and yet be quite shut cut from the benefits of the Act. Such cases are not isolated, for they come under my notice practically every day. Another case I have in my mind is one in which a man applied for an invalid pension for his daughter. In a communication he says - </para>

                            <para>I am writing you to see if you can help me in regard to an application made by my daughter, -- for an invalid pension, which has been rejected by the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions, Sydney (date of rejection of claim, 27th April, 1921). The reason given for said rejection is on the ground that she is not permanently incapacitated for work. My daughter is suffering from dislocated hip and also curvature of the spine, for which she has to wear body supports.  Her  right leg is 3 inches shorter than her left. Further, she was an inmate of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney, for two years, and for many months of that time was placed in plaster casts, and was finally discharged as incurable by doctors such as the following: - <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Clubbe, Dr. Wade,</inline> and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Kelty.</inline> Since that time (1911) she has been under many other doctors, the latest who saw her being <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. P.</inline> L. O&#39;Halloran, during this year, who says she cannot work while wearing the supports for curvature of spine without great discomfort to her and also danger to her health. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">The  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions holds that this girl is not totally incapacitated, in spite of the fact that, after two years in the Sydney Hospital, she was discharged as incurable, and that three eminent doctors have indorsed that view. I have known several cases in which a number of doctors have issued certificates of total incapacity, but the Government Medical Referee has point-blank refused to give a certificate to that effect. He holds that the patients may be cured in any period up to ten or fifteen years, and his conscience would not allow him to declare them totally incapacitated. I make my suggestion, so that people who become ill and unable to work for any period, it may be up to fifteen years, may be able to live. Ever since I entered this Chamber I have fought consistently for the claims of invalid and old-age pensioners; and I hope, in the near future, that instead of 15s. a week, they will receive at least &#163;1 per week. All other sections of the community, from the lowest to the highest paid, have had their incomes increased; and there seems no valid reason why these poor people should not also have their position improved. Their living conditions are practically intolerable. The landlord has no more consideration for an old-age or invalid pensioner than he has for anybody else, nor has the grocer, the butcher, or the baker; and if a pensioner cannot pay he must go out in the cold, and do without food. We all know that no man or woman can have reasonable comfort on 15s. per week, and I trust that the Treasurer will reconsider his attitude, and grant a pension sufficient to meet the circumstances of the times. </para>

Honorable members who have been here for a number of years know how this question has been ventilated from time to time, and how, when amending Bills have been before us, attempts have been made to give these pensioners the full benefit of the Act. There are in my electorate a number of old men and women who are living in State institutions, and who draw only a portion of the pension. </para>

I remind honorable members and the Government that the proposed increased payment to old-age pensioners in State institutions does not involve a very heavy expenditure. I suppose that throughout the whole of Australia there are not more than 4,000 or 5,000 who would come within the scope of the reform, and, at most, the liability would pot be more than1s. or 2s. per head. </para>

                                <para>- That is so, and I think that the request now made is reasonable. It may not be possible during this session to pass an amending Bill, but I suggest that, in the meantime, the Government raise the issue with the StateGovernments in order that we may be in a position to definitely deal with the matter later on. We cannot do anything without the co-operation of the States, and I, therefore, suggest that preliminary arrangements be made with a view to finalizing at the earliest possible moment what is, after all, only a small matter. </para>

                        <para>There is one point I have not heard referred to this afternoon. Under the War Gratuity Act, as administered by the Central Gratuity Board and the various State Boards, it is becoming extremely difficult to prove dependency. , Numerous cases have been brought under my notice where persons who are recognised as dependants by the Repatriation Department and by the Defence Department, are not so recognised by the Gratuity Boards which operate under the Treasurer. There is room for improvement in the administration of the War Gratuities Act in this respect. I have had much to do with the Central Board, and its officers have always given fair consideration to my recommendations ; but in innumerable cases of this kind I have been unable to secure finality. A case that comes to my mind now was brought under my notice by a man whom I knew well in France, and before the war, who lives just outside my electorate. He wrote to me from Wokalup about a gratuity application on behalf of his sister. It appears that he and his brother went to the war and the brother was killed. They had been maintaining an orphan sister, a girl who is now sixteen or seventeen years of age. Neither could declare her to be wholly and solely dependent on him, yet she was dependent on both. No gratuity has been issued in respect of the brother who lost his life, and nothing has been done for the sister. </para>

                        <para>I wish now to say a word or two about the munition workers. Quite a number of us who know the work done by the munition workers have spoken strongly here on their behalf ; and about twelve months ago it was promised that a Conference should be called which would represent all the political sections here, and that by it a tribunal would be created before which the munition workers could place their grievances. Because of sickness, the absence of Ministers, and other reasons, there has been unavoidable delay in assembling the Conference, but the munition workers have been more than patient, and should receive a definite and tangible reward. I ask only for an impartial tribunal to settle their grievances, and their associations have agreed to this. They have declared that they will accept the verdict of an independent tribunal, whether in their favour or against them. In fairness to them, we should take immediate action to have the primary Conference called in order that such a tribunal may bo established. There is no statutory authority for the payment of pensions to munition workers, and it is to the credit of the Government that they have granted to thorn compassionate allowances. Many munition workers, however, are unaware of what is being done, and if the tribunal to which I refer were set up, they would have an opportunity of stating and getting a settlement of their claims for consideration. I urge the Government to deal with this matter as soon as possible. </para>

                            <para>. - It seems to me that every member of the House is in favour&#39; of increasing the old-age and invalid pensions; and I believe that if there were an informal meeting of members of all parties, we could decide on a plan of action here which would quickly improve the position of our pensioners. I do not know if what I suggest would be contrary to the Standing Orders. Surely when members are all of one mind effect should be given to their wishes. I suggest that something should be done to meet the rightful claims of some of the finest men and women in Australia, who laid the foundation of this country&#39;s success. Other members of the community are receiving increases to make up for the high cost of living, yet these most deserving persona are being neglected by us. The time for talk has passed, and action is long overdue. Speaking for myself - and I am sure that in this matter I could speak for my party too - I am willing to co-operate heartily in any endeavour to increase the pensions of the aged and infirm. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>There are some very hard cases - mention has been made of several this afternoon -in which persons who should be helped cannot obtain invalid pensions. That prevention is better than cure is an old and true saying, and I am glad that the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls)</inline> and the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell)</inline> have said that something should be done for invalids who. are only temporarily incapacitated and whom proper treatment and rest would wholly or partly restore to health. Some pitiable cases have come before me recently in which, the bread-winners having been taken away, their widows have had to struggle to earn a pittance for their families. In a typical case which I put before the authorities as strongly as I could, a lady is steadily declining in health, but cannot get help from the Government which would allow her to take the necessary rest. Unfortunately, the medical man certifies that she is not permanently incapacitated. Persons such as she, who with timely assistance might be restored to their normal health, will  eventually, if not helped-, become a permanent burden upon us, and whatever the state of the finances, it is poor economy to deprive them of assistance. As for the aged, and infirm, is this National Parliament going to be so contemptibly mean as to refuse the needed help ? </para>
                        <para>I have on previous occasions spoken of the way in which medical men are, by their reports, helping to cut down war pensions.  I quote the case of a man in my constituency with a wife and six  chilrren.  He was medically examined upon his return from the war, and for a consider- . able time received a pension. From time to time he has been in the military hospital, and attended to by the doctors. Some time ago the military doctor declared that this man was not permanently incapacitated, and his pension ceased. Although he is weak in body the man has tried to earn his living, and has fallen down at his work through weakness. In some occupations he has been a danger to his fellow employees on that account. After such a collapse he returns homo, and has a consultation with his wife. They have the six bairns to support, and because they require attention the wife cannot go to work, whilst the -man is unable to continue at his employment. Yet the Defence authorities say that that man is not permanently incapacitated. If the Government run away in that fashion from their responsibilities they are quickly forgetting their promises to the men who fought at the Front. I am sure that every honorable member could quote instances of dire distress in the community because of re: turned &#39;soldiers, who are physically incapable of carrying on their ordinary avocations, and have families dependent upon them, being unable to receive any assistance from the Government. Even although the medical testimony be that a man is not permanently incapacitated, surely if he is unable to work at his usual calling he should be helped, having regard to the assistance he rendered to the country in its time  of storm  and stress. </para>
                        <para>I desire to call, attention to the improper discrimination amongst Government servants in the administration of the basic wage. I have been requested to &#39; question the Leader of - the Government as to why the child endowment is given to certain Commonwealth employees and denied to others. The reply I have received is that permanent employees who have children under a certain age dependent upon them receive an extra 5s. per week for each child, but a workman employed in the Cordite Factory, the &#34;Woollen Mills, the Clothing Factory, or the Saddlery Factory- all Commonwealth industrial undertakings - is not entitled to receive the endowment. That policy of discrimination is distinctly unfair. The mere fact that a man -is a temporary employee is not sufficient reason for .denying him the endowment part of the basic wage. On the contrary it is all the more reason why he should receive, that consideration. The discrimination is not  relished  by those who suffer by it, or even by those in the same establishments who are receiving endowments. Some of the clerks in these factories, because they belong to the permanent section of the Service, are entitled to the child endowment, but other men working in the&#39; same .building are denied it. .That is unjust. No doubt it is a money saving&#39; device, hut it is so mean that the Government might well be charged with trying to dodge their responsibilities. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> when announcing to the House_the intentions  of the Government in &#34;regard to the basic wage, said that whilst they were not prepared to grant the wage of &#163;5 16s. per week recommended by the Commission, they intended, to fix a basic wage, for Commonwealth employees, and so set an example for private employers. Yet many thousands of Commonwealth Government employees are not enjoying the endowment. What has become of the Government boast that they would set an example to private employers.? Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> although he stated in a supplementary report that the Commonwealth could not afford to pay a basic wage of &#163;5 16s. per week all. round, was a_ party to the unanimous recommendation of the Commission, after taking exhaustive evidence, that on account of the high cost of rent., clothing, groceries, and other necessaries &#163;5 16s. per week was the minimum wage upon which a man with a wife and three children could eke out an ordinary .existence.  I do  not suppose there -was ever a Commission that -was so unanimous on any point, or that ever made such an exhaustive inquiry into the general conditions of the working classes of Australia.&#39; The Government decided not to abide by the decision pf the Commission, but .to run away from their pre-election promise by creating a lower basic &#39; wage for Com,- . monwealth &#39; employees, namely, .&#163;4 per week, and 5s. per week for each dependant child. Even that promise has not been honoured, for thousands of employees in the Commonwealth Service are. denied the endowment. This is just one more instance of promises made by the Government before an election, and adroitly evaded afterwards. </para>
                        <para>The honorable .member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> called attention to the mean way in which some employers treated their employees in connexion with Anzac holiday. I know that when a holiday -has&#39; been declared and the doors of an establishment are closed for the day, many employees, if they are not paid for the compulsory holiday, are unable to meet their weekly obligations. , Yet that lias occurred in the Government Printing Office, where a large number of men are employed in the printing of the documents and reports of this Parliament. The Commonwealth cannot evade its responsibility to those men, because, although the establishment is controlled by the Victorian Government, the men are to. a large extent . employees of the Commonwealth. The permanent employees received full .pay . for Anzac holiday, men who served in the war. and were&#39; employed as temporary hands also received the holiday and . full pay, and, after agitation, the&#39; same concession was extended to the men who had fought in the South African war. But the fathers of some of the lads who fell at the Front did not receive payment for the holiday. These nasty distinctions are creating bad feelings in the hearts of many people. My idea of the Australian workman is that he will respond to fair treatment. I worked in the Government Printing Office for seven years, and I know many of the employees and the work they do. It is not unusual for a man who has worked .all day to be required to continue through the night in supplying the requirements of this Parliament. When a holiday is declared, especially on Anzac Day, the Commonwealth Government should advise the State Government that they are prepared to take their share of the cost of giving the employees a holiday on full pay. If the Government give fair treatment to those men it will be reciprocated, but treat them in a niggardly way and they will not give the same service as they otherwise would. </para>
                        <para>Reverting to the basic wage, I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> in his pamphlet, <inline font-style="italic">The Next Step,</inline> lays down certain principles which, if acted upon, would allow of &#171; the basic wage being paid. I admit that he points out the difficulties, but he has based his argument on figures compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> which I make bold to say are not reliable in this application. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> has founded his statistics of the income of the Commonwealth upon the value of goods as produced at the factory. &#39; The value of goods as they leave the factory, or primary products as they leave the soil, is, at the most, the wholesale value. How many people purchase their goods at manufacturers&#39; or wholesale prices? The bulk of the people have to pay profit, not only to. the manufacturer and wholesaler, but also to the retailer, and they have to pay the cost of distribution also. When all these additional costs are added there is involved an increase of at least 60 per cent. That is why I maintain that the figures employed as a basis by Messrs. Knibbs and Piddington are altogether misleading. While the Prime Minister was&#39; conducting his election campaign he intimated that if the basic wage was to be conferred on the community by .the Federal Parliament it would be essential for the people to agree to the proposed amendments of the Constitution which were being submitted by way of referendum. I am given to understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> when ho learned of. that statement, wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and wanted to know if it was correct. He took the stand that unless he and his fellow-members of the Commission were to have the power to recommend a basic wage, and that such recommendation&#39; would be put into effect, he would not undertake to carry on. Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> received some sort of &#39; assurance from the &#39;Prime Minister whereupon he entered upon his investigations. In his  pamphlet, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> states that since the Arbitration Court has the constitutional right to fix what is known as a living wage there can be no constitutional authority to prevent the fixing of a basic wage, and that it can, therefore, be fixed by the Arbitration Court. The Prime Minister stated that the Government could not go outside and say to every private employer, &#34; This is to be the legal basic wage to be paid throughout the Commonwealth,&#34; but that the Government could give a lead in that direction in respect of their own employees. I complain, however, that in the payment of the basic wage to public servants there has been a discrimination which is not only unfair but iniquitous. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> says - </para>

                                <para>- We can never legislate for the individual, nor for individual industries. We should take industry as a whole. I believe that industry cannot pay quite the full amount of &#163;5 16s. per week, but I am pretty certain that, generally speaking, it can come very near to doing so. The public at large have to pay all the profits of every party. Some favoured folk are able to go to a wholesale house and secure the benefit of wholesale prices. Some wealthy families are able to buy at wholesale rates by purchasing in large quantities. The ordinary wage-earner, however, has to pay the full profits of the manufacturer, the wholesaler, the agent, the distributor, and the retailer. And it is upon the total sum of those profits that the decision should be made whether industry generally can pay the basic wage. If Messrs. Knibbs and Piddington were to have regard for all those costs, I guarantee that the industries of this country would be found to be able to pay the basic wage of &#163;5 16s. </para>

Wages costs in relation to an industry are but a small part of the general cost. Some years ago the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald-</inline> an organ of conservative folk - stated that when a manufacturer is compelled under a wage award to pay so much to his employees, involving, perhaps, an increase of 5 per cent., the added price which he puts upon his goods to the public is generally between 10 and 20 per cent. </para>

                            <para>Now, once it is admitted that it is in the interests of the community that such a wage should be paid as will enable a man to marry and bring up children in decent, wholesome conditions - and that point has been settled long ago - it seems obvious that we must devise better machinery for insuring the payment of such a wage than at present exists. Means must be found which will insure that the minimum wage shall be adjusted automatically, or almost automatically, with the cost of living, so that within the limits of the minimum wage at least the sovereign shall always purchase the same amount of the necessaries of life. The Government is, therefore, appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated during the war; also how the basic wage may be adjusted to the present purchasing power of the sovereign, and the best means, when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and fall of the sovereign. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>The Commission was appointed, and eventually it furnished a report. Even before that document was laid on the table of the House, the Government began to run away from it, and their followers, of course, did the same. That was due entirely to a startling statement which was- based upon altogether wrong premises. If the Government intend to do as they said they would, namely, to set an example to private employers, why do they not confer the basic wage on all their employees - permanent and temporary? </para>
                        <para class="block">I desire to refer briefly now to the Australian coat-of-arms. I have in my hand a publication of the Bank of New South Wales, which bears what is, I presume, its coat-of-arms. This is supposed to represent an emu and a kangaroo. The kangaroo has its tail away up in the vicinity of its ears, at ail angle even more peculiar than the tail of a tom cat on a roof-top on a wintry night, while the ears themselves are long enough to be those of a donkey. I believe in the Australian coat-of-arms, and I believe that the depiction of the emu and kangaroo, together with a spray of wattle, forms an entirely suitable crest for our country. About the year 1912, when the Commonwealth coat-of-arms was introduced, its first presentation to the public was made by way of a sketch published in the daily press. I asked the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Andrew Fisher)</inline> whether this picture was a true representation of the coat-of-arms the Commonwealth had adopted, and he said it was. Then I told him, as I said the other day, that it appeared to me as if the kangaroo and emu were up a wattle tree. I am told that if we in Australia require a coat-of-arms we must apply to a College of Heralds on the other side of the world, and they will prepare one for us. </para>

The Commonwealth Bank has been very successful in depicting its kangaroo and emu in natural positions. The kangaroo, the emu, and the wattle tree are certainly emblematic of Australia, but in our coat-of-arms the wattle tree is only a branch; and, as a matter of fact, we all know that kangaroos and emus keep on the ground and are not likely to be discovered up a tree. </para>

Rees, a returned soldier of Mudgee, a man with very unusual qualifications, forwarded to me an application for a position in connexion with the immigration policy of the Commonwealth. On the 9th July, 1920, I wrote informing him that I had brought his case before the right authorities. On the 12th October, 1920, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> J.

                            <para>Some time ago Captain T. Rees, of Mudgee, wrote to you offering his services as an immigration officer, but he has not beard anything from you since you wrote - him on the 9th July. Captain Rees, who has been residing in this district for three or four years, is a gentleman well fitted to act as an immigration agent in England. He is a member of one of the  best-known  Welsh families, his family being well known right throughout South Wales. He has been a military man, and has a great reputation as an organizer. He has been successfully conducting a farm in this district, and he knows the conditions of Australia thoroughly. He recognises that the people that we want here are men of the farming class, and he is confident that if he is appointed agent it will be the means of persuading a large number of good immigrants to come to Australia. He is a very able and intelligent man, of good appearance and personality, and if the Federal Immigration Department want a man in every way suitable as an agent, they should not hesitate to secure his services. </para>

                            <para>I have written you previously with regard to CaptainRees, pointing out to you his great qualifications as an immigration officer in England. Just now, when immigration is a burning question, of course, there is no need for me to point out to you the great advantage of obtaining the services of men holding the high qualifications of CaptainRees. To show you his ability, I will just let you know some of the positions he has held. Probably through reading the list of positions which he has held, you may arrive at the conclusion that he is purely a military man; but such is not the case. He is a born organizer. He has been farming very successfully, on a small scale, in Mudgee, and he feels that he could do great work as an immigration officer, as he knows Wales so well, and knows the stamp of immigrant that we want here; so I trust that the Department that deals with immigration will be sure to secure his services. </para>

CaptainRees will be very pleased to submit a scheme in connexion with immigration.

                        <para class="block">Minister, and gave the right honorable gentleman, while he was in the House, a letter relating to it. The application was sent in the ordinary way to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. &#39; I read most of -the correspondence relating to this matter before the right honorable gentleman entered the Chamber, and it shows that from May of last year to the present time there has been a consecutive effort to secure recognition for this man. He deserves recognition at the hands of the State. He is a man of proved capacity in dealing with a subject of vast importance to Australia, and yet, after all this effort on his behalf, the Department states no record of an application from him can be found. I ask the Minister to take special notice of this case, and to endeavour to see that justice is done to this man. I hope that not only will something be done for him, but that, in future, the Administration will be more careful to see that business methods are adopted in the various Departments. How can we expect the country to carry on under a system of administration such as that disclosed by this correspondence? There must be some one in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department who should get into trouble over this case, and there are a few such men in all the Departments. Until some of them are brought to book, we shall not be able to put the&#39; affairs of Australia on a proper footing. As an example of lax administration, I -do not think this case could be surpassed. I. again ask the Minister to look into it, and to see that there is no recurrence of such, incidents in- any Department of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>. - I want to ascertain what possibility there is of a Bill to amend&#39; the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act being introduced at an early date. Those of us who have a constructive policy are not content with destructive criticism - we want to submit concrete proposals.. The only excuse offered by the Government for not increasing invalid and old-age pensions is that they have not the money. If there is one thing more than another which we are entitled to ask the Government to undertake, it is the introduction of an amending Bill providing for an increase in the pension rates. Old-age and invalid pensions are a matter of right, and not of.&#34; charity, and those who receive them are as much entitled to consideration as are Judges and other highly-paid public officials who receive pensions on retirement. Many officials who are eligible for Public Service pensions have never in the discharge of their duties to be exposed to adverse weather conditions. They do not know what it is to be out in hail and snow. They do not know what  hard times &#34; mean. Many of them, undoubtedly, have done good service, and, notwithstanding the financial stringency, have received increased salaries. Why should we not increase the invalid and old-age pension rate ? The demand for an increase is favoured, not only in this House, but in the country, and I think we ought to have at once from the Government a statement of what they intend to do in the matter. Private members have no opportunity to introduce legislation since the time usually devoted to private members&#39; business has been taken away from us. But the Government should certainly bring in an amending Bill. There are many anomalies in the existing law. I object, for instance, to the method of payment, and have urged on many occasions that it should be altered. Under the present system a pensioner has to go once a fortnight to the nearest post-office for his money. Many pensioners have to travel long distances to reach a post-office, and those who are physically unfit to undertake such journeys have to appoint a substitute who will, not infrequently, demand a commission for collecting their pensions. I suggest that it would be better if the amount due to an invalid or old-age pensioner every fortnight were paid into his credit at the nearest Savings Bank. There are Savings Banks all over the country, and this would be the most convenient course to adopt. It would, amongst other things, rid some old people with a weakness of the temptation which they at present feel to spend too readily money that is placed in their hands. I do not see why these old folks should be obliged to go to a post-office, perhaps miles away from their homes for their pensions, when the money could be readily placed to their credit in the Saving Banks. Another anomaly relates to the claims of married persons who are living apart. If a man is; living apart from his wife, or a female applicant is living apart from her husband, unless there has been a judicial separation, the claim for a pension is refused. Both these are matters that should be dealt with in an amending Bill, and I ask the Minister to say here and now whether we shall be given an opportunity this session to discuss and pass such a measure. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I well remember the introduction of the original Bill. I was  chairman  of the Old-age Pensions Commission, whose report was responsible for the introduction of the pension, and I can say that the original rate of 10s. per week was fixed upon as representing just about the amount which could then be paid. It was regarded also as being the minimum amount on which it was possible to keep body and soul together. Ten shillings in those days would purchase far more than a pound will purchase to-day, and since we are all agreed that invalid and old-age pensions are desirable, why should we not make them sufficient to enable the recipients, instead of being half starved, to live according to a reasonable standard of comfort? I have some knowledge of the cost of the necessaries of life, and do not hesitate to say that it is impossible to live with any degree of comfort on 15s. per week. The position might be improved if some of the present stringent regulations under the Act were relaxed. For instance, pensioners might well be allowed to earn a little more than is permitted at the present time. I refuse to believe that this country is not rich enough to be able to deal fairly with the aged and infirm. At least three-fourths of the members of this House are in favour of the pension rate being increased, and a determined effort therefore should be made to secure an increase. I ask the Government to take note of warning signals. What would happen if an honorable member proposed to add to some motion before the House certain words providing that old-age and invalid pensions should be increased ? </para>

                                <para>- I urge the Government to take this question into its serious  consideration.  I agree with those who say that some people who are in receipt of pensions ought not to receive them, and that others who are denied pensions should be getting them. Much of the present trouble is due to stupid regulations. Pensioners receive sympathetic treatment at the hands of those administering the law, but the Deputy Commissioners cannot go outside the four corners of the Act and the regulations made under it. Many of these old folks have blazed the track for us; they have made our paths easy, and we should see that they receive reasonable consideration. They should not be asked to seek relief from hunger by tightening their belts nor to go poorly clothed. </para>

                        <para>I desire now to call attention to the need of drastic improvements in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. The Department is going from bad to worse-. Services are being cut out and conveniences reduced- Is there an honorable member, who will say that the telephone service is satisfactory? My experience is that it is very bad and such as to conduce to the use of profane language. I urge the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> who, no doubt, is doing his best, but who must be judged by results, to endeavour to bring about some improvement. The charges of the Department are higher, I suppose, than they have ever been, whereas the conveniences and services rendered by it are less than before. </para>
                        <para>I now wish to ask the Government when it is proposed to open up trade relations with Germany? I have had questions on the notice-paper on the subject, and I have received side-tracking replies. It seems to me stupid for us to be the only country in the world, in a sort of spirit of vengeance, to refuse to trade with our former enemies. After all, we wish to sell our wheat, wool, and other primary products, and we cannot expect to do that unless we establish trade relations in every possible direction. </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; but three months ago Britain and America were trading with Germany, and the Americans, who are noted as keen business men, have  even  arranged a fund of &#163;100,000,000 to enable business to be established with quick despatch. I cannot understand why we stand out, isolated, as it were, especially as we know that German goods, repacked in Britain, are coming here. </para>

There is an old saying that you should not &#34; cut off your nose to spite your face&#34;; and again I ask why we should continue our present attitude when we have such a fine lead from Britain and America? The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> and the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> point to what has taken place this week ; but I wish to see trade relations opened up at once. </para>

                                <para>- Then why did they go into conference? What the Treasurer probably means is that the States will have nothing to do with the scheme in the way in which he desires. We have discussed this question so long that it looks as if it were going to be eternal. If the Treasurer is anxious for money, there is one way in which he can get it, and that is by preventing needless expenditure. </para>

                                <para>- It is. When are we going to have any effort made to amend the Constitution? We, cannot go on increasing taxation indefinitely. One Parliament and one Government is quite enough for this country; and if we were to stop all the present duplication, we could save millions. If we were to ask the people of the country whether there should be fourteen Government Houses, fourteen Parliament Houses, and seven Governors, there would be only one answer, and that strongly in favour of doing away with the unnecessary expenditure. </para>

                                <para>- There is generally a country residence in each State for the Governor. Who will deny that the taxation burden is becoming unbearable? What is causing the immense depreciation in country properties and products of all kinds? It is the excessive taxation. If we tax a farmer &#163;50 or &#163;60 a year unnecessarily, we at once reduce the capital value of his land by at least &#163;1,000; and the burden is becoming too heavy. We must have money to pay pensions, provide for our returned soldiers, and meet other current obligations, and there is no reason for all the present duplication. Why not meet the representatives of the States at a round-table conference, and discuss these matters? </para>

                        <para>I should now like to say a word or two about the reduction of military pensions. I do not know the details sufficiently to express a decided opinion, but if what I hear is true, an absolute wrong is being done. Will the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> explain why. it is that, without any reason being given, the pensions of soldiers&#39; widows have been cut down by one-half? It is extraordinary if such a step has been taken without very good cause. In many cases these unfortunate pensioners are unable to get along on their present allowance, and the matter ought to be investigated. It is idle to say that the Defence officials do. this sort of thing without direction from the Government, who must be held responsible. </para>

                                <para>- Some time ago the Treasurer promised, if I remember rightly, to consider the taxing of the profits of the man on the land - the grazier, the farmer, and the miner - on an average of several years; because, although they may make large profits in one year, their occupations are precarious, and over a series of years they are bound to make losses, to which the income taxation as now levied gives no consideration. Under the present system a grazier may make &#163;1,000 in the first of a series of years, &#163;2,000 in the next, &#163;2,500 in the next and &#163;2,500 in the next, or &#163;8,000 in four years; but in the fifth year there may be a drought, and he may lose &#163;3,000, so that his net income for the whole period of five years is only &#163;5,000, or an average of &#163;1,000 a year. Such a man, however, would be called upon to pay income tax amounting to &#163;643 for the five years, whereas a city man earning &#163;1,000 a year regularly, and thus in a much better position to save, because such a man can regulate his outgoings in accordance with his income - would in the same period pay only &#163;228 in income tax, or just over one-third what the grazier would pay, although the incomes of the two would be the same. That is a dreadfully unfair arrangement, and I am surprised that it has not been altered. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that a member of this Parliament had to pay taxation on an assessment of &#163;1 per head for some thousands of calves all of which he lost in a drought. No allowance was made for that loss, and he was therefore taxed on an income which was never received. lt is idle to say that we cannot change the system. A Commission whose expenses will probably amount to between &#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000 i3 now inquiring into the incidence of taxation, but better results could have been obtained by getting- the heads of the Taxation Departments, who are very capable men, to confer on the subject. In a week they could give us as much information as the Commission will obtain in twelve months, .and during the whole of the time that its inquiry is taking place the present injustice will continue. The system of which I complain is inequitable, unjust, and unfair, and the sooner we have an alteration of it the better. Why cannot we introduce business methods in the conduct of the affairs of the country? At the present time the main business before the House is the Tariff, but what advance will be made in the consideration of the schedule this week? I travelled over 500 miles between Tuesday and Wednesday to attend here, and must return ever 500 miles to my home to-morrow, and I shall have travelled over 1,000 miles this week to do nothing. Why could we not attend to the public business ^ continuously for a fortnight or three weeks on end, as we would deal with private business, and make some progress ? If we attacked it in that way, we could devote a day to the consideration of the old-age pensions, and another to the rearrangement of the income tax. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that the men, having had all the facts and figures placed before them,  realize that unless they accept a reduction, there will be no work for them to do, and, therefore, have decided by a majority to take lower wages. How can an industry continue if the men demand wages which make the cost of production more than the product is worth? No industry can continue under those conditions.  A  man cannot be paid 22s. 6&#60;L if his labour earns only &#163;1. </para>

                                <para>- We all of us complain of the newspapers, but we know that their statements are not always untrue. I do not wish to labour this matter, because it is evident that an industrial enterprise must show a profit if it is to continue to pay wages, .and the country cannot afford to allow its industries to perish. It is argued that we should buy ships instead of building them, because in that way we can get them more cheaply. But if we give up shipbuilding there will be less work for miners and many classes of operatives, and fewer customers for the butter, meat, and other products of the farmers and graziers. The object of the Tariff is to increase our industries in order to increase employment, and to give a larger local market for our primary productions. </para>

                                <para>- My con&#39;tention is that the artisans are being driven into a corner by the agitator, and that this latter individual is behind the go-slow movement. What with all the duplications of Departments and the many Parliaments existing in Australia, heaped upon all these other considerations to which I have referred, we have about reached the end of our tether. We must have less humbug and more common sense. I am asked why I do not proceed to bring that about by ousting the present Government. No matter how bad I may think the Government, I am not prepared to go from bad to worse by putting in another Government drawn from the ranks of those who say, &#34;Let industry perish,&#34; and &#34;pay the men more in wages than the goods which they produce will bring in the markets of the world.&#34; I am sure that if we were to ask the people whether they think there should be an end to all the present stupid system of government they would almost unanimously reply in the affirmative. But we can remedy at once a part of the state of affairs existing to-day. We can put an end to the anomaly which compels the primary producers - the miners, the farmers, and the graziers - to pay virtually three times the amount of taxation that the city professional man has to pay. </para>

                            <para>.- -I desire to call attention to a distinct anomaly existing in the treatment by two Commonwealth Departments of one particular matter. The Taxation Department, aided and abetted, no doubt, by the Treasurer, has seen fit to collect heavily in the form of taxes from winners of Tattersalls sweeps.  Prom 1917 to 1920 the amount so collected was something like a quarter of a million sterling. No exception is taken by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department to distributing Tattersalls prize money to the various fortunate winners. But when it comes to the conveyance of letters from individuals in the community who desire to purchase Tattersalls tickets, the Postmaster-General seeks to prevent such a thing by placing certain persons upon a proscribed list, as a result of which they may receive neither package nor letter through the post. The whole business touches the height of hypocrisy. On the one hand the Government accepts money in the form of a heavy tax from winners of sweeps, while, on the other, the Government regards Tattersalls sweeps as illegal and refuses to deliver correspondence having to do with the matter. I suggest that the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer arrive at a decision to remove the anomaly one way or the other. If the Postmaster-General were to agree to lift the ban upon the conveyance of letters the Taxation Department would have far greater scope of exploitation. </para>

                        <para>I have asked numbers of questions recently regarding the appointment of three  Deputy  Presidents to the Arbitration Court, and others concerning the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and still more having to do with the basic wage. The Government should remove the <inline font-style="italic">impasse</inline> in which the unionists of this country find themselves through no fault of their own, but entirely owing to the inactivity of the Government. Ostensibly to help trade unionists, the Government amended the Arbitration Act; but,&#39; in its amended form, that Act now amounts to a hindrance. Unionists cannot secure redress of their, grievances. Previously they could go to the Arbitration Court and receive satisfaction, but that avenue for the maintenance of peace in industry has been closed foi* several months, and no govern-  mental action has been taken to reopen it. An unfortunate incident occurred some months ago, in which  His  Honour Mr. Justice Higgins and the Prime Minister were involved. It arose from the passing of the Industrial Peace Act, which, by the way, has been availed of only once, namely, in regard to the coal and shale industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins rightly adopted the attitude that that Statute overrode the provisions of the Arbitration Act, and he gave notice of his resignation from the Arbitration Bench. It will be a misfortune to Australia if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins is permitted to resign. I believe there are no great difficulties in the way of retaining his services. If the </para>
                        <para class="block">Government were to make known that the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act are to be applied only in times of crisis, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins were officially notified to that effect, I understand that he would remain  President  of the Arbitration Court. Australia can ill-afford to lose the services of such a man, and I say that notwithstanding that I differ greatly from the  President  of the Court in relation to many of his pronouncements, and particularly over his Harvester judgment. I urge the Government to take all necessary steps to retain his services. </para>
                        <para>For a considerable time there has been an agitation concerning the basic wage. Much criticism followed the announcement of the finding of the Basic Wage Commission. The finding of the Commission has been attacked, from all angles, but no one -has pointed out where it is wrong or produced figures to shake it in the slightest. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> has talked about a reduction in wages. For the past six years the workers of Australia have been chasing unsuccessfully the cost of living, and have not yet caught up to it. The Basic Wage Commission fixed the wage at an amount lower in some States and higher in others, but averaging &#163;5 16s. a week. In no State have the workers achieved that rate nor are their wages likely to reach the cost of living for some months to come even if they remain as they are to-day. So far there has been no appreciable reduction in the cost of living, and it will be many months before any decrease eventuates which is likely to bring the workers  into a state of mind that will induce them to contemplate a reduction in their wages. A very clever campaign was inaugurated about six months ago by the different organizations of employers. First of all the mine1 owners were put up to fight the case for the reduction in wages on the ground that there had been a depreciation in .the price of metals. At the outset the Mount Morgan mine in Queensland closed down, and the directors of that company stated that they were prepared to work their property if the workers would accept a reduction in wages. The men took a ballot, but by a large majority they declined to accept any reduction in their wages because they had not caught up to the cost of living as ascertained by the Basic Wage Commission. In Moonta, in South Australia, the same proposition was put up to the members of the Australian Workers Union and other unions. They were asked to take a ballot, but refused to do so. A ballot was certainly taken at the instigation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Verran, who has been appointed a special guardian of the mine owners&#39; interests. He induced a number of people who had never worked in a mine to vote on the question of a reduction of wages, and a majority decided to accept a reduction, but as the members of the trade unions had refused to participate in the ballot it was of not avail. In Kalgoorlie and Boulder, in Western Australia, the same campaign is being brought into existence. Notwithstanding the fact that the members of the Australian Workers Union have recently been to the Arbitration Court and secured an award, the mine owners are asking them to take into consideration the advisability of accepting a reduction in wages. Again, the directors of the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Company, Tasmania, have recently served notice on all the members of unions in their employment that unless they are prepared to alter their working conditions and hours and accept whatever conditions the directors may impose upon them the mine must be closed down. </para>

                                <para>- The ballot was a later phase which I shall deal with in a moment or two. The point I am emphasizing is that the whole of the unions, including the Australian Workers Union, absolutely refused the condition said down by the directors. After this meeting a conference was called at Melbourne. I attended the initial conference of the combined unions which resolved that no reduction of wages or extension of hours should be accepted. I had to leave for Sydney at the week end, but in the meantime the directors met the combined unions and put forward certain propositions, which were subsequently considered at a meeting of the executive council of the Australian Workers Union held in Sydney on 30th April and the 1st and 2nd May. About 1,600 men are working in the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> mine, and most of them are members of the Australian Workers Union. There were representatives of every State at the meeting of the executive council of the Australian Workers Union. The meeting took into consideration not merely the closing down of the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> mine, but the possible effect upon the whole of the workers of Australia of accepting the proposition of the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> directors, and after giving the matter careful and earnest consideration, resolved that in no circumstances would it accept a reduction of wages, an extension of hours, or any curtailment of the conditions the members&#39; of the Australian Workers Union were enjoying. The resolution of the executive council was duly conveyed to the members of the organisation at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell,</inline> and to the directors of theMt. Lyell Company, and quite recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler,</inline> the general secretary of the union, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> M.L.C., representing the Tasmanian members of the union, met the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> directors in conjunction with representatives from the combined unions whose members are engaged in or about the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> mine. The Australian Workers Union was not the only organization which refused&#39; to accept the conditions offered by the directors of the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Company. The same stand was taken by the representatives of the combined unions, because it was realized that once a reduction of wages, an extension of hours, or a curtailment of conditions was accepted it would establish a precedent and bring immediate success to the employers&#39; campaign which, as I have said, has been in operation for the past six or eight months. It would lead to a fall of wages everywhere. In certain localities some workers may think that they can manage with 6d. a day less, or by working an extra hour per day more, because of the fact that their employers may be providing them with rations at cost price - at the Moonta and Wallaroo smelters for instance. But the question is not a local one, it is a national issue. The workers of Australia must remain solid and stick together, because as soon as the thin end of the wedge for a reduction in wages is inserted, it means an all-round reduction of wages throughout Australia. </para>

If that principle were followed we would have men working at starvation wages simply because the industries in which they are employed could not provide them with a wage which would enable them to live ina reasonable standard of comfort. If the price of copper falls to &#163;40 per ton the honorable member for Eden-Monaro would not claim that the copper mines should be kept going by compelling the men to work at starvation wages. </para>

                                <para>- If an industry will not provide the workers engaged in it and those dependent upon them with a reasonable standard of comfort and decency, the workers should not be called upon to subsidize it. If an industry is essential to society as a whole, then the people as a whole should subsidize it, and not those employed in it. The directors of the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Company threatened to close down their mine if the men were not prepared to accept their conditions. They asked the unionists to guarantee an output of so many hundred tons per week, to assist in getting more men to work in the mine, and to work longer hours, but the men have refused to accept any responsibility for the working of the mine. That responsibility is essentially with the directors. This company has made over &#163;1,000,000 within the last three years, and this money has been invested in Broken Hill Proprietary stock, in the Electrolytic Zinc Works in Hobart, and in other ventures. While money has been hoarded and invested by the company in this way there has been no suggestion that the men, who have made these profits, should get &#34;a cut&#34; out of them, but immediately the price of copper falls to something close to the cost of production, the directors go to the workers and ask them to bear the brunt of it. Does the honorable member for Eden-Monaro say that that is fair? No fair-minded man can say it is. The environment of the workers at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> is the nearest in Australia to what Milton, in <inline font-style="italic">Paradise Lost,</inline> has described as Hades. </para>

                                <para>- There is no need to close the mine. Under present conditions it can make handsome profits. No other mine can produce copper as cheaply. The company has made millions of profit, but does not talk of sharing some of those millions with the unfortunate slaves who have made them for it. When it finds itself in difficulties, it says, in effect, to the workers, &#34; For Heaven&#39;s sake, accept a reduction in wages or an alteration in the hours of labour in order that the industry may be retained, and so that you may be able to buy bread.&#34; It is rank hypocrisy. </para>

                        <para>I shall conclude my remarks with a reference to old-age and invalid pensions. Ninety per cent. of the members of this House, despite the wailings of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> are in favour of a substantial increase in the invalid and old-age pension rate. To-day we are making a maximum payment of 15s. per week. That allowance can be obtained only by those who are able to make out a substantial case to the  Deputy  Commissioner. Applicants who have a few acres of land or a few sheep have great difficulty in obtaining anything. If they do get anything, the amount is very small. </para>

                                <para>- The question we have to consider is not what amount of money we spend in this way, but rather what is the position of the recipients. To-day invalid and old-age pensioners, unless helped by their friends, cannot live as human beings ought to do. Their present allowance is not sufficient to enable them to obtain proper food or the warm clothing so necessary to the aged. It is not sufficient to enable them to purchase bed-clothing or any of the simple luxuries which the old and infirm require. No matter what the total expenditure in this regard may be, we have a responsibility to the aged and infirm which must be met. We must give them at least &#163;1 per week. Heaven knows that is little enough. I suggest to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> that he set apart a day for the discussion of the question. If he does, I am sure that there will be such a unanimous expression of opinion in favour of an increase to &#163;1 per week that he will agree to make the increase. </para>

                <para class="block">In submitting this motion, I ought to explain that the matter has become just a little hurried owing to the possibility of the Senate rising to-morrow for some weeks. I want to have this Bill passed before another place adjourns. It is a measure to vary an agreement made some time ago with the Westralian farmers. Honorable members will recollect that last year we passed a Bill containing an agreement under which we proposed to assist a co-operative enterprise on the part of the farmers of Western  Australia to build &#34;silos for the storage of their wheat. As the agreement left the House, it provided that the whole scheme should involve an expenditure of &#163;800,000. One of the stipulations was that the farmers themselves should subscribe 300,000 shares of &#163;1 each, of which amount 10s. per share should be paid on application, and that we, on our part, should provide &#163;550,006 for the complete scheme. It was provided that when the farmers had subscribed 300,000 shares, and had expended &#163;100,000, we should begin to pay at the rate of &#163;2 for &#163;1 until the full amount had been exhausted or the scheme had been completed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Westralian farmers now ask for a variation of this agreement. They want to confine themselves for the time being to the construction of the terminal silos, leaving the question of the construction of the country silos to be ~ considered later. The proposition, therefore, is very much reduced. Later on it may transpire that we shall expend the whole of this money in the construction of silos, but on a plan different from that which hitherto has been&#39; adopted. It is not at all clear that the country silos erected in New South Wales are a proved success, and I think the Westralian farmers are wise in contenting themselves for the time being with the construction of terminal silos. The variation they suggest may be shortly stated. They have already subscribed 240,000 shares. That means that they have already in hand &#163;120,000. They suggest that they do not subscribe the remaining 60,000 shares for the time being, but that they proceed  only  with the erection of the terminal silos. I propose to agree to the modification, stipulating on our side for a <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">rata</inline> reduction in our obligation. This means that they will proceed with their present share capital of &#163;240,000, and that we reduce our obligation to them to &#163;440,000. That is a strictly <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> arrangement. We reduce our obligation from &#163;550,000 to &#163;440,000, and they reduce theirs from &#163;300,000 to &#163;240,000. </para>

                        <para>- Incidentally it is, and I commend this co-operative concern for what I cannot help regarding as a wise and cautious view of the situation. &#39;When they have erected their terminal silos the question of whether country silos are a success will have been tested, and they can proceed in a year or two&#39;s time with more experience behind them, a greater amount of resources, and more information on the whole subject. I commend this proposal to the House. It relieves us of an obligation to the extent of &#163;110,000, and it enables the farmers of Western Australia to proceed with a somewhat less .ambitious scheme. </para>

                    <para class="block">On the 25th November last I submitted to this House a motion referring this work to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report, in accordance with the provision of the Public Works </para>
                    <para class="block">Committee Act. I then pointed out that when the original contract for the erection of the Perth General Post Office was entered into in 1914 it was considered that the number of stories for which it provided would be adequate for the purposes of the Departments for some time to come. Experience, however, has shown that the building as then designed will not be adequate. It was suggested, first of all, that the State Government should occupy one of the two floors if we proceeded with the extension, but the State Government could not see its way to do so, and the idea was dropped. In the meantime, Commonwealth Departments in Western Australia grew to such an extent, especially the Taxation Department, that it was urged that two. stories should be added to accommodate them. At present the Commonwealth Departments are in various buildings scattered throughout Perth, and the two additional stories, it was urged, would accommodate them all in the one building. The matter was investigated very fully by the Public Works Committee, evidence being taken in Western Australia from the officers of the various Departments. The result is that the Committee unanimously approve of the work being proceeded with, and they show in their report exactly what the cost will be. The original contract price for the building was &#163;232,700, and, though there have been various modifications, that, roughly, remains the price to-day. The addition of two stories will cost,, probably, another &#163;50,000, but the general result  Will  be to provide more efficient and cheaper accommodation for the Departments than we have at present. As I have said, the Public Departments, including the Audit Department, the Sub-Treasury, the Taxation Department, and the Electoral Department are scattered all over Perth. </para>

                            <para>- This contract will extend over two years, and the money for this year has been provided. The Public Works Committee report that it will be more economical, and certainly result in more efficiency, if this extension is carried out as recommended. The contract was originally let to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnott,</inline> and it is proposed by the Committee that he be allowed to complete the building on a schedule basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnott</inline> has all his- material and plant on the spot, with an organized staff, and the Committee is of opinion he ought to be allowed to carry out the work of adding these two stories on the terms mentioned. The building is now ready to receive the roof, but the contractor has stayed his hand, leaving the material lying idle, pending the decision of the House. It will be seen that the matter is urgent ; and there is the additional fact that there is a. tendency for rents, under the present leases of the Public Departments, to rise. </para>

                        <para>.- It must be admitted that this can be described as an urgent work, inasmuch as the building has been under construction for some years. I take it that we are all agreed that it is much more economical to house our own Public Servants in our own buildings; and in the present case it certainly will be much more economical to make available this additional space than allow the original contract to be completed. From the report of the Public Works Committee I gather that the contractor is now at the stage when he is able to put the roof in position; consequently, whatever this House does must be done promptly. It may be asked why should this contractor be given this job without the calling for tenders; but the answer is not difficult to find. The present contractor has all the necessary apparatus on the spot, and therefore, he is able to complete the job much cheaper than if a fresh tender were accepted, and fresh plant had to be installed. My view is that it is essential, as far as possible, to have all the Commonwealth offices in one building. In any capital city of Australia, if inquiries . are made for the Commonwealth offices, the inquirer finds that he has to go to different streets ; indeed, it is difficult for the average resident to find exactly where they are located. I notice that these additional stories mean an expenditure of another  &#163;50,000;  but in Perth to-day the Commonwealth is *paying, according to the evidence before the Public Works Commit tee, &#163;2,635 per annum in rents. That is a little more than five per cent, on the&#39; estimated cost of the additions, but at the present time we cannot borrow money under six per cent. There is, therefore, a slight loss after providing interest on the additional capital to be found, but it is hardly worth considering in view of the increased facilities afforded to the public. There is another advantage in having all our Departments under one roof. Very often, under such circumstances, the Departments can be worked with less labour than &#39;if they are scattered all over the city. Each Department has its- own staff, of course, but there is certain work, quite apart from the staff,- and for which we have to rely on casual labour. With half a dozen separate buildings the cost of this labour has to be met in each build-  ing, whereas where all are under one roof, the aggregate cost does not equal that n&#233;w incurred. Notwithstanding the fact that money is scarce I regard this as an urgent work. The Public Works Committee gave the matter very &#39; close attention, and the evidence shows justification for their finding. Believing that finally the proposed addition will tend to reduce the cost of administration, I shall offer no opposition to the motion. </para>

                            <para>.- When&#39; the original plans were furnished for this Post Office at Perth, a good deal of opposition was raised to the project. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley, who &#39;was then in charge of the Works Administration, purchased the site at a valuation,&#39;? which I suppose has by now nearly doubled ; and he was much criticised for what I regard as his foresight as to the requirements of the City of Perth. When this building was projected the Government of Western Australia was asked to occupy a portion of it, but the Government refused. I do not know much of the rr en who composed the State Government, but I do not think that &#39;it reflects the opinion of the people of Western Australia. They were asked by the Commonwealth Government to become tenants of the building which it is proposed to erect, but refused to do so, and put all the obstacles that they could raise in the way of the Commonwealth Government because at the time a Labour Government was in power here. </para>

                                <para>--At any rate, that Government had&#39; not a vision extending beyond its own features, whereas this Government saw further ahead. The Perth General Post Office would have been finished now had the State Government shown more foresight. Since that time, the Western Australian Government has agreed with the Commonwealth Government upon the amalgamation of Taxation Departments, and a floor of the new General Post Office is to be devoted to the accommodation of the Taxation officers. We are amply justified in voting for the completion of this structure. The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> spoke of&#39; the contractor for the building. I understand that the contractor is satisfied that a schedule can be drawn up to which the Department can agree as showing the amount required to finish the building. Strangely enough, the calamity howlers in this Chamber all hail from Western Australia.&#39; They are perpetually crying economy; they talk it by the yard, and spin it out by the mile. Their utterances cast gloom on a community that has already sufficient to bear. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> should have thought twice before saying what he did the other day about our financial position, because,, above all things, a public man should be optimistic. That is the foundation of his .success. Now, however, the Western Australian members are pressing for Government expenditure in Perth, trying to obtain something of the kind that New South Wales members want to get done at Canberra. We wish to have the Commonwealth Parliament and the administrative offices of the Commonwealth put in the Federal Territory; and the Western Australian members wish to have the Commonwealth Departments of Perth housed in the one building. I agree with them that that should be done. It is not often that we get an opportunity to discuss matters of finance here. I am satisfied that this proposal is a sound one, because the money is to be usefully expended. There is no extravagance in spending money for a work which is necessary for the proper conduct of the business of the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, in to-morrow&#39;s newspapers we shall probably read adverse criticism of this proposal, and the Taxpayers&#39; Association, the members of which are merely&#39; tax-dodgers, will object to it. About &#163;200,000 has already been spent on the Perth General Post Office, and from this expenditure we get no direct return; but the proposed additions, which will cost &#163;50,000, will give us a return. If the men at the head of this Administration had proper financial knowledge, a redemption fund would be provided to gradually extinguish the debt on the building. Unfortunately, that is not provided for, and nothing of the kind is to be expected until, with a change of Government, the party to which I belong w:ns the opportunity to show the people how its affairs should be financed. </para>

                            (Maribyrnong)  &#91;9.231 .- I would have liked the Minister to tell us a little more about the resumed property on which the Perth General Post Office is being built. I understand that some years ago a Commonwealth Government acquired in Perth a very valuable property, which can be made an exceptionally , fine investment. There is, or was, a first-class hotel on the site, and I understand that a street was to be formed. Some of the citizens&#39; of Perth wish for expenditure on ornamentation there, but those who regard this as a business proposition consider that it would be better to create shop frontages.

                                <para>- I do not wish to introduce irrelevant matter. What I have seen of the Perth General Post Office makes me think that the structure is a very fine&#39; one, and although money is dear at the present time, it will be in the long run profitable to expend it in housing our  officials  in the manner proposed. Those who have travelled about the Commonwealth know how much time and -money is wasted by the present arrangement of having the Commonwealth Offices distributed all about the various capital cities. &#39; The sooner we have in each of the capitals buildings which will house all the Commonwealth servants there, the better it w:ll be for the public and for the Commonwealth Service, because it will facilitate inter-departmental communication, and will convenience all who have business with Government Departments. I hope that this fine structure, which will adorn the wonderful city of Perth, may be completed soon. * </para>

                            <para>. - I support the proposal, but <inline font-style="italic">&#39;1</inline> am sorry that it does not go further. It is not economical to build on an expensive site a build ng lower than the municipal regulations will allow the s&#39;te to carry. That it is now proposed to add two stories to a five storied building proves my contention. It is a waste of public money to put a three or four storied building on an expensive site  whch  would carry a seven or eight storied building, and provide floor-space economically. Nowadays, when a big steam-ship company or any other enterprising business concern is erecting city offices, it generally builds as high as the municipal regulations will permit. If they do not wish to use the whole of the building they let portion until it is required for their own purposes. Here is an example of what occurs in connexion with the so-called economies of government. When the building was first planned, a five-storied structure was contemplated, but it had not been roofed when it became evident that upon . such a valuable site a building of such a character would not be economical. The proposal was made, therefore, to add two additional/stories. It is not economical to place a roof upon a low building, in such circumstances, and then, only a few years afterwards, to take it off and build the structure higher. There was a similar experience in connexion with the great railway station in Sydney. I believe that the additions to that structure have &#39;cost twice as much as would have been the case had they been made when the station was originally built. If one were to  investigate the erection of Commonwealth buildings throughout the States, and to ascertain the additional costs involved by tinkering W.th those build. ings because the first plans had not been on a sufficiently elaborate scale, an enormous waste of public money would be revealed. Perth is -a big and a growing city. I agree with the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> that the public buildings of the Commonwealth should be erected by optimists who have faith in the future of Australia, and whose optimism would rapidly prove the best form of economy. </para>

                            <para>.- I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond).</inline> The reason why the Perth Post-office was not originally erected as is now proposed rests with that gang which is attached to the Commonwealth Public Works Branch, and which is now &#39;trying to ruin Canberra. Perth can claim something possessed bv no other city which I have ever visited. Owing to the genius of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O &#39;Malley, the General Post Office in Perth has been built on the best possible site. The two great points of meeting in any metropolis are its central railway station and General Post Office. 1 know of no city in Australia or Great Britain where there is a junction of those two centres such as in Perth. The land upon which the General Post Office has been reared has been secured practically for nothing. The money spent thereon is returning&#39; at present more than 5 per cent. ; when I was in Perth the return amounted to between 6 per cent, and 7 per cent. Ultimately, the General Post Office site will prove to have cost the Commonwealth nothing, and when the proper structure shall have been reared there will be a huge revenue returning 7&#163; per cent, upon the original cost of the land. The sum of &#163;50,000 involved in the building? of two additional stories is an expenditure which 1 consider wise, but it jars upon my mind that the work should not be open to public tender. I understand that the difficulty in this respect is due to the fact that the contractor is already in possession of the situation. </para>

                        <para>I plead with the Government to throw open the designing of public buildings competitively to the architects of Australia, and not to let the work remain with that abomination of all centres, that little circle in the Works Department which tried to ruin one of the most brilliant geniuses who ever came to this country. I recall that the &#34; honorable member for the void,&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> sent a petty litt e official to block the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Commissioner</inline> blacket Upon the subject to which I am now alluding. There <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> no architect in Austral. a who can proceed along St. Kilda-road to-day without being horrified at that laughingstock which houses the Repatriation Department. That job came from that same cauldron of absurdity; and until the gang to which I am alluding is placed under proper control, Australia will never have fair play in the erection of her public buildings. The facts form almost as great an infamy as the giving out of the architectural work in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney, in which there was involved that family combine of Miller and Kirkpatrick. </para>

                                <para>- He is one of the most skilful men We have, and he has rendered invaluable service to the Commonwealth. I resent the cruel remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne, and it is only right that I should endeavour to defend  public  officials who have been attacked and have not the opportunity to reply. It is about time this kind of criticism was dropped. The work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murdoch</inline> has come under the review of the Public Works Committee again and again. He has had to withstand the full force of the many probings  of that body, and I leave it to  the  judgment of honorable members whether the attack of the honorable member . is either justifiable or worthy of himself. </para>

                        <para>.- When I secured permission last evening to resume my remarks to-day, I was referring to the fact that Japan was the only country which had beaten the American Tobacco Combine. I propose to show as briefly as possible how this was done. It was during the Russo-Japanese war, when the latter nation desired to borrow money, and found that a tobacco &#39; monopoly was a great asset! The Japanese approached the American Combine, which, however, would have nothing to do with the proposal. Thereupon the Government of Japan imposed a 50 per cent. duty. Still, the Combine did not care. Therefore, the Japanese authorities, within a year, imposed a duty of 100 per cent.; and still the Combine was perfectly happy. Next year came 150 per cent., and ultimately with a Tariff at 250 per cent., which obliged the Combine to pay a duty of &#163;25 on cigars valued at &#163;10 f.o.b. Hamburg, the Americans recognised that they would have to come to terms with the Japanese Government. Accordingly they approached that Government, but were informed that the Government- wished them to remain in business in Japan. The Government pointed out that several fair offers had been made to the Combine which they were not prepared to accept, and they could do no more in the matter. The Combine realized that, in the circumstances, they could not continue to carry on business in Japan, and determined to cut out all operations there. As the result the Japanese Government were in a position to buy, for a mere song, the buildings of the Combine and what machinery it did not pay to remove. To-day the Japanese are facing, with success, the competition of American Tobacco Combines from Vladivostock in the North to Bombay in the South, and are providing a cigarette equal to what is produced in any other part of the world. </para>

                    <para>Yesterday I claimed that the most up-to-date Tariffs in the world were these of the United States of America and Japan. </para>
                    <para class="block">I would like to see either adopted <inline font-style="italic">en bloc,</inline> with perhaps a few additional items relating to matters in which the East would naturally differ from the West. The figures showing the protection afforded to the Japanese cigar maker are startling. The duty on a box of cigars weighing 1&#163; lbs. and worth 20s. on board  shio  before landing is 15s. under our Tariff. But that is not the actual amount of protection afforded to the local cigar maker. We must also deduct from this 15s. the duty charged on the imported leaf and the amount of excise duty, which two items equal 6s. 9d. on the lj lb. box. The net protection afforded to the local cigar maker is therefore only 8s. 5d. on that box of cigars. On a box of cigars of the same value the Japanese cigar maker is protected by a duty of &#163;3 lis., and on a box of cigars of the same weight worth ls. each on board ship before landing the protection afforded to him is &#163;17 15s., the duty in  Japan  being 355 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline></para>

                    <para>In discussing Protection we cannot have a better illustration than a box of matches. In Great Britain the women and children who are employed at match making, mostly in their homes, receive 2&#163;d. for making a gross of match boxes, and they are obliged to find their own paste. In 1902 I visited Japan, and I wrote a small book describing my visit, in which I said - </para>

                        <para>In . the year 1902 Japan manufactured 328,806.090 gross of matches at a cost of 8,608,571 yen. Beckoning one yen at 2s. - the actual value is 2s.  0&#189;d.-this  works out at a trifle over f of a penny (.635d.) per gross. In face of these figures, it seems that even Scandinavia must shortly surrender the business of match making absolutely to Japan. </para>

The aftermath of the terrible war makes it absolutely necessary to have a real Tariff for Australia. . For twenty years the two walls of this chamber have rung with the speeches of Protectionists, but in this twenty years we have not had a real up-to-date Tariff. Even that which the Minister has brought in is not as perfect as either the United States&#39; or&#39; the Japanese Tariff. Australia must manufacture all its needs&#39;. It is time we became proud of our country. We held our own in the most terrible ordeal a nation can undergo, but we are not manufacturing commodities as we should be doing. We are told that some wool and skins are to be burnt to get rid .of them. </para>

It is as big a crime as that of a man who burns a house, and the crime of arson is next to that of murder. Honorable members - have spoken of wool with weevils in it, and of decaying skins. Surely there is some way in which the Government could come to the assistance of the men who hold this wool or these skins. Surely they could be. collected in some way and stored in some centres instead of being destroyed when more than half the world is begging for wool.: Next to feeding people comes the. clothing of them. There are to-day millions oi  people in Central Europe without proper clothing. Therefore, I pretest against the destruction of wool and hides. It is an infamy. The man who burns his wool is equally guilty with the man who burns down a house. </para>

Our Govern men t factories should be extended. When the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> was Treasurer, I submitted to him an offer by a manufacturer of this State to supply to the public cheap clothing on certain conditions; but the honorable member did not &#34; play the game.&#34; At the time, certain factories which had contracted with the Defence Department to make clothes for our returned soldiers were being supplied by the Government with various tweeds at 4s. 6d. per yard. The tenders received for suits to be made from such tweeds ranged from 26s. 3d. to 30s. each. A local manufacturer placed in my hand an offer to supply factory-made suits to the general public for &#163;2 2s., and tailor-made suits for &#163;3, if the Government would undertake to let him have the same tweeds at the price at which it was being supplied to these factories. He was prepared to begin with an output of 500 suits per week, and to work up to an output of 1,000  suits  weekly. The honorable member for Balaclava referred me to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> who told me that the Defence Department could make a better arrangement. I urged it to do so without delay. Why should not the public have the same consideration in this regard as is extended to our soldiers? If the Commonwealth Mills cannot turn out sufficient tweed to enable the public as well as our returned men to be supplied at these low rates we should extend them. The tweed is of excellent quality, and would command a market in any part of the world. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> showed me some splendid samples of cross-bred wool, which he informed me was being sold at 3d. per lb. Seven pounds of greasy wool will make a suit. </para>

I had submitted tome evidence that tweeds sold at a Geelongmall at prices ranging from 6s. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per yard were sent from Geelong to a Melbourne warehouse, and finally returned to Geelong, where they were retailed at prices ranging from &#163;1 to 35s. per yard. The State Government, during the war, appointed a Pair Prices Commission, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> McCay, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Gray, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchinson,</inline> but it had little or no power to deal with profiteering. If it had been empowered to order the imprisonment of profiteers, it would have been able to do some good. It has been unjustly blamed, and I take this opportunity to extend to its members my meed of praise for the work done by them. Where it was proved before the Commission that a grocer or tailor had overcharged an individual, the Commission could compel that grocer or tailor to make a refund, but it had no power to deal with wholesale robbery. How many people would be prepared to waste a day or two in giving evidence before the Commission concerning an overcharge of 3s. or 4s. in a grocery bill? The position would have been different if the Commonwealth or the State Government had followed the splendid example of Napoleon, who in 1812, provided that if any body of men came together for the purpose of unduly raising the prices of any goods, they should be punished by a fine of 20,000 francs, and, in addition, be imprisoned for six months. If the raisins of prices related to foodstuffs - to such commodities as wheat, flour, or wines - the punishment was doubled. </para>

                        <para>.- While I can hardly go to the extent to which the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> is prepared to go in his support of this Tariff, I stand pledged to give reasonable protection to secondary industries, believing, as I do, that it is highly necessary for primary production to be followed by secondary production. Last night we heard a lecture on the Northern Territory, and were told that the chief industry in that great area, embracing as it does some 520,000 square miles, is pastoral. It was also stated that the pastoral industry may be followed up successfully by mining, and that to make both reasonably successful&#39; it is necessary to have a railway. I cannot see that Protection can give any great  assistance to these three great interests for a considerable time to come. In Queensland, I understand, there are some 41^,000,000 acres of land, not more than 20,000,000 of which are alienated, while the population is smaller than that of Melbourne. There, again, we see the necessity for primary production, and the opening up of our great resources. In Australia we require at least another 5.000.000 people. To place those people, if they come here, in our cities would mean ruin, but picked, desirable settlers., with a knowledge of their business from an agricultural stand-point, placed on the land, would prove one of Australia&#39;s greatest assets. There are some 500.000 acres of stations in New South Wales and part of Queensland that are now being subdivided for closer settlement. In view of that large scheme of settlement, and of the great <inline font-style="italic">acreage</inline> of the Northern Territory and Queensland, it is &#39; highly necessary that our settlers should be given all the assistance within our power.  Included  amongst those are 22.000 in soldier, settlements, who mainly produce butter, wheat, wool, and meat; and it is highly necessary that the producers of these commodities should be able to procure their tools of production at the most reasonable price, and provided with railways and roads. Here,, again, I fail to see how an excessive Tariff can be of much assistance for years to come. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The dairying industry has been a great benefit to Australia in the past, and we trust it may be even more beneficial in the future. For eight months during the sale of our butter to&#39; the Imperial Government, if I mistake not, the &#34;amount received in return was some &#163;10,000,000. That was without any assistance from the Tariff, as the world&#39;s market very largely regulates the price of the product. The dairying industry is simply in its infancy, and as various byproducts are now under scientific investigation, it is one to which assistance might be given with great benefit to the country at large.. Another great industry is the woollen industry, which for many years prior to the war returned to Australia some &#163;32,000,000 per annum. I fail to see why we are not converting more than 8$ per cent, of .this, our own wool, into manufactured goods. It is not Protection that this industry requires, but something quite apart from Protection. Our wool is taken Home and brought back manufactured; and hitherto we have been supplying Germany with wool for manufacture into clothing, while our own people have been practically idle. The woollen industry is probably one of the greatest in Australia, and if &#163;32,000,000 worth or thereabouts, of our wool were converted into textiles here, that figure, would be increased &#39;to over &#163;70,000,000, while employment would be given to 140,000 workers, representing the sustenance of about 500,000 people. The food alone required for the Upkeep of that army of men and women would run to over &#163;12,000,000 a year; and it is here that the farmer would benefit. But still I do not see that to this particular industry Protection can give any great assistance. There are- other industries, however, to which, no doubt, Protection is highly necessary. As a young country we -must develop our secondary industries along with the primary; and to that end there must certainly be fair and reasonable Protection, which I, as a member of the House, am prepared to extend. There are industries that the war has proved necessary to us, not only as a means -of employment, but as a source of defence. The war has brought to light many inventions that would not have been thought of for many years to come ; let us not lose sight of the valuable information thus given, but take, time by the forelock. I feel sure that honorable members in this corner will give all reasonable assistance to those industries that afford tangible proof of requiring it. </para>
                    <para>The primary producer, as I have already stated, depends largely on the world&#39;s market for the sale of his produce. It is very different with the manufacturer, who has the advantage of Wages Board awards and Arbitration Court findings, and who. also has the happy knack of not only adding to his price the cost of any such findings, but a considerable amount in addition, while the unprotected consumer pays &#39; all the time. I am sure the Minister will keep his eye on this &#34;aspect of the question. I am pleased-to hear that the Minister has in his mind the appointment of a scientific Board in order that moves of the kind indicated may be watched. If that is not done, there will be continual clamour for Protection, Protection, Protection, as in the past, and the helpless consumer will in all cases pay -the piper. The high wages awarded by Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts in certain industries are draining the country of farmers&#39; sons. We cannot possibly expect a farmer&#39;s son to remain on the land, for 30s. to &#163;2 per week and his keep, when he can get over double that pay in a manufacturing establishment, with  shorter  hours, better opportunities for recreation, and sports in every direction. If we get the flood of immigration which we hope and look for, and there is no wise supervision in order that the immigrants may be kept out of the cities and placed in their proper vocation in life, it will prove&#39; a greater menace than a benefit. We shall simply become a manufacturing community regulated by Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts, which must break down from their very artificiality, if from nothing else. </para>
                    <para>The Minister did not say straight out that this is really not a protective but a revenue Tariff, which he asks our assistance to push through because the Government requires&#39; the money, and then promise that at the earliest possible  moment, when the finances allow, he will revise it; he believed that it would have a speedy passage. But that it is a revenue Tariff is proved by the fact that the Customs receipts for the year ending 31st March were &#163;32,072,408, equal to a tax of 6s. 3d. per head of our population. Yet certain members of the House are continually crying down the profiteer as the cause of the high cost of living, though the demands of the Customs House are largely responsible for the cost. </para>

                    <para>We have 3,000,000 square miles of territory peopled by just over 5,000,000 people. The United States of America have a population of 111,000,000 on an area not as large as Australia. Our continent is fourteen times larger than Germany, which has a population of 68,000,000. We have twenty-seven times the area of Italy, which has a population of 36,000,000. Australia has an area equal to two-fifths of the whole area of South America, where there are 88,000,000 people. I have been a Protectionist all my life, and I dp not see. my way to alter my opinion now; but these facts prove to me, wrong as I may be, that the brains and intelligence of this House should be concentrated on the opening up and development of the great resources of this young continent, for otherwise we cannot possibly expect to hold it. </para>
                    <para>In regard to machinery I have quite  a  sheaf of information; but the honorable member for Dumpier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has, in my honest opinion, pretty well covered that branch of the subject - though, perhaps a little on the low Tariff side - in one of the ablest speeches yet made on the Tariff. That honorable member gave the House the fullest information he could collect, after months of work, and presented a most comprehensive view of the position as it is to-day. Under the circumstances, I do not propose to traverse the same ground, but merely to refer to one or two items, particularly with reference to the machinery industry in Canada. Canadian workmen are higher paid than Australian. On the other hand, the Australian manufacturer secures his raw materials at prices equal to or even less than those of the Canadian manufacturer. With all these advantages in his favour, it would be reasonable to expect the Australian manufacturer, if he is efficient in his methods of production, and satisfied with a reasonable profit, to produce and sell the machines he manufactures at about the same price at which the Canadian manufacturer sells similar machines in Canada. The following table, showing the prices of representative farm machines in Canada and Australia, will not only indicate the disadvantage under which the Australian farmer labours, but also the advantage the Australian manufacturer has taken of the opportunity both distance and the Tariff have given him to feather his own nest:- </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">As a farmer who knows something about agricultural machinery, I hold the view that the difference between the price of reapers and binders in Canada and their price in Australia is excessive, and so with many other articles on this list. I hope, therefore, that members will not agree to every item without inquiry. We ought not to build up Combines in Australia to the advantage of a few individuals; our object should be to secure fair treatment for the whole of the community. The fact that the Tariff schedule, as a whole, is calculated to produce a magnificent revenue is not an argument for its acceptance, because if money is not obtained in this way it must be got from some other source, and it is for honorable members to determine whether there would be any gain in that. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to put a prohibitive tax on luxuries, or, rather, I would make the tax on them similar to that on farming machinery, which is practically prohibitive. I am sure that honorable members will do their best to make the Tariff as nearly scientific as is possible under the circumstances. I trust that the proposed Board will be in no sense political, and will be composed of independent, brainy men, who will do their duty honestly. </para>

                        <para>- There is a subject to which I should have referred when speaking on the grievance motion had the Treasurer been present, but he was absent in the performance of duties elsewhere, and, of course, is not to be blamed for that. This afternoon I addressed to him a series of questions relating to silver coinage, but they did not appear on the notice paper exactly as I wrote them. Perhaps it would be better to give notice of them again in the form in which they were originally drafted. The coins to which I referred were, in my opinion, counterfeit, and they were obtained, not in one business place, but in two. They were part of some coinage got from the Imperial Government because of the great demand for silver created by the return of our soldiers. There was not sufficient in Australia at the time to conduct ordinary business. I know that these coins came from the Imperial mint, and, if possible, I shall endeavour to get some like them. They were tested with acid, and proved to contain a certain quantity of zinc. Any person having to do with money would conclude, as I did, that they did not contain 90 per cent. of fine silver. The Treasurer was correct in his statement that the coinage of 1920 contained the right proportion of silver, because that money was coined in Australia, but the money to which I referred was not. coined here. I referred to it as &#34;dated 1920,&#34; but other words were used in printing my question which placed a different meaning on it. I make this explanation in justice to myself, to show that the questions were not frivolous and that I knew what I was talking about. </para>
