                        <para>- In this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> in the monetary and commercial column, it is stated that an arrangement has been made by the Government in reference to the seigniorage on silver coined in London for use in Australia. I ask the Prime Minister if that statement is correct, and, if so, will he inform the House what arrangement has been made? It is also stated that the depreciation in the gold coinage minted in Australia will have to be provided for by the Commonwealth. Does that statement refer to the gold coinage in circulation in Australia only, or to all the gold coined in Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- I have information on the subject to which the honorable member's question refers, but, as the question is a very important one, I ask him to give notice of it, so that I may make a more satisfactory statement than I could make offhand. I should like to remark that I have never known a House in which so many questions are asked without notice. It is scarcely fair to Ministers to expect replies offhand to questions which involve, at times, very careful consideration. It would be much more convenient to the Government, and, I think, more satisfactory to members asking questions, if, as far as possible, notice were given. Of course, there are occasions when the question is one of great urgency ; I do not allude to questions of that kind. My remarks apply to questions in obtaining an answer to which the loss of a day is not of the slightest consequence. </para>

I had a communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> pointing out that he was entitled to interest at 5 per cent on the money refunded, which was held by the Department for over three years. That claim was allowed, interest at that rate having been paid in similar cases. I shall be glad to let the honorable member see all the papers. </para>

I shall therefore content myself on this occasion with reminding the House that this is purely an enabling measure. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne drew attention to the fact that it leaves the Administration at large ; but I think that those who administer the measure may, like those administering other measures, be trusted to carry out its expressed intentions. Seeing that these proposals are to a certain extent experimental, the Bill has been so drafted as not to prevent the Administration from meeting unforeseen contingencies. In that we have followed the example set in the principal Act, which merely provides that a General Officer Commanding and an Advisory Board may be appointed, leaving the exact allotment of the duties of these authorities to be determined by regulation and administration. </para>

                        <para>- No. It may be found in the course of two or three years, or even sooner, that it is not desirable to limit the tenure, and that, like other matters, is left to be decided by experience. Though I myself have a very strong opinion on the subject, experience may prove that I am mistaken in my view. The appointment referred to will certainly be made for a period not exceeding four years, but that will not prevent its being renewed, if, at the end of the term, it is thought desirable to adopt that course instead of making a change. If any questions arise, I shall conveniently be able to -answer them in Committee. If I may be permitted to do so, I would ask honorable members to assist in facilitating the passage of the Bill, in order that it may reach the Senate as soon as possible, because, until it becomes law, the hands of the Department will be tied, and, although I am ready to proceed, I cannot do so until we have the necessary legislative authority. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to prolong this debate, but I desire to reiterate what I have already stated to the effect that the Bill is unnecessary. The present Defence Act, and the powers conferred under it, would enable the Government to practically do everything that could be done under the Bill. The title of the General Officer Commanding is merely a name. He exercises only such powers as are intrusted to him by the Government. There is nothing to prevent the General Officer Commanding from performing, under the present Act, all those duties that it is proposed the Inspector-General shall discharge, and the proposed Board could do nothing beyond what could be accomplished by the Board of Advice provided for under the Defence Act. My principal objection to this hurried legislation is that the Act passed last year, after considerable thought and full discussion - with infinitely more deliberation than is being shown in connexion with the present Bill, because the subject was before us for eighteen months - has not been given a trial. The Minister himself has changed his opinion, and has given us no reason for it. He has stated, further, that this is not his proposal,, but that of his predecessors. I should like to know whether the Minister has really changed his opinion, or whether he has merely adopted the views of others. The Minister of Trade and Customs formerly expressed the opinion that a Council of Defence was unnecessary, and several other honorable members took up a similar attitude. I do not know what has happened to bring about a change of opinion, even before a trial has been given to the legislation which was deliberately passed last year. If -we had given the Act a trial, and it had failed to accomplish what was desired, I could understand an attempt being made to devise better means of administration and control. It seems to me that, because the late General Officer Commanding carried out his duties in a somewhat autocratic manner, and centralized the control to a greater extent than is considered desirable, it is held to be necessary to make a radical change. </para>

The Government can limit or extend the powers of the General Officer Commanding, just as it chooses, and a Board of Advice could be appointed which would be equally as effective as a Council of Defence. I do not know upon whose advice the present proposal is being made. The late General Officer Commanding was opposed to it. </para>

                            <para>- I have-already informed honorable members that a very high authority in the mother country considers that the Inspector-General should be a member of the Board of Management, and yet the Minister persists in putting forward a scheme under which the Inspector-General is to have no executive authority, and to have no voice, and to have no place upon the Board. As I have already stated, when the Bill reaches the Committee stage, I shall propose an amendment in this respect. I should like to know why the director of the Navy should have a seat on. the Naval Board, whilst the director of the Military Forces is to be excluded from the Military Board. The distinction made between the two officers appears to me to indicate that the matter has not been well considered. I was in control of the Defence Department for two or three years, and I am deliberately of opinion that there is no necessity for this Bill at present. </para>

                        <para>- For once I am in accord with the right honorable member for Swan. I think that he is perfectly right when he says that in effect all that is provided for in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Bill could be carried out under the present law. I cannot understand why the measure was introduced. If it is intended to adopt a system similar to that followed in Great Britain, I think that the proposal is ill-advised. Our conditions are utterly different from those which prevail in the mother country. We have only a small force, which could be controlled by one responsible officer. Under the proposal in the Bill it is intended to relieve the commanding officer of a great deal of the responsibility which should properly rest upon him. Then again it would be possible for the Minister to shelter himself behind the proposed Council of Defence. </para>

                            <para>- In all financial matters the Minister has a perfect right to interfere. He is, through Parliament, the representative of the people, and when I was Acting Minister of Defence, during the absence of the right honorable member for Swan in England, I insisted upon exercising control over the commanding officer in all matters where the expenditure of money was involved. Upon two occasions - in connexion with the establishment of schools of instruction in Sydney and Melbourne - the General Officer Commanding persisted in proceeding contrary to my directions, and I had to stop supplies in order to compel submission to the authority in control of the finances. The proposed Council would scarcely be an advisory body ; it would have much greater powers. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. It seems to me that it is proposed to create very ponderous machinery for the control of a very small number of men. The Minister will probably tell us, as he has already told me privately, that it will be convenient to permit the Inspector-General to travel over the various States in order to see that defence matters are put in proper order whilst the Minister is sitting in Melbourne, and requires his frequent advice. The same result might be brought about, however, if the Inspector-General remained at Head-Quarters, and sent his principal staff officer to perform the work of inspection. I do not know what expenditure will be involved in connexion' with the proposed Council. No provision is made for the fees or salaries that are to be paid. </para>

                            <para>- I do not trunk there is. The fact that the late General Officer Commanding - able officer though he is - was frequently not in accord with the Ministerial head of the Defence Department, was responsible for a good deal of friction during the term of his appointment, and largely contributed to the state of affairs which exists to-day. In my opinion, this Bill constitutes ill-considered and ill-advised legislation. Then, I ask, why should the Naval Commandant be appointed to the Naval Board, while the Inspector-General is not appointed to ; the Military Board ? The Bill contemplates the constitution of two boards, and it seems to me that if the Naval Commandant is to be appointed to one body, the Inspector-General should occupy a seat upon the other. In my opinion, the principle which should be laid down in connexion with our Military Forces is that of direct responsibility to the Minister, and' through him, to this House. I feel that the Bill is a step in the wrong direction. The right honorable member for Swan has pointed out that the Minister of Defence has given no reason for his change of opinion. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad to hear that. It seems to me that he should be offered the position; but I think that the Government would be acting more wisely if they appointed him General Officer Commanding. If they did so, I am convinced that there would be very little friction between the military and the civil side of the Defence Department during the next three years, and that there would be no occasion whatever to pass a Bill of this character. In my judgment, the measure is a retrograde movement, and is a piece of legislation which may require to be repealed in three or four years' time. </para>

                            <para>- About twelve months. During that period, I took a very live and real interest in that Department. In my opinion the events which have recently occurred in Great Britain more than justify the action that is now proposed. The feeling pervading the whole British Empire is that it should possess a force which should be purely of a defensive character, and not for purposes of aggression. We must endeavour to educate our citizens up to an appreciation of their duty in this respect, and consequently must free ourselves from that military domination from which we have suffered so severely. The very strongest possible censure upon the very able officer who has just left our shores was uttered by' the honorable member for Hume, who insinuated that if Brigadier-General Finn had filled the position of General Officer Commanding during the past three years there would have been no. necessity for this Bill. No more sweeping condemnation of Major-General Hutton could have been uttered by anybody, lt shows plainly enough that a man possessed of a strong personality in the position of General Officer Commanding can engender intense friction. We have great cause to feel thankful that we have at the civil head of the . Defence Department a gentleman who has so strong a desire to- serve the Commonwealth. In my opinion, the Secretary of Defence has rendered yeoman service to his country by the magnificent manner in which he has resisted all the attempts to place that Department in a position independent of this House, and of the country - a position which it should not occupy. I expressed that view very early in the history of the Commonwealth, when honorable members were not as conversant as they are now with the splendid work which Captain Collins has done in Victoria. The right honorable member for Swan declares that this Bill is unnecessary, and I join issue with him at once. I say, from my own personal knowledge, and it is patent to anybody who cares to inquire into the matter, and who has a due appreciation of the importance of the subject, that we must alter the system which has been in force during the past three years. The right honorable gentleman affirms that we could appoint a General Officer Commanding, and impose upon him the duties of Inspector-General. But why, I ask, is there any desire .to retain' the title of General Officer Commanding? Merely to make it appear that the gentleman who occupies the position has a power which, under this Bill, he will not possess. I believe that the mistakes made by Major-General Hutton were due to his inability to understand the sentiments of Australians. He was absolutely out of touch with our aspirations. Having regard to the terms upon which he was appointed, and the magnificent opportunity afforded him to add the coping-stone to a life of brilliant service to his country, I say - as a strong Imperialist - that we were entitled to more consideration at his hands than we received.' The right honorable member for Swan asks - "What is in a name?" I quite agree with him. In this Bill, we should clearly set out our intentions. I admit that Major-General Hutton has instilled into our Forces an amount of discipline to which they were previously strangers, and I am very glad that we have as Ministerial head of the Defence Department a gentleman who possesses an intimate acquaintance with defence matters. I believe that we have at last reached a solution of our present difficulties. We need, however, to foster and develop a truly national sentiment. Although I agree with the honorable member for Hume, that the gentleman indicated by the Minister ns likely to be selected for this high and responsible position will do his best in that direction, the fact remains that we shall not always have his services. The time will come when his place will be taken by another, who may perhaps make the disastrous mistakes which were committed by the officer who has just left our shores. In my opinion, the Minister has done well. During his brief term of office, he has acquired a better knowledge of this subject than he had before, and I feel sure that nothing but the results of his investigation have prompted him to propose this change in system. He is entitled to every credit for the position <inline font-style="italic">\\i</inline> has taken up. </para>

                            <para>- I am not surprised that the right honorable member for Swan should object, because that is a trait of the party with which he has been so long and honorably connected; but I am certainly surprised that the honorable member for Hume should have offered the same objection to this material advance in the administration of the Department. I believe that the Department can be properly administered only when its civil branch is placed in capable hands, and due prominence is given to that part of our defence system. I should have" liked to speak at greater length on this subject, but I am verv anxious that the Bill should be passed; into law, and, as time is valuable, I recognise that I must necessarily curtail my remarks. </para>

                        <para>- When the right honorable member for Swan, as Minister of Defence, introduced the first Defence Bill to the House, I made the suggestion that it should embody the principle of a Council of Defence somewhat analogous to that which existed in the Defence Act of Victoria. I believe that I was the first to make that suggestion in the House, and I remember that it received but scant support. The honorable and learned member for Corio was the only member who supported the proposition. </para>

                            <para>- I congratulate the House upon the change which has come o'er the spirit of our dream. It is a change in harmony with the principle which has existed in the Victorian Act, and which I understand worked well. The principle received the hearty support of the Victorian Military Defence authorities, and the late Lieut. -Col. Sargood was one of its strongest advocates. I had the honour of several conversations with him upon the subject, and from him I received strong inspiration in favour of a Council of Defence being provided for in the first Defence Bill. I have no doubt that this change in the sentiment and the opinion of the House is due - as the honorable member for Laanecoorie has somewhat delicately hinted - to the very extraordinary military administration under which Australia suffered while our forces were under the command of the military officer who has just left our shores. Of absent men, perhaps the least said the better, but I can ascribe the great change which has occurred in the opinions of honorable members only to the manner in which our military laws were administered under the recent <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline> I strongly and heartily approve of the main outlines of the scheme which has been presented by the Minister. I approve, first of all, of the </para>

                            <para>- That is perfectly true. I would not, for one moment, suggest that it should be abrogated. The only criticism which I have to offer on the whole scheme is directed not to the essence of the Military Board, but merely to its composition. The Board should undoubtedly be composed of the most prominent military officers available, and, that being so, I cannot understand why so important an officer as the Inspector-General should be excluded from its deliberations. </para>

                            <para>- As at present advised, I think it would be a great mistake to provide that the Board shall merely be advisory to the Minister. I wish to know why the Inspector-General is to be excluded from it? <inline font-style="italic">Prima facie</inline> he is to be a military officer. The very best military officer we can obtain in Australia is to occupy the post of Inspector-General, which is only another name for that of General Officer Commanding, and no doubt the functions exercised by him will be analogous to those of a General Officer Commanding.

                    <para class="block">If we have so important an officer occupying this position, why should he be excluded from the Military Board? Even assuming that it is not to have supreme power - that it is to be only a board of advice - why should he not have a right to take part in its deliberations ? He might be brought into military contact with the board, and his advice and his information might be accepted and rendered available. It is said that because the Inspector-General, in England is excluded from, the Military Board, the same course should be followed in Australia. There is a great difference (between the positions and the functions of the two boards. In England there may be an abundance of military talent apart from the Inspector-General to advise the Board, but here there is a limit to it. On this point I wish to read an extract from a letter which has been received in Australia from a very distinguished officer, who was immediately associated with the Imperial scheme, and whose identity may be conjectured by honorable members. I should like to lay great Stress upon the following passage, which although it is merely an expression of opinion, is worthy of special attention : - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Hume has shown that for once he is in accord with the right honorable member for Swan, and I also am surprised to find myself for once holding views in harmony with those of the honorable member. I condemn the proposal to hand over the control of the Department to a Council of Defence. I have previously expressed the opinion that Parliament should retain control, through its responsible Minister, of the Department, as affording the best check against the very evil which those who support the Bill think it will prevent. I see no reason why we should place the administration of our defence system in the hands of a Council any more than we should hand over the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department to a like body. ' It may be argued that we may have Ministers of Defence who are not familiar with the work which the administration of the Defence Act involves; but it might also be said that, from time to time, we shall have Postmasters-General who could not be expected to be acquainted with all the details of the Postal Department. No one can say that the present Postmaster-General is a first-class electrician, and his knowledge of many other branches of his Department may also be deficient. But the honorable gentleman, and those who have preceded him, have succeeded in administering the Department, with its immense expenditure and its army of retainers, without any special knowledge. They have had to -rely on their ordinary business ability, and to avail themselves of the advice of their responsible officers. We certainly ought to retain control, through the Minister, of the Defence Department. I admit with sorrow the statement made by the honorable member for Laanecoorie, that our first experience of the system of having a General Officer Commanding was not satisfactory. But this was not because of any particular fault on the part of the gentleman who occupied that position. He is a renowned soldier of very great ability, but, as has been pointed out, he was lamentably out of touch with Australian sentiment. I have been surprised at the silence which has been maintained by honorable members regarding the great want of sympathy which the late General Officer Commanding displayed with Australian sentiment in the matter of defence ; but I do not think we should rid ourselves of the difficulty by adopting the proposal made in this Bill. To my mind, the new presbyter would be old priest writ large. With a Council of Defence we shall have to contend with greater difficulties than we have had, or would be likely to have again, with a General Officer Commanding. Whatever the Minister may say, such a Council would be, to a very great extent, a barrier between, if not him, at least some of his successors, and the Parliament. When honorable members complained of certain acts of administration, the Minister would be able to say that he had been strongly recommended by the majority, or the whole, of the Council, to adopt the course to which exception was taken, and that he did not see his way clear to go beyond it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member is nearer the first than the second. He cannot, however, expect the rest of us, who have expressed opposition to his proposals, to change our minds for no better reasons than he has given. He and others have said that a defence of these proposals is contained in the Bill, but it is not a sufficient defence. The clause creating the Council of Defence, for instance, should be much more explicit. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has pointed out that the Inspector-General is not to be a member of the Council. </para>

                            <para>- I did not understand that. The mistake emphasizes my complaint that the Minister has not put his case before us with sufficient clearness. The Bill itself should expressly state how many and what military and naval officers are to be members of the boards and council; and how many civil members there are to be. The measure is wanting in many details, and the Minister has not made up for its shortcomings by a statement sufficiently full to enable us to thoroughly understand it. Honorable members who support the measure have argued in favour of what they term the civil control of our defence system. I do not think we can obtain civil control more perfectly than 'by having a General Officer Commanding, subject to such limitations as we may see fit to impose, and a Ministerial head responsible to this House for the policy adopted, and the manner of administration. I regard the introduction of the Bill as a retrograde step, because I think that it will to some extent lessen the civil control of our defence system, and the responsibility to Parliament of those intrusted with the administration of the </para>

                        <para>- From the first I have been rather favourably disposed towards the appointment of a Council of Defence, and I have no great fault to find with the machinery provided in this Bill. There are certain parts of it, as I said the other night, such as those relating to the position of the Inspector-General, which might be altered ; but that, of course, is a matter for the Committee. I have, however, a good deal of sympathy with the view of the right honorable member for Swan, that it would be well not to proceed - too hastily in this matter. We know that there is gradually growing up in this country a feeling against bringing men, however able, from the old country to command our troops, because it is thought that we should begin to train our own officers for such positions. Some honorable members seem to hesitate about mentioning this fact, but I do not know why it should not be referred to openly. It was evidently recognised by the late General Officer Commanding, because, speaking in Sydney a few days before his departure, he said - </para>

                            <para>- That may be his opinion, but it need not be ours. He has, however, recognised the sentiment to which I have referred, which culminated in friction between him and the Minister. It seems to me that we might very well experiment with the present system a little longer under the new General Officer Commanding whom the Minister has in his mind, because I believe that Brigadier-General Finn is likely to get on well with the Australian troops, and before his term of office expires, we may have been able to adopt the system suggested by the Minister, of sending men to be trained where there are the best opportunities ' foi acquiring knowledge. I think that a good deal of the friction which has occurred has been due, not to the regulations; or methods of administration, but to the desire to which I have referred, to have an Australian at the head of the Australian troops, and if opportunities are given for the training of our own officers we may ultimately not find the proposed drastic change necessary. The Bill says that the General Officer Commanding and the Naval Officer Commanding shall have such powers as the Governor-General may direct. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, that it would be well for the Inspector-General to have a seat on the Military Board, of which I approve, though I do not see the reason for the Council. There seems no need for a buffer between the Military Board and the Naval Board, and the Cabinet. It is like employing too many cooks. I think that the Military Board and the Naval Board ought to report directly to the Minister, the civil authority who is supposed to have most information on the subject. I have risen chiefly to support the light honorable member for Swan, the honorable member for Hume, and others, who have expressed the view ; that we might defer this change for a little time, experimenting further with the existing system under a new Commandant, and, in the meanwhile endeavouring to train officers of our own for the command. I feel that I can not, under present circumstances, support the Bill, though I take no great exception to its machinery. </para>

                        <para>- I acknowledge that I am a convert to the proposal of the Minister to create a Council of Defence. Having read the reports of the English method, I am satisfied that what is good enough for the old country is the plan that we should adopt, especially as we have a defence force only, and not an army of offence. All that we wish to do is to defend our hearths and homes. We have no desire to send our soldiers outside Australia. I cannot understand, however, why the Naval Commandant should have a seat on the Council, while the Inspector-General has not. </para>

                            <para>- That is all we really want. I am under the impression that the whole of our Defence Forces are in a state of chaos. I know that that is the case in Queensland, where greater dissatisfaction now exists than ever before. I do not wish to say any hard things about the late General Officer Commanding, but, in Queensland, officers and men alike agree that he was the most overbearing, Imperialistic man they ever met. He fairly struck terror into the hearts of the officers, and I feel sure that the honorable member for Laanecoorie struck the right nail on the head when he said that he was not in sympathy with Australian sentiment. We do not want to maintain a large army upon Imperial lines, but to have a citizen soldiery for purely defence purposes. In Tasmania, the utmost confusion exists in connexion with Defence matters. There are more officers than privates in the Forces there today. The Tasmanian officers and men who went to South Africa came out of the war with flying colours, and there is no reason why the Tasmanian Forces should not be put upon a thoroughly sound and effective footing. The honorable member for Grampians referred to the statement of the late General. Officer Commanding, to the effect that there was no officer in Australia fit to take command of the Forces here. That does not bear very high testimony to the efficiency of the officers whom we have obtained from the old country. They have been here for years instructing our Forces, and we have spent millions of money upon dur defences, and yet we are told that we have not any officers who are capable of assuming command. I am very favorably impressed with the proposal for the interchange of officers. I think that is the best of the' ideas put forward by the Minister. Military science is a progressive one, and unless we send abroad for information we cannot possibly keep up-to-date. I trust that we shall make liberal arrangements for the exchange of officers with the Imperial Army at home, in India, and elsewhere. If this be done, it will contribute as much as. anything to bring our Forces up-to-date and render them efficient. I desire to place before the Committee a few suggestions which have mainly been furnished by an officer of our Forces, of whom I have a high opinion. My ideas coincide, to a very large degree, with those expressed in the memorandum, which reads as follows : - </para>

A Garrison Artillery, armed with guns equal to any that can be brought to bear against them from the sea; for, if outranged, they are silenced. 3rd. As perfect a system of submarine mining as is possible to prevent a fleet which may have passed the Navy and Garrison Artillery from anchoring or landing troops. </para>

                    <para>When I was at the battle of Ingogo, in South Africa, the whole of the officers attached to the battery with which I was connected were killed or wounded, and all the gunners, except myself, were placed <inline font-style="italic">hors</inline><inline font-style="italic">de combat.</inline> Some of the members of the Rifle Brigade were called upon to assist me, but they had no knowledge of big-gun drill, and the consequence was that the whole of the training of the guns, the sponging, loading, and firing was left in my hands. I had to do the best 1 could, and I did it with effect and saved the whole position. That is why I say that men should be drilled in the use of field-guns, and if not required as artillerymen utilized as riflemen. At the battle of Ulundi, when the men belonging to my battery were not required as artillerymen, Lord Chelmsford mounted them upon the artillery horses, and used them as cavalry in turning the enemy's flank.

I now propose to read what I said upon the question of the appointment of a Council of Defence, and I venture to think that when I have done so, honorable members will say that wherever I criticised the scheme proposed by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, it was because it did not accomplish what the present scheme will accomplish.

                        <para>I hope the honorable member for Melbourne Ports will not press his amendment. I think that I may .fairly say that during the course of this debate I have not displayed any great subservience to military authority, or any great advocacy of the absolutism of that authority. I think a Board such as the honorable member suggested, would be entirely unworkable, in view of the large area of the Commonwealth and its scattered population. There is no parallel between the Council of Defence in England and the Council which it is now proposed to constitute. The English Council is really a semi-political body, which is intended to harmonize the" relations between the political and the military administrations upon all important matters of policy. </para>

                        <para>One can understand the desirableness of such a Board, in view of the conflict that has existed between the financial and the executive branches of the administration. The proposal of the honorable member is modelled upon the Council of Defence which existed in Victoria up to the time of the establishment of Federation, and the wording of the new clause is practically the same as that of the section of the Victorian Act. The Victorian Council of Defence at times did great service; but, as a matter of fact, every member of that Council for many years past was a resident .of Me. bourne, and it was very easy to call a meeting of that body. </para>

                        <para>Very often valuable suggestions were offered by the junior members of the Board, which proved of service' to the administration, but during the term of one officer as Commandant, the Council of Defence simply served as a battlefield for the struggle which was waged between the Minister of Defence and the Commandant. Unfortunately, the Council never possessed the power that it purported to exercise, because the Minister on the political, and the Commandant on the administrative side, exercised the real control. </para>

In the meantime, I think we may well adopt the suggestion of the Minister. However strongly we may feel that a Council of Defence is desirable, we are not in a position to say how it would work or the best form which it should take. Personally, I do not see how it could exercise effective control unless all the members composing it were established at the Seat of Government while they retained their positions upon the Board. </para>

                    <para>I venture to say that in those remarks there is not a single word which does not absolutely confirm the position which I take up to-day. So far from contradicting my present attitude, the speech which I made more than a year ago - at a time when I never anticipated that I should be submitting this Bill to-day - absolutely indorses the views which I still entertain. Whether the proposals contained in this measure be good or bad, honorable members must recognise that I have no contradictory attitude to explain away. </para>

                            <para>- The Executive would no doubt be able to appoint an officer to command the Forces of the Commonwealth, but it would not, I think, have power to vest in him the powers given by the Act to the General Officer Commanding. . From time to time the Forces of the different States may be brought together to take part in a review or for military exercise, and I think it would be well to give the Inspector-General the power to command the whole Forces on such occasions. If there were a meeting of troops in Victoria, and troops from Queensland and New South Wales took part in it, there might be some friction as to who was to command. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir JOHN</inline>QUICK (Bendigo). - I accept the assurance of the Minister that he will consider the point I have raised; but I apprehend that, in passing this Bill, we should take care to provide for a fairly complete and workable scheme. The Government should not seek to get rid of any point that is raised, merely by saying that the matter will be provided for by an executive act. It does not do to depend too largely upon executive acts, and I am not sure that the suggestion I have made could be carried out in such a manner. By the Constitution the Command-in-Chief of our Forces is vested in the Governor-General, and it may be that by executive acts he may delegate his power to any particular officer. But it would require legislation to enable the Governor-General to be represented on the field by an officer occupying the position of Commander-in-Chief. The Defence Act, as it stands, provides for the office of General Officer Commanding. That I apprehend means not a mere Inspector-General fulfilling certain functions, but a General Officer Commanding to represent the command in chief of the Governor-General. It is proposed now to repeal that provision. I do not see any necessity to do so. It is necessary to create the two new offices for which the Bill provides, but I know no reason for obliterating the connecting-link between the Governor-General and the General Officer Commanding; I decline to recognise that the Executive have the power to create this office, and say that it ought to <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> founded on an.

                            <para>- My point is that the Inspector-General would have no executive authority enabling him in such a case to at once give instructions regarding any matter that required attention. He could only make a report on his return to head-quarters. The proposed system may work well in England, where it is possible to travel from one end of the country to the other in a day, but in a vast continent like Australia we need an Inspector-General with executive authority. </para>

The inconsistency o.f the attitude taken up by the Minister is shown by, the fact that he proposes that the Director! of the Naval Forces shall be a member of the Naval Board, because he will not have much to do. If the principle is to be introduced in the one case, why should it not be observed in the other? If there is no place for the Inspector-General on the Military Board, there should be no place for the Naval Director on the Naval Board. </para>

                    <para>The difficulty about a board in Australia is, as you say, to find the members. Here, under our scheme, every member administers a very large Department - quite enough for one man - and millions of money. With us, I thought it essential that the Inspector-General should be. outside, and controlled by the Council. If you have a good Inspector-General, you rather require his presence and advice upon the board. On the other hand, he ought to be constantly away from head-quarters if he is to do his work properly. He ought also to become a General Officer Commanding in war only, and when the State Forces are brought together for a common purpose. In peace time, he must, I think, in addition to inspecting, supervise training and staff duties, which I propose he should do. On the whole, I think the balance of advantage is in making the Inspector-General a member of the board - </para>
                    <para>That is not a very emphatic declaration - which need not often meet as a board, since questions of general policy cannot often arise, but will transact its business as a board.. </para>

                            <para>- No. The Inspector-General will be too good a man to be engaged with routine administration. No one man can administer, inspect, and carry cn executive command and training. Australia' is too big for that; and extent of territory is quite as great a factor in this matter as the number of troops to be controlled. The General Officer Commanding pointed out in his last report that, owing to the demands on his time made by his administrative duties, he was unable to carry out his inspecting duties. The right honorable member for Swan must have found - as I have found since - that the General Officer Commanding was often away inspecting when he was required 'in reference to matters of administration. The individuals carrying on administrative work must be separated from the individuals carrying on inspecting and executive work, if both classes of duty are to be properly performed. I wish to take full advantage of the knowledge of the Inspector-General by putting him on the Council, and I do not wish him to be prevented from doing his essential work - seeing that the Forces have been properly trained - by keeping him in an office transacting administrative duties. If the Inspector-General were given a position on the board, which is an administrative board, what administrative duties would be assigned to him - because a member of an administrative board without administrative duties would be in an extraordinary position? If he were on the board to control it, he would be in the position of a General Officer Commanding having a Board of Advice, and one of two things would happen; he would dominate the Board, or the Board would dominate him. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest.  -  The Minister would be there. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister should not be made an arbiter between the Board and his General Officer Commanding. Besides being a member of the State Legislature, I occupied a position in the State forces at the time, and this made me fully cognizant of the fact that under the Victorian system the Minister sometimes had to resolve the battles between the Commandant and the Council, while sometimes the Council had to try to resolve the battles between the Minister and the Commandant, owing to the in distinctness of the lines which divided their duties. The work of inspection is quite enough for a good man, while others will be told off for the work of administration, and within their own districts the Slate Commandants will be the: executive officers. The system which we now propose is in force in every country of importance, and has been satisfactorily carried out in England in regard to the Admiralty for two centuries, so that every precedent is in our favour. It cannot be said that British experience in any of the wars of the last century has proved the value of the General Officer Commanding system. If <inline font-style="italic">thi</inline> Inspector-General were placed on the Board <inline font-style="italic">ex officio,</inline> he would either dominate it or be dominated by it, and would, moreover, be reporting to himself. In reporting after an inspection, he would say, " So and so is going wrong," and then, as a member of .the Board, would take his own report, and say, "This must be remedied in the way I suggest, or things will not go on properly," so that we should get back to the General Officer Commanding system again. </para>

The Minister will be a member both of the Board and of the Council. If the Board did not do what the Inspector-General thought should be done, he could bring the matter before the Council. </para>

                            <para>- They may ask him to come, but they cannot send for him, because he is not under their administration. He is no more subject to the Board than the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth is subject to the Departments whose accounts he audits. The Government may be wrong in the view which they hold in regard to this matter, and the rest of the world may be wrong in having adopted this system ; but it is essential to our proposition that the Inspector-General shall have nothing to do with actual administrative work, which is left to the Board. I ask the right honorable member to give us an opportunity to see how the system will work. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it is quite possible that I do not grasp the point which the Minister is trying to impress upon honorable members. It still appears to me that no man with any self-respect would put himself in such a position as that contemplated in regard to the Board. The Inspector-General will have to report to the Board, which will be constituted of men inferior to himself in rank and qualifications. His report must be dealt with in one way or the other by. the Board. If it be accepted, well and good, but if not, the Inspector-General will in effect be corrected by his inferiors. </para>

The latter officer has a statutory appointment, protected specially by Parliament, and has also the right of report direct to Parliament in the event of his decisions not being heeded, whereas the Inspector-General will have no such privileges. The recommendations of the Inspector-General may be treated as the Board may think fit. </para>

As he probably knows, no honorable member of this House is more in sympathy than I am with the object he desires to achieve. My career shows that I have consistently supported the views which the honorable member holds' on the liquor question. This matter came before Parliament last year, and I then said, as a private member, what I now desire to repeat, namely, that it would be an unwise step to take in the interests of sobriety. </para>

                            <para>- I would ask the honorable member for Lang not to press his proposal. I can assure him that as the result of long experience and intimate knowledge, I feel convinced that the effect will be to substitute unlicensed and unchecked drinking for drinking under strict control. I shall make sure that the canteen regulations are so stringent as to ensure proper control. Where men have only to go outside the barrack gates or beyond the bounds of a camp in order to get as much liquor as they like, it is better that they should be permitted to obtain drink from canteens under proper control. If the canteens were abolished, the men would be induced to smuggle liquor into their quarters, and sobriety would certainly not be promoted. I think that a grave mistake would be made if the proposed new clause were adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the honorable member for Lang will press his proposal. The Minister's argument is tantamount to saying that because I do not permit intoxicants to be consumed in my 'house, I am encouraging my children in habits of in sobriety. It is exceedingly unfortunate that this proposal should be discussed upon Friday afternoon, when many honorable members are absent. There is no doubt in my mind that had it been brought forward upon any other day it would have been carried. I do not intend to throw any obstacles in the way of getting this admirable Bill through Committee, but I must express regret that men who are in sympathy with me upon this great question entertain the same view as that expressed by the Minister. I trust that this question will not be made a Government one, because I hope to secure the support of the honorable member for Dalley. I know that he is loyal to the Government and to the Minister of Defence, but I am sure that he is more loyal to. his principles, and that he recognises that where there is drink there is danger. I hold that the greater the facilities which are offered for drinking the greater is the danger. May I express regret that you, sir, are in the chair at this particular juncture, because I am aware that you can speak from the stand-point, not only of a military man. but of a duly qualified medical practitioner. I do not propose to delay the Committee, but I intend to press this matter to a" division. </para>

The Victoria Barracks,, Paddington, are located in my own constituency. In those barracks the canteen business is run vary much upon the lines of the Gothenburg system. All the profits derived from the sale of liquor are invested in comforts for the men - in reading matter, &amp;c. Thus the temperate thirst requirements of the troops are cared for, the profits accruing from the traffic being devoted to their material and mental comfort. </para>

                            <para>- I do not suggest that these hotels cater for the Royal Australian Artillery. I know that they do not. In fact there is no more sober body in Australia than the Royal Australian Artillery. Its members are not thirsty men. They are content to satisfy their temperate requirements in the barracks with the best liquor that is procurable. If they are obliged to go outside the barracks they will resort to an atmosphere which is not nearly so. good, from a moral stand-point, as that which obtains inside. They will consume worse drink; and in so doing will also be spending their money in assisting to, swell the profits of the publican. That being the case, we should not think of adopting the proposal under consideration. It is premature in the extreme. </para>

                            <para>- During the interval for adjournment I had an opportunity to discuss this matter with Brigadier-General Finn., and consequently I have been enabled to reap the advantage of his thirty five years of military experience. I have also looked into the regulations, as they stand at present, and I may tell honorable members that I am willing that those regulations shall provide, in the first place, that the liquor consumed in the canteens shall be the property of the corps for whose benefit they are established, and that its supply shall not be farmed out to contractors. That will be equivalent to Government control. </para>

                            <para>- It has been done scores of times. In my own regiment I have put it into operation half-a-dozen times without experiencing any difficulty whatever. I am further prepared to provide that there shall be no sales of liquor except to those for whose benefit the canteens are established. In the third place, I am willing to see that boys and cadets are absolutely prohibited from obtaining liquor at canteens. The canteen sergeants will prevent them from entering these places. I will undertake to see that the regulations for all troops are so framed as to insure the carrying out of these conditions. Having made that offer to honorable members, I think they may reasonably accept it as one which goes a very long way in the direction which they desire, without causing the disadvantages which I fear will accompany the absolute prohibition of liquor in military camps. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the abolition of the canteens in military camps and barracks is a reform which might very reasonably be tried. From personal experience in England, I can say that the results which flow from the canteen system both in camps and barracks, are anything but favorable. I was present in camp at Aldershot and Dover, and I know that the canteen was not a. good thing for the members of those camps. We are also aware that the opinion of Lord Roberts is opposed to t'he canteen system. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. There are other eminent military authorities who are just as emphatic upon the question. Their opinion is that the canteen is not a good institution for the soldiers, and certainly it is not a good one for the officers. Under these circumstances, I think that very stringent regulations should be framed in regard to the use of the canteen in military camps. I regard the offer of the Minister as a very fair one, but I should like to know how others, entertaining similar views to myself feel in regard to the matter: before consenting to give way. We should certainly control the liquor traffic in camps or barracks very strictly indeed if we are to prevent possible abuses. </para>

I think that he has suggested a course which will commend itself to everybody who is interested in the welfare of those who live in barracks or in camp.

                            <para>- My experience at Woolwich and Aldershot leads me to differ entirely from the conclusions drawn by the honorable member. It is that nearly all, the crime committed by men in barracks, had been the result of obtaining drink within those barracks. Out of the thousands of troops stationed at Aldershot and Woolwich the percentage of those who get drunk outside is very small indeed. At Woolwich and Aldershot Saturday was usually pay day, and every Sunday morning the guard-room was full of men charged with drunkenness and other offences, due to the drink they had obtained at the canteen, although it closed at 9 p.m. </para>

                            <para>-Nocomplaint could be made on that score, for the spirits were sold as supplied to the canteen. According to the honorable member for Wentworth,! the Federal Government have no control over hotels. Let me tell him that in every garrison town in Great Britain certain hotels are placed out of bounds, and God help the soldier who is found in any one of them. If the Federal authorities thought fit, they might declare twenty, thirty, or forty hotels in the vicinity of the barracks out of bounds, and any soldier found in them would be liable, not only to imprisonment, but, if he had a good conduct badge, to a deduction of one penny per day. I think the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the position; I certainly am satisfied with his proposal in regard to the supply of drink at camps and cantonments in different parts of the States. Last Easter twelve months I saw several boys lying about one of the camps in a drunken state, and made up my mind to do my best to render it impossible for strong drink to be supplied at such places. The Minister has told us that the supply of drink to cadets and civilians will be strictly forbidden, and that should remove the difficulty. We certainly ought to give the Minister's proposal a trial. </para>

I wish to have the Bill sent on to the Senate without delay, so that I may set to work to put the new scheme in operation as soon as possible.

                        <para>- I feel that I shall not unduly occupy the time of honorable members by offering some criticism on the third reading of this Bill. The House has resolved to accept a scheme which was decided upon by the last two Ministers of Defence, and adopted by the present administrator of the Department, so that even if I had spoken on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, it is improbable that I should have been able to influence its decision. What I shall have to say will be by way of protest, and largely in the nature of a prophecy. I am afraid that there is an ultimate danger in connexion with this Bill, and the criticism which I offer may receive the attention of another place, or of this House at some future time, when we find that the measure has not realized the anticipations of those responsible for its introduction. I recognise that the Minister is only performing a patriotic duty ; that he has done everything within his power to bring the Defence Forces into the best possible condition ; but I regret that the Bill passed through the Committee stage as quickly as it did. The Minister really made a second-reading speech, explaining the proposals of the Government, when the Defence Estimates were before us, and in consequence the remarks made by him this morning, in moving that the Bill be read a second time, were somewhat curtailed. When I arrived, I found that the motion had been agreed to, and that such good progress had been made in Committee that the proposed new clause, moved by the honorable member for Lang, was under consideration. In these circumstances, I feel that it is my duty to avail myself of this opportunity to put my views before the Minister, who I believe will give consideration to them, knowing that I have always taken a deep interest in defence matters, and have made them the subject of careful study. When the Defence Bill of 1903 was before us, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports moved an amendment providing for a Council of Defence, under which the office of Commander-in-Chief was to be continued. I gave that proposal my support, but the present Minister of Defence opposed it. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It is for that reason that I feel that, although I supported the proposal put forward by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports for a Council of Defence, I cannot be charged with inconsistency in offering some opposition to the measure now before us. We have three lines of defence, but our Army still remains under our own control. The value of the Army depends first, on its fighting capacity, and secondly, upon its administrative organization. The Minister has attempted to supply the second essential to an army's success by introducing this measure, providing for a Council of Defence - of which the Inspector-General, the Chief of. Staff, and other officers will be members - and also for a Naval Board and a Military Board. I understand that the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Swan to provide that the Inspector-General should be a member of the Military Board was withdrawn, and I certainly agree with the Minister that we require to have an independent critic outside the Board, and certainly one who will not be called upon to criticise his own work. The difficulty which arises in regard to this Bill is one that has occurred in connexion with the forces of all the States. That is, a constant fight between the General Officer Commanding and the permanent head of the Department. We who have had experience of the. military forces in Victoria know that that difficulty, has existed in this State, and that the permanent head - that is, the Secretary of Defence - having the ear of the Minister, has usually been able to succeed. Now the struggle is to be shifted to a new set of combatants. We shall not only have the Inspector-General fighting for his own hand, and his own priority, but we shall have the Chief of the Staff and the permanent head doing the same. The Chief of. Staff will have this great advantage over the Inspector-General, that he will be not only a member of the Council of Defence, but also of the. Military Board, the natural consequence being that he will have two opportunities of getting his way, whereas the Inspector-General will have only one. The reason why, in 1903, I supported the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports was that, under his scheme, we should' continue to have a Commander-in-Chief. The Minister could still have a Chief of Staff and an Inspector-General, in addition. Under whatever scheme we may adopt, there must be one man who will have the final word to say. In an autocratic body like an army there must be a head man, one supreme control. Otherwise the whole organization breaks down. If there is an organized body in the world, which is essentially autocratic in its character, it is an army. Therefore, I think that, as this scheme develops itself, we shall come back more or less to the old system, and that there will be some person - whatever we choose to call him - who will develop into a Commander-in-Chief, and virtually take the position which the Commander-in-Chief occupies at the present time. Of course, in framing this scheme, the Minister is looking largely to what has been done in England, in consequence of the reorganization of the Army, consequent upon the South African 'war. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> S. Amery is the author of a book' upon the subject, <inline font-style="italic">The Problem of the Army,</inline> which will be found in the Library. He sketched out the lines on which, afterwards, the Military Board in England was appointed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> . Sydenham Clarke was, with Lord Esher and Admiral -Fisher, made a member of that board. Upon this new system, the War Office is to be con ducted in the future. But there are difficulties in connexion with the administration of the Army in England, that do not prevail in Australia. In England, there are five 'different authorities, whose transactions may lead the country into war. In Australia we have no such difficulty. Here our Army is small, and the area of possible combat is extremely limited, as compared with the enormous area over which the English War Office has to extend its authority. </para>

                            <para>- They can exercise powers which may lead the country into war, but, of course, only the Crown can declare war. The five authorities are the War Office, the Admiralty, the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, and the India Office. Any one of these authorities might bring about a state of war. But. a far different condition of things exists in Australia. Here, if a mistake were made in our military affairs, it would not be so disastrous. But I think that we may be going upon wrong lines in abolishing the office of Commander-in-Chief, for several reasons, which I shall give. I may direct the attention of the Minister to an article written by the Honorable j. W. Fortescue, which is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century.</inline></para>

                        <para>As the War Office itself, past experience seems to indicate pretty clearly the broad lines upon which reform should proceed. People talk vaguely of a Board, and point to the Admiralty, merely adding the words <inline font-style="italic">mutatis mutandis.</inline> But <inline font-style="italic">mutatis mutandis</inline> is in this case a large order ; the army is not the navy ; and a Board of to-morrow's creation must be a very different thing from an ancient body with the tradition of more than two centuries of imperious independence. First, then, is a Commander-in-Chief necessary to the army? History teaches most emphatically that he is. Whenever the army has been without such a Commander-in-Chief - whenever, that is, its military Government has been in the hands of other than a single military chief - its discipline has suffered severely ; and an army without discipline is naught. The present time is no exception. There are too many symptoms of the spread of slack discipline in the army at this moment, symptoms which a student of our military history can trace directly to the degradation of the Commander-- in-Chief's position, and to the encroachments upon his independence. We are reverting to the state of things to which the Duke of York, with infinite industry and labour, put an end a hundred years ago. </para>

                    <para>It has to be recognised that the system of controlling the British Army by means of a board, is no new experiment. It was being pursued in England about 120 years ago; but the Duke of York, the son of the reigning King, saw that the Arm v. needed to have the administration of one vigorous mind, and in consequence, the system was changed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fortescue</inline> goes on- to say - </para>

                        <para>A Commander-in-Chief, then, there must be ; but his title might, with advantage, be changed to that of Captain-General ; and he should be the effective head of the military government e the army, and nothing more. As the senior officer of the army, he should have a seat in the Secretary of State's Council, of which presently; but he should not be the sole military adviser of the Secretary of State. His duties should consist in the maintenance of discipline and instruction, of expending the moneys allotted to him by the Secretary of State for current services of the army ; and he should be responsible for keeping the army up to the strength fixed by the Cabinet for the maintenance of its military policy. </para>

                    <para>When the right honorable member for Swan was criticising the proposed new system the other day, he remarked that the Board proposed to be appointed was on similar lines to the Victorian Board of Railways Commissioners. But ' as a matter of practice, there is a supreme head of the Victorian railway system. Honorable members who know the Railways Commissioners Act, will remember that there are three Commissioners of whom one, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tait,</inline> is the superior officer, and the Chairman of the Board. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tait</inline> really has the governing voice in the direction of affairs. Although he has two colleagues, he is able, under the law, to override their decisions, and if that happens, all that they can do is to enter their protest in writing against what he proposes to do. In a large business concern like a railway system, just as in an autocratic organization like an army, there must be some one ruling and directing mind. That is what our army requires, and what the Victorian Railways have at the present time. This desire to have a board to control our Military Forces, rather than a Commander-in-Chief has, to a large extent, arisen in consequence of what occurred in South Africa. The revelations during that war were sufficient to make the English people come to the conclusion that it was necessary to have a change in the method of organization. Consequently, they reverted to the system which we see in operation in the Board of Admiralty. They thought that the Board of Admiralty afforded a type which should be followed in connexion with the administration of the army. But does the Minister of Defence propose that the members of his board shall be similarly placed? Is he aware that the members of the Board of Admiralty are officers on -half-pay, and that they do not wear uniform, because they are regarded, while they occupy such positions, as civilians? Surely there is a divergence from the Board of Admiralty type in the scheme before the House. </para>

Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir M.</inline> Culme Seymour wrote an article in a recent number of the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century,</inline> in which he shows that,, although the Admiralty Board nominally controls, the members are really under the First Lord of the Admiralty. That article contains the following: - </para>

                        <para>When, in December, 1868, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> became Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Childers,</inline> who had in a previous Administration been Junior Civil Lord of the Admiralty, was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, and knowing that he could not carry out <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone's</inline> economies with the Board, in January, 1869, procured an Order in Council which abolished the responsibility of the Board, and made the First Lord' solely responsible to the King and Parliament, and the Naval Lords responsible only to the First Lord for whatever work he allotted to them to carry out, and this system has been continued to the present day. The machinery of the Board was retained, in case the First Lord wished to call them together to ask for their advice, which he can take or not as he thinks fit ; but the Board, as a Board, are in no way directly responsible to the King and country. And the anomaly remains that, although they are appointed by Patent as Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral, they are prevented from doing so by the Order in Council referred to (January the 14th, 1869). </para>
                        <para class="block">Referring to the War Office, the article proceeds - </para>
                        <para>How the organization I have sketched (purposely, briefly, and without details), would suit the War Office, it is for those who are more conversant with military matters than I am to judge. Personally, I feel sure that a Board on the lines of the present Admiralty, would not answer; the reason the Admiralty is more or less satisfactory at present is not because a civilian is solely responsible for its conduct, but owing to its old traditions, the extreme loyalty that pervades the Navy, and the fact that the procedure is carried on on much the same lines as previous to 1869, when the Board, and not the First Lord, was responsible. If the War Office is to be reorganized on the model of the Admiralty, it must be as the Admiralty was previous to 1869. </para>
                        <para class="block">This and other articles are by experts of high rank in the Naval and Military Forces of Great Britain, and their opinions, deliberately given in the reviews, are worthy of consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> T. Lambert contributed to the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century</inline> a criticism of Lord Esher's note, which was the basis of the final proposals of the War Office, now followed in the Bill before us. In that article it is stated - </para>
                        <para>The equality of authority and of responsibility is absolute, and equal deference is required to be paid to all. It has been the custom, however, to give precedence to the Lords Commissioners, according to the order in which their names stand in the Patent, and the first name is invariably that of the Cabinet Minister who is to represent, the Cabinet at the Board, and the Board in the Cabinet. The position which he thus occupies as the representative of the Government makes the First Lord <inline font-style="italic">facileprinceps</inline> among his colleagues at the Board, and as, of course, their chairman. Under the Patent he cannot overrule, his colleagues, but, in the event of his differing from them, he has the Cabinet to fall back upon, and the decision of the Cabinet is, as in all matters, conclusive. </para>
                        <para class="block">It seems to me, therefore, that the First Lord of the Admiralty is the one man responsible, while the others are allotted only certain duties, for the performance of which they are answerable to him, and not to the Cabinet directly. It was admitted by the Minister of Defence, in reply, I believe, to the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, that there must be a Commander-in-Chief in time of war, although an effort is being made to divide other duties amongst members of the Board. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, I take it that that is the present intention of the Minister ; and to that I do not object. The Minister went even so far as to say that at the end of four years the Inspector-General would be capable of taking another command. When the Minister was speaking, the right honorable member for Swan interjected to the effect that unless the Inspector-General were an old man, he would not be content to finish his military career at the end of four years; and to this the Minister replied that the Inspector-General could go to some other work - that he did nor see why such an officer should not undertake a State command, when he could be no longer Inspector-General. That is where we see the great defect of the scheme. The Inspector-General is not to be responsible for executive commands, nor for the training of troops and yet he is to take charge of those troops in time of war. That seems to me to be a fatal mistake; .and experience will prove that such a scheme must break down in time of war. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill only provides a skeleton scheme, the details of which may be filled in afterwards; that is the Minister has said in effect, that the details need not be adhered to definitely. I want honorable members to see that if the Minister devises any other use for the Inspector-General, or any other way of abolishing the Commandership-in-Chief, his present proposal will have to be amended, and we shall then arrive at the one man who must be responsible. The scheme of having an Inspector-General who is to be changed every four years, will give rise to an extraordinary position. Throughout the debate there seems to have been a feeling that there is too much centralization in the Military Forces, but personally I think we should have more; and on this point I should like honorable members to listen to one or two figures. This might perhaps be thought a matter more for discussion on the Estimates, but I should like to lay the figures before the House, in order that it may be seen how many staffs we are maintaining. When Major-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton left the Commonwealth, we had a Commandant in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland. South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. We have now an Acting Commandant for the Commonwealth - that is, seven Commandants in Australia - four Assistant Adjutants-General, three Deputy Assistant Quartermasters-General, seven Deputy Assistant Adjutants-General, two senior clerks, and forty-one military clerks. In other words, we have in the Commonwealth seven Commandants at a cost of £7,100, four Assistant AdjutantsGeneral at a cost of .£2,425, three Deputy Assistant Quartermasters- General at a cost of £1,600, seven Deputy Assistant AdjutantsGeneral at a cost of ,£3,090, two senior clerks at a cost of .£635, and forty one military clerks at a cost of £6,666. We also have an Assistant Adjutant-General for Artillery, a Principal Medical Officer, an A.D.C., and a Secretary to the General Officer Commanding. The fact is that we need more, not less, centralization in connexion with the organization of the Military Forces. We. ought to abolish the States staffs. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, because one-half of the forty-three military clerks who. are employed in receiving, docketing, forwarding, and recommending things, are merely conduit pipes between the central office and the persons whose correspondence they deal with. Supposing that a sergeant in Queensland wishes to communicate with the Minister. The sergeant writes to his captain, the captain writes to the colonel of the regiment,, the colonel writes to the State Commandant's staff officer, the State Commandant writes to the Chief Staff Officer, the Chief Staff Officer then obtains the recommendation of the General Officer Commanding, and then it goes to the Minister. What the Minister does is to set in motion the same machinery, only by the reverse process. Every one of these persons has to note his minute and forward it, perhaps putting a recommendation on it. Eight or nine men are employed in sending the letter from the sergeant to the Minister, and eight or nine men are employed in sending the Minister's answer to the sergeant. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister will wait I shall answer his question. I would abolish the States staffs and work through Head-Quarters. In each State I would allow one man - who might be the senior man, and who would be available for functions, and so on - to have charge of the whole of a similar arm throughout the Commonwealth. Supposing, for example, that Colonel Price were in charge of the Australian Light Horse. If he were in Queensland he would have to deal with the whole of the Australian Light Horse for the Commonwealth. In the same way, I should have an officer in South Australia to look after the whole of the infantry for the Commonwealth, an officer in New South Wales to look after the whole of the artillery for the Commonwealth, and an officer in Tasmania to look after the whole of the military miners. By that method we should be able to abolish the whole of the States staffs. </para>

We need unification in our methods in Federal affairs. The only advantage which has been gained in this. Department has been the appointment of one Minister in .place of six </para>

It should be recognised that we have an Australian service and not six States services. I trust that the Minister will do his best to bring about that reform. The duty of the Chief of Staff, under this Bill, I consider, will be to prepare the schemes of defence and intelligence. The duty of a Commander-in-Chief in war is to possess a complete and detailed knowledge of the schemes of defence and intelligence, and the larger tactics, and to put them into execution. The Chief of Staff is the man who prepares the schemes of defence ; but under this Bill the Inspector-General, who will have nothing to do with the training of troops, and who will be a mere critic, like a company's inspecting auditor, will take charge in time of war. I do not think it is possible at any time to work a military force by means of a Committee. In connexion with the Russian and Japanese war, a proposal was lately made in Russia to create a second army, under General Gripenberg, while General Kuropatkin, the present Commandant, was to retain charge of the first army. But all the military experts in Europe pointed out that such a plan would only lead to disaster. They urged that it meant that two men would have control instead of one. That proposal is very much like the Minister's scheme of a Committee to guide and control the Defence Force. On the 28th September the London <inline font-style="italic">Standard</inline> published the following criticism of the proposal which had appeared in the Vienna <inline font-style="italic">Fremdenblatt : -</inline></para>

                        <para>Now that a second man has been co-ordinated with General Kuropatkin, the old military rule must be cited that two good leaders at the head of an army are worse than one inferior .leader. Largely as the present arrangement contributed towards bringing about the disasters of the past, the new one is likely to lead to nothing but new defeats. </para>

                    <para>The critics recognise that with apparently the Minister does not recognise, namely, that an army cannot be carried on by a Committee, that it must be in control of one man, who will be responsible ibr everything. The Minister said that, under his scheme, the Cabinet is- to finally control, and I noticed that the House approved of his remark. That really means  that the Minister is to finally control. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; there is no doubt that in these matters the Cabinet will take the opinion of the Minister of Defence. This really means that the Secretary of Defence, as the permanent head of the Defence Department, will control the forces in the future, as he has done in the past. I do not say that that control has not been to a certain extent beneficial. But there is no doubt that when a struggle arises between the Chief of Staff and the Permanent Head, and the Inspector-General, as to who is to control the forces, there will be a return to the present system. If the Minister, through the Cabinet, is to control, it means that the Secretary for Defence will have the largest, because the final, say. There is nothing more dangerous in an army than to have political control. It was only when Lincoln and the men in charge of the Civil Department at Washington ceased to try to control matters in connexion with military operations from which they were so far distant, that General Grant was able to succeed in his efforts against the secessionists. For that reason attempts have been made in the past to give the English Commander-in-Chief a place in the Cabinet. They do that on the Continent, where they are largely autocratic in their military ideas, and where there is generally a member of the Royal family who has acted as CommanderinChief.' The English Constitution and the Australian Constitutions, however, have found it difficult to graft an autocratic department on to a democratic system. In spite of the proposed new organization, the Minister of Defence will continue to control matters as he does now. I have tried to show that the Council of Defence will not fulfil the intentions of its author. To the extent that it endeavours to do the work which the Minister intends it to do, it will fail. As a council of control it will be a failure. If the Minister had followed the lines proposed in 1903, which he then so strongly opposed, and had provided only for a council of advice, he would have provided a useful body. I wish now to discuss the assumption of the Minister that it is necessary to import an Inspector of Ordnance from England. If we do import such an officer, he should be the best man obtainable. The London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> however, has described  the English Army as the most costly and the least efficient which the mind of man can conceive, and those of us who have had experience of the organization scheme recently put forward know that .we have done no good by bringing out English officers, and would have been better off had we depended on Australian soldiers to do Australian work. That has been finally admitted by the late General Officer Commanding, though the idea was at first repudiated by him. In a public speech made about a week before he left Australia, he said that he could see that Australian troops would be best led by Australian officers, 01 by officers in sympathy with Aus-' tralia. </para>

If young men know that the highest positions in the service will not be open to them, even though they may possess the ability requisite to efficiently discharge the duties pertaining to them, they will not adopt the military profession. We have trained some of the best medical men to be found anywhere in the world, men who when they went to South Africa showed that they knew as much about medical science as did the eminent surgeons from other parts of the Empire. Similarly we have trained our own Judges, who I think will be acknowledged to be good lawyers, and it seems to me a pity that we do not give Australians an opportunity to show what they could do in military matters. Until Australians are promoted to the highest positions, we shall never have Australian officers able to take command. If the scheme we are now discussing were to be worked by Australian officers, it would have a better chance of succeeding than it will otherwise have </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to trouble the House by reading what the Minister did say ; but he opened his speech with a statement that he had changed his mind. I have no doubt that in twelve months' time the Minister will realize that this scheme is unworkable, except under a Commander-in-Chief. I can foresee that under the system proposed there will be a constant struggle for supremacy between the Chief Staff Officer and the Inspector-General - a struggle compared with which the differences which have existed between the Ministerial Head of the Department and the Military Commandant will be as nothing. I maintain that we cannot have a military organization without a definite autocratic head, and any attempt to work the Military Forces by means of a Committee will certainly lead to disaster. I trust that my remarks will carry some weight in another place. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to obtain a little information from the Minister in regard to the constitution of the Council of Defence, When this matter was under consideration upon a former occasion, I emphasized the fact that the proposed representation of the Naval Forces was not nearly so great as that of the Military Forces. I then endeavoured to obtain from the Minister some statement which would make the position clearer. By way of interjection, he said that due representation would be given to the Naval Forces upon the proposed Council of Defence. That may mean something, or it may mean nothing. I should be glad to know definitely the extent to which our Naval Forces are to be represented, because if the naval members of this important body are to be out-voted by the military members no adequate expression will be given to the need which exists for devoting more attention to naval matters. I feel very strongly upon this question, because it appears to me that we are subordinating the very first line of our defence to the least effective line. Upon a previous occasion I asserted that an attempt had been made to build up the Military Forces of Australia, not so much for the defence of our own territory, as for service abroad. Thereupon I was informed that there was no justification for my statement. I affirmed that the building up of our Light Horse regiments was not in accord with the true policy of Australian defence, and that the General Officer Commanding really intended those regiments for service abroad, rather than here in Australia. I now propose to show from an authoritative source that there was some warrant for my declaration. In a paper which was presented to Parliament two years ago, I find that Major-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton deals with what he terms " the two factors " in connexion with Australian defence. He says - </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that I can give the honorable member for Bourke any more information than I have already afforded him. Naval defence will be adequately represented on the Council by those whose interests and knowledge are specially connected with the Naval Forces; but I would not undertake to set down a definite numerical relation between, the number on the Council, who are specially familiar with military matters, and the number who are specially familiar with naval defence. I can only say that I shall see, so far as my power goes, that we have in the Council a body that will be able to consider the whole question of Australian defence, in regard to both its naval and military aspects. After all, these are only two branches of the one great question. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to bring under the notice of the Government a matter similar to that which has already been mentioned 'by the honorable member for Fremantle, in regard to the coaling of the war-ship <inline font-style="italic">Euryalus,</inline> at Fremantle. I refer to the fact that one of the vessels of the squadron, the <inline font-style="italic">Challenger.</inline> was recently coaled in the port of Melbourne by her crew, although it has been the in, variable practice to coal these vessels by means of shore labour. I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he can see his way to make representations to the Vice-Admiral as to the custom which has hitherto prevailed, and suggest that so far as possible it is desirable that it should be continued. I have been re quested by members of the union with which I am connected, to bring this case forward. Those who follow this avocation felt the matter very keenly. There is no particular reason why at this juncture there should be any departure from the usual practice. If it is considered desirable to teach sailors how to coal at sea, it is singular that this should not have been done before, and those to whom this work usually falls are at a loss to know why the usual course should not have been followed on the occasion to which I refer. </para>

Although I have no possible concern in the matter - although the question as to whether war-ships are coaled by their own crews, or by shore labour, is a matter which is absolutely within the discretion and control of the Vice-Admiral - as a matter of courtesy, I suggested to the honorable member a day or two ago that he should address a letter to me on the subject, and said that I would not hesitate to forward it to the Vice-Admiral. </para>
