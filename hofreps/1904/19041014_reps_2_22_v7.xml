As already partially intimated in reply to a previous question, it may be stated that it was held by the Crown Law Officers that, on confirmation by the Governor-General, the classification of the service made by the Public Service Commissioner supersedes the State Acts as regard salaries, increments, and allowances. </para>

                        <para>- The answer to . the honorable member&#39;s questions is as follows : - 1 and 2. A clerical error occurs in the printed classification, whereby six officers in the New South Wales Customs are given wrong designation; when this was discovered, the Commissioner notified the officers of same. They are described as third instead of fourth class inspectors, but the mistake is self-evident, as the classification and pay of the officers show their positions as in the fourth class. Five of the officers referred to have been granted an increase in the classification. The Commissioner is not aware of any other similar cases. </para>

                            <para>-I would ask the honorable member to follow the course I have just suggested to the honorable member for Richmond, and to move for a return. There will be no objection to such a motion, but I desire to suggest one or two alterations in form which would tend to further the object the honorable member has in view. </para>

                        (New England).During the previous discussion upon this matter I suggested that the Bill should contain some provision for the reservation of the land along the route of the proposed railway against- alienation by the States Governments. I stated that if that was not provided for I should certainly oppose the Bill. Whilst the survey is being made, no opportunity should be afforded to any. one to monopolize the land along the proposed route, and this is the proper time to make provision against it. What would be the use of making the railway if the land were gone?

                            <para>- My point is that the Bill provides for the survey of a proposed line of railway through the territory of two States, and I desire that the land should be protected by proclamation against being monopolized by individuals. I think that I am justified in speaking upon that joint, because, unless some provision is made for reserving the land, I shall oppose the survey. </para>

The money received from the sale of the land could afterwards be applied to liquidating the cost of constructing the railway. I merely desire what is fair. I wish the Commonwealth to be protected in its expenditure, and I desire to prevent any expenditure being incurred in the interests of private capitalists. I am aware that the Commonwealth has no power to reserve this land, but I ask that the Bill shall provide that the States shall reserve it. </para>

                            <para>- We can refuse to pass the Bill unless the States consent to reserve the land. It is useless to attempt to wriggle out of that position. I take it that the members of the Labour Party desire to prevent the capitalist from obtaining an advantage over other persons, and that, consequently, they will support my suggestion. I merely say that a man shall have what he himself earns. I am prepared to do my best to block this Bill unless some provision of the character I have indicated be inserted in it. It appears to me that the advocates of the measure are prepared to sacrifice every principle simply to suit the needs of their own States. </para>

                        <para>- I take no exception to the honorable member&#39;s desire that the States through which the proposed railway will pass should reserve a reasonable area upon each side of it, but I fail to see how they can do that until the route has been determined. I am sure that if the Ministry make representations upon the subject to the Western. Australian Government no difficulty will be experienced in inducing them to give effect to their views. At the same time, nobody desires that any . mineral wealth which may be discovered shall not be worked. Personally, I am of opinion that no minerals will be found in Western Australia except within about 250 miles of Kalgoorlie. Indeed, in a private letter which I received the other day it was stated that a mining lease comprising ninety-six acres had been &#39;applied for, about 250 miles to the east of Kurnalpie, which- would be somewhere near the probable route of the railway. Of course it would be altogether adverse to the interests of the Commonwealth to place any restrictions whatever upon the working of mineral leases: But I am convinced that no difficulty will be experienced in inducing the Government of Western Australia to reserve from alienation- any reasonable area upon each side of the projected line. I am sure that the representatives of that State share my opinion. Probably it would be advisable to set apart, say, twenty or thirty miles upon each side of the railway, but of course there would be nothing to prevent that area from being leased for pastoral purposes, as the land is quite, suitable for pastoral purposes when water is procured. At the present time, however, we do not know the exact route which the line will follow. I can assure honorable members that it is not merely the value of country which the railway will traverse which induces me and those associated with me to advocate its construction. I. am impelled to do so from a desire to connect the eastern States with Western Australia, and thus to make Federation a reality. Until a Bill authorizing the construction of the line is before us, I think that the honorable member&#39;s suggestion is premature. </para>

                            <para>- I would point out to him that any land which might be alienated would be subject to a land tax. Personally, I do not see how we can define the particular locality in which any area should be reserved at the present time. The honorable member ought to be quite satisfied, seeing that in South Australia a land tax is in operation. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt as to South Australia&#39;s attitude upon this matter. That State would be quite prepared to reserve land upon each side of the proposed line for certain purposes, but the suggestion that we should make provision for it in this Bill, even though we do not know the route which the railway will follow, seems to me a very impracticable one. If the honorable member will defer his proposal until the measure authorizing the construction of the line&#39; is under consideration he will be acting wisely. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite in sympathy with the object which the honorable member for New England wishes to attain, but I contend that the present is not an opportune time to give effect to his suggestion. I can assure him that the members of the present Western Australian Government are fully seized of the necessity for preventing any unfair exploitation of the resources of that State. The previous Government were called upon to: deal with several cases in which attempts were made by syndicates to obtain undue control of large areas. These were promptly frustrated. If my memory serves me correctly, I think that even in the direction which the railway is intended to take some veiy active gentlemen endeavoured some&#39; time ago to secure large blocks of land. However, their little scheme was discovered, and quickly thwarted. The honorable member for New England may rest assured that the Western Australian Government are fully alive to the need for preventing exploitation of the national resources in the way that he fears. As regards mineral&#39; wealth, however, I confess that the position is somewhat different. </para>

                            <para>- That is a case in point ; but I have more particularly in mind the great country of Siberia. A few years ago it was regarded as a terrible wilderness, and the worst criminals were consigned there in order that fitting punishment might&#34; meet their misdeeds; but it is now being found excellent for settlement. I merely mention this as an illustration of the discoveries that will probably be made when this particular portion of Australia is being surveyed. I trust that competent men will be sent with the party with a view to reveal the resources of that belt of country. If that be done I believe it will be found that considerable mineral wealth exists there. I would ask that the consideration be kept before the House that this after, all is merely a legitimate inquiry, and that Western Australia is fairly entitled to expect that a matter of this kind, which is of considerable national import, will be taken in hand by the Federal Parliament now that the opportunity offers. I feel satisfied that the result of the inquiry, if it be undertaken, will be to add another valuable province to the Australian Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I never feel sadder than when I have to differ from the right honorable member for Swan and the other representatives of Western Australia. I sympathize with them in their desire, as the right honorable member says, to connect the east with the west, and so consummate the great scheme of Australian Union ; but there are practical considerations which ought not to be overlooked. The proposal made by the honorable member for New England is not without precedent, I think, in all the States. For two and a half years I, as Minister controlling the construction of railways in New South Wales, laid it down as an indispensable condition that in every instance a reserve of ten miles should be made on each side of any State railway which was to be constructed, and I have reason to know that, in consequence of that action, a very considerable increment accrued to the State. </para>

                            <para>- The principle involved is the same whether it be a line costing &#163;100,000 or &#163;10,000,000. &#34;It must be &#39;admitted by every honorable member that if a syndicate were to come tomorrow to the Commonwealth Parliament, or to go to the Western Australian Government, with an offer to construct the line, and propose, as a condition of the expenditure of so large a sum, that they should have a- reservation, and ultimately a gift, of a very large extent of territory on both sides of the line,, it would be regarded as a very business-like proposal, and one which any syndicate or any company would be. justified in making at all events, for the consideration of the Government about to have the railway constructed. </para>

                            <para>- We are asked to embark on a preliminary survey, and if . honorable members consider for a moment they will be able to follow and acquiesce in the line of argument I am about to take. This expenditure is proposed for the purpose of laying down,&#39; in a rough way, perhaps, the line which this particular railway is intended to take in the future. I do not say that there will be shown, within a mile, the exact route which will ultimately be taken, but there will be an indication, as the result of a survey made at the expense of the Commonwealth, of the particular direction which the railway will follow. We all know that the intimation of the line of survey will be the signal for a number of adventurous spirits, whom I am not prepared for a moment to denounce - it will be the signal for a number of enterprising men to look round with . a view to purchasing land, which we know in some parts of Western Australia- </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that I am libelling Western Australia by saying that the people there are a businesslike community, prepared to sell land for money. I am quite satisfied that if any one were to approach the Western Australian Government and offer to take up land on long lease or in a freehold for money payment, the offer would be welcomed. But my point - from &#34;which the interjections are calculated to divert me - is that the moment this line of survey is, I shall not say determined, but indicated, a number of enterprising capitalists will endeavour tc&#171; get hold of land in the vicinity. They will know very well that should it become necessary to resume land, the test of the compensation will be what was given for it and what it was worth before the railway was actually undertaken. On the other hand, if the land is not resumed, the occupiers will acquire the increment which results from the construction of the railway through what, at present, is unexplored country. I consider it necessary that before embarking on this expenditure of ,&#163;20,000, we should require the, two Governments through whose territory the line is likely to run, to satisfy the Commonwealth Government that they have reserved from sale or lease a large extent of territory on each side. . The object is that when we, as a Parliament, hereafter undertake the actual construction, we may lay it down as a condition that the Commonwealth shall, in some form or other, have a <inline font-style="italic">quid fro quo</inline> in the shape of a large extent of territory which would represent compensation for the outlay. The honorable member for Perth suggested that this is an inopportune time to consider this matter. If I thought that the time was inopportune I should not attempt to stop the progress of the Bill at this stage ; but we are now about to sanction the expenditure of about ,&#163;20,000, for what purpose? For the purpose of showing the world the line that this railway is likely to take - for the purpose of pointing out to enterprising men, the particular direction in which it will pay them to take up land. If something is not done at this stage, we shall probably be told When we come to sanction the actual expenditure on the construction of the &#39;line, and we ask Western Australia and South Australia to offer some <inline font-style="italic">quid fro quo</inline> in the shape of land concessions, &#34; It is too late ; the moment the survey was completed the whole of the land along the line was taken up bv enterprising capitalists.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I will not use the word &#34; sharks,&#34; because I think it represents too hysterical a view of the position. A number of enterprising capitalists are willing to invest money with a view to the settlement of the country, and we need not allow our differences of opinion as to how those gentlemen should be characterized to interfere with the question we are considering. We all admit that there are in the community men with money who would seize upon any opportunity to get such land at the cheapest possible price; and if the Commonwealth is going to construct the line, it is the Commonwealth, and not capitalists outside, who should be considered. </para>

If this is a Bill which will immediately lead to the determination of the line along which the proposed railway is to be constructed, then this is .the occasion for taking steps to require the two States Governments concerned to reserve land on each side to a width which this Parliament may determine.

                            <para>- I ask honorable members for Western Australia what objection they can have to the suggestion I have made? The Western Australian Government would only be asked to undertake to reserve a certain width of land along the whole line of railway immediately the route is ascertained. If no objection to the suggestion can be fairly offered, then the Western Australian people and representatives ought to assist any one who seeks to impose such a condition. I, therefore, thoroughly approve of the suggestion made by the honorable member for New England, and I do not hesitate to say that this is not only the most opportune occasion, but the only occasion, on which such a proposal can be effectively made. </para>

                        <para>- I am thoroughly in accord with the principles just enunciated by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. I confess I am not quite sure whether this was the occasion to raise this particular point, but the arguments which have been addressed to the House convince me that the present opportunity should be seized by the Government to enter into negotiations or correspondence with the Governments of the States concerned, with a view to preserve the public rights in the public lands along the route of the proposed railway. I have often expressed the opinion that the honorable and learned member for Parkes was a democrat, and I think that the speech he has just delivered fully bears out that contention. Some of our honorable friends interjected that the honorable and learned member&#39;s proposal was an example of Socialism. But there is a distinct difference between this proposal and socialistic proposals, because in this case the public rights in. the lands are sought to be preserved. There is&#39; no suggestion to nationalize any private capital or any private industrial enterprise. It is a purely protective act so far as the rights of the general public are concerned, having for its object the prevention of public rights in public property being invaded for private gain. In the past we have had so much experience of the extent to which public lands have been exploited by private individuals, when public expenditure has enhanced their value, that it is our duty to see that the public rights are preserved before sums of money are voted by the Federal Parliament which would have the effect of enhancing the value of the public estate. The lands through which this survey is proposed to be made still belong to South Australia and Western Australia. It is only reasonable that the Government should enter into communication with those States, with a view to preserving to the public a certain proportion of the lands on each side of the route surveyed, and so prevent their passing into the hands of private individuals. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but the trouble is that honorable members who represent different portions of the two States in this Parliament have not the power to speak for them, or to say what their Governments will do in this connexion. They may have full sympathy with the ideas which are here expressed, but they have no power to say that this or that will be done. The only way in which we can get a satisfactory assurance that these things will be done will be by negotiations such as those which are proposed, and which I am very glad to hear have been promised by the Prime Minister. I hope that they will lead to a recognition of the. necessity of preserving the public rights in the lands through which the railway will ultimately pass. </para>

                        <para>- We should first bear in mind the fact that the survey or the construction of this railway has been made a Commonwealth matter. It ought to be shown bv its advocates that either the survey or the building of the railway, would be of considerable -benefit to the whole of the Commonwealth. I have read most carefully the case as put forward by people in Western Australia; I have read as many other papers as I . could get, as well as portions of the diaries of celebrated explorers who went through part of this country, tout I have not found one recommendation for a survey of this line at present. </para>

                            <para>- Previously we heard different opinions expressed. I do not know whether recent developments have had the result of throwing any light on the character of the country lying between these two points, but that would appear to be the case. From the first, I have been favorable to a survey of this line being made. In this case, as in others, we can reasonably . ask the Government to carry out their declared policy of consulting the States concerned. We should have an assurance that the States concerned are prepared to guarantee the reservation of the adjacent lands, for the reasons already given, before a survey is commenced. I do not see how we could&#34; very well make that stipulation in the Bill, because we have no control over the lands in the Commonwealth. We are entering upon an undertaking which is of an exceptional nature. What is proposed is practically to give a bonus to the two States which are most directly interested in the survey and construction of this line. Honorable members may feel that the construction of the line is likely to follow the survey, and, personally. F think it will. I hold the view that probably in a few years we shall have the whole of the railway systems of the </para>

                    <para class="block">States under the control of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, I am not so much alarmed as are some other honorable members that the Commonwealth should be requested to undertake the construction of this line. I do not suppose we shall rush into the undertaking for some little time. What is proposed is certainly an important departure, in connexion with which we should be assured of the distinct co-operation of the States. The honorable members for New England and Parkes have pointed out what usually takes place .when railways are projected, and there can be no doubt that persons would be found very glad to take up a large area of land along the route of this railway. They would be able to get it at a very cheap rate, and they would naturally regard it is a very good speculation. So far from opposing this measure, I am in favour of it, but I think, with the honorable members to whom I have referred, .that we should have a distinct pledge from Ministers that they will ask the Governments of both the States interested for an assurance that the land for a certain distance on each side of the proposed line will be reserved from alienation. If this were done, we should be in a position to refuse to survey or construct the line later if the States Governments failed to give that assurance. We know (that some persons are always on the watch for an opportunity to acquire land along the route of a projected railway for speculative purposes. No one can find fault with them for that, but it is our duty to see that the public interests are not sacrificed to the private interests of any syndicate. For that reason, I am heartily in accord with the &#39;suggestion of the honorable member for New England, that, in this instance, steps should be taken to see that the interests of the public are conserved. The construction of this railway will be a very great undertaking, involving many important considerations that are not now before us. The whole question of the management of railways by the Commonwealth, and the setting up of a new Commonwealth Department is involved. In connexion with such undertakings the States are protected by the fact that they have control of the land. In New South Wales we not only reserve land from alienation, but we have introduced, the betterment principle in connexion with railway construction. In South Australia there is a land tax which may operate with a somewhat similar effect, but the Commonwealth Government would have no such protection, if it were to undertake the construction of a railway. It is, therefore, desirable, when the construction of the line is not yet before us, that we should look ahead to what our position would be if we should agree eventually to undertake it. I hold the opinion that the States chiefly concerned should undertake the construction of the line, unless some move is made to bring all the railway systems under the control of the Commonwealth Government. It would not do, I think, to have divided control of railways; because the construction of branch lines following the general development of the country would involve very difficult problems. I have always believed that the Commonwealth Government should have control of all the railways, and I have no fear that if that were the case we should be able to overcome all these difficulties. I have no doubt that the people of Western Australia would be in a position to undertake the survey, and perhaps the construction of the line, but we have to recognise the fact that South Australia is not a rich State, and we are, therefore, justified in offering the comparatively small sum which, would be required to carry out a survey of the line. </para>

                            <para>-The Bill proposes &#163;20,000 as the outside cost of the survey. From what I have read concerning the country, and from what I have heard from persons who know it, it would appear to be very easy country for the purposes of railway survey and construction. A very large area of the country is comparatively flat, and is not covered with scrub to any great extent, so that the cost of survey should not be very great. I believe that the Government will be prepared to give the assurance for which we ask. </para>

                            <para>- We may probably later on have a service of flying machines; ! to provide communication with Tasmania. I have no doubt, that the States would give the guarantee suggested, because we have the assurance that Western Australia has acted upon the principle, and the honorable member for Perth tells us that the Western Australian Government has already refused to allow a syndicate to take up land on the route of this very line. If the States Governments are prepared to give the assurance to which I have referred, I see no objection to the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I hope honorable members will forgive me. if I make a few observations on this question, about which I frankly admit that I feel very strongly. We were told during a previous debate that a distinct bargain had been made in connexion with this particular matter. I have seen no official confirmation of any such bargain. Although some of the people of Western Australia may have been induced to vote for the Federal Constitution Bill on grounds other than the provisions contained in it, and for reasons other than were put forward in the rest of the States, this House is not bound by the arguments used there by the advocates of the Bill. But if we pass the measure now before us, we shall be committed to the construction of the proposed railway, probably at no distant date. It may be that its construction will be postponed, because of an unfavorable report, but, in agreeing to the survey, we are committing ourselves to a first step towards the construction of the line, which we shall not be able to retrace. In my opinion, the only justification for considering the proposal at the present juncture is that it will provide a means of defence. I do not think that the alleged advantages to be obtained by a quicker carriage of mails should weigh with us at all. But, even so far as defence is concerned, I feel that there are many other ways in which the money could be more advantageously expended. The two States most concerned are South Australia and Western Australia. We have had very strong representations of the opinion of the people of Western Australia in regard to the proposal, but the opinion of the people of South Australia has not been nearly so strongly expressed here. </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that that will be generally admitted. If the representatives of South Australia are not strong and strenuous advocates of the line, it behoves the representatives of other States, which will not benefit so directly, to pause before agreeing to the tremendous outlay proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> estimated that the cost of rails, connexions, points, and so on. will be about &#163;1,155,000, and the total expenditure &#163;1,155,000, He assumes that an average speed of forty miles an hour will be maintained by the trains, and he allows for the use of 60-lb. rails. I do not set myself up as a railway expert, but I know that it has been the experience of Victoria that heavy trains cannot safely be run at an express speed on 60-lb. rails. If we use such rails, and the traffic proves to be heavy, we shall be faced almost immediately with the necessity of spending a great deal more money to improve the line. </para>

                            <para>- When the traffic is sufficiently heavy to justify their use, because, where light rails are used for heavy traffic, the cost of maintenance is enormous. Honorable members are asked to believe that the total cost of the line will be about &#163;4,600,000, but if they take into consideration the nature of the permanent way that is provided for, and the fact that heavy trains are to be run over the line at high rates of speed, they will see that that estimate would soon be exceeded. </para>

                            <para>- Even at a moderate estimate pf the cost of construction and maintenance, we have to face an inevitable deficit of &#163;28,000 per annum for a series of years. I would ask honorable members to remember what took place when we were discussing the expenditure that would be involved if a dissolution took place. The opinion was then expressed that one of the first considerations ;should be economy, and, if honorable members cast their memories back still further, they will remember that we agreed without demur to a proposition that we should go before the electors at the same time as the members of the Senate, in order to save the cost of a second election. In the face of these facts, how are we going to justify an expenditure which is so unwarranted at the present time, and which would go so far towards minimizing the benefit conferred upon the Commonwealth by our previous action in this Parliament ? </para>

                            <para>-The right honorable gentleman is accustomed ,&#39;to deal with enormous sums in a fashion with which other Ministers are unfamiliar. Fortunately for him, he was backed up by a substantial majority of the people of his State, and I admit that he expended large sums of money to the greatest advantage. However, as I am opposed to borrowing, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, and I do not consider it advisable to impose direct taxation, I cannot follow the right honorable gentleman in treating lightly the expenditure of even &#163;20,000. The honorable member for Darling told us that under the Constitution we could exercise no control over the land along the route of the proposed line, and upon that ground he based his opposition to any proposal to engraft upon the Bill a provision that the States should first agree to certain reservations of land. I would&#39; suggest, however, that we surely have the right to make conditions in respect to the expenditure of a large sum of money upon such a work as that contemplated. </para>

                            <para>-I believe that this is the proper time to make the condition. It would be of no use for us to wait until the work had been commenced or completed. It must be remembered that no fixed sum of money has been allocated to cover the cost of the survey, and that our experience in the past is that estimates in connexion with works of this kind are very frequently exceeded. If the work were in progress, and it were found that&#163;20,000 was not sufficient, the Government would have no compunction about asking for a further sum of, say,&#163;10,000 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20,000.</inline> After having committed ourselves to the expenditure of the first amount, we could scarcely avoid making the additional appropriation necessary for the completion of the work. During a recent debate frequent reference was made to the ultimate aims of a certain party in this House We must not lose sight of the aims of those honorable members who are in favour of the proposed survey. Their aim is the construction of the line, and those honorable members who do not believe in that are fully justified in opposing the proposed survey. </para>

                            <para>- I shall take no notice of that suggestion. What is the survey to prove? According to one honorable member, we do not know this country j but, so far as we can judge from the reports, it is a waterless waste. The right honorable member for Swan tells us that the country is thoroughly well known, and that it has already been surveyed, whilst other honorable members state that we know nothing about it. Honorable members have evidently shaped their arguments to fit the circumstances as they have arisen. When it is suggested that a substantial area of land should be reserved along the proposed route, we are told by some honorable members that the land is absolutely worthless - that it is a desert. </para>

                            <para>- I think that we shall be thoroughly justified in postponing, at any rate for a period, the survey of the proposed line, and especially its construction. The honorable member for Newcastle made a most valuable suggestion, and I am glad that the Minister of Home Affairs has already intimated that it is the intention of the Government to adopt it. I desire to make another suggestion. I hope that if it is decided to construct the railway, provision will be made for the adoption of the method which has proved so beneficial in Victoria, namely, the butty-gang system. We have had a number of light railways constructed in Victoria- </para>

I hope that a clause will be inserted in this Bill providing for the reservation of the lands upon each side of the proposed railway. If the survey be carried out I trust that it will be conducted as economically as possible, and that Parliament will not be subsequently asked to provide a further sum of money to complete a work which a considerable section of this House deems both inadvisable and inopportune. </para>

                        <para>- I could understand the speech of the honorable member for Laanecoorie if it had been delivered after the proposed trial survey had been made. He affirms that he has obtained sufficient information&#39; to warrant him in deciding against a survey of the route of the projected railway. Where he has derived that information I cannot even conjecture. At first I was disposed to think that there was no justification for a survey of the line, but the more I looked into the matter the more I became convinced that there were sufficient grounds to warrant it being undertaken. I have read reports which state that there are millions of acres of grassy land along the probable route of the line. I have perused the report of the right honorable member for Swan upon the country to the south, and I have also studied the accounts furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Muir</inline> and others. According to these authorities there are millions of acres of grassy land along the probable route of the line, and that fact seems to me at least to justify further investigation. As I stated on a previous occasion, unless the country between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie possesses better possibilities than at first sight present themselves, I shall not vote for the- construction of the line. My fears are n6t only on account of the character of the land, but also on account of the want of the water. Apparently the representatives of Western Australia think that there will be sufficient justification for the construction of the line if the fact be established that good land exists between Port Augusta and the Western Australian border, even though there may not be any prospect of a large traffic upon&#39; it. I cannot understand why the honorable member for Laanecoorie should twit the right honorable member for Swan with talking lightly about the expenditure of millions of pounds. Some men can handle millions sterling better than others can handle pence, and, seeing that the right honorable member has always justified any large expenditure for which he is responsible, I think- that we ought to seriously regard his views upon this question instead of jeering at them. Honorable members have repeatedly jeered at the right honorable member for Swan for declaring that he had expended millions of pounds, whilst acknowledging in the same breath that he had spent those millions well. Verv early in the debate the right honorable member declared that he believed this line would pay, and that he made the statement fully conscious of the fact that he had a reputation to lose. Of course we may say that he is interested in Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I recollect my father telling me that in the early days of Victoria he was able to lead his horse over what are now grassy plains without putting his foot upon a solitary blade of verdure. The fact that there are millions of acres of grassy land, some of it timbered, upon the probable route of the proposed line indicates that there is a . possibility of obtaining water at no very great depth. To my mind, the proposed survey should be one of an exploratory character, and especially so in regard to the supply of water. I understand that to the north of the Great Australian Bight there is a stretch of limestone country where water can be obtained only at a very great depth, if at all. That is the chief difficulty which has to be confronted. A thorough search should be made for water, as the survey progresses. </para>

                            <para>- Water may be obtained from certain catchment areas, but I have grave doubt about it, because I understand that it soaks away very rapidly. As the survey proceeds, I am of opinion that efforts should be made to obtain water by sinking. The country to be traversed is of limestone formation, and is not likely to prove rich in minerals. I am heartily in sympathy with the idea that the land upon each side. of the line for a reasonable distance should be reserved. </para>

                            <para>- I have never had anything to do with the construction, of railways. The honorable member for Corangamite said that a century hence, when population has been settled upon the country which the line will traverse, it will be time enough to undertake its construction. To my mind, that is not the way to develop our resources. If he had visited America he would know that the railways there are pushed out from the various centres, and that settlement follows. Under the land grant system there, it. is customary to give those persons who undertake the construction of railways every alternate block, It is idle to say to the people, &#34; Go out into the interior and live there as best you can for some years, and then we will construct a railway.&#34; That is not exhibiting an enterprising spirit. If the country which the proposed line would traverse proves to be of good quality, and if water can be found along the route, we shall have some justification for constructing it. That is my reason for voting for the second reading of this measure. If the survey does not disclose that the land is worth opening up, and likely to be able to support a population, I shall not be disposed to go any further. </para>

                            <para>- If a sufficient supply of water is available,, and if the country proves to be of good quality, I shall be prepared to support the construction of the line within a reasonable period. Under such circumstances, I shall be obliged to take into consideration the fact that there is a large gold-field at Kalgoorlie, and that the competition by sea cannot be so keen as it otherwise would be, because goods intended for that centre have first to be transported to Perth, and then forwarded by rail for a distance of 400 miles east. There is, first of all, the gold-fields population, which is likely to be employed for the next fifty years in opening up those fields, and if in addition to that fact the report of the survey party shows that there is. good country to be developed and that a water supply is available, I shall feel justified, but not otherwise, in voting for the line. The report might show that there is good grazing or agricultural country along the line of route, but unless it also sets forth that water could be obtained at a reasonable depth to aid in developing the country I should not vote for the construction of the railway. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to ask the Minister of Home Affairs if provision will be made in that direction. It has been suggested that the mineral resources of the country should receive attention, but while that is undoubtedly a very important matter, it is still more important that the water supply should be tested. If the land itself were ever so suitable for grazing or agricultural purposes, it would be valueless without a proper water supply. </para>

                            <para>- The survey will be of very little value to the advocates of the line, unless it shows that the country is good and that water is available. I do not know whether the Minister has any faith in the divining rod, but from some information which I have received lately I am inclined to attach some importance to its use. Some of my friends have employed it with very successful results. In any event, steps should be taken to test the water supply, either by putting down bores, or in some other effective way. I certainly intend to support the proposal outlined by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. &#39; We should have some indication from the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia that they are prepared to reserve the land along both sides of the line. If the land is fit to be opened up by a railway, it is only reasonable that the Commonwealth should1 receive some benefit from it. </para>

                        <para>- I voted against the introduction of this measure solely for the reason that I considered it premature, and I am afraid that I shall have to vote against the Bill itself, even though it be amended as suggested. The time is hardly ripe for the making of a survey, &#39;but no one can say that it would be premature, at this stage, to give effect to the- suggestion, made by the honorable and learned member, for Parkes, that, the land along both sides of the proposed route should be reserved. That is a most necessary and .reasonable precaution to take. The sooner the possibility that this land may be- required is provided for the better it will be. We have already adopted a somewhat similar course in , dealing with the lands required for the purposes of the Federal Capital, by providing, in the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act, that land acquired by the Commonwealth shall be assessed at its value on. the 1st January preceding the date of acquisition. In these circumstances, I think it would be well to provide in this Bill for the reservation of the land on both sides of the line. </para>

                            <para>- I &#39;do- not agree with the honorable gentleman. I hold that it should be inserted in the measure now before us. We made provision for the valuation of the land to be acquired for the purposes of the Federal Capital before1 we had actually decided upon the site of the capital, and I think that we may well provide in this Bill for the reservation of the land along the route of the1 projected railway. I shall support the honorable member for New England in any proposal he may make in that direction, believing that in doing so I shall assist in improving the Bill, and that the time is opportune to take such action. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the House owes a debt of. gratitude to the honorable and learned member for Parkes for the splendid suggestion that steps should be taken to secure the reservation of the land along the projected route, because the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will have to pay for the construction of the railway. The cost will fall, not upon any one member of the community, but upon the whole of the people of the States. Great corporations often secure millions of acres of land on both, sides of lines of railways, and, locking it up for centuries, prevent settlement along them. If a private corporation were to obtain a. grant of land on each side of this projected railway, the country would probably not be populated for a hundred years. The land would be locked up, just as is the case along some of the railways, in the United States of America.. I. should oppose the selling of the land,, but if the suggestion ma&#39;de by the&#163; honorable and learned member for Parkes were acted upon, the Commonwealth would be able, by selling the land, to recoup itself in respect of the cost of carrying out the survey, and constructing the. line; Unless I were prepared to vote for the. building of the railway, I should not vote! for the making of the survey., </para>

                            <para>- No honorable member has a right to pledge the revenue of the State which he represents in this way unless he is prepared to vote for the construction of the line if the survey shows that it would be a legitimate investment. I am bound to say, from what I have heard from the right honorable member for Swan - who is perhaps the greatest explorer now in the Southern Hemisphere that I think the line would be a good investment. Every honorable member who proposes to vote for this Bill must not let ft be a salve to his conscience&#39; that he will not do anything further towards the carrying out of this work. The suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Parkes gives me a clearer view of the position than I previously had. I am amazed that I did not think of it myself. It only shows that the honorable and learned member is in a fair way to become a real genuine Socialist, and as a Socialist I hope to follow him. If the report of the&#39; survey party be such as to legitimately recommend the construction of the line, what will be the next step ? The five representatives of Western Australia in this House, although they may be divided on some political issues, are united on this. </para>

                            <para>- It is the Western Australian representatives who have brought this question to its present prominent position. It is their battling and their buttonholing - their declarations that if honorable members did not vote for this railway they might as well clear out of Parliament - that have made this Bill possible to-day. As soon as this survey has shown that the railway ought to be built, what will be the next move on the chess-board? The five Western Australian representatives will be all over the various rooms of Parliament House. - in the streets, and all over the place - praising to the very heavens the glorious opportunity now presented to build this railway to their State. And an honorable member who refuses to support the line will find an organization&#39; as strong as a Japanese army to upset all his calculation. I shall positively be afraid to go into the Labour Party&#39;s room. </para>

What I do know is that for the last three years I have heard nothing from the five members of Western Australia but the merits of this line - wherever I went, upstairs or downstairs, I had to listen to the same story. Those honorable members may disagree on other matters, but they are absolutely united, as to the necessity for this line.

                            <para>- That is so. I shall vote for this Bill, but on condition that a clause such as that suggested by the honorable and learned member for Parkes is inserted, so that the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia may be called upon to set apart a certain width of. land on each side of the line. Such a provision would enable Tasmania to get back the money which is taken from the people of that State for the . purposes of this railway. What interest have the people of King Island, or of Tasmania generally, in this railway? Of course, when we raise the question of sentiment, or point to the necessity for military protection against outside aggression, Tasmania is interested. I do not desire to take up much time in discussing this matter, but merely to put myself right in the eyes of the public. The Bill should provide that private corporations and private &#34; land sharks &#34; and other &#34; boom boosters,&#34; should not be allowed to tie up land, and <inline font-style="italic">then</inline> demand immense compensation from the Commonwealth before the line can be constructed. </para>

                        <para>- I am very pleased to hear the good sound socialistic views expressed by the honorable and learned member for Parkes - to hear that he is of opinion that a certain area of territory on each side of this proposed railway ought to be held by the State. But the question which we have before us just now is whether we shall have a survey made in order to decide as to the wisdom, or otherwise, of constructing the line. The time to impose conditions is after .we have come to an affirmative decision. If the result of the survey does not satisfy me, I am not going to vote for the construction of a railway to </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Western Australia. I am thoroughly satisfied, however, from what I know of the country, that the survey party will be able to report that there is every .justification for entering on this enterprise. As to preserving the country from getting into the hands of speculators, I would point out that for several years it was the policy of the South Australian Government that there should be no alienation of Crown land. Under a resolution of the Parliament of that State, not a foot of land was alienated for many years. Unfortunately, about two years ago, a reactionary Government came into power in South Australia - though I feel satisfied that that Government will be &#39;compelled to resign office in a very few months. There are decided indications that the same forward movement we have witnessed in other States will also be witnessed in Western Australia; and should that prove to be the case, we may depend that the policy to which I have referred will come into operation. At the present time, in Western Australia, there is a Labour Government in power, and I feel quite sure that even if that Government leave office the labour section in the local Parliament will be strong enough to secure that no injustice is perpetrated on the community by speculators. Under all the circumstances, I do not think we have1 anything to fear in that regard. Surely the honorable members for Lang .and New England ought to be quite satisfied that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to impose land taxation? The reason why a good many South Australians are opposed to the construction of this line is their anxiety to first have a railway to the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- The proposal was to hand over a tract of country larger than Victoria and Tasmania combined - &#34;larger than the whole of the United Kingdom&#39; - with all the minerals, in return for a &#34; shoddy &#34; line, which would allow of the passage of a train once a week, at the rate of twenty miles an hour. No wonder the proposal did not meet with success, and I am sure that the honorable and learned member for Parkes would have assisted to prevent such an iniquity. The honorable member for Corangamite says that we have no information which would justify the construction of this line. So far as South Australia is concerned, I am satisfied that if the line be built, more than one Tarcoola goldfield will be discovered. At Tarcoola, one mine alone has employed 300 men for years, and has turned out at least 50,000 ounces of gold up to date. </para>

                            <para>- I must admit that Tarcoola has been treated very graciously by the Commonwealth. The progress of that field has, however, been retarded for two reasons. In the first place, two gentlemen Were prepared to take the opening up of the field into their own hands, and, consequently, there was not that prominence which is usually given through the Stock Exchange to other fields. I am. satisfied that with more publicity, several millions of money would have been invested in this part of the country. About twenty-five miles on this side of Tarcoola very payable gold has been found ; in fact, the stone has been assayed up to three ounces to the ton. </para>

                            <para>- At the Mount Gunson copper-field, ninety-five miles from Port Augusta, thousands of tons of copper have been taken out. I have seen numerous parcels sent down. A large profit has been made out of the field, notwithstanding the enormous freight for that distance, ninety-five miles, over a sandy tract, and the freight thence to Port Adelaide, another distance of 300 miles. On that copper-field many hundreds of thousands of tons of ore may be seen on the surface. Of course it is of low grade, but we all know that low-grade copper pays, so long as there is cheap means of transit. I have gone over the whole of the country up to the border of Western Australia, and much of it is splendid pastoral country. Unfortunately, it has experienced droughts, but then all Australia suffers periodically from droughts. When the seasons are good, as they now are, very large sums of money are spent in that country, and very large returns are received. I am perfectly satisfied that, so far as the South Australian portion is concerned, this railway would yield a handsome return. The honorable member for Laanecoorie said that the honorable member for Darling stated that the country to be traversed is a desert. Possibly, some persons believe that it is a desert. In South Australia, we have a large tract of country over which its representatives pass every week. For many years this country has been called a waterless desert, but it has been proved to be capable of growing almost anything. I am quite satisfied that a great proportion of the country which is believed to be desert in the two States, along the proposed route of this line, will be found to be, if not agricultural country, at any rate good pastoral country and undoubtedly good mineral country. From the fact that he is supporting the proposal for a survey, I should take it that the honorable member for Darling does not. hold the opinion which has been attributed to him. It has been said that the land is not known. I.t is a remarkable fact that some time ago a private syndicate was prepared to build this line on the land grant system. It would be pretty careful to ascertain the nature of the country in which it proposed to invest the enormous sum required to build such a railway. There is no philanthropy about a syndicate, and the members of this syndicate were quite satisfied that they were going to have a very good thing on. </para>

                            <para>- I thoroughly agree that all possible information ought to be gleaned by the survey party, not only as to minerals, but also as to the water, and as to whether it can be obtained without expensive boring. I feel sure that the survey party would consider that to be part of .their duty, and as all that is now asked for is the expenditure of &#163;20,000 to see whether there is any_ justification for building a railway which would be of advantage to the Commonwealth without being an unnecessarily heavy burden on the taxpayers, the proposal shall have n:y hearty support. </para>

                        <para>- I listened with considerable interest to the last speaker* The facts which he brought forward are rather convincing to me against the construction of the line. Knowing, as I do, the enterprise of the people of South Australia in undertaking the construction of the Port Darwin railway for a distance of 1,000 miles or more at their own expense, and learning from the honorable member about the wonderful mineral resources of the western part of that State, and the large area of agricultural land which is there available for settlement, it does seem to me a remarkable thing that they will not construct a railway through this country. </para>

                            <para>- In South Australia, as far back as I can remember, the construction of a land grant railway to the Northern Territory has been advocated, but no one could ever be got to take the enterprise in hand. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rowland</inline> Rees, who &#34;passed away only yesterday, was a strong advocate for the adoption of the land grant system. Other leaders of his day advocated its adoption, but no one could be found to take on the enterprise. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has stated that a short time since a syndicate was prepared to construct this railway on the land grant system. Now, if it was a good thing for a syndicate, would it not be a much better thing for the State? His knowledge of human nature ought to convince him that the promoters of a railway on the land grant system would be the &#34; first robbers.&#34; They would do well out of it, and those who came afterwards might do very badly. The &#34; first robber &#34; is always prepared to go in, so long as he can gull and rob the public, but the people who bear the burden are those who afterwards suffer. So much, then, for the honorable member&#39;s statements, which go to show me that this is not such a good thing as he would lead us to believe. He referred to the Tarcoola district as a place where there are yields of 3 ozs. to the ton. South Australia will not construct a railway, nor would she construct a telegraph line at her own expense to the place. </para>

                            <para>- There is a very great deal of copper in the district, but we are told that it is of a low grade. At Kadina, Moonta, and Wallaroo there are very large deposits of .copper ore which can be hewn out in great blocks, but the owners of &#39; the mines &#34;apparently think that it does not pay so well to work them as to hold them. Honorable members can readily understand that the people of South Australia would not undertake the construction of a railway line for the transport of copper ore of a very low grade. I look at this matter as a business man, and I say that if the conditions were such as to warrant the construction of the proposed railway, I should be justified in spending ,&#163;20,000 in surveying a route through that country ; but if the conditions are such as not to warrant the construction of the railway, I should not be a business man if I threw away &#163;20,000. It would be putting money into a speculation as hazardous as horse-racing. As I am not in favour of spending &#163;^5,000,000 of Commonwealth money on the construction of a railway line which I believe would not warrant that expenditure, I am not justified in voting for the expenditure of ,&#163;20,000 on the survey of the line, because I feel that it would be money thrown away. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has said that the syndicate would have constructed a very indifferent kind of railway in South Australia. I am reminded by that observation that in South Australia from &#39;Terowie the railway is constructed on a narrow gauge, and that would necessitate another break of gauge. It is probable that a railway on a very narrow gauge would be constructed right through the desert country, causing a further break. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I overlooked the fact that the line extends from Petersburg to Port Augusta, but there would be a break at Terowie, and at Port Augusta, and there would be another break between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Western Australia has had some experience of the land grant system. I have been over the line from Albany to Perth, which is constructed on that system - the chess-board plan - and at the time I passed over it I know the whole talk and scandal on the road was that although the contracting company were granted alternate blocks, they were allowed to extend the area, almost indefinitely, in any direction, so long as they did not take more than the aggregate area allowed under the terms of construction. I can see no force in the suggestion that land along the proposed line should be reserved for the. benefit of the Commonwealth. Assuming that the land was reserved by the States Governments for the benefit of the Commonwealth, let me remind the honorable member for Hindmarsh that when a reactionary Government, such as the honorable member referred to, came into power, it might set aside the reservation and sell the land. That has been done in all parts of Australia before, and it might be done again. In such circumstances, honorable members will see that there would be no safeguard in the reservation proposed. If land is to be reserved in the way proposed for the benefit of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth is to be recouped its expenditure on the railway from that land, would it not be better that the States should construct the railway keep the land themselves, and recoup themselves from it? If this proposal is such a good thing, and the resources of the country are so great as to warrant the expenditure necessary for the construction of this line, the States could keep the land and recoup themselves for their outlay on the line. Does the honorable and learned member for Parkes propose that the Government of the Commonwealth should acquire land and set up a Crown lands administration in competition with the States? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member evidently was not listening to my remarks, or he would know that I have already dealt with that phase of the question. If this proposal is such a good thing, and the&#39; expenditure could be recouped from these lands, I ask why the States should not themselves construct the railway? Honorable members must be aware that it is because the undertaking is too hazardous, and because they know the country much better than we do, that they are not prepared to incur the heavy loss which they know would be entailed, and prefer to experiment at the expense of the whole Commonwealth. I say that it is not advisable that we should have a Commonwealth Crown Lands Department in competition with those of the States until we have reached the stage of unification which is looked forward to by some honorable members. Something has been said with respect to the land system which should be enforced in the Federal Capital. I think it will have to be governed by a special Act of Parliament, some form of local government measure, but I have no wish to introduce a discussion upon that question. I repeat that, as a business man, I would not undertake to expend &#163;20,000 on the survey of this line unless I were prepared to go the full length of spending &#163;5,000,000 on its construction. I am supported in the view I take of the matter by the right honorable member for Swan, who has said that if we spend the &#163;20,000 on the survey we should complete the construction of the line. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say a few words in regard, to this matter. In the first place, I differ from the honorable member for Laanecoorie in the view which he takes of the proposed railway as a means of defence. In my opinion, parallel steel rails are the chief factors in modern warfare. I think that the railways of the Continent should be under the complete and dominating control of the Federal Government. 1 approve, too, of the suggestion that a reservation should be made on each side of the proposed line, though I admit the difficulty of getting the two States which are chiefly concerned to agree to set apart a strip fifty miles wide, that is, twenty-five miles on each side of the rails. If such a reservation were guaranteed, I should vote for the construction of the railway. Inasmuch as Western Australia at the present time is the largest gold-producing State in the Commonwealth, it would have been a gracious act on the part of the Government of the State to suggest to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth that the sum required for the proposed survey should be deducted from the Customs duties otherwise returnable to it. If they put an export duty upon their gold, they could easily raise the money themselves. Western Australia is the specially privileged State in the union. However, I have risen chiefly to show that the proposed railway could be constructed without costing the Commonwealth a single penny piece. The island of Guernsey, as honorable members are no doubt aware, is not a dependency of the Empire, but an allied State, because the Channel Islands were never conquered by Great Britain. In 1823 the people of Guernsey wished to build a market-place, but, as in those days borrowing was not so easy as it is now, it was determined to issue <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> notes with which to pay the brickmakers, stonemasons, and other artisans employed in the construction, and they, together with the contractors and shopkeepers, agreed to accept those notes as ordinary legal tender. The market was built, and each year, as the rents were collected, so many of the notes were recalled and burned, and at the end of ten years the people had a splendid rent-pr oducing property, the construction of which had cost them nothing in interest, the only financial charge being the expense of printing the notes. That system of payment for public works still prevails in those islands. If the people require a water mill, they do not borrow money at high rates of interest to pay for its construction, but they issue notes such as I have described. . As late as March of this year a note issued in connexion with their education system was recalled and burnt. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline></para>

                        <para>The States of Guernsey having determined to build a meat market, voted&#163;4,000 to defray the cost. The market notes were guaranteed by the whole property of the island, said to be worth &#163;4,000,000 sterling. These notes did not bear any interest, nor were they convertible into the precious metals - they were tokens, not possessing any intrinsic value, but only that conventional or representative value which they received from the authority of the States by which they were issued. They were the symbols of the real money of the island. They were worthless to any other community than Guernsey, and, therefore, there was no inducement to, their exportation. Consequently, they remained permanently in local circulation for local purposes. They were inscribed &#34;Guernsey Meat Market Notes,&#34; and numbered from 1 to 4,000, each note representing <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> in the currency of the island. They were legal tender by the authority of the States. With these notes the States paid the contractor, and with them the contractor paid his workmen, and all who supplied him with materials. They were freely taken by tradesmen for goods, by landlords for rent, by the authorities for taxes. </para>
                        <para>In due season the Market House was completed, rand the butchers&#39; stalls, with some public rooms constructed over them, were let for the total annual rental of&#163;400. At the expiration of ten years all the notes were received by the States and cancelled, but the meat market has returned a clear annual revenue to the States, and continues to afford accommodation without having cost a f ar thing in taxes to any citizen of the States. </para>

                    <para>If a tract of country fifty miles wide were reserved., that would give a good security for a similar Commonwealth note issue, while behind that security would be the guarantee of the Commonwealth Government. In the event of some such method of raising money as that being followed, my vote would gladly be given for the proposed work. At the present time, however, the proposal absolutely stinks in the nostrils of a great number of persons in Victoria, who ask, &#34;Why should the Commonwealth go to this great expense?&#34; The adoption of the method of financing the undertaking which I have suggested would disarm criticism, and is worthy of consideration. I wish to pay my meed of praise to a gentleman who does not wish his name to be made known, who has gathered together books on financial subjects which are absent from every library in Australia. They are books which contain doctrines opposed to the established methods of capital, and have disappeared from the Parliamentary Library and from the Free Public Library, while they are not obtainable in any other of our public libraries. The American people have only just in time rescued from oblivion the narrative of the building of the Guernsey meat market, which I have read. If what 1 have suggested cannot be carried out, I think that the Government of Western Australia might allow the Commonwealth to pay the&#163;20,000 required for the proposed survey out of the Customs revenue otherwise returnable to the State. </para>

                        <para>- The matter now under discussion is one which should be considered quite apart from any party spirit. The question of constructing a railway to connect Western Australia with the eastern States has been under discussion for many years - prior to the time that Fremantle superseded Albany as the first port of call for the English mail steamers. Many years ago I succeeded in persuading the Parliament of New South Wales to pass resolutions in favour of extending a railway from Cobar to Wilcannia and Broken Hill, and I gave as one of the reasons for advocating the construction of the line that it would probably form portion of a line which would be carried right through to Western Australia. I have seen no reason to change the opinion I then held. In fact, the developments which have since taken place in connexion with Federation have strengthened my belief that a line such as that now projected should be constructed. I know that a large number of persons, especially in Victoria and South Australia, are opposed to the construction of the line, but I cannot conceive upon what grounds. I shall unhesitatingly vote in favour of what I believe to be a great national work. It has been said that the prospective traffic would not warrant the construction of such a railway. That might be said in nine cases cut of ten ; but as the country becomes opened up, and large centres of population are connected by rail, the traffic increases, until ultimately, in most cases, the revenue returns become satisfactory. In many places traffic cannot be developed unless a railway is constructed. </para>

                            <para>- This is an exceptional case. If it were not so, I should not advocate the construction of the railway as a national work. If it were proposed merely for the development of any one State I should throw the responsibility of its construction upon the persons directly interested. I heard all the discussions which took place at the Federal Convention with regard to &#39;bringing Wester!! Australia into the Federation, and I have no hesitation in saying that it was fully anticipated, and practically concurred in, that the proposed railway connexion should be made. </para>

                            <para>- I have not the slightest doubt that if a resolution had been submitted committing the Commonwealth to the construction of the railway it would have been carried. I have very little doubt that the proposed railway will pay, because many of the passengers arriving here from Great Britain and other parts of the world in the steamers which make Fremantle their first port of call would doubtless be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity to save two or three days by making the overland journey from Fremantle across to Sydney or Brisbane, or other parts of the eastern States. In the same way, passengers leaving Australia for London could also effect a great saving of time by making the overland journey from Melbourne or Sydney - perhaps to a greater extent from Sydney than from Melbourne - and I fully believe that a large percentage would join the steamer at Fremantle, instead of going round by sea. </para>

                            <para>- Adelaide does not bear quite the same relation to the other States as Fremantle would if the proposed railway were constructed. One matter which has an important bearing upon the question of the cost of maintaining the railway is the saving in time that would be effected by the carriage of the English mails overland from Fremantle to the eastern States. If two or three days could be saved in that way the public convenience would be promoted, and the desire of the community for the speediest possible means of communication between Australia and Great Britain would be, in some degree, attained. I cannot understand the attitude assumed by one or two honorable members. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Robertson is opposed to the project, but I would point out that no portion of New South Wales would derive greater benefits than would the district represented by the honorable member from the construction of a railway to connect Fremantle with Sydney. An enormously increased traffic would pass through Dubbo and Cobar. It seems to me that the honorable member was speaking absolutely against the interests of his own constituents and of the people of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I refer to the country bordering upon New South Wales and extending for two-thirds of the distance to Port Darwin. I cannot understand why the honorable member for Parramatta should oppose the construction of the railway. The coal mining industry at Lithgow, in his electorate, would derive especial benefit from the construction of a railway to Broken Hill, because a large quantity of coal would be hauled to meet the requirements of the population inland. Then, again, huge forests of some of the best timber in New South Wales are to be found almost adjacent to the present terminus of that line. There are vast forests of ironbark which would be used for mining and other purposes if there were any means of communication available. I make these remarks to justify my action in connexion with that railway* Upon two occasions I succeeded in passing measures authorizing its construction through the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales ; but both of these were rejected by the Legislative- Council. Some reference has been made to the break of gauge. I must admit that- if it is proposed to adopt any- . thing save the 4ft. 8|in. gauge upon the projected line, it will very materially influence my vote. That is the standard gauge of the world, and I have no hesitation in saying that if we construct this railway upon the 3ft. 6in. gauge, it will prove a failure. Upon that gauge it is impossible to carry over long distances heavy loads, such as can be carried upon the 4ft. 81/2in. gauge. </para>

                            <para>- I was not Minister of Works in New South Wales for many years without understanding something about this matter. The speed which can be attained upon the projected line enters v. ry largely into the question of the wisdom or otherwise of constructing it. Unless we cart travel at a high rate of speed, it would be idle to build it, because too many days would be occupied in traversing the distance between the eastern States and Kalgoorlie. If, however, it is possible to reach a speed of forty or fifty miles per hour, the time occupied in the conveyance of mails to and from Great Britain will be very materially lessened. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that there would be a very considerable reduction indeed. That result, however,, can only be achieved by adopting, the universal gauge, and by travelling at a high rate of speed. I should not have known so much about this country had it not been for the fact that some years ago, in conjunction with several others, I contemplated taking up a large portion of it. We obtained a most authentic report upon a large area which the proposed railway would traverse, with a view to taking it up. </para>

For the first fifty miles from the sea the land is low-lying. Then it rises abruptly to a tableland, which to a large extent is composed of limestone. As honorable members are aware, limestone country is usually safe stock country. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that it is dry country, and that is why we did not take it up. We feared that it might be afflicted with drought. This country is practically undeveloped. In the report which was supplied to us, mention was made of three springs, one of which is situated ten miles from the coast, another some fifty miles from the coast . just where the sudden rise takes place to the limestone table-land, and a third in the limestone country itself. When this area is developed, I have not the slightest doubt that water will be obtainable by sinking. </para>

                            <para>- When I was considering this matter some years ago I came to the conclusion that fresh water would be found. Although we are bound to strike supplies of salt water, caused by its percolating through minerals, I am satisfied that if bores are put down fresh water will be discovered. The result of such a policy would be to make this country three or four times as productive as it would be in the absence of communication. In that way we may expect very much more in the shape of a return than we can at present estimate. That return would also assist in defraying the expense of constructing the proposed line. I am under the impression that the Western Australian Government are prepared to guarantee the working expenses of the line and interest upon it for a certain period. </para>

                            <para>- I have very little doubt that if it were necessary to do so in order to induce the Commonwealth to construct this railway . and thus to obtain communication with the eastern States, the Government of Western Australia would go even further than they have done. Under these circumstances, I cannot see any reason why we should object to a trial survey of the railway being undertaken. The honorable and learned member for Parkes has foreshadowed an amendment providing for the reservation of the land on both sides of the projected line. I do not think it would be wise to amend the Bill in that direction. The proper course for the Federal Government to pursue would be to at once communicate with the Governments of Western Australia and of South Australia, with a view to ascertain what land along the route is held under lease, and also the length of tenure. </para>

                            <para>- I know that a considerable area has recently been leased. I certainly think it would be unwise . to make such an amendment as the honorable and learned member for Parkes suggests, because it might hamper, and, to some extent, frighten the Government of Western Australia. But the Federal Government should ask the Government of that State to refrain from leasing any&#34; more land along the route until the matter shall have been finally dealt with. </para>

                    <para>Western Australia, but the eastern States. If the line be constructed, it will doubtless lead to a large quantity of produce grown in Eastern Australia being sold along the route right through to Kalgoorlie. A wonderful development has taken place in Western Australia, and we have to look to still greater developments. I do not know so much about the agricultural resources of the country. Doubtless they will be materially developed, but a great expansion in the mineral resources of that State will certainly take place. Another Kalgoorlie may not be discovered, but I have no doubt that rich belts of mineral country will be opened up. The construction of this railway would lead to the discovery and development of mineral tracts of country as yet unknown, and, in any event, every additional sovereign produced in any of the States must tend to the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. For these reasons I desire to emphasize my opinion that the Bill should not be trammelled in any way, but that it should be passed, as practically one step towards carrying out the moral undertaking entered into with the people of Western Australia before that State became part and parcel of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the question before us requires very serious consideration. The Bill makes absolutely no provision whatever for that examination of the country which many honorable members supporting the proposed survey believe to be necessary. It provides solely for an engineering survey. The terms of the Bill, so far as my reading of it goes, would absolutely prevent the expenditure of any moneys under it in securing reports on the resources of the country to be traversed, or in making tests to determine whether a water supply is available. If the engineering survey proves that which I take it is the object of the Bill - that a railway can be constructed between the given points - we shall still be in exactly the same position as we occupy to-day, so far as our knowledge of the nature of the country and the possibilities of a permanent water supply is concerned. I am one of those who hold that this preliminary, at- all events, is essentially a State matter. Before asking the Parliament of the Commonwealth to construct the railway the Government of Western Australia should have afforded us that information which many honorable members think should be in our possession. </para>

                            <para>- i have given those reports fair consideration, but they do not contain the information which <inline font-style="italic">1,</inline> in common with many other honorable members, desire. The one great need of the country to be served by the railway is a water supply. The right honorable member for Swan is in a position to give the House better Information on a subject of this kind than perhaps are most other men in Australia. We know that for many years he was engaged in exploration work in Western Austral&#39;.!, and i understand that his reports go to shew that whilst the nature of the country is favorable to a considerable degree, there is no proof of anything like a permanent water supply along the proposed line of route. i would ask the Minister, in reply, to tell the House, first of all, whether the money that we are about to vote will be sufficient to provide for an engineering survey, and also for the geological survey that we believe is necessary, more particularly for the purpose of testing the water supply. Will the Bill, for example, cover the cost of putting down bores ? Will it be possible for the Government, under the terms of the Bill, to expend money on purposes other than that for which it expressly provides? These are fair questions to put to the Minister. i am not opposing this measure because of any direct personal hostility, either to the project itself, or to the State of Western Australia, but i d&#39;o think that at the present time, having regard to the financial position of some at least of the States, it is our bounden duty to take every reasonable precaution before sanctioning expenditure on a work which must ultimately entail an outlay of, roughly speaking,&#163;5,000.000. </para>

                            <para>- I am convinced that the representatives of Western Australia believe they are perfectly justified in urging the construction of the line, and at the same time I believe that they do not object to all reasonable precautions being taken, and to proper tests being made in order that we may determine whether the railway is an undertaking on which the Commonwealth should embark. I cannot believe that representatives of Western Australia desire to plunge the Commonwealth into an expenditure of&#163;5,000,000 on a railway unless they believe there will be some substantial return. That being the case, is it not advisable on their part to assist us in getting such information as will enable the Government to proceed with the work? I repeat that under the terms of the Bill it will not be possible to obtain the information on which the Government could ask the House to sanction the construction of this line. I refuse to believe that either the representatives of Western Australia, the members of the Government, or honorable members who are supporting this Bill, believe &#39;that it is merely a sop - that we are going to spend&#163;18,000 or&#163;20,000 and then allow the matter to drop. I am quite certain that no honorable member would advocate for a moment that we should undertake this survey unless we are prepared to proceed with the construction of the railway. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. If we take the honorable members most directly interested, in a proper sense, in this railway, I believe none would be found to advocate the construction of the line unless the report prove satisfactory. If the report is satisfactory from an engineering standpoint, what will be our position ? We shall then have to pass a vote for the purpose of a geological report, or such a report as will enable us, the engineering conditions being satisfactory, to decide whether the line is warranted. The Bill before us will not enable such a report to be obtained. I ask honorable members to read the Bill, and then say whether it will enable the Government to expend even <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> in obtaining information such as I have indicated. Is there one honorable member who will say that&#163;18,000 is sufficient to obtain a proper engineering survey, and also such a report on the nature of the country as we should have before undertaking a work of the kind ? </para>

                            <para>- And, therefore, they are entitled to all the revenue for which they are prepared to tax themselves. The Federal. Government has almost reached the expenditure limit of 25 per cent, and if we embark on works of the character now under consideration we shall find the Government compelled to resort to direct taxation, because, very fortunately for some of the States, 75 per cent, of the Customs revenue must be returned for a few years longer. Unless we are prepared to face this question, and provide a sufficient sum to enable us to obtain all information, and then, if that information is satisfactory, to proceed with the construction of the railway, we ought not to pass this Bill. If we do pass the measure, we should tell the people of Australia that we are doing so in good faith; and if the survey report is satisfactory, it is the bounden duty of the Government to give effect to the decision of the House. I do not believe there is an honorable member who is deliberately attempting to fool the people of Western Australia, and if that be so, the work ought to be proceeded with in the event of a satisfactory report. That must be the result, unless we are deliberately passing this Bill merely to afford the people of Western Australia a barren satisfaction. Is the Federal Government, or the Parliament, or the States prepared to undertake at the present time, or even in a short time, an expenditure of&#163;5, 000,000 or &#163;6, 000,000? I am one of those who believe that we are not prepared for that expenditure, and, in that belief, I shall have to vote against the Bill. But if the Bill be passed we should insert a provision such as has. been suggested by the honorable member for New England and the honorable and learned member for Parkes, to provide that there shall be at least some chance of the Commonwealth obtaining a return for the money expended. I was absent for. some little time this morning, attending a fruit conference, but I heard two or three honorable members from Western Australia say that they were prepared, and that they believed the people and Government- of Western Australia were prepared, to make a land reservation along the line of railway, to be handed over to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Then, I hope that the people of South Australia will very soon take the matter into their own hands, and see that these monopolies are broken down. But if that State were as honest and anxious as Western Australia in this matter, I believe that it could be arranged by those States without reference to the Federal Parliament. That I think would be the infinitely preferable way. At the present time we have not a mile of Federal railway, and we are now asked to embark upon the construction of a Federal line to dove-tail in . between States&#39; railways, and the resulting complications might be very serious. </para>

                    <para>Mr.Mcwilliams.-If the states railways were federalized, the only question we should have to consider would be, is this railway of such a character that we could seriously and reasonably sanction its construction at the cost of the people of the Commonwealth ? I do not wish to look at this proposal too much from a State point of view. But I would invite honorable members to remember that the two States which have the smallest populations, and whose public revenues are somewhat seriously embarrassed are Queensland and Tasmania. From a direct stand-point neither of those States can possibly hope to obtain the slightest advantage from the construction of this railway. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to be led into a discussion of the merits or demerits of the different States, nor shall&#34; I attempt to pit one State against another. But I would remind those who ask us to consider this question in a Federal spirit to remember that we also can ask them to look at it in a Federal spirit, and bear in mind that if the cost of the Commonwealth were increased, it would be done directly at the expense of the people of Queensland and Tasmania, upon whom direct taxation would have to be imposed to make good the deficiency in their revenues. Holding, as I do first, that this project more directly concerns Western Australia and South Australia, and that, therefore, before the Commonwealth is asked to incur any expenditure, they should furnish that information which we are now asked to obtain ; secondly, that the Bill is of such a character, that, if passed, it would not enable the Government to get such information as the House would be satisfied with, before it could authorize the construction of the railway; and, thirdly, which is a more important consideration with me, that the finances of two States are in such a condition that the passing of this vote might ultimately have the effect of imposing direct taxation upon their people, I shall have to oppose the motion. But if the second reading be carried I shall assist those who will attempt- to place in the Bill at least some provision by which the Commonwealth would be able to get back a direct return for the outlay which it is asked to incur. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The honorable member for Hume said that one stipulation upon which his vote for the construction qf this railway would depend would be that its gauge should be 4ft. 8jin., as in New South Wales. The gauge is 3ft. 6in. from Port Augusta to Terowie and from Terowie to Cockburn, 5ft. 3m. from Terowie to Adelaide and from Adelaide to Melbourne, and 4ft. 8&#189;in. from Cobar to Sydney. The honorable member has indicated that his anxiety is to make Kalgoorlie, as it were, a suburb of Sydney. I do not mean to suggest that he deliberately advocates that a gauge of 4ft. 8&#189;in. should be adopted for this connecting link, with a view to preventing any traffic from going down from Adelaide to Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- As part of a general scheme altering the railway gauges throughout Australia to a standard gauge, which undoubtedly is the 4ft. 8 1/2in gauge, there might be no objection to it. It is rather much to expect South Australians to be enthusiastic for the construction, of a line, when the conditions on which it is proposed to construct it, would simply prevent the settled portions of their State from deriving the smallest benefit from it. On the part of those who think this line advisable and a proper undertaking far the Commonwealth, it is a great mistake to put forward that kind of argument, and to lay down conditions which must necessarily arouse antagonism in States to whose interests those conditions would be diametrically opposed. I do not object to the survey of this line, but before I would agree to its construction I should certainly stipulate that the northern route, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Tarcoola, and not that along the sea-coast, should be adopted. If the northern route were adopted, it is probable that it would lead to the development of some country. It would take the line through country the value of which is at present but little known. From the information which has been supplied by the Government Geologist of South Australia, it is known that a very large area of that country is within the mineral and gold- bearing belt, and there is a possibility, and perhaps a strong probability, of development along that line. If the southern route <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Eucla were adopted, the railway would be for all time in competition with sea carriage, which is the most serious competition that any railway could face. Further, if that route were adopted, there could be no possibility of the development of any fresh country. It goes through limestone country the whole way. The honorable member for Grey knows the route very well, and has travelled it a great many times, and I have been over a great portion of it. We have both been over the northern route as far, at any rate, as Tarcoola, and the potentialities of the two routes cannot be compared. I intend to vote for the second reading of the Bill. The construction of the railway is another matter altogether, and it will have to depend upon the results of the proposed survey. I must not be understood for a moment as in any sense pledging myself to vote for the construction of the railway, but I do think it is worth while to ascertain which is the best route for such a line, and what are the possibilities of development to which it would give rise. Even the carrying out of the survey might lead to the development of some country. I had not the pleasure of hearing the speech of the honorable and learned member for Parkes, and I have not up to the present grasped the advantages of the amendment which he has foreshadowed. </para>

                            <para>- The reservation which the honorable and learned member suggests, would include much of the mineral country which has been proved to exist along the line between Tarcoola and Port Augusta. It would take in country where there are enormous deposits of &#39;copper ore of low grade, which so far have not been worked,, chiefly because of the cost of carriage. This country is well worth developing, .and whether the Commonwealth undertake the construction of this railway or not, I feel sure that the Tarcoola district will, before many years are past, justify the State in the construction of a line. The honorable member&#39; for Robertson told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline> Charles Todd has said that the construction of the telegraph line was a mistake, because, temporarily, it has not paid; but as a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd recommended the construction of the line. </para>

                            <para>- I have not the least fear that the Tarcoola field will turn out to be a very valuable field. The district is to a very large extent gold-bearing, and it is certainly worthy of careful prospecting. If it had railway communication there is no doubt it would be developed to a very much greater extent than it can be now, when the cost of the carriage of ore is so very high. Supplies have been carried on camels for a considerable time, and of course the cost involved is so high as to be prohibitive of mining development unless with very high returns. As I believe that there are possibilities of considerable mining development along the line between Tarcoola and Port Augusta, and between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, I intend to vote for this measure. From the point of view of agricultural or pastoral development I am not sanguine as to the prospects of the proposed line. The country, so far as is known, is not suited for these purposes. The Gawler Range country is practically deserted. There are practically neither sheep nor cattle on that country now. </para>

                            <para>- There were up to about 1893. Probably drought had something to do with the desertion of the country, and the low price of wool coming after the drought, followed by the inroads of the rabbits, would also be factors. A very large amount of development took place as the result of men going there with plenty of money. But not much money has been ma&#34;de on the Gawler Range country. However, it would not be traversed if the line took a more northerly route, in which case it would pass through a much better pastoral district,&#39; the run-holders there having managed to maintain their footing, and in some cases to do exceedingly well, even in very ba&#39;d seasons. While I believe that the survey of the proposed route is justifiable, and shall therefore vote for the Bill, I do not pledge myself to vote for the construction of the proposed railway until I&#39; have seen the reports of the surveyors. </para>

                        <para>- The vi.ry handsome majority which was obtained for the motion for the appropriation of money for the purposes of this Bill was very much appreciated by the people of Western Australia, who, as I have remarked before in this Chamber, have long felt that hitherto they have not reaped any of the practical and tangible benefits from Federation which the other States have received, although they have borne their share of the cost. They regard the vote to which I refer as an assurance that their claim that this great work should be at least considered is recognised. Although we understand that some of those who voted for the resolution, and will vote for this Bill, do not pledge themselves to vote for the construction of the proposed&#34; railway, we are sanguine that when the survey and accompanying explorations are made, we shall have such a tale to tell that the opposition to the proposal will not be greater than the present opposition to the Bill. I wish to express my gratification that only three members of the Labour Party voted against the motion, though it was in no sense a party question. I should like now to deal with one or two objections which have been raised to this proposal. The honorable&#34; member for Franklin has complained that Western. Australia has not done all that she should have done in preparing reports on the scheme. He thinks that she should have gone to the length of making the survey, a suggestion with which I shall deal later on. As for ordinary information, the Government of the State has done all that a Government could do to obtain it, and to place it before the House, and I regret that the1 speeches of some honorable members indicate that they have not made that study of the reports which have been furnished to them which they might reasonably have been expected to make. Had they done so, we should not have heard some of the statements which have been made in regard to the absence of water and the nature of the country to be traversed. I sympathize as much as any one does with the Governments of those States which are in financial difficulties. Both Tasmania and Queensland are struggling with a shortage of funds, and are straining every nerve to make up deficiencies. But they are not alone. Western Australia has to face similar difficulties. We may be in a better position to meet our obligations ; but it must be remembered that we have a falling revenue, and that the special means of revenue which we now enjoy under the Constitution will shortly come to an end. Those who referred to the poverty of their own States as a reason for not voting for the proposed survey must therefore remember that Western Australia is also being called upon to use extra efforts to make1 both ends meet. It seemed to me that the honorable member for Laanecoorie took a very narrow view of this question. His attitude reminded me of the struggles which have taken place in our States Legislatures in regard to railway proposals. Frequently proposals for the construction of railways, which had everything to recommend them, have been shelved for a long time, owing to the predominance of local considerations. I am afraid that a similar spirit has been introduced into this debate, because the honorable member for Laanecoorie and others have made the question one of State against State. Victoria owes much of its prosperity to its railways. The settlement of the country, and the development of its resources have been possible only because enterprising public men in years gone by built railways to places which were then uninhabited. Therefore, those who urge hat we should wait for population to extend along the route of the proposed railway before entering upon its construction, ignore all the lessons of our past experience. The railway would help to develop the country, and those honorable members who are in favour of inducing people to come here, and of providing facilities for settlement, should at least be consistent, and support an enterprise which will do more to open up the continent than many anticipate. With reference to the proposal for the reservation of land along the line of route, I am glad that the honorable and learned member for Parkes has advanced so far along the line of democratic legislation as to advocate the principle of the nationalization of land. It will be refreshing to his constituents, and to the democrats of Australia generally, to find the honorable and learned member, who is so notoriously conservative, adopting such an attitude. I desire, however, to know exactly what he means. If he proposes that the Commonwealth should construct the line only upon what would practically amount to the land grant system, I join issue with him at once. If he insists that before even the survey is entered upon the States of Western Australia and South Australia shall hand over a certain portion of their territory to :the Commonwealth, he is raising an entirely new consideration. If, on the other hand, he desires merely to prevent private land speculators from deriving the advantage of the increased value given to the land by the construction of the railway, I am perfectly in accord with him. I am quite sure that that was all the honorable member for New England intended. He wished to prevent private speculators from doing as they have done so often, namely, securing the land along the line of the proposed railway, and simply waiting for the State to spend its money in order that their profits might be secured. We are willing that that should be done, but we do not .think that the States should be treated as if they were private speculators. If it be held that some return should be made by the States which derive the greatest benefit from the construction of the line, I would point out that Western Australia has already proved her sincerity, and has shown herself willing to make every effort in her power to recoup any loss that may accrue. </para>

                            <para>- One-eleventh, in addition to her own share. She has shown, also that she is prepared to deal in a liberal spirit in respect to any loss that&#39; the Commonwealth itself may suffer. In view of these three distinct offers, I think I can. claim that Western Australia is at least prepared to pay for her portion of the unearned increment. If honorable members want to put the screw on, and to insist upon our handing a large slice of our territory over to the Commonwealth, I think they are going too &#39; far. If the consent of Western Australia to join the Federal Union had been given subject to the condition that the railway should be constructed, there would have been no objection to such a provision as that now suggested. The same principle that was applied to New South Wales in connexion with the granting of territory for the purposes of the Federal Capital Site, might reasonably have operated in regard to the construction of the proposed railway, if that had been in the bond. But I contend that it is unfair to insist upon taking from us- a slice of our territory, in consideration of the construction of a railway to which we contend we are unconditionally entitled. The railway itself is naturally a Federal work. If the capitals of the other States had not been connected by rail - if, for instance, Sydney and Brisbane had not been so connected- - the strongest representations would have been made, and rightly so, by honorable members from New South Wales and Queensland for the construction of the necessary line by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is my misfortune that I cannot view this question in that broad, Federal spirit which seems to animate some honorable members. Queensland should not be asked to contribute any money towards the construction of a railway such as that now proposed. The line would pass through territory which, so far as we know, is a desert. If the country had been any good, it. would have been taken up by capitalists long ago. Some honorable members have referred to the probabilities of obtaining abundant supplies of artesian water, whilst others have expressed the belief that valuable mineral deposits will be brought . to light. If the country is mineralized, however, no artesian water will be struck, because artesian water is obtained only in country of cretaceous formation, which never occurs in a mineral belt. As is well known, ever since Queensland joined the Commonwealth she has suffered a very considerable loss of revenue, and I object to that State making any contribution towards the cost of a survey of the proposed line. If Western Australia and South Australia desire to obtain the benefits which a Transcontinental Railway would confer they should at least defray the expense connected with a trial survey of the route to be traversed. The Commonwealth would then be in a position to decide whether or not it should undertake the construction of the line. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may take all the kanakas and all the black, brown, and brindle population of Queensland. We do not want them. I maintain that the Commonwealth is paying nothing whatever for the abolition of the: kanakas. As a matter of fact, it is deriving a revenue from the sugar which is produced exclusively by white labour. I fail to see that the proposed railway will confer any benefit upon the States other than South Australia and Western Australia. Queensland is in a very impecunious position at the present time. Relatively to population, she is burdened with one of the heaviest national debts in the world, and I object to that State being called upon to make any contribution towards the construction of a Transcontinental Railway. I know that my constituents share my views upon this question. I would further point out that if this line is ever built it will not pay for axle grease. Reference has been made to the gold-fields. I was engaged in mining some few years ago, and, speaking as a practical man, I believe that the Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie goldfields will decline within a few years. </para>

                        <para>- Like the honorable member for Capricornia, I am opposed to this Bill, lock, stock, and barrel. If the Prime Minister would introduce a Bill providing for the construction of a railway from Port Darwin to Longreach, in Central Queensland, I should have no hesitation in supporting the measure, because that line would benefit the whole of the Commonwealth. Some time ago the right honorable member for Swan, in a fit of sanity or insanity, declared that only last year a profit of&#163;4,000,000 was made out of the mines in Western Australia. </para>

During my membership of the Queensland Parliament, various sums were placed on the Estimates to enable permanent surveys of projected lines to be made, but in no instance was the amount first set apart for the work found to be sufficient, and the Government were compelled to come down to the House with a request for a further vote. If the provision now proposed to be made be insufficient, we shall have to agree to a further expenditure to complete the survey. I am satisfied that &#163;100,000 will barely complete it. </para>

After all, the people have to find the money. -I should not be faithful to the trust reposed in me by my constituents if I were to agree to the placing of this additional shackle upon them at the present time. The Treasurer of Queensland is at a loss to know how to keep the State expenditure within its income, and now we are asked to impose a further burden on Queensland in common with the other States. I do not wish to pay special attention to the position, of Queensland. The cost of this work will have to be borne by all the States, and we do not know what expenditure will be necessary in time to come in the construction of this railway. I am sorry to find myself in disagreement with the right honorable member for Swan in regard to this Bill, but I know that he will accept my criticism in the spirit in which it is offered. If I could see my way clear, consistently with my duty to my constituents, to vote for the Bill, I should do so, but in the present circumstances I do not think it would be right for me to support it. </para>

                        <para>- I intend1 to vote for this Bill, not in the interests of Western Australia, but because I believe it was part of the Federal compact that the Transcontinental Railway should be&#34; constructed by the Commonwealth. I shall also vote for the Bill, because I believe that the Federal Union will never be complete until this line has been made. Another reason why I support the measure is that I think the making of the survey will do much to open up the great mineral resources of the west - the fringe of which some of us have been privileged to visit - and take away the workless workers of the east, who desire to reach the rich gold stores of the western State. It will open up new country and fresh markets, and bring about that real union at which the Federation aims. I am- unable to see how we shall ever be able properly to defend the Commonwealth until we are in a position to convey our troops by rail from east to west. A number of other reasons might be advanced in support of this measure. and it is singular that honorable members should &#34; harp &#34; upon the Government proposal, more particularly when the Bill now before us provides for an expenditure of only &#163;&#34;20,000. </para>

                            <para>- We require further information as to the nature of the country. In many of the States large sums have been expended in surveying the routes. of projected railways, and in some cases the information so obtained has been such that even some of the warmest advocates of the lines have declined to further advocate their construction. A vast tract of the country through which the Transcontinental Railway would pass remains practically unexplored, and the carrying out of the survey may open up new avenues of employment for tens of thousands of persons. If it results in the discovery of only another Golden Mile something will have been accomplished. Fresh discoveries of mineral wealth are being made almost every week in the western State. We have tens of thousands of idle men in the eastern States, and they would be glad to find employment in the west. In these circumstances it seems to me little short of marvellous that honorable members should hesitate to expend , &#163;20,000 in obtaining the information necessary to guide us in coming to a decision in regard to the construction of the line. Even from the point of view of the mineral resources that may be developed by the making of this survey, we shall certainly be justified in going on with the work. If in any of the other States the prospect of discovering a new gold-field - of opening up a new avenue of employment, and finding fresh scope for business people - were one-fifth, or even one-tenth, as great as that which this undertaking offers, how readily those who guide the destinies of that State would expend the money necessary to further that development. </para>

                            <para>- The hon- or able and learned member for Parkes takes up the position that the Commonwealth should not &#39;be&#39; asked to bear this expenditure. I have heard him say again and again that the Union should be a thorough one, and that we should not look at the questions &#39; which from time to time come before us from a provincial standpoint. What if a &#39; work proposed to&#39; be undertaken by the&#39; Commonwealth would be slightly more advantageous to South Australia/ Western Australia, or Queensland than to the other States? Why view these matters from a provincial aspect? This is a Federal undertaking. It was part of the Federal compact, and if Western Australia had insisted on its being provided for in the Constitution itself, no doubt its request would have been gladly granted. </para>

My honorable friend, of course, asks the question because he thinks that the right honorable member for Swan should have stood out more strongly than he did for provision being made in the Constitution for the building of the railway, or that it was due to his unsophisticated nature that he did not demand as much as he might have done. Perhaps he considered that there were other concessions which it would be impossible </para>

I, too, view this matter from the stand-point of New South Wales, and I know that there are many men in that State who are out of employment, and desire a chance to reach the gold-fields df the west. . They also need the new markets which this railway will enable them to secure. Consequently, I shall&#39; support the Bill. We are not asked to take a leap in the dark. We are simply called upon to vote for the making of a survey in order to obtain information that will guide us in determining whether the railway should be made. Any one who has visited the west must recognise that, after all, prospecting has not been carried on there to any very considerable extent, prospectors being handicapped in going out to the backblocks by want of water and other difficulties. But looking at the possibilities of that great State, honorable members must be strongly disposed to follow the lead of its representatives. They now call upon us to help them to open up this territory, assuring us that if we do so, we shall discover fresh avenues of employment for our people, and cause other cities to spring up like those which have already grown in the west - like mushrooms in &#34;the night. </para>

If I could find that the construction of the line was provided for in the Constitution accepted by the people of Western Australia in. common with those of the other States, I should vote for the Bill; but I have failed to discover any reference to it in the Constitution, or to find that there was any Federal compact which would justify us in making this survey. </para>

                            <para>- The argument that the railway is necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth has frequently been used ; but as I dealt with that phase of the question when the matter was before us on a previous occasion,. I shall not now refer to it. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro has spoken of the large number of men in New South Wales, and other States, who are &#39;anxious to obtain employment, and would readily go to the west. Surely we are not asked to believe that the unemployed in Victoria, New South Wales, or any&#39; part of eastern Australia would travel west by this railway if it were constructed ? Such persons could not afford the high fares which will be charged, and would inevitably choose the cheaper route by sea. </para>

                            <para>- If the railway for which the honorable member is so anxious were constructed, it would still be cheaper to travel to Fremantle by sea, and thence by rail to the gold-fields. If Tasmanian politicians had been as wide awake as was the right honorable member for Swan, that State would have been able to retain its Customs revenue. But the Tasmanian representatives did not ask for that privilege before the Constitution was voted on, and we are now willing to abide by the bargain which was then made. In my opinion, however, Tasmania was very badly treated when she was not allowed to keep her Customs revenue for a time. I do not think that we have any right to vote any sum of money for railways until the States&#39; railways have been taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I have supported this proposal up to the present stage, but I confess I cannot become so enthusiastic on the subject as was the honorable member for. Eden-Monaro a few minutes ago. The Bill before us leads us into new avenues, and we ought to consider very carefully before we commit ourselves. In the first place, the States have not seen fit to hand over the control of the railways to the Federal Parliament. If the administration of the railways had been one of the transferred functions, the proposal before us would have merited very earnest consideration. At present, however, we are prac&#39;tically asked to initiate a work which tha States primarily interested do not seem disposed to undertake. No doubt this is a very large project, and its magnitude may be one reason why the States I have indicated are not disposed to further it. But I cannot think that the construction of such a railway will bring about the great development which the honorable member for Eden-Monaro would lead us to suppose. If that were so, this project would invite almost immediate State action. I have supported this proposal hitherto, and I shall give it my vote to-day, because I recognise that the people of Western Australia received, in effect, a promise that something in this direction would be done as an inducement to them to enter into the Federal compact. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that is so, and while there is no provision in the Constitution like that, for instance, relating to the Federal Capital, I am prepared, as far as I can, to honour the understanding then arrived a&#39;t. One reason why I think we ought to consider a vote of this kind is that it affects two State&#39;s - that it is not wholly confined to one State. True, the project affects one State more than another, but neither Western Australia nor South Australia can a&#39;dvance without the assistance and co-operation of the other. It seems to me that by making this exploratory survey we may induce those two States to undertake the actual work of construction. If, after we pass this Bill to-day, we are called upon to consider the propriety of expending money on the actual construction, a new issue will be raised, which I must then consider. I wish to say, however, that in voting for the proposal before us, I do not feel that I am pledging myself or my State to the carrying out of this particular work. We are simply paving a way for the States primarily interested to combine in order to carry out the work. </para>

                        THOMSON (Minister of Home Affairs - North Sydney). - I shall refer very briefly to some points which have been raised in the course of the debate. First, I think the discussion has taken lines that should precede a Bill for the construction of a railway, rather than lines that should precede a proposal for a mere survey. The honorable member for Bass said that there was nothing in the Constitution engaging the Commonwealth to construct such a railway ; and with that we must all agree. But I think it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the majority of honorable members that when, during the discussion of the Constitution, the other States decided- that Western Australia, owing to that isolation, would not, and could not, in her own interests, enter the Union,, the &#39;people of that State were induced, by certain promises, if not of the removal of that isolation, at least, of an inquiry into the practicability of its removal, to come to a decision which rather surprised the people of the eastern States.

                            <para>- As to certain proposals which have been made, and which I fear may prove hampering proposals, I am perfectly at one with tho.v honorable members who wish , to preserve to the Commonwealth and to the States the increment in value which will be given to lands along this railway line if it is ever constructed. But by endeavouring to put such a condition into this Bill, those honorable members are practically giving into the hands of South Australia- a State, the Government of which have been of late more or less antagonistic to the proposed construction of this line - what ought to be retained in the hands of the Commonwealth. That, I think, is not desirable. I quite agree that it is desirable, in the negotiations which must take place with the Governments of those two States, the Commonwealth Government should see that satisfactory arrangements are made before the survey is proceeded with. But I do not think that we should put in are Act of Parliament a rigid provision which might not be capable of being adhered to by the States concerned, and which omitted a great many other things equally important which ought to form part of the negotiations prior to any survey being made. That is my opinion on that matter, and I hope that it will receive from honorable members their consideration. Several suggestions, and very proper ones, have been made by the honorable member for Newcastle and1 the honorable member for Grampians, as re-, gard&#39;s testing the country for minerals, for pastoral purposes, and for water supply. These, of course, should receive consideration. I do not see that that can be done out of this survey vote. It must be a matter for united action by the States, in whose interests settlement would take place on the lands, mining enterprises would be developed, and - apart from the supply of water for railway purposes - a discovery of water would be made. The proposed vote is not sufficient to enable the Commonwealth, to undertake these inquiries. But I think that when an expedition for one purpose was crossing the territory, the States concerned might arrange for united action in those other directions. I do not. think I have any more to say, except to refer to the statement by the honorable member for Franklin, that he would be perfectly willing that a survey should be made by the State of Western. Australia, and that a decision should be come to on that report. We have had several reports from that source. I think that any report ought to be such as would command respect from this Parliament, not merely as regards the capacity of its compiler, but also as regards the unbiased position of those who superintended the work of the survey. For these reasons, especially for the very important reason that I think Western Australia has a claim to satisfaction, so far as an inquiry goes, I support the proposal. I recognise that there will be a great many questions to be faced after a survey is made. We shall have to consider all the information which the report may contain, and, further, to face the very important financial consideration, not merely whether the line shall be constructed, but whether it shall be constructed immediately, or at a later period. But as regards gathering information and seeking to satisfy the people of Western Australia that we are determined not to keep them isolated, but to carry out what they were led to expect before Federation - an inquiry to see if we can remove the isolation - I think that the Bill should receive from every honorable member favorable consideration. </para>
