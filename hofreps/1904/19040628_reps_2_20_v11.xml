Can he give an explanation of the reason for the wide difference between the rates of remuneration paid to officers of similar grade in Victoria and New South Wales? </para>

My attention has not so far been drawn to the anomalies complained of, but if the honorable member will place a question upon the notice paper, pointing out the anomalies alleged to exist, I shall have the matter inquired into. As I have al-, ready indicated, the Government do not hold themselves responsible for anything but the policy involved in the scheme of the Public Service Commissioner. </para>

The conditions of life in Hay and Deniliquin, for instance, are practically the same, yet living allowances are granted to officers in one town and not to officers in. the other. I ask the honorable gentleman to cause inquiries to be made to see whether these necessary allowances cannot be given to all officers stationed within a similar area. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member must see that the machinery of the Act itself allows of any anomalies being corrected in a proper way. The officers have the opportunity to appeal and surely it is only to be expected that they should exhaust the machinery which the Act ' itself provides before taking up the time of Parliament. If any number of honorable members desire to discuss the policy embodied in the scheme, I shall be quite willing to facilitate a discussion upon any motion which may be tabled with that object in view. But I ask honorable members not to precipitate a discussion, and take up the time of Parliament in debating whether individual members of the service have been properly treated. </para>

                            <para>- It must be remembered that three States have undertaken pecuniary responsibilities in respect to the Pacific Cable, and we must have regard to their interests. I do not think that it is likely that' the Earl of Jersey will be biased. He has had a good deal of experience, and. is recognised everywhere as a shrewd man. Seeing that he knows the feeling of the Commonwealth oil the subject fairly well, it is more than unlikely that he will do anything to which we can take exception. Furthermore, the work of the Conference is purely consultative, not legislative. Its members will act on instructions from their respective Governments, and can do nothing effective without the consent of those Governments. </para>

                        <para>- I have within the last few minutes received a letter from the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Copeland, in reference to the Pacific Cable Conference. In that letter he stated that he had just arrived in England, and had not received his commission to sit on the Board, but that Lord Jersey was about to retire, and that the effect would be that New South Wales would have only one representative on the Board, instead of two. I hope that the Prime Minister will make inquiries into the subject, so that New South Wales may have the representation to which it is entitled. I will give him a copy of the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Copeland. </para>

                        <para>- As the Prime Minister has already pointed out. our representative on the Conference will be instructed definitely to pursue a certain course, and he will be expected to confine himself to his instructions. These will be prepared by the Cabinet, which will therefore be responsible. At the same time, I am not aware that the Earl of Jersey would be in any way biased. Indeed, we are somewhat circumscribed in the area of our choice.' We must have a representative who can proceed to the Conference immediately, because a meeting is .to take place before the end of July. Under these circumstances <inline font-style="italic">we think we may safely rely upon the</inline> Earl of Jersey to carry out the instructions which may be conveyed to him by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- The question of observing neutrality in the war between Japan and Russia came before the Ministry almost immediately after they had assumed office. I daresay that it had also engaged the attention of our predecessors. Of course, there is no intention, so far as the Ministry are concerned, to permit of any action that would constitute a breach of the neutrality regulations laid down by the King. We have received proclamations on that head from the Imperial Government, and nothing has occurred, so far, which, in our view, has in the slightest degree broken the neutrality which it is so desirable to observe in a case of this kind. As to this particular allegation, I have no knowledge, nor has the Minister of Trade and Customs, of any clearances of vessels carrying contraband of war for Japan, during the time "we have been in office. Of course, if people clear their vessels for other ports, and, after arriving there, determine to send their goods on to Japan at their own risk, that is a matter with which we have nothing to do. So far as I am aware, there has been no breach of the neutrality regulations by British citizens going from Australia, and the Minister of Trade and Customs informs me that every step has been taken to guard against any breach of the character indicated. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the right honorable member for Swan last week, the Postmaster-General stated that as the result of cablegrams being sent by the Pacific Cable, instead of by the Eastern route, the revenue of the South Australian Telegraph Department had been affected to the extent of only <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> is. 4d., during a period of eleven months. I should like to know what we are to understand from that answer. Prior to the existence of the Pacific Cable the whole of the cable business was transmitted by the Eastern route, and, therefore, passed over the South Australian lines. I desire to know whether it is intended to convey that the opening of the Pacific Cable has had no substantial effect upon the revenue of .the South Australian Telegraph Department ? </para>

                        <para>- The regulation to which the honorable member refers was made by the late Government I have not seen the exact terms of the minute in question, but since I have presided over the Department all these cases have been sent on to the police court. In one instance I know that an officer was suspended for being short in his cash to the extent of 30s., and others were similarly treated for minor deficiencies. Every case in which any defalcations have been disclosed, or in which an officer has embezzled money, has been sent on to the police court. Whether or not the regulation is too drastic is a matter of opinion. All I can say at present is. that I will reconsider it, with a view to ascertaining if it is possible to modify it. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to intimate to honorable members that I intend, if possible, to-morrow - certainly not later than Thursday - to ask the House to go into Committee of Supply for the purpose of 'granting a sum for the Treasurer's advance vote, which will be available during the first month or so of the next financial year. As honorable members are aware, the financial year closes upon 30th June, and all votes for the current year lapse upon that date. In the absence of some such provision as I propose, the Treasurer would find himself without any money with which to meet emergencies. The same practice was adopted last year. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know of any better. That is the trouble. I admit that any system which intrusts the spending of money to the discretion of an individual is bad. But a better plan is not easily evolved. Some time ago I promised the honorable and learned member for Corinella to make the sum that is annually voted for the purpose of clothing the military forces - which represents <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> or 30s. per head - available as soon as possible this year, so that they might proceed with the ordering of their uniforms. That will involve a sum of ,£50,000 in anticipation of the vote which is granted every year. These two sums I propose to include in the Supply Bill, and nothing more. </para>

                    <para>.When the Committee, on the occasion of its last sitting, decided in favour of the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corinella, I asked that you, sir, should report progress, and thus give the Government an opportunity of considering the effect of the alteration that had just been made in the clause. I stated then that in my opinion - hurriedly arrived at - the proposal cut into the heart of the clause, and affected materially the general purpose of the measure. The Government still hold that view. We think that the clause in its present shape absolutely fails to meet the desires of those who are anxious to see this Bill passed into law in an effective shape. We propose to ask the Committee to reconsider that position so soon as we arrive at the recommittal stage. In the meantime we propose to go on with the other clauses of the Bill, and, having considered those, we trust that the Committee will arrive at a conclusion different from that at which they arrived on Friday afternoon. I have only this to add - that in my view it is more than probable that if the matter had been argued out on Friday a number of honorable members would have arrived at a different conclusion. Of course, I admit that' we had a considerable amount of discussion on the general question of preference to unionists, but in the laudable anxiety to get the Bill through there had been no attempt made to analyze the phraseology of this particular clause and the additions to it. </para>

                    <para>- Of course, we all know, in our parliamentary experience, that it is a very rare thing for the Minister in charge of a measure to move the Chairman out of the chair and to suspend business in relation to that measure upon a certain division being arrived at. It is an unusual procedure. It is a procedure to which grave significance must attach; and I said at the time - speaking, as the Prime Minister did, hurriedly - that I thought he had taken the proper course. I made that remark because it did seem to me that from the point of view of the Ministry the amendment carried was a vital matter, and must be a vital matter. That was the view I took. . But it is of course for the Ministry to decide for themselves all these matters- as to whether they will regard as vital any amendment that is made. This request for an opportunity - or rather, this intimation of a desire to have another opportunity - of- putting this matter before the Committee, may not be based upon very substantial grounds in so far as there may be any anticipation of any different result ; but it is a course which every Ministry is entitled to take, and no fair-minded man who opposes a Ministry will endeavour for a moment to interfere with such a course. Every Ministry in charge of an important measure, which comes to think that there is a vital difficulty in their way, created by an alteration of their Bill, is entitled to have another opportunity to submit the matter to the .Committee. I think the members of the two Oppositions, who sit here - I ' can usually speak only for my own friends, but I think that on this occasion I can also speak for honorable members generally upon this side of the Chamber - agree that, while there may be no possible prospect of a change in the decision of the Committee being arrived at. the Ministry are fully entitled to ask us to consider the propriety of recommitting the Bill with a view to reconsider this particular matter. I must frankly .say that if I were in the position of the Prime Minister, I should take exactly the same course. There is always a difficulty in these matters in a Prime Minister's way. He wishes to be candid, and he wishes, also, to emphasize fully the significance of the matter, and yet, at the same time, he naturally does not desire to seem to exercise any sort of compulsion, or to offer any sort of threat in connexion with the subject to which he proposes to invite the attention of the Committee. I admit the difficulties of such a position, as I think every one must do; and I think that the Prime Minister has taken the proper course. So far as I am concerned, I offer no objection to it. </para>

                <para class="block">In speaking at an earlier stage of the debate upon this clause, I pointed out that, whilst I did not wish to- go to the extreme length of voting against preference altogether, because to do so might impair the efficiency of the scheme, I desired that it should be surrounded with certain safeguards and securities to prevent its operating injuriously or oppressively, it might be, to those workmen who were not members of a registered organization. The tendency of I he clause would naturally be to force men to join the organizations. We have recently noticed what the effect was in a case in Sydney in connexion with the Wharf Labourers' Union. It occurred to me that when men entered organizations under pressure, so to speak, they might not receive that fair play to which they are undoubtedly entitled. I have been shown clauses in awards made by the New South Wales Arbitration Court, in which the secretaries of the registered organizations are required to prepare lists of their members who are capable and willing to accept work. These lists are produced to the employers, and the workmen are picked out from them. I think it is quite possible that in the preparation of these lists, Which practically place the patronage in the distribution of employment in the hands of the secretaries of the unions, rather than in the hands of the employers themselves, a certain amount of favoritism might creep, in, and that, perhaps, men who were not in the inner circle of a trades union might be elbowed out of work, while those who were in the confidence of the union might receive preference from the union officials in obtaining employment. That is the reason why I am anxious that if, after, a preference has been conceded by the Court, it is found that the rules of a union are unjust, or oppressive, or that any workmen are treated unfairly or harshly bv the timors, those who have ground for complaint may have a legal right to ask the Court in a summary manner to suspend or modify the preference. The Court would then dictate terms to the trades union. If it found that the union had exercised the preference in an unfair way, or that the effect of its exercise would be unfair, the Court might suspend the preference, and if necessary wipe it out altogether. I can see no reasonable objection to a modification such as this, which does not in any way impair the efficiency of the grant of preference, but merely provides that if, after the grant of preference, it is found that an organization is acting in a tyrannical or aggressive manner, the Court may interfere to stop it. That is only a fair power to give to the Court, and no reasonably minded trades unionist could object to such a modification of the clause. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to the amendment. I had already indicated a willingness to accept from the honorable and learned member for Ballarat an amendment of an almost similar purport, though certainly it was proposed to insert it at a later stage in the Bill. The effect aimed at in this amendment is the same. The feeling the Government have in this matter is that there should not be an attempt to make a union a close corporation, or at any rate, that if such an attempt is made, it should not be assisted by the provisions of this measure. We are quite at one with the honorable and learned member for Bendigo and other honorable members in that view. I am, therefore, quite prepared to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to suggest a verbal amendment of the amendment. If the phrase, "if it be proved," be strictly interpreted, it might have the effect of placing very great difficulties in the way of any employe' who desires to show that an organization is acting unfairly towards him. He may have to come from a great distance to give strictly technical proof that the object of the section is being defeated'. I suggest, therefore, that the expression used should be, " if in the opinion of the Court." </para>

                    <para>- I hope that, in accepting this amendment, the Government are not losing sight of a possible danger which it involves. While I am quite with them in agreeing that unions should not be allowed to become close corporations, I point out that in the matter of craft unions the members of those organizations are to a very great extent responsible for the qualification of their men as tradesmen. That is to say, they insist upon a man giving evidence of some skill and fitness in the particular trade represented before he can become a member of a craft union. It sometimes happens in connexion with all craft unions that without being in any way qualified to call themselves tradesmen or mechanics, men make application to become members, because they have a smattering of knowledge of one branch of the trade. In such a case, craft unions do the industry they represent a service by saying to such an applicant - " No ; in our opinion you are not qualified to become a "member of this society, and to take work as a tradesman in this particular industry." No one will object, I am sure, to a power exercised by craft unions which tends to maintain the standard of workmanship. But there is a danger underlying this amendment.

                        <para>- I point out that the amendment of the amendment makes the proposal more drastic, and is calculated to accentuate the evil to which I am referring. I repeat that craft unions do good service to employers, as well as to employes in various industries by keeping out men who are not really qualified to become members. But an applicant of the kind I have mentioned having been refused admission to a union would have power, under this proposal, to move the Court to inquire into his individual case. That, to my mind, might' involve interminable work for the Court, and it might put unions to considerable cost and trouble in causing inquiries to be made into each particular case, though it maybe a matter of very small moment in itself. I do not desire that the unions should be harassed in this way by every individual who happens to form an opinion that, because he has not been allowed to become a member, he is suffering injustice. I should much prefer some other safeguard. If we are going to give every man who does not happen to be pleased with a union this power to move the Court against it, we shall be giving the Court a lot of work which it should not have to do, and we shall be imposing upon unions a lot of trouble and expense which they ought not to have to bear. I ask the Government to consider this aspect of the question, and to see whether something cannot be done to prevent frivolous matters from being brought before the Court, under this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the honorable member, I desire to point out that this proposal does not interfere with the right of unions to insist upon proper qualifications being shown by intending members. I take it that no Court would regard as burdensome or oppressive a rule which insisted on intending members showing some knowledge of the craft or trade the union of which they wished to join. </para>

                    (East Sydney).- There are only two things that I wish to refer to. One of them is that in this amendment, which, I think, is a great improvement on the Bill, there is something not provided for. I do not propose to ask the Committee to enlarge the amendment much ; but I would point out that even if the Bill were amended in this way it would still leave open a possible source of hardship. This addition would be of great service in keeping the unions in a certain degree of order, and it would help to compel them, if they happened to be disposed to act otherwise, to act fairly towards their own members, and not to pass rules which were oppressive or burdensome.- But there is nothing here which would enable the Court to exercise a control over these organizations with respect to their conduct towards persons not inside the unions, and not subject to the rules. We hear of a large number of persons in all these trades who are not in any union. There is nothing in the clause, even as altered by this amendment, which would set up any standard with reference to the relations between persons in the organizations and those outside. But I think, on the whole, that .this will meet the most serious difficulties. The other matter I wish to refer to is the means by which a man may become skilled. I can quite see that artisans' unions cannot admit persons who are not artisans, and I should like the Minister of External Affairs, if he can,' to give me some information as to the means by which the rising young Australians can qualify themselves to become competent for membership of the union of a skilled trade. We desire to encourage our youths .as much as we can to enter into these skilled pursuits, and I should like those who have the information to say what facilities exist among his fellow workmen for a young fellow acquiring the necessary knowledge to entitle him to join a union.

It is becoming largely a question of machine minding, and technical skill is required less and less. But some skill ought to be required, I think. The right honorable and learned gentleman will remember that in New South Wales the Court always limits the number of apprentices. It provides- for labourers who will work with those persons although they are not in their particular union. </para>

                    <para>- I listened with some attention to the remarks of the honorable members for Fremantle and East Sydney, and I would like to present to the Committee this view, that it might be possible if this addition were made for a union still to be a close corporation. I should like to know how the clause would be interpreted in regard, to matters of apprenticeship. We know that there are unions now whose policy it is to limit the number of apprentices. We know too that the seven years' apprenticeship which was required years ago to learn a trade is no longer required. The term was reduced to five years, and it is being gradually shortened. With the advance of education, and the provision of technical schools, a much shorter apprenticeship is required to learn a trade than was required in the days when, perhaps, we were learning our own. </para>

There is now scarcely a tradesman who is skilled in all the branches of his trade. At one time a fitter had to start at the casting-shop and finish at fine work. To-day his work is largely clone by machinery ; practically he is part of the machinery. </para>

I wish to make it clear that there is a number of skilled tradesmen to-day who have never served an apprenticeship. In printing offices, for instance, there are compositors who have never served an apprenticeship. I wish to know whether these men, before they were allowed to join the Typographical Association, would be asked to show that they had passed an apprenticeship; because, if so, it would keep out of the union a large number of really qualified and skilful men - some of the best tradesmen. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it is wise to leave the matter in too vague a form. Generally, a man 'who is able to learn a trade under all sorts of difficulties and disadvantages, is really the most skilled tradesman. A boy who spent five or six years in a composing room and had everything shown him has a considerable advantage over a boy who had to go into a little printing office in the country, and thence graduate to the office of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> or the' <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> and who can hold his own with the best men without having signed indentures. I am rather afraid that the addition to the clause may put a bar in the way of these men getting the benefit of the rights which the Bill confers on them. I do not know that that will be the case ; but I thought it was my duty to give expression to the doubts which occurred to me after listening to the remarks of the honorable members for East Sydney and Fremantle. </para>

                    <para>- I can bear out the statement of the last speaker, that there is a large number of skilled workmen who have never served a day's apprenticeship. I should imagine that, if an inquiry were made in the States, it would be found that almost the majority of the men are in that position. The honorable member for Moreton seems to think that the clause may do some damage in that regard. But, really, it will be an advantage, because if these men are treated unfairly, they will have the right to go before the Court and show that, whilst they are skilled workmen, they were kept out df the union for some other reason. J. think that the honorable member will see that it will be wise for him to accept the amendment. In the Arbitration Court of New South Wales decisions are being given on the lines of making men skilled through being indentured. The trouble will come later on, when the unions begin to demand, as they evidently intend to do, that every skilled workman shall learn his trade as an indentured apprentice. The Minister of External Affairs told the Committee that a man who is a labourer can learn the business of a blacksmith or of any other trade, and that, no doubt, is so to-day. But the unions are setting their faces against that system, by requiring that every man shall learn his trade as an indentured apprentice, and by setting limits to the number of apprentices. If those rules are adopted, the result will be that all skilled work will be monopolized by unionists, and it will be very difficult for other men to earn a livelihood. </para>

                    <para>- The insertion of the words " or any person affected by the award" after the word "members" in the last line but one will make the clause- perfect. As it stands, it refers to members of unions only, so far as the declaration that an organization must not act unfairly or unjustly is concerned. An organization might, however, act unfairly to a party quite as much interested as the employer, or to a still more interested party, an employe who was not a member of a union. The clause now protects members of unions only, who are really able to protect themselves by means of their votes. It is of more interest to non-preference men than to preference men. The idea of the Government is to prevent the oppression of any one bound by the award. </para>

                    (New England).- I wish to point out that the clause will prevent large numbers of men from obtaining work to which they are entitled, and which they would get if preference were not given to others. The Minister of External Affairs told the Committee the other evening that there are 3,000 members in the Wharf Labourers' Union, and work for only 1,500. Therefore, new members joining the union ' would not be able to get employment. They would have to pay their entrance fee and the annual subscription, and then, finding that they could not get work, would have to seek elsewhere for it. If they wished to join the United Labourers' Society they would have to pay another set of fees, and even then could not be sure of getting work, because there might be a dearth of employment in connexion with that branch of labour, too. Thus in every direction there will be barriers preventing poor men from getting employment. If we are going to give advantages to any section of the community, if we are going to establish an aristocracy of labour, allowing all outside it to starve and die, let us say so plainly. That is the practical effect of the clause.' If, by our legislation, men are compelled to enter, unions before applying for employment, the work available for the members of the union should be divided equally amongst them. No one member of a union should succeed in obtaining employment at the expense of another, and whenever there was not sufficient work for every member of a union, what there was should be rotated. The Court should have the power to direct that all the members of a union should share whatever work was available. I believe that the principle to .which many men subscribe at the present time is that all should have work according to their needs.

                        <para>- Yes ; but while it may be a right provision in a State Act, it is not a provision which should be inserted in a Federal measure. It really means that a Justice of the High Court may, after an award has been given, administer it himself. He may go into any factory to which it applies, and see whether there is a likelihood of a breach of the award taking place. In other words, the clause mixes up the functions of the Judiciary and administration, which is opposed to the spirit of the Constitution. it is of the essence of Federal Government that there shall be no such confusion. If honorable members look closely at the clause, they will see that it is not confined to pending disputes or Bending matters. I can understand that it may be necessary for the President to have a view of the <inline font-style="italic">locus in quo</inline> of a dispute ; but every Court has an inherent right to go to any place for the purpose of informing its mind on the matter before it. Therefore the clause is not necessary to give the  President  that power. But it goes further, since it enables him to make these visits at any time, whether 'the dispute or matter is or is not pending. The word " matter " goes further than the word " dispute." and would, perhaps, cover an application to vary the terms of an award. The  President  is empowered, if he merely anticipates a breach of an award or an offence, to investigate the matter before it is brought before him in his judicial capacity. It might go before a minor Court, but' it might come before the  President  himself. Surely it is not intended that he should become an administrative officer, and deal with matters which have not been referred to him by some person affected. I would suggest that after the word "may," line 3, the words " having connexion with any dispute or pending matter before the Court" should be inserted. The word " matter " would cover the case of an application to have the terms of an award varied, which might not be embraced' within the definition of "dispute." Surely the  President  of the Court should not be asked to act as an administrative officer, in addition to discharging his judicial functions. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that the President should have power to fully inform himself of the facts of any case with regard to which he may be required to give a decision, but I think that some differentiation should be made between the President and any person appointed by the Court to act as an inspector. I do not think that the Judge should interfere with the administration of the Act in any way. Whilst it might be reasonable to ask the President to give authority to an inspector to enter any building or other place where an industry was being carried on, it would be absurd to expect him to go there himself. As a matter of preference, however, all matters connected with the administration of the Act should be left to the Minister in charge, and the judicial and administrative functions should be entirely separate. If the Minister will promise to consider the matter I shall not move an amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause evidently contemplates two distinct things. When a case is before the Court it may very often shorten the proceedings by inspecting the premises upon which an industry is being carried on. Surely every member of the Court, or any person authorized by it, ought to be permitted to do that. Then, again, after the Court has made an award, it should be in a position to authorize some persons to see that the award is properly observed. We might very well leave the matter in the hands of the Court. </para>

                    <para>- The difficulty is that if the power proposed to be conferred is to be confined to the President, it may impose upon him an enormous amount of comparatively routine work. After al], the Registrar will be a fairly responsible person, and the Court will have the right to review all his actions, of whatever class or character. I do not think that he will lightly use his power. Probably he will receive general instructions from the Court, and will then be left to carry them out. We do not wish to impose upon the President any more duties than we can help, because the multiplication of small functions may necessitate the appointment of an additional Judge of the High Court, whereas, otherwise, there might be no necessity for any such increase in the strength of the Bench. </para>

                    (Lang).- In view of that explanation, I do not desire to press for the omission of the word "Registrar." It seemed to me at first glance that it was proposed to confer too much power upon that official. Still I can appreciate the difficulty pointed out by the Prime Minister. I propose to move that the words " during ordinary working hours " should be inserted after the words " at any time." It seems to me that the clause, as it stands, would confer power to enter a building at any time of the day or night, and that that would be too extensive an authority to grant. It would be sufficient if we empowered the officers of the Court to enter a building at any time during ordinary working hours. A building might be closed up, and the proprietors might live some miles away, and if a demand for entry were made at some unseasonable hour of the night much unnecessary inconvenience might be entailed. I hope that the Prime Minister will not see any serious objection to the insertion of the qualifying words-

                        <para>- Sp far as the proposal of the honorable member for Angas is concerned, the better plan would be to recommit the clause. I do not object to his amendment, but it would be inconvenient to insert it at this stage. With regard to the suggestion of the honorable member for Lang, I quite agree with him that, generally speaking, it is undesirable to give, power to persons to enter premises at all hours. It struck me, however, whilst he was speaking, that one reason why we should not use too strict phraseology in this instance was that a breach of award might consist of an employer working his hands after ordinary business hours. I should like to know how the -honorable member would get over that difficulty. It might be alleged that Jones had committed a breach of an award by keeping his hands working late at night, and an inspector might require to go and find out what was being done. I do not see how we could meet a case of that kind, if the President could not give authority to enter a .building except during ordinary working hours. </para>

                        <para>- To make it clear that a roving commission is not intended to be given to any person authorized by the Court to enter places of business, I think that the following words should be added: - "Provided that such inspections shall be confined to the objects named in the authority."' I think that we ought to lay down how far this inspection is intended to go. In its present form there is no indication that the authority conferred by the clause is not a general one. I admit the necessity which exists for checking any wrong-doing which may be going on, but I hold that the Court should . limit the power of inspection to the purposes for which it is authorized. The provision which I suggest will give the Registrar full authority to do all that is necessary, and will not permit of an inferior altogether exceeding the authority of the Court. </para>

It was the intention of the Government that the Court or the Registrar should declare the purposes for which an inspection is authorized. For instance, it might be necessary to inspect a boiler which is alleged to be unsafe, or to enter an establishment for the purpose of ascertaining how many boys are employed there, and the hours during which they are employed.

                        <para>- Moreover, a person has merely to say that he suspects that an industry is being carried on in any building to obtain the necessary power to enter and inspect it. I have in my mind's eye buildings, portions of which are used for ordinary trade purposes, and other portions for domestic purposes. I desire to safeguard the privacy of the home from the intrusion of an inspector, who may wish to enter such buildings. It seems to me that if power is given to enter premises, except under stringent safeguards, under the authority of the Court, an officer may invade the privacy of a man's home, and demand to inspect any article therein. An unscrupulous person might .obtain the necessary authority from the Court in order to gratify some vindictive feeling, and thus private individuals, who had no thought of contravening the provisions of this Bill might be persecuted. Of course I recognise the necessity which exists for giving inspectors the power to enter buildings where industries are being carried on, in order to see that the compact is being kept as between employers and employes. But it is not the desire of the Committee to prevent a man from working on his own premises, where he is not conducting an industry in the sense in which that term is employed in this Bill. I do not wish to penalize any man who does a little painting or carpentering in his own home. My sole desire is to safeguard him from the operation of this Bill, and, at the same time, to provide for a reasonable method of inspection, with a view to avoid any infringement of the terms of awards. </para>

If, however, the honorable member can, before the recommittal stage, suggest some form of words to make it clearer, I shall have no objection to reconsider them. But the insertion of language which may, in itself, be correct, in the middle of a clause might have effects that one cannot anticipate. I do not think that it is wise to introduce verbiage into a clause unless necessity can be shown for it. I trust that the honorable member will not press his amendment. If, in the meantime, he can suggest any language that will better express our meaning, I shall be willing to accept it. </para>

                    (Darling). - I would point out to the honorable member for Lang one phase of the matter which he has not discussed. It is rather a far-fetched idea to suppose that an- inspector sent to inspect premises under the authority of the Court, would desire to inspect private premises which were used for domestic purposes. But, if this amendment were carried, it would enable employers to mark portions of their premises " Private and residential," and the inspector would be kept out of them, although they might be used for other purposes. I am sure that the honorable member does not mean to leave a loophole of that kind. It is quite likely that a man who wanted to hide something might resort to such means to shut out the inspector. The Committee will be with me in thinking that no inspector appointed under . the authority of the Court, whose powers were limited by Act of Parliament, would intentionally enter private premises. But, suppose he did such a thing, it would not be a very serious error. No harm would be done. But, on the other hand, the consequences might be serious if we left a loophole, by means of which an employer could defeat the law. Under this amendment, that would be quite possible. I have never heard of even a policeman unwisely interfering in people's private affairs. If officers of the law have to enter private premises, they do it in a way that is not objectionable. If an inspector under this Bill were to exceed his duty he probably would not have another opportunity of doing so. The amendment is not needed. The clause, as it stands, sufficiently limits the power of the inspector. It would be better to leave it as it is, with an assurance that the interests of employers in regard to their private premises are sufficiently safeguarded.

                    <para>- In connexion with this clause I propose to leave out all the words after the word " penalty," with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words " proceedings for recovery of the penalty may be taken in any Court of summary jurisdiction constituted by a Police, Stipendiary, or Special Magistrate." The object is to enact the New South Wales provision, which insists on the constitution of the Court where this matter is decided by a stipendiary or police magistrate. We propose here to use. the additional term, " Special Magistrate," because there is a class of magistrates in South Australia who are thus termed. Every one who has observed the manner in which Benches, which may be constituted of honorary magistrates, are occasionally packed by interested parties, and especially in metropolitan areas, will agree that it is a most undesirable thing to allow these matters, which are to such an extent matters of heat and controversy of a political character, to be brought within the jurisdiction of other than permanent officials. Every fair-minded man will admit the unwisdom of that if it can be avoided. We propose in the interpretation clause, when we recommit that portion of the Bill, to ask the Committee for power to appoint magistrates as " special " magistrates in addition to those so included by the South Australian law- </para>

                        <para>- Yes, that was the idea. The difficulty that has arisen in New South Wales, as I understand it, is that they require to apply on every occasion to the Court for a penalty, and for this reason : Assuming for the sake of illustration, that an award covers a dozen employers or employes, who reside in different petty sessions districts - separate action has to be taken in regard to each person in each separate petty sessions district, or else the magistrates have to confess that they have no jurisdiction. That is resulting in New South Wales in the loading up of the Arbitration Court with a lot of work as to penalties in regard to breaches of awards, and so on, that should properly be disposed of by subordinate magistrates. We wish to avoid that kind of thing by the insertion of some provision in the interpretation clause, which will allow of the appointment of Special Magistrates who will have a jurisdiction wider than that of the ordinary petty sessions district. </para>

                        <para>- I think not; but that will be a matter for argument and consideration later. At present it appears to me that we can appoint, say, a Stipendiary Magistrate in Sydney or a Special Magistrate in South Australia, a magistrate for the purposes of this Bill, with, of course, any jurisdiction we care to give him. I have no wish to add to the number of magistrates, and particularly to the number of honorary magistrates. I do not think there is any desire on the part of honorable members to undertake the invidious task of picking out a few hundreds of thousands of honorary magistrates. I think that the constitution under this Bill of some of . the existing Stipendiary Magistrates as Special Magistrates for this purpose, with a sphere of operation over a wider district than they at present control, will prevent a lot of work being placed on the shoulders of the Court of which it might properly be relieved. </para>

The honorable gentleman will remember that earlier in the discussion of this Bill attention was drawn to the fact that in different parts of the measure awards and common rules were treated as though they were separate and distinct terms, whilst in another part of the measure it would appear to be contemplated that an award includes a common rule. For instance, a common rule is made to apply by an award. </para>

                        <para>- There was some dispute on the subject, and the honorable and learned member for Corinella emphasized the necessity of making it clear that we were not going beyond the terms of the Constitution, that we were only giving power to make awards, and that the common rule should be considered a part of an award. I wish the Attorney-General to satisfy himself that this is covered by the use of the word. " award " in this instance, as it is of importance in considering the recovery of a penalty imposed for a breach of a common rule. I can quite see the necessity of giving a Stipendiary Magistrate the extended jurisdiction to which the Prime Minister refers. In doing so we shall be following only what we have clone already in section 68 of the Judiciary Act, under the last provision of which a magistrate may be specially authorized by the Governor-General to exercise a jurisdiction. That shows that under our existing law we have, in certain instances, taken the power to appoint special magistrates to exercise Federal jurisdiction. But when we come to consider whether a justice of a State Court of summary jurisdiction, acting under a State Act, can extend his jurisdiction beyond the specific area to which, by the State law, he is restricted, the matter is somewhat dubious. I am inclined to the opinion that the Prime Minister will find that if he wishes to extend the jurisdiction of a State magistrate over a larger area than that accredited 'to the State Court in which he presides, it may be necessary for him to create a special Court, and to give that Court the necessary extended jurisdiction. I ask the honorable gentleman to consider that aspect of the matter: </para>

                    <para>- With regard to the point to which the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs last referred, I understand that a great deal of difficulty has arisen in New South Wales under the Arbitration Act there because Police Magistrates in that State have jurisdiction only within limited districts. It has been found almost impracticable to enforce penalties under the Act before Police Magistrates, as the offence could not be brought before them unless it has been committed within their very limited territorial area of jurisdiction. So far as I can see at present, the course indicated by the Prime Minister is the course which it is best to adopt, and that is to exercise the Commonwealth power to nominate gentlemen who may act under the name of " Special Magistrates," or any other name which may be preferred for the purpose of enforcing the Commonwealth law of arbitration. It seems to me to be a reasonable way of carrying out that, to have in the interpretation clause a definition of " Special Magistrates," which will include not only "Special Magistrates," so called in South Australia, but those magistrates who may be specially nominated for the particular purpose of dealing throughout the States with the enforcing of penalties under the Commonwealth Arbitration law. </para>

                    <para>- The- honorable and learned member for Indi is right. When this amendment was given notice of, the Government contemplated leaving the maximum penalty to the determination of the Court, and, consequently, we proposed another amendment, that the members should be severally liable for whatever penalty the Court might determine. But in view of the fact that the Committee did not agree with bur proposal in that respect, I think that I had better ask leave to withdraw the amendment, and so leave the clause as it was originally drafted. This will apply to the next amendment, too. </para>

                        <para>- This clause deals with a much more serious state of affairs than is contemplated in connexion with an ordinary breach of an award. In my opinion, it is only proper that when a serious and continued non-observance of an award, or a contempt of the Court, occurs, it should have the power to order imprisonment with the maximum of three months. I do not think it is unreasonable to make that provision. There are other provisions by which breaches are punishable by the imposition of maximum fines ; but in this instance, seeing that the clause is intended to deal with only an aggravated case, where a man has persistently broken the law, or ignored the award of the Court, it is not an unreasonable provision to make. </para>

I am quite aware of what the procedure would be. First, an award has to be made ; secondly, an application has to be made to the Court for a mandamus or an injunction ; then a copy of that order has to be served on the parties, and if they do not obey, it is intended by the clause that imprisonment only shall be inflicted.

                <para>Only an organization of employes, not an employe' singly. I submit that clause <inline font-style="italic">6,</inline> which would stop a strike or lock-out, can apply in reference to only an industrial organization. That is not a dispute between employers and employes, as persons, but only one between an employer or an organization of employers and an organization of employes. Consequently, under the Bill, as it is drawn, an employe can make any breach he likes, and, therefore, does not come under this clause. The only punishment that can possibly be inflicted is against the organization itself, and not against the employe, because h2 is not a person as defined in the Act. This is only my view, but I certainly think that, for the reasons I have given, the word "person" throughout the Bill, particularly in this clause, which provides for three months' imprisonment, can under no circumstances apply to an employe, but must always apply to an employer. It is very unfortunate that we should not have this remedy against an employe. An employer is a person only, and he is the only offender who is to be visited with imprisonment. I ask, in these circumstances, that an employer should be allowed the privilege of paying a fine, and should not be imprisoned straight off. </para>

                    <para>- I strongly sup- 1 port the view that the clause ought to provide for the imposition of a monetary penalty. I would recall to the recollection of the Minister of External Affairs the fact that during a great industrial struggle in New Zealand the strikers did not consider that the award of the Court was fair, and that, wishing to resist it, they said that in the Colony there were not sufficient prisons to hold those who held that view. The Minister will see that the penalty named in this clause may not be a very satisfactory one, and that, therefore, the imposition of a fine ought to be provided for. It appears to me that the clause is open to another objection. Supposing that the breach of the award were such as, in ordinary reason, would be met by imprisonment for a day or a. week, would the maximum penalty of imprisonment have to be inflicted ? </para>

                    (Indi). - The position appears to be quite met by the Bill. An award is made, and a breach of it is either actually committed or threatened. For an actual wilful breach clause 56 provides a monetary penalty not exceeding ^20. If that breach is repeated, or it is thought necessary to obtain an injunction under any circumstance's where a pecuniary penalty does not seem to deter the persons making the breach, the Court has power to make an order, and for a breach of that order may inflict imprisonment.

                        <para>- The proposed Court will not be an ordinary tribunal, and it may, therefore, be argued that it must look for its powers wholly to the provisions of this Bill. I think it right to arm the Court with distinct and affirmative power, against the event of any such question arising. Properly speaking, clause 56 should precede clause .55. If an award is made and any person " wilfully makes default in compliance " with it, a penalty of '^20 or less, but only such penalty, may be imposed. Then, under clause 55, an application may be made to the Court by any party to an award for an order in the nature of a mandamus or an injunction to compel compliance under pain of imprisonment. The Court has no power to order imprisonment right away. There must be the award, the breach of it, or threatened breach of it, and a further order to compel compliance. It is only after written notice of this further order that the person to whom it applies will be liable to the penalty of imprisonment. Surely it is not too much to say that under such circumstances the Court may, in its discretion, award imprisonment not exceeding three months. I think that the clause read in conjunction with clause 56 is a very fair one. </para>

                    SMITH (Parkes.) - The honorable and learned member for Indi has missed the point taken by the honorable and learned member for Corio. No one doubts the importance or the necessity of giving a Judge or a magistrate the ultimate power to inflict the most serious form of punishment where its Order is disobeyed ; but the honorable and learned member for Corio pointed out the extremely one-sided character of the provision contained in the clause under discussion. When the Court of Arbitration makes an award it does not make it against individual members of a union.

How could anything in the nature of an injunction or mandamus be made effective against those men? The clause provides that where an award has been disobeyed the Court may grant an injunction .or a mandamus ; but, having made its award against the union, would it be likely to grant an injunction against the individual members of that union, who might number hundreds or thousands? Could the Court, after making an award against a union, make an injunction or issue a mandamus against the individual members of that union ? </para>

I wish the Minister would show us how the Court in granting a mandamus or an injunction to compel compliance with its previous award against the union, could compel men to go to work. If they did not go to work, who would be imprisoned for three months? Does the Minister mean to say that it is intended that the Court shall imprison for three months the whole of the members of a union ? </para>

                        <para>- I contend that it would be impracticable to imprison all the members who refused, and that it would be unjust to allow the provision to stand as at present. The difficulty might be, to some extent, overcome by providing for the option of a fine, or three months' imprisonment. I admit that where a practicable course is provided for, by which each member of a union can be made liable to a fine, as. an alternative to imprisonment, all the members of a union can be cited for disobeying an award arid fined. But all of the members could not be imprisoned. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable, and learned member must see that the employer could not single out individuals, and could not imprison the whole of the members of a union. Therefore it is absurd to provide that an employer should be imprisoned without the option of a fine. I quite agree with the honorable and learned member for Indi that we must make provision of the most drastic character for the enforcement of the awards of the Court, but I want to see provisions that will work fairly to both sides. If it be impracticable to imprison the whole of the members of a union, numbering 500, we should not provide, in the case of employers, for imprisonment without the option of a fine. </para>

                        <para>- I wish the Minister to recognise the one-sided character of the provision. I am quite sure that he is anxious that the Bill shall be passed in such a shape that no one can say that it is one-sided - that it bears more heavily upon the employer than upon the employe. I think that the Minister must admit that in a strike such as that at Teralba - I am not citing an impossible or improbable case, but one which actually occurred in New South Wales - where some hundreds of men ceased work, notwithstanding the order of the Court, a revolution would result if any attempt were made to imprison 500 miners. If that could not be done in such a case, we should not enact that an employer shall be imprisoned without the option of a fine. The only solution of the difficulty I can suggest is that we should provide that either , s'ide should be liable to a heavy fine or three months' imprisonment. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that it is not impracticable. I say under certain circumstances it might be impracticable. If only one man, or if even two or more men, at Teralba, had disobeyed, it would not have been impracticable to imprison them. Then, it follows that the provision becomes impracticable only when such numbers of men are involved as would make any law impracticable. Take- the case of the Education Act in England. That is becoming impracticable of enforcement because of the large number of persons who are disobeying it- </para>

                        <para>- The Government desire to be absolutely fair. We say, however, that it is not fair to take a lot of hapless men, like miners or wharf labourers, and subject them to heavy fines, which they cannot pay. I can assure honorable members that 'the great majority of the members of" the Wharf Labourers' Union in Sydney have not averaged 15s- per week for the last twelve months. They certainly have not averaged that amount during the last five months. Therefore, to say to any of these men that they must pay a fine of <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> would be equivalent to condemning them to imprisonment, because they would have no hope of paying such an amount. I read only the other day a statement to the effect that in the handling of wheat at Darling Island in Sydney a stevedore was making <inline font-style="italic">-£2</inline> 6s. per hour, whereas the labourers were earning only i5d. per hour. A' 'fine of .£25 would be nothing to the stevedore, but the men could not pay such an amount, and would, there fore, have to go to gaol. I know that the honorable and learned member for Parkes, with all his bias against this class of legislation, desires to be fair. If he can show me a way out that will be fair to the employer and the employe, I shall gladly adopt it; but I urge that his suggestion does not provide such a way. </para>

                        <para>- If a man wilfully breaks an award, and cannot pay the fine inflicted, he must go to gaol. If we were merely to ask a man to pay a fine of ,£20, and he could not pay it, there would be an end of the matter ; but, under the preceding clause, it is provided that he shall go to gaol in such a case. The other parties to the award could obtain an order in the nature of a mandamus or an injunction, and if obedience were not secured, the Court might put the man in gaol. The following clause meets many of the objections raised by the honorable and learned members for Parkes and Corio, and I think that, under the circumstances, they may very well allow matters to stand as at present. ' In connexion with this class of legislation, it is impossible to insure that under all circumstances the law will be enforceable. For instance, legislation in regard to early closing would be simply impracticable if the whole body of employers or employes decided to disregard it. Our education and our vaccination laws might easily be rendered inoperative by a combination on the part of our citizens. We trust that both sides will realize the value of this provision, and bv co-operation, render it workable. If mv honorable friend can show me that his suggestion would operate justly in the case of the workman as well as of the employer, I shall be very glad. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the Minister, but I contend that some remedy must lie against the members of these organizations. Let us suppose that a case arises in which the colliery employes refuse to obey an award of the Court. What remedy has the employer, who is bound by the fact that he could' pay a fine of ^25, if it were imposed upon him. against his employes, who could not pay it? I would further point out that the question of contempt of Court, which has been referred to, is dealt with in clause 90. Honorable members will observe that under this provision a person must not be guilty of any contravention of an award, either by commission or omission. I think that that will lead to a good deal of oppression. It would be simply impossible to imprison 500 men, and, therefore, the Court should be allowed to deal with breaches of awards in some other "way. I ask the Minister of External Affairs to accept my amendment as a fair proposal. I am not at all satisfied that the word " person " covers employes. I am referred by the honorable and learned member for Indi to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> of clause 46, which says that "the Court shall' as regards every industrial dispute of which it has cognizance, have power to enjoin any organization or person from committing or continuing any contravention of this Act." But I claim that that power is governed by the words " as regards every industrial dispute." The only possible parties to an industrial dispute are an organization of employes, an employer, or an organization of employers. </para>

I venture to say that if an industrial dispute is limited to an organization of employes, an employer, and an organization of employers, the Bill will not bind any individual employe. Under the New South Wales Act the definition clause includes employes, organizations of employes, employers, and organizations of employers. The reason assigned by the Minister for not including employes in this measure is that no single employe" is able to institute a dispute which would extend beyond the limits of one State. </para>

                    (Indi).- I do not know that the adoption of the amendment will make very much difference to the Bill. I do not think that, in accepting it, the Ministry will be doing any wrong. I confess that I was a good deal astonished at some of the arguments which were employed by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. He seemed to me to have entirely overlooked some of the plainest provisions of this measure. He supported the view entertained by the honorable and learned member for Corio that the word "person" can relate to employers only.

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member for Corio holds that ah industrial dispute must necessarily involve a dispute with an organization of employes, and that consequently an award can be made applicable only to that organization and not to the persons composing it. In my judgment that contention is not correct. It is true that to give the Court the power to make any award a dispute must arise either with an employer or an organization of employers on the one hand, and an organization of employes on the other. But when once the Court is seized of .the fact that a dispute exists, it has power to make its award applicable to members of the organizations concerned as well as to the organizations themselves. Therefore, under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 37, which assumes that an industrial dispute has arisen, and that the Court has cognizance of it, all members of the organization concerned are bound by the award. If an order is made enjoining an organization from committing any particular act or directing it to perform some act, each member of it is bound to do nothing in contravention of that order. </para>

                        <para>- If my honorable and learned friend is not agreeable to strike out the clause, what is the use of saying that it is impracticable? What becomes of his argument if he is prepared to retain the clause? If the clause is to remain, I cannot see how we can better it. Because-, with all respect, it is nonsense to say to employes and employers alike, "We will impose upon you as a penalty a fine of £25." That is comparatively nothing to the employer, and certainly it is less to an organization of employes. </para>

                        <para>- I am not averse to putting in an option. If the honorable member agrees with me on that, I think we are at one, because I am only insisting that this power - the power of force in the last resource - must be resident in the Court. To say that it is one-sided is, I think, an error. When honorable members read clause 57, they will see that an employes' organization or a single employe who fails to obey the award .of the Court, whether practicable or not, is thrown out of his organization, has to forfeit all privileges, has to forfeit any benefit given him by the act of award, is riot allowed to get any pay, and is not allowed to get any benefit out of the funds of the organization - and if he does it is an offence in itself, and those who assist him in getting any portion of the funds are themselves liable to a penalty. I do not see what more can be done. If any honorable member can suggest what more can possibly be done to meet the case I shall be glad to hear of it. We provide for fines, for imprisonment, for disqualification from membership of the association, for depriving the member from any of the benefits; and I do not know what more we could do, unless we provided for hanging the offender. </para>

                        <para>- I should say that it is not impracticable. If we have power to fine and imprison, I should say that that is sufficient. In America, as I said by way of interjection, the Courts have taken men who have led in strikes and in acts which have practically amounted to rebellion, and put them in prison without any difficulty whatever. In America that can be done by injunction, I think. </para>

                        <para>- I should certainly indorse the procedure of injuncture to compel obedience to the order of the Court. It is done every day in our Supreme Courts. In America, where the organizations are infinitely larger than ours, and where there are millions of employes, I understand that the Courts exercise the power to restrain by injunction and by imprisonment any breaches of order. I should advise the Government to accept the amendment. It cannot do any harm. </para>

                        <para>- The last part of it applies only to persons, but not the other part. The first part of the clause provides that - the Court may, on the application of any party to an award - that may be an organization - make an order in the nature of a mandamus - that may be a mandamus to an organization, or injunction - that may be against an organization - to compel compliance with the award, or to restrain its breach under pain of imprisonment, and no person to whom such order applies shall. . . . be guilty of any contravention. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is impossible to imprison an organization as an organization. All that is practicable is done here ; and I should like to add that a maximum penalty is fixed for a breach of any of the provisions of an award. But this is a special provision for continued disobedience to an order, in very flagrant circumstances ; and, therefore, it necessarily provides, so far as imprisonment is concerned, that it shall apply to the person only. As regards the injunction and mandamus, that applies to the organization or to the person. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with the general reasoning of the honorable and learned member for Indi as to the structure of the Bill. I recognise that the clause is, in some form, necessary, even if a wide discretion is given to the Court as regards imprisonment. Under clause 46 <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> the general power to enforce orders and awards puts no limitation with regard to the period for which the Court can actually commit a man. It is just as well that some limit should be put in. Under clause 56, though a technical penalty may be imposed, it does not follow that it can be . followed up by imprisonment. In clause 53 we have already provided that proceedings for the recovery of penalties may be taken before any Court of summary jurisdiction in a State. We are following the procedure of the States with regard to recovery, as the judgment of a State Court would be recovered. In some States they permit imprisonment in default of the recovery of pecuniary penalties. In other States, however, they allow nothing more than distress. So that it is necessary to make some provision, both as regards employers and employes. But I think we should give the alternative of a pecuniary penalty even in that case, because there is no doubt that in practical working there is all the difference in the world between imprisoning a body of employers and a body of employes. The employers would necessarily be very few. They would be for the purposes of breach of the award the men who actually gave employment, not the members of an employers' organization. The man who breaks an award is not the member of the organization as such, but the man who gives employment. We have to deal with persons, not organizations. I do not see how an organization can possibly break ah award. But it is possible to charge a person with breaking an award ; and to charge an employer is a very simple thing, because there are very few of them. In some cases there would be one only concerned. In the case of the employes, no doubt it would be impossible to imprison them all if they broke an award. But there is nothing to prevent the employes retiring from the employment one by one, and refusing to work under the award. There is no power to compel employes to work for the wages fixed in the award. One employe' could walk out' of the workshop one week, and one could walk out the next week. How could they be charged with a breach of an award under those circumstances ? But in the case of an employer, it is very different. He has to continue his business, unless he closes it up altogether; and then he fails, and puts an end to a business that perhaps has been in existence for years. There is a great difference, in fact, between issuing an injunction against an employer and against a body of employes. I think that the Government should provide some alternative, and allow a discretion to a Court to say that, instead of imprisonment, they would inflict a fine. That would' be operative upon the employers, and to some extent, also it would be operative against the employes. </para>

                    (Indi). - I should like to draw attention to one point in this clause which might be amended. The Prime Minister will see that it provides only for a breach of the award. In various parts of the Bill there is power to make an order in addition to an award. In clause 46 an order is distinct from an award. I think that an amendment should be made in the first line of the clause, so as to make it read ' ' on the application of any party to an award or order," leaving the clause to be redrafted afterwards. The amendment could not be made properly without some, consideration.

It is certainly provided that the Court may in its discretion reinstate him ; but it could not reinstate him in his benefits.

                        <para>- Not at all ; but the honorable member will see that incidentally a man would be robbed of the benefits to which he had become entitled if, under a measure of this kind, he ceased to be a member of an organization. I therefore propose to leave it to the discretion of the Court to say whether an individual judged guilty of any. contravention of Part II. shall, in addition to any ordinary penalty imposed directly for the offence, be and continue subject to any or all of . the other disabilities. If the case is ari aggravated one of a man who has wilfully committed offences, and shows no disposition to behave himself, I think it is right that the Court should have the power to say that he shall cease to be a member of a union, and shall lose all the benefits which have accrued to him by his previous membership. In some cases that would be very severe punishment. In the case, for instance, of the Amalgamated Engineers and the Typographical Society, and- some other trade societies, extensive benefits accrue to members in proportion to the number of years the member has been in the society. I think we shall sufficiently achieve the object of the clause if we agree to the amendment' I have moved, leaving the matter in the discretion of the 'Court. </para>

                <para>The effect of the introduction of those words will be that no association which contravenes those provisions can be registered; in other words, that no body formed for purposes other than the purposes of this Bill can obtain registration. The machinery of the Bill requires the formation of organizations for the purposes of the measure only. There is no reason why it should apply to trade unions, benefit societies, or any other associations, political or otherwise, which are not formed for the purposes of the Bill. All that are required are organizations of not less than 100 members to set its provisions in motion. </para>

                        <para>- No; to organizations both of employers and employes. My object is that any body or number of persons, wishing to obtain the privileges gained by registration under the Bill, shall organize exclusively for the purposes of the Bill. There is no reason for allowing existing unions to be registered, because the Court will have no control over their methods, whereas it will be able to control the organizations which are the creation of the Bill. I do not wish to amplify my arguments, because the matter has already been discussed at great length. It may be desirable to limit the organizations to particular districts, that is, to provide that they shall consist of the employers or employes in a district, instead of in an industry. That was a suggestion thrown out by the honorable member for North Sydney, and, if it is agreed to, we can subsequently insert clauses giving the Governor-General power to prescribe certain districts in respect to which organizations can be registered. </para>

                        <para>- It does not seem to me that the amendment is in consonance with the general plan of the measure. As it was drafted, the Bill' contemplated relying upon the existing organizations as responsible bodies. It seems to me that the whole framework of this legislation depends upon our having organizations whose influence with their individual members would be such that, broadly speaking, there would be no necessity to enforce its penal provisions. An organization would be able to bring sufficient pressure to bear on its members to obviate the necessity, in the first place, of mulcting it in the pecuniary penalties laid down, and, in the second place, of having recourse to the penalties which are provided against the individuals. That being the case, we ought to have an organization which has funds, and, above all, ties which would bind its members together in sufficiently close union to allow of the pressure of one set of members against an individual. The amendment contemplates quite an ephemeral organization. A set of individuals brought into an organization for the purposes of this measure only would have no tie in common, excepting the fact that they were in the same industry. But that, in itself, would not be a tie, as dissensions between unionists and non-unionists - I do not use the latter term in an offensive sense, but in the ordinary sense - occur to-day right through industries. In the absence of a trades union, as the term is ordinarily understood, it is the most difficult thing in the world to get anything like unity from the different employes in an industry. If, on the other hand, we took advantage of the unions, as we know them to-day, we should have something that would create between members a sympathy which no other organization does. It is difficult to define exactly how that operates, but, undoubtedly, it does operate. </para>

                        <para>- The experience elsewhere has been that, having joined a union, the men absorbed the spirit in which it was worked. There is practically no difficulty about these men at all, but if we brought into existence the organizations contemplated by the amendment, there would be no common tie, and, therefore, nothing, practically speaking, on which we could rely for the preservation and the exercise of the influence which is so necessary to make the Act a success. I do not wish to debate this question at length, because it has already been discussed. The honorable member for North Sydney put the general idea forward here during last week, and I then pointed to the Teralba incident in New South Wales, which has since been referred to by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. In that instance, according to. my view, it was solely owing 'to the pressure of a strong trades union on the men who were disobeying the award of the </para>

                        <para>- With all respect to the honorable member, there was, in the arbitration award, no power to. make any such summons. Perhaps he is not fully aware of the circumstances. Whatever remedy there was against the men lay at common law. There was in the award nothing which said that the men should not knock off work the next instant if they cared to do so. What did happen was that the Miners' Union of the Newcastle district exerted pressure steadily and continuously in favour of getting the award complied with, and of steps being taken at a later period to show that it was inequitable and should be altered. So far from that being an instance against the working of the Act in New South Wales, or against the working of the clause which the Government ask the Committee to pass, it is a signal proof of the desirability of passing the clause in its present shape. It proves that the general plan and purpose of the measure was more than justified, that the unionists who were not immediately concerned brought pressure to bear on their fellow-unionists in the Teralba district. Instead of the flame spreading, beyond the Teralba district, instead of the strike becoming general, this pressure, exerted in the fashion I have indicated, constrained the men to turn to work, and for the time being, at any rate, to comply- with the direction of the Court, and accept the terms that it had laid down. In these circumstances, I think that if this amendment were carried, we should, in the first place, be taking a leap in the dark. We have no experience to guide us as to how far a provision of this sort would be workable. In New Zealand, Western Australia, and New South Wales the existing unions were taken as a basis because of their strength, and because of the fact that they possessed a financial backing for the most part, and were, .therefore, bodies upon whom responsibility could be thrown. This is the design on which the measure of' each State I have named was drafted, and it is a very safe plan for us to adhere to. In addition to the amendment being, as I say, a leap in the dark, I am convinced that it would not insure anything like a successful working, because of the unstable character of any organization formed in the manner indicated by the honorable and learned member for Angas. With other honorable members, he objects to an organization being recognised which has any purposes outside those of this measure. </para>

                        <para>- No ; nor in nearly every award, because in quite a number of instances the Court has refused to give a preference, and in others the preference has been hedged round with conditions which showed that the Court was fully alive to the importance of the issues generally. Supposing that one Court, presided over by a particular Judge, had done the most extraordinary things in the world, .that would be no reason for sapping our confidence in the general constitution of Courts, or constraining us to abolish Courts. For instance, in New South Wales a Judge in Court made some remarks the other day about legislation which, in the view of a good number of persons, he was not entitled in that position to make. But surely that would not cause any of us to inveigh against the setting up a Court ? Again, in Western Australia, a great number of persons are not at all satisfied with the Judge who presides over its Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; . but the point I wish to make is that it does not follow, because the Arbitration Court of New South Wales may have given in most cases, as I believe it has, a preference to unionists that a similar course would be followed by a Judge in quite a different set of circumstances. The Court set up by this measure would no doubt be guided by the circumstances surrounding each case, and the evidence which was brought forward. Therefore it does not follow that the precedent set by any Court would be adopted. I am quite content to leave it to the discretion of the gentleman who would be charged with that responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- It does not follow, because that journal is published in Melbourne, that the writer is an authority as to what occurs in Sydney. Besides that, these articles are usually anonymous, and we cannot know how far the writers may be influenced by their own feelings, or be in a position to judge. What I was urging was that the whole plan of the Bill depends upon the recognition of the responsibility of organizations. If we create organizations that are bound together by nothing except the mere fact that their members are engaged in the same industry, I fear that we shall not be able to attach to them any responsibility. Consequently we shall not be able on most occasions to secure that explicit obedience to the awards of the Court which we should expect to result from setting up this somewhat expensive and intricate machinery. Therefore, I trust that the Committee will not accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- In connexion with this measure the Prime Minister, like the Minister of External Affairs, possesses very marked advantages over almost all of us - certainly- over myself. They are not only members of trades unions, but to them these' bodies are concrete realities with whose workings they are familiar, and whose powers and privileges they thoroughly understand. They have also had an opportunity in New South Wales, during the last two or three years, of watching the working of the Arbitration Act in that State, and finding out its strong and weak points. Therefore, they start with a practical knowledge of the questions with which we have to deal that is not possessed by many of us. I admit, therefore, on the testimony borne by the Prime Minister that the influence which the trades unions are capable of exercising must be valuable. I can quite understand that in the Teralba case the steady pressure exerted by the leaders of the movement, and of the union,, must have been very beneficial. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me perfectly reasonable that there should have been such an influence at work ; but I do not know of the extent to which it was exercised in the Teralba case. I part company with the Prime Minister first of all in regard to the view which he takes of the scheme of the Bill. As I understand it, the measure does not, in any sense, make it necessary that the unions and the organizations contemplated, by the Bill should be co-extensive. On the other hand, its provisions indicate that organizations will probably be formed of members of trades unions, and of those outside unions, who will be brought together for the purposes of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. The question was raised to-night whether the organizations were intended to be Federal ot otherwise. I take it that they are not required to be Federal. They may be Federal or State organizations. It will be competent for an association of more than 100 employes in any one industry in any one State to register as an organization. They will not be affected, under this Bill, unless a dispute extends beyond any one State. Though it is not imperative, the probability is that organizations of employes in two or more States will unite for the purposes of bringing a case before the Court when a dispute has extended beyond the limits of any one State. Consequently, organizations will not necessarily be Federal, but . they may be Federal. In the next place, an organization is not intended to be coterminous with a trades union. I find clear proof of that in clause 54, amongst others. In sub-clause 2 of that clause, it is provided that - </para>

                        <para>- I think it will save time if I am allowed to explain what I clearly understand by the term "organization," and what is meant by one or two of the provisions to which I shall call attention. The organizations do not exclude trades unions. In fact, special references are made to cases in which a trades union may form or form part of an organization. In such cases a responsibility will be incurred by the trades union. The property of the union will become available in certain cases for the payment of penalties which may be inflicted by the Court; and . the Prime Minister had in this fact one of his strongest arguments if . he had chosen to use it. So far as a trades union is possessed of property, and becomes part of an organization, it will make itself responsible. That provision requires to be viewed in another light. The fact that inasmuch as, by becoming an organization or a part of one, a trades union will, so to speak, pledge its property, may be regarded by the unions as a reason for not, as trades unions, forming part of an organization. That is another argument which I present to the Prime Minister as of some importance. </para>

                        <para>- I am simply pointing out that the provision is in the. Bill.. If it is not approved, it ought to be removed or modified. The clear intention of the Bill is not to require, as the Prime Minister is inclined to do, that every person who desires to become a member of an organization shall also be a member of a trades union. Trades unions have all excellent objects, to some of which the Prime Minister has alluded, and as such they have exercised the most legitimate influences in furthering the interests of those who are embraced by them. But there are classes of the community who, for one reason or another, do not favour the particular trade union of the industry in which they are employed. In some cases they do not favour the union in a particular State, and in . other cases they do not favour unions at all. These persons are not excluded from the provisions of the Bill. On the contrary, special provision is made for keeping wide open the doors of the organizations, so that all who please may enter them, become bound by them, and share in their responsibilities. </para>

                        <para>- The organizations, so far as the Bill requires them to go, are only bodies by means of which appeals are to be brought before the Court. When awards are made these bodies are expected, and are obliged, to assist in giving effect to them. So long as they do this they accomplish all that is necessary under the Bill. Trades unions, however, go a good deal further. They have a great many other objects, most of them - all of them in their place - most useful. They can bring a great deal of influence to bear upon their members, and the organizations contemplated by the Bill may not do so. The fact remains that when a man joins an organization he may or may not join the trades union associated with that particular industry. </para>

                        <para>- That may be used as an argument against the amendment. I am endeavouring to state the whole of the arguments which may be used on either side. The trades unions have objects relating to benefits, or of a political or quasi-political character, besides those which are purely industrial. So far as they are industrial bodies they may come within the Bill as organizations, and if they are only' industrial they will probably approach very closely to fulfilling the requirements of an organization under the Bill. To the extent, however, that they, introduce any other motives or ends, either semi-political or wholly political, they pass right outside the purposes of the measure. The point that underlies the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Angas is that he wishes it to be emphasized - to be made perfectly clear - that the only sense in which trades unions shall form part of organizations under the Bill, shall be so far as they are extra-political. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I have already said that this Bill contains the same ample powers that exist in every State Arbitration Act. There can be no doubt that a certain amount of ambiguity has resulted from adapting to disputes which must extend beyond the limits of one State before they are litigable similar provisions to those which have been applied to industrial disputes within a State. As the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs has pointed out, the word " person," as it is used in clause 6, could not possibly mean a person who is located in only one State. He would require to be a person who conducts business in two States. </para>

                        <para>- All that the Bill- requires is that the Registrar shall certify that a- dispute exists which ought to be dealt with by the Court. It will not always be the size of a dispute which will induce that officer to certify as to its existence. Instances are readily conceivable in which relatively a small contest may raise for the first time .a very important industrial principle, requirking to be settled promptly, and in such cases the Registrar ought to intervene. It seems to me that the Minister requires to qualify his statement to a greater extent than he appears to have done accord- ' ing to the newspaper report, by calling attention to the fact that the Registrar has unlimited authority - subject to the President - to bring any dispute extending beyond the limits of a State within the cognizance of the Court. </para>

                        <para>- Then we come to the proposal of the honorable and learned member for Angas. It is that no association shall be registered unless it has been formed and exists solely for the purposes of this Bill. The whole of the new element embodied in that proposal is to be found in the word " solely." Of course, before any organization can be registered it must have been formed, and exist for the purposes of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that, in referring to "organizations," many honorable members have used the term in different senses. In some instances it has been implied that an organization must necessarily be a trades union. I have already indicated the circumstances under which a union may or may not form part of an organization. The honorable and learned member for Angas desires to make a condition that an organization must exist for the purposes of the Bill. He proposes that it should exist solely for those purposes. What would be the effect of his proposal ? It would make little or no change in the phraseology of. the Bill because the definition of the term "organization" is wide enough to allow such a body to consist, wholly of the members of a trades union, or not to consist of them at all. After his amendment some of the provisions might be very rarely used ; but that fact would not involve any serious change in the structure of the Bill. The amendment would relieve the unions of the financial obligation to which I have referred, but would not exclude every member of a union from joining an organization. </para>

We require to settle what is really meant by the term " organization." If an organization may consist of some unionists and some non-unionists, how is that junction to be communicated ? Will it be by resolution ? What step will require to be taken to make it clear whether or not a union comes within the scope of subclause 2 of clause 52 of the Bill? </para>

                        <para>- There the practical experience of the Minister helps him out of a difficulty. Quite apart, however, from the particular question as to whether these organizations should be formed solely for the purposes of this Bill, 'the question involved is one of the utmost importance. If honorable- members will refer to schedule B, which sets out the conditions upon which any organization shall be formed, they will find nothing required there except what is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Bill. Amongst other matters it contains the following sub-clause : - " The rules of an association may also provide for any other matters not contrary to law, and for the repeal or alteration of the rules, but so that the above condition shall always be complied with." I presume, therefore, that provision may be made for all the ordinary rules of a trades union, and may include all the ordinary objects of such a union. That brings the Committee face to face with the proposal of the honorable and learned member for Angas that it is desirable for these matters to be separated so that political and semi-political questions shall be entirely excluded from the organizations established' under this measure. </para>

                        <para>- I follow advice, as the honorable member does, whenever it commends itself to my judgment; but I listen to both sides, and form my own opinion. As a matter of fact, I have not voted for the alteration of a single line or letter of this Bill - not one. I have supported the Government on every occasion when this Bill has been challenged, and have done that largely because I had introduced it and become responsible for it; although I have been discovering as we have proceeded - as I think every honorable member must on the further consideration . of a new question like this - that when sections of State Acts which are found to work well are applied to Federal affairs, they often produce unexpected consequences, and require consideration. Notwithstanding that, I have in every case cast the balance in my own mind in favour of the Bill as it stands. I hold myself free, however, to amend even those parts which are my own handiwork at any stage when I may see cause for amendment. And the greater part of the Bill is not my handiwork, but that of the right honorable member for' Adelaide. I am not in any way departing from the Bill in this case, because, as I have pointed out already, the Bill, as framed, allows organizations to be formed consisting entirely of trades unionists, or of non - unionists, or partly of unionists and partly of non - unionists. Therefore, the matter is open for consideration whether we shall gain most for this measure and its efficiency, by separating entirely .the membership of organizations under the .Bill from any other bodies to which they may belong, or whether it is necessary, in the interests of the Bill, and necessary for its working, as the Prime Minister contends, that trades unions shall be encouraged to come in and accept responsibility. That <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> a' question which is open for argument, and at present it seems to me that there is a good deal in the suggestion which the honorable and learned member for Angas has made. His proposal undoubtedly would create bodies which, being industrial wholly and solely in their purposes, will be open to those who choose to join them in order to secure the benefits of this Bill, without becoming involved in the various aims and efforts of trades unions. Those can be carried on by the unions in the future as they have been in the past. I have yet to see that this proposal cripples the Bill. If it did that, it would be an overmastering consideration, and I would be no party to it. But I do not see that it does cripple the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- That difficulty exists under the Bill as it stands. There is no compulsion upon existing unions tip come under the Bill as it stands. The Bill is framed so that although the existing unions do not come under it, an organization can be formed in any particular industry. If such an organization were formed in a particular industry - take the bootmaking industry, for instance - and did appea'l to the Federal Court, while a trades union in the same industry was appealing to a State Court, duplication must arise. That is one of the possibilities which I must say I did not foresee at the time when I was considering the drafting of the Bill as clearly as I see it now. But that possibility of duplication exists under the Bill as it stands, and may be worthy of consideration in any regard. If the amendment before us does not cripple the Bill, it would certainly facilitate its working. I hope that the honorable and learned member for Angas will review the language in which it is cast, so that it will leave the organizations to be formed as free as 'unions are now, provided that neither are devoted to other than industrial purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Most of the leaders of unions which exist at present partly for political purposes cannot be said to hold their positions for the purpose of obtaining work for the members of the unions. It has been admitted this evening that the average wages of the waterside workers of Sydney for the last five months have not amounted to more than 15s. a week. It is clear, therefore, that their union has not helped them. The amendment simply provides that we shall not allow any union which uses its funds for political purposes to come to the Court and ask for . assistance. There is a very good reason why that should be so, because we have given to organizations under this measure very great power indeed. Under clause 75 all fines, levies, and dues paid to an organization may be recovered from the members in any Federal or State Court of competent jurisdiction. Consequently, we have given power to these organizations to recover fees from their members. Many men may be perfectly willing to join a trades organization for certain purposes, but not for political purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I point out how desirable it is that we should limit the unions to one purpose only. Under clause 68 it will be found that during the pendency of any dispute no application to cancel the registration of an organization which is a party to the dispute, can be made or received, and no resignation of, or discharge from, the membership of such an organization can have any effect. It is, therefore, doubly incumbent upon us to see that these funds, which are to be collected under the machinery of this measure, shall not be collected for political purposes. The Minister of External Affairs has said that he believes the contribution of <inline font-style="italic">\d.</inline> per week would be sufficient for the purposes of this measure. </para>

Giving such powers as are here proposed for the recovery of fees and contributions, and to prevent members of an organization resigning during the consideration of a dispute, are we going to allow funds to be collected from them for any purpose other than the purposes of this Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- That is so. We hear to-night that as low a subscription as 13d. per year will be sufficient for the purposes of this measure, and in view of that statement I do trust that later on some honorable member will move that not more than 2s. per year shall be collected from any member of these organizations under this Bill. As we are trying to force these unions and organizations into being, I think we should have some auditor appointed to audit the accounts . of all unions, and to see where these funds really go to. If much larger sums than are necessary for the legitimate purposes of industrial unions are being collected, the sooner the great bulk of the members of these unions are protected in some way the better. </para>

                        <para>- That was with special reference, to New South' Wales, where the statistics were collected. I take the figures given by the unions, and they are, no doubt, largely exaggerated, because they certainly did not minimize them, at 120,000 members throughout- Australia. During the debate on the Defence Act, introduced by the right honorable member for Swan, we learnt that there are 970,000 men capable of bearing arms in Australia, so that there would be only one man out of every eight in the unions. The amendment should certainly be accepted if honorable members are really considering the interests of members of the unions. Honorable members on the Government side, if they were not connected with unions in positions of leadership, would look upon the matter differently if they found that, while they need only pay 13d. a year they were called upon to pay very much more to unions' funds. </para>

                        <para>- I . can answer the interjection ; most certainly, yes. They have fought in season and out' of season in favour of placing upon the statute-books in the different States, a measure which would enable them, in times of trouble, to go to the Arbitration Court, or to some impartial tribunal, to have their cases decided on their merits, instead of having to resort to strikes- That, in my opinion, is an organization for the purpose of industrial peace. Men have spent the whole of their lives in working among their fellows, endeavouring to build up organizations to better the conditions and to secure the interests of the labouring classes, and now that the unions have become so strong that they have forced even honorable members opposite to speak in favour of arbitration legislation when on the hustings, they are told from inside this Chamber that their organizations must not be registered under the Bill. Possibly those who are against unions, and do' not wish to have the opposition at election time of a pretty solid body of men prepared to support democratic 'measures, are on the right track; but I ask' them before committing themselves to remember that the unionists will know the track upon which they are going. </para>

It has been objected against the . existing organizations that they may have other objects than those contemplated by the Bill. What other objects have they? Most of the unions, by requiring from their members a subscription of a small amount per week, make provision for granting relief in days of adversity and sickness, so as to keep starvation from the doors of wives and children when the bread-winners die or are laid aside for a time. </para>

                        <para>- Those are associations which are doing useful work, but the condition of the workers has made trades unions necessary as well. Not only do the unions provide against the sickness or death of their members, but, in some cases, they have funds for the assistance of members out of work, for the purchasing of tools to replace lost tools, and even for old-age pensions for those who have been members for a certain number of years ; although this Parliament does not think that it can yet make that provision for the aged poor of Australia. Honorable members who favour the amendment say to the members of these unions, " You are not good enough to come under the provisions of the Bill. For the purposes of this measure, you must join other organizations." What reasonable justification is there for saying that the members of the existing unions will not adapt themselves to altered conditions, and stand loyally by the measure for which they have fought for so many years ? If honorable members opposite carry their views into effect, members of unions will be called upon to say whether they will forego the advantages given by the Bill or support two organizations when one would be sufficient.' I have had some little experience of trades unions, and I claim that the proposed duplication of organizations is absolutely unnecessary, while experience shows that it will probably make the measure inoperative. Since I have been connected with trades unions, I have not met with many persons outside the unions who particularly wish to come under the provisions of a measure such as this, and unless the measure is actively supported by the members of the unions, it will probably become a dead letter. Is it worth while to agree to an amendment which may have such disastrous consequences as that? The honorable member for North Sydney made the other night what was, to my way of thinking, a beautiful proposition. He suggested that the employers' might stop, say, 3d. a week from their employes' wages.  </para>

                        <para>- The amount does not matter. I take exception to the suggestion that the employers should stop any sum from their employes' wages. I believe that to advocate such an arrangement is to advocate what is equivalent to robbery, and I am not willing to allow it to become law without raising my voice to object to it: Honorable members opposite can provide ample safeguards in the measure. I am of opinion that provision should be made for unions keeping their doors open for the admission of members who are competent and willing to join them. I believe in every man being given an opportunity to join a union if he desires to do so. I have no objection to it being provided in the Bill that the books of the unions shall be kept open for the reception of the names of those who are willing to join, so long as they are competent to perform what is required by the particular trade to which the members of the union belong. </para>

                        <para>- That is a provision in the right direction. I understand that it is also provided that union funds shall not be expended in assisting strikers in any part of Australia. With those provisions in the Bill, honorable members have no justification for attacking the unions as they are now doing. In my opinion, if they persist in requiring the members of trades unions to join new organizations, and to pay additional fees, in order to . take' advantage of the provisions of the Bill, the measure will be an absolute failure, and will act against the best interests of the people, and endanger that industrial peace it is sought to secure. </para>

                    <para>- I am rather astonished that the criticism of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie was not more destructive, because he put into the mouths of honorable members on this side of the Chamber arguments which they had not used, and which they would not be so ridiculous as to use, and then proceeded to demolish them. No such proposal has been made as the destruction of trades unionism. I, for one, recognise the good which trades unionism has done in forwarding the interests of the workers, especially where efforts have been confined to the obtaining of better conditions of employment. But we are providing in this Bill, not merely that there shall be conciliation and arbitration, but that there shall be a power in the Court - a power which, if we can judge by the actions of other similar Courts, will be freely exercised - to compel persons to join unions, and to pay subscriptions to those unions, if they wish to earn a livelihood by following certain trades. As we are all aware, the Court may, after any dispute, declare a preference for unionists. If that is to be compulsory, surely it is going a little too far to say that the members of a trade shall not only be compelled to join organizations, but must also pay a certain sum per week for benefits such as the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has spoken of, and for which they may be already paying as members of a benefit society, so that they cannot afford to pay more. </para>

If the majority of the members of a union favour a certain policy, they have a right to spend a portion, or even the whole, of their funds in furthering it. But .when men are compelled to join a union in order to comply with the awards of the Arbitration Court, it is not reasonable to force them to pay weekly subscriptions for the support of a political policy of which, perhaps, they do not approve, or to which they may be absolutely opposed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and other unions do. Leaving that matter, I shall point out a still stronger argument, which will go to support my contention. Lately in Sydney a conference of unionists met. I believe that the members represented more than New South Wales, or, at any rate, that the proposal to which I am about to refer emanated not only from it, but also from other States. It was that the unions as a- body should join the Political Labour League, and it was lost by only 'two votes - a result which I venture to say will very soon be reversed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it would bind an individual union that objected to it, but I do contend that the indication is that almost a majority, at any rate a large number of the unions were in favour of joining the Political Labour League. There is no reason why they should not. because it is perfectly justifiable for them to do. </para>

But when it is sought by this Bill to absolutely compel, as some decisions of the Court would compel, workers to enter trades unions - and, of course, the funds of the unions must go to the Political Labour League when they are associated with it - </para>

                        <para>- If there is a union of the Political Labour Leagues and the trades unions, does any honorable member think it is decent to order that only the members of a certain political organization, as it will then mean, are to be employed in a certain industry ? Would it be decent if it were a freetrade or protectionist organization? And is it decent in the case of any other political organization? I am quite aware of the difficulty which is involved, and I do not intend to embody my suggestion in an amendment. Last week I simply outlined what I think is a broader, more democratic, safer, and more promising system of organization than that which is laid down in the Bill. We ought to be able at this period to make a step in advance towards the objects of such a measure as this if we are to be successful. For the sake of simplicity, take a single employer and his employes. The members of the organizations should be that employer on the one side and all his employes on the other. I mentioned last week, in reply to a challenge from the Prime- Minister, that this was perfectly easy of accomplishment. If I were going to debate it to-night, I would defy any honorable member to point out to me a single difficulty under that proposal more than there is under the provisions of the Bill, and against any difficulty that could be suggested I would point out several advantages. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie spoke of democracy and the democratic intent of the measure. Surely it is a wider democracy when the franchise is given to every man concerned, and is not confined to some few persons who may be concerned ? In reply to his statement that honorable members on this side were against democratic proposals, because of their opposition in this particular, I would say that his is comparatively a Tory proposal. It is an intention to govern by a limited number - a minority. </para>

Of course, I am quite aware that it was done when the honorable member was in knickerbockers or short frocks ; but when the extension of the political franchise was proposed, did honorable members urge that many persons would not vote, as a reason for keeping it from them?

But where is a privilege given to the non-unionists who comprise by far the larger number of the workers? </para>

                        <para>- Where is a privilege given to the non-unionist? He is to be bound by the Bill, and to be punished if he strikes ; but he is not to be allowed to have a voice unless he belongs to a body which, for some good reason or other, he has not hitherto been willing to join. The proposal of the honorable and learned member for Angas is not that any unionist shall be excluded. Every unionist can be a member of an organization, formed for the purposes pf the Act, and the Minister of External Affairs has stated that his contribution for such a purpose would be exceedingly trifling, and not more than he would be likely to have to pay additionally to his own union if it was made an organization under the. Bill. Under that plan the necessary fund could be created. Rather than do an injustice to a great number of men I would not care whether there was a fund or not, because I do not look much to the security it would provide. For this purpose the Minister has said that a farthing per head would be sufficient. </para>

In my proposal, as the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has objected, I did suggest that had it been possible at this time to weave it into the texture of the Bill, a very simple means of collection was available - one not unknown to the Courts now, and not unknown by arrangement with employes now, such as deductions for accident insurance funds. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that the amount must be comparatively small. My proposal was simply to give the Court power to collect a contribution from the men' through the medium of the employer, and to receive from the employer a similar contribution. That is done by the Courts now in a number of cases. </para>

                        <para>- Most certainly I would compel him to pay in a case where a dispute had arisen, and an organization had been created. Why not? It would not be compelling him to pay nearly so much - in fact, a mere fraction of what the Bill would compel him to pay if the Court decided, that a preference should be given to unionists. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the Minister's use of that phrase, but the Bill empowers the Court to give a preference to unionists, and a man cannot' be a unionist unless he has paid his entrance and subscription fees, and that would amount to a very much larger sum per annum than would the contribution made for the purposes of the Act only. Let me describe the sort of thing which may arise when preference has been given in a number of callings to unionists. Men who want work badly may come to the city, and turn to unskilled labour on the wharfs. But before they can obtain employment they must send in an application to join the union, and must, borrow or beg 10s. to pay their subscription, and await their election. , Even when a man obtains admission to the union possibly he may secure but little work. The Minister of External Affairs has stated that the members of the Wharf Labourers' Union in Sydney have not earned, on the average, more than 15s. per week for some time. A new comer in that union would probably obtain very little employment. He might find work in some other direction, and would then have to join another union. He would have to spend -some of his time in making his application, and he would also have to pay his entrance fee and subscription to that- union. If the fees were so reduced that it would not be difficult for a man to find the moneys - and it would not be difficult if the organization were intended to fulfil only the purposes of the Bill - men would be assisted, instead of being hampered, in that most trying of 'all occupations, the search for work. The amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member for Angas might very well receive the support of honorable members opposite. Those who oppose it, in effect, declare that the Bill is designed in the interests of the minority of the community. I do not, however, take that view. The Bill will be of benefit only if it serve the needs of the larger number. I desire to refer to one or two statements made by the Prime Minister. He said that for the purposes of the Bill we required organizations, whose members would be bound together by the ties of interest and sympathy. I do not for a moment reflect on the existing unions ; but I say that stronger ties of sympathy would exist between those engaged in one calling, or, it might be, in one employment. </para>

                        <para>- Their sympathies would also be stronger. Men who work alongside each other, perhaps for many years, are more likely to be in sympathy than are men who perhaps rarely, if ever, meet, although they are fellow-members of a trades organization. I believe that this Bill would have been made a stronger measure, and would have been more likely to prove successful, if it had gone further, and had aimed at dealing, not merely' with one section, but with all sections, of the employes in the industries over which it will exercise control. The Prime Minister also said that the influence exerted by the unions was very strong, and would doubtless be used for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Bill. I quite admit that ' the circumstances connected with the Teralba case to a large extent support his statement. In that instance the officials of the union, from first to last, opposed the action of the men, and advised them to resume work. I would point out, however, that in spite of the enormous pressure exerted by the officials, supported by probably nine-tenths of the coal-miners of the district, the small body of miners at Teralba refused to yield. </para>

The men stood out until others were being put into the mine, and they had either to resume their places, just as in the case of other strikes which break down, or lose their employment. </para>

                        <para>- Other men were being called in, and the work was going on without the strikers. The intense feeling which made these men resist the influence of their officers, who were working faithfully to carry out the purposes of the Act, and who were supported by nine out of every ten ' men in the district, afford me reason to fear for the success of the Bill. My belief is that' if the Teralba dispute had affected the whole of the miners in the Newcastle district, numbering many thousands, and the same intense feeling had been general, no provision under this or any other Bil] would ever have induced them to go to work. I would point out that, by including in an organization the whole of those engaged in an industry affected by a dispute, we should embrace not merely the extremists - either the extremely subservient or the extremely independent and pushing - but the average men engaged in that calling. If we desire to maintain the provisions of such a Bill as this we shall have to depend on the average good sense of both sides - employers and. employes. I have already stated that there is no intention to destroy the unions. They can continue to fulfil the purposes for which they have existed in the past, and can continue their activity. They can leaven the organizations formed for the purposes of this Bill, or, if others do not move, they can be at first, at any rate, the only organizations registered under the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the least objection to hear the target ring when the shots go home, so that I do nor mind these interjections. There is no intention on the part of the honorable and learned member for Angas to exclude unionists in any way. Unless the amendment is carried, non-unionists would be excluded, because they do not need the benefits conferred by the unions, or are opposed to their political objects. If the trades unions as such retained their objects relating to benefits or politics, and formed or joined an organization for the purposes of the Bill, with the small contribution which will be required to carry out its intentions - which would probably be required from the members of the unions, in any case - they would not exclude any persons from the organizations. In the other case, however, they would exclude, not merely the smaller, but the larger proportion of the workers. That, I think, is evidenced in New Zealand, where, after some years of experience, the unions, instead of gaining in strength, are becoming reduced in numbers in proportion to the workers outside. I do not like to hear the threat that if the amendment be carried the Bill will never be availed of -by the trades unions. </para>

I have made no secret as to my actual position with regard to this Bill. I have said that I should not attempt to destroy it by a side-wind. I believe that it is a complete farce, because it is constructed in such a manner that it will never prove effective. Honorable members are now beginning to see this. </para>

The Prime Minister argues at one time that the measure is intended for the settlement of disputes which extend beyond any one State, and the next minute we hear him stating that certain provisions are to operate in regard to disputes restricted to a State. </para>

                        <para>- Either two-thirds of the Bill will be worthless, or it is intended to operate in regard to disputes other than those which extend beyond any one State. The proposal contained in the amendment is a good one, and I believe that it will operate in the direction of making the measure effective. If the principle of conciliation and arbitration is to be effectively applied in times of stress, when wages have to go down, as well as at times when they go up - and the former will be the time of stress - we must secure the support not only of a small minority, but of the great majority of the workers and employers of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- If its effect would be nothing more than has been pointed out by the honorable member for North Sydney, I hold that it is entirely unnecessary. The Bill, as framed, already makes provision for organizations, and to repeat that provision will not add to its strength. I have no desire to reiterate what I said the other evening, but I wish to remind honorable members that the term " non-unionist " is very frequently misused. I contend that the spirit of unionism is more strongly developed in the working men of Australia than it is in any other part of the world. The term " non-unionist " is an unfair one to apply to men. simply because they are not members of unions. The fact that they do not belong (o these organizations is chiefly the result of carelessness. Every one must recognise that whatever good has been accomplished for the workers employed in any industry in Australia, has been the result of the efforts put forth by trades unionists. I am glad to note that during this discussion, no one has made any attack upon trades unionists as such. I have never claimed that this Bill will confer upon the general community all the benefits which have been predicted for it. It will, however, tend to the promotion of industrial peace, in which all, whether members of trades unions or not, will participate. Honorable members opposite have concentrated their efforts on behalf of some imaginary individuals, who, it is alleged, object to join trades unions. It is admitted that those who have improved the conditions of labour in every industry - who have done everything in their power to abolish sweating - are the most thrifty section of the working classes. Yet all their interests are to be cast to the winds - why? Simply because it is urged that they are associated with a political movement. I propose, very briefly, to give honorable members the absolute facts of the case. The union of which I have the honour to be president is the one which, above all others, has been branded as political. I know of only one union which has a political fund. </para>

                        <para>- It is about time that we got away from these exaggerated notions. In the Australian Workers' Union we have a fund which is intended to be spent for political purposes, and which represents a contribution of one shilling per member annually. Under the rules of that organization there is power to levy an additional sixpence. It will thus be seen that is. 6d. is the total sum which the branches can vote for political purposes, and they can do that only after a plebiscite of their members has been taken. Moreover, the latter are not questioned as to their political opinions. Every member possesses a certificate of membership, which, upon presentation to the Political Labour League, causes him to be recognised as a member of that organization without further payment. The parliamentary fund of one shilling per member annually has never yet been expended. That, however, is the amount of the. vote which is intended to defray the expenses of the candidates selected by the League. The trades' unions, as such, mind their own industrial business. Now, let me refer to the other two unions which, possibly, may appeal to the proposed Court. I refer to the Seamen's Union, and to the Waterside Workers. I know that neither of them contribute a single sixpence to political work. The Australian Workers' Union is the only organization which does so. Every member of that union pays an annual fee of <inline font-style="italic">ten</inline> shillings, one shilling of which is supposed to be devoted to political purposes; but I repeat that that sum has never been expended. Instead of a considerable sum being spent for political purposes, I may frankly confess that the funds of the Political Labour League are usually at low water. When a vote of the union was taken upon the question of contributing even sixpence per member annually, it was not carried. Some of the older trades unions have become very conservative, and carefully exclude politics from their meetings. They leave political matters entirely to the Political Labour League. The honorable member for New England has referred to a certain rule, but I would point out that that rule existed for only one year. It slipped through during the very year that we registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New South Wales. I do not remember any discussion taking place in reference to it. Moreover, although it expressed a certain opinion, it is scarcely necessary to point out that it could not be enforced. The individual members of 'our union are as free as are those of any other organization. No doubt they are politically educated, so that very few of them support the rivals of the selected labour candidates. That, however, is but natural. The rule to which reference has been made was passed by the conference which was held prior to the registration of the union, and was abolished as speedily as possible. Some reference has been made to the payments of the members of trades unions. All the members of the Miners' Unions pay when in work. When not in work they make no contributions. The trades unions of to-day are the result of a very long period of development. They manage their own affairs exceedingly well, as every one knows who has been in touch with them. The talk about what some people make out of them will not be believed by any one who has had any experience. Unfortunately the unions do not pay those who work for them as well as they ought to do. I venture to say that the officers of trades unions have done more gratuitous work for their fellow-men than any other class. They devote nights and nights of work to the interests of the unions. I am making these observations because of the fear which some honorable members appear to entertain that the unions will devote their funds to political purposes. If this amendment were carried, the whole measure would have to be recast. It would be necessary, in the first place, to define what is meant by political. For instance, the New South Wales coal miners have been asking for an eight hours' law. They very properly require an Act of Parliament to protect their lives and health, in reference to the management of coal mines. There is a Regulation of Mines Act in existence in Victoria. Would it be a wrong thing for an organization to ask a State Parliament to pass a measure of that description ? Would not that be industrial? That is the line that all trades unions of which I have any knowledge have taken up with reference to all questions. The matters with which they have dealt were questions on which they were competent to express an opinion as experts. Certainly it will be necessary to define the limits within which trades unions may work if this amendment is agreed to. But the wisest plan is to recognise existing organizations. This Bill would compel the men to organize afresh. When the New South Wales Arbitration Act was passed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise's</inline> first impression was that the unions would have to make special provision in their rules for the purpose, but on further consideration, and after registration, we found that it was unnecessary. The unions obtained registration as industrial organizations, and added to their names the term "industrial union of employes." Under this measure it is not even necessary that an organization of employes should be a trades union at all. It, therefore, appears to me that any reasonable objection that could have been raised has been removed. Honorable members may dismiss from their minds the idea of the unions exerting their power for political purposes. Of course, it is natural that the grouping of men together in a union gives them a common interest, but they do their political work entirely apart from their trades union work. Indeed, so far as concerns what is called the fighting programme of the Political Labour Leagues, I do not remember an occasion when the candidates of all parties opposed to labour candidates have not signified their approval of the planks of that programme. I am not speaking, of course, of the whole labour programme that may be put forward at some time, but of the fighting programme put forward for present electoral purposes; and I have never heard of any candidate opposed to a labour candidate who did not favour those proposals. But every member of a trades union is free to vote as he pleases on such matters. There is no coercion of any kind. So far as concerns the organization with which I am particularly concerned, we have done our best to bring our rules into conformity with the New South Wales Act. We have been quite willing to eliminate any objectionable rule. We have been one of the first labour organizations to fight for the passing of legislation of this kind, realizing from hard and costly experience that this is the only way to bring our opponent organization, the Pastoralists' Union, into a Court where we can get justice done. There would be no gain from the establishment of new organizations to act instead of the existing unions. The simple result would be that one body would be working inside the Court and the other outside, whereas under the Bill, as it stands, trades unions by becoming registered would be directed and controlled by the Court. If the Court saw in the rules of any union anything that was opposed to the Act, it would order its elimination. The union with which I am particularly concerned has, during the eighteen years of its fighting life - and it has 1 certainly been a militant body- been industrial in all its aims. It appealed to Parliament to pass legislation providing for better accommodation for shearers in the huts. That action may possibly be called political in one way, because Parliament was asked to pass the legislation ; but to all intents and purposes it was industrial. The union has devoted itself entirely to industrial work. The two other principal organizations in New South Wales do not touch political questions. I can assure the Committee, with a full knowledge of what I am talking about, that by making the alteration proposed they will cause friction to which I can see no end. I do not accuse honorable members opposite of a deliberate desire to crush trades unionism. I accept their assurances that they do not wish to do so. But certainly what they propose 'will have that tendency. I do not think that, as a matter of- fact, it will crush the unions, and while it fails in that regard it will make the measure less workable than it would otherwise be. I would point out the tremendous moral influence the unions have had, and how they have disciplined their men. I could quote cases in my own experience of the marvellous influence of discipline that has arisen from union action. We want to use that power of discipline in the interests of industrial peace, "and that can best be done by recognising the existing organizations. In one case my own organization recognised an unfair act on the part of a number of men towards a gentleman at Wagga, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Heffernon.</inline> He was made to suffer, in regard to his stock, at a critical period by a number of unionists. Recognising that, the union gave him compensation out of its funds for the loss which he had been put to. That is only one case where the power of a union has been exercised practically to compel a section of its members to do a fair thing. I cannot help having one rap at honorable members opposite, who have professed at all times to be so strongly in favour of freedom. On the present occasion they are running directly in the opposite direction. They are becoming the strongest coercionists we have. They propose even .to take money from men by force, and practically to compel every man engaged in an industry to enter an organization. I must' appeal to honorable members who are adopting this view to adopt a moderate course. I am contending for moderation and freedom on this occasion, believing that what may be called the medium course proposed by the Bill, will be the wisest. That is the course which will disturb existing conditions as little as possible, and which will result in the control of existing unions by the Court in the interests of industrial peace. Honorable members opposite are taking a most dangerous departure, and I am astonished at the attitude of such men as the honorable and learned member for Werriwa, and the honorable member for New England. I trust that the honorable and learned member for Parkes will not join them, but will show his old faith in the freedom of the individual, and support me in standing for some degree of liberty. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Darling speaks so nicely and so quietly that one scarcely likes to differ from him, or to raise any objection to what he says. He has told us that the union he represented was not political, and that they discarded certain rules indicated as political as quickly as ever they could. They discarded those rules when they learnt that the Registrar would not register them unless they were taken out. </para>

                        <para>- The law does not say that they can strike, but we know that a man can leave another man's service if hs pleases. There is no privilege in it at all. But when honorable members representing unionists come here and ask for particular privileges by law, it is our duty to see that people who are outside the unions are put in the same position, and that it is made absolutely clear that every man shall have the right to employment ; that there shall be no restriction against his getting employment. A man can belong to 500 unions if he likes, we have nothing to do with that ; but if he comes here to get some privilege by law - and we provide in this Bil] that the Court may give a preference to unionists - then it is our duty to see that the unions shall be wide open, and that they must not be political bodies. Why should any man, in order to get a living, be compelled to join a union which may have political objects, of which he does not approve? Whether we are unionists or non-unionists there is no answer to the contention that, as a Legislature, we have no right to put any difficulties in the way of any man getting a living. Honorable members opposite talk of the'ir altruism, and the self-sacrifice of unionists for others, but every argument I have heard them use is to the effect that, " We have made sacrifices, but we do not desire that others shall get the advantage of them. We have made sacrifices for ourselves." That is actually their position. What honorable members opposite, and those whom they represent, are fighting for is that, by law, unionists shall have all power and non-unionists be left to starve, or do anything else they please, for what they care. We are here, every one of us, to guard against that. I say we should treat all men alike. We hear talk of Toryism, but real Toryism is the giving of special privileges to certain men. The men who should be fighting for liberty for all are fighting for the fullest freedom for one set of men, and no freedom at all for others; and they call themselves Liberals and Democrats. That is simply a misuse of terms. It is the greatest Toryism to give special privileges to any men. We have been told that the pressure of the local union was used to induce the Teralba men to return to work after they had gone out on strike. May I say that the award did not involve any punishment in that particular case, and that the men would not go to work for all the pressure of the union. The employers were then urged to punish them by law for having violated their contract, and at last the employes yielded, and on the very day they were to appear before the Court they agreed to resume work. Let us put the thing on right lines. The men yielded, not to the pressure of the union, but to the pressure of the law, when they found they were summoned for having violated their contract. What possible objection can there be to the amendment? Let these organizations be absolutely free for men to join, so that all men may have an opportunity of getting a living. 1 do not care what is the -wording of the amendment .if it is made clear that there will be nothing to deter men from joining organizations, and that there will be no utilizing of the organizations for political purposes, or that otherwise they shall get no preference, or shall not be registered, or that, if registered, their registration shall be cancelled. I am not here to crush unions. I say let them go on. I believe they are doing a great deal of good. I admit that there are splendid men in the unions, but there are as good men outside. I admit that there are bad men outside the unions, but there are just as bad in the unions. Human nature is exactly the same, whether it is unionist or non-unionist, and, as far as I am concerned, I shall be doing my duty in seeking to give a means of living to every man in this land of ours. I take up the position that we should not give special privileges to any body, and, in doing so, I hold that I am a Liberal, and that I am carrying out liberal principles. </para>

                        <para>- I have no wish to stop the business, but I think .the debate might be adjourned. If the Prime Minister does not agree I must continue the debate. I am heartily in accord with the amendment. If we look at the history of unions we will find that they were first of all based on the idea of collective bargaining, to gain what could not be gained by individual bargaining. Then there came a time, and the honorable member for Darling will bear me out in this, when men banded themselves together in unions for the purpose of securing the influence of persons in Parliament for the' betterment of their conditions. </para>

                <para class="block">Union, and I can have no - better authority on the subject than (he honorable member for Darling. I think that must be pretty obvious to so old a campaigner as the honorable member. I hold that these objects are perfectly legitimate. The object, in the first instance, of the old trades unionism was to prevent sweating.. The object of the new trades unionism is also perfectly legitimate. There is no reason why men should not band themselves together to collectively exercise the suffrage. Now the- Parliament is prepared apparently to go beyond that stage to the third stage of industrial evolution, when it is proposed to secure industrial peace absolutely by means of the Federal Arbitration Court. Surely the objects for which trades unions were created have gone, now that we are placing an omniscient Justice of the High Court in the position of Judge of the Arbitration Court, to decide all questions of wages and all conditions of living. The only reason for keeping the unions in existence will be to carry out what may be termed friendly society objects, the providing of funds for the support of wives and children ' when the breadwinners go or are laid aside. Non-unionists, however, often belong to benefit societies, pure and simple, and if they were compelled to join the existing trades unions, would have ' to subscribe to those objects twice over. They number more than those in the unions, and we have no right . to so compel them. I wish now to say a word or two in reply to the honorable member for Darling. He has told us that the subscription to the Australian Workers' Union is 10s. a year,, of which rs. is credited to the political fund. It will be generally conceded that shearers, as a class, work for only a short period in each year, so that the members of the Australian Workers' Union pay approximately is. a week to the union for every week that they are working. That union, we are told, is the only political union in New South Wales ; but that it is not increasingly popular is shown, by the fact that in 1902 its members numbered almost 21,000, while in 1904 they numbered barely11,500, a falling off of nearly 50 per cent. </para>

Thus the members of the political union do not- appear to place great store upon their privileges.' The proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney is that the Court should, through the employers, keep back a proportion of every employe's wage, and register that employl as an employé in a particular, industry. The honorable member for Darling followed with a harrowing picture of the impracticability of the administration by . the Court of all the details of a union organizer's work. He is quite prepared to hand over to the State the administration of the details of the tobacco business, but the very much more important duties of a unionist organizer and perambulating agitator he thinks could not with safety be left to the Court to perform. </para>

                        <para>- I did not know that it was held by any persons of conservative tendency in this country. We were told this evening by the Minister of External Affairs that a contribution of £d- or 1/2d.. per head per week would easily meet the expenses resultant on a union being brought under the Act. If that amount were deducted from the wages of the men, and returned straight to headquarters, and brought under the administration of the Registrar, there would be required, on the average, one clerk for probably 5,000 men. .At the present time a union running from 100 to 800 members; even this rapidly decreasing union, with its 11,000 members, requires a secretary and its officials. The smallest union requires its secretary to be paid at from ,£100 to about ^280 a year. One clerk could do the work of ten secretaries, because it would all be combined and simplified. So that, far from this entailing an increased cost to the employe, it would effect a. very great saving to him. If the unions wished to keep together and run their benefit projects, by all manner, of means let them do so. But they would still be a body within a body. They would be a benefit organization or a union - whatever they might choose to call themselves - within a general organization, which alone men could be compelled to join. It seems to me that this is really the crux of the question. ' The amendment would npt "Interfere in the least degree with the rights of unions. They could still maintain their benefit projects. Their old power to strike would df course lie gone, "willy nilly," the moment that the Act was brought into operation. Perhaps at this hour the Prime Minister will consent to progress being reported. </para>

                    THOMSON (North Sydney). - There are other honorable members who wish to speak. It will be remembered that when I was speaking this evening there was a question between the Prime Minister and myself as to the duration bf the. Teralba strike. Speaking from _ memory; I was under the impression that it lasted for three weeks; while he, also speaking from memory, was under the impression that it lasted for a fortnight. I said that I would refer to documents I .have to show the period. I find that the honorable gentleman was right in the statement that he made. Although I do not think that it affects my argument in any way, still I consider it only right to make this explanation to the Committee. I would suggest to the honorable gentleman that he might well agree to progress being reported now. Progress reported.
