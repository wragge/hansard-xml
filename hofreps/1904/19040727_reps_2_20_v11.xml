                        <para>- My attention has been drawn to the report of the debate which took place in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria yesterday ; and,' if the. newspaper accounts be correct, the only explanation I can give, of the statements alleged to have been made is .that there must be a great want of knowledge of the facts of the case on the part of those whose utterances are reported. I regret that, owing to the shortness of time at the disposal of my officers, I have not been able to obtain full details relating to the case; but it is altogether incorrect to say that the Department has not done everything that could be done to minimize friction, and to reduce the trouble which the Government of Victoria has met in trying to arrange for the sale of duty stamps to the public. As a matter of fact, the difficulty was adjusted some days ago. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and at what are known as allowance offices. The Victorian Comptroller of .Stamps agreed to furnish the Postmaster-General's Department with a complete list of the non-official offices of which he desired to make use for the sale' of duty stamps, and with a statement of the advances which he proposed to make to each - office. This advance is to be rigidly adhered to, the Postmaster-General's Department ascertaining to what extent it will be desirable to increase the guarantee, so as to cover any losses which the State may sustain, and the State paying for the additional sum guaranteed. If this arrangement is approved of, action will be taken by the ' Comptroller to supply stamps to all unofficial offices in his list. The postage is to be paid' by him, and the postmasters concerned are to correspond directly with him, being paid a commission of 2 j per cent, oh the sales. The criticisms passed on our action in the local Parliament last evening are quite unjust. To show the earnest' desire of the Department to do everything in its power to meet the wishes of the Victorian Government in this matter, I may inform the House that, from the 1st March, 1901, to the 1 st March, 1904, our officials have been transacting the work incidental to the sale of Victorian duty stamps without cost to the State, the value of the work done amounting to £12,160. The estimated proportion of the salaries of the officers of the General Post Office chargeable with the distribution of duty stamps, promissory notes, and bills of exchange, was £4,764 for the three years I have named. Altogether, duty stamps, promissory notes, and bills of exchange, to the value of £209,375 18s. 5d. were sold, on which the commission at 2 J percent, would be £5,234. The' estimated, postage incurred amounted to £1,586, while for accommodation, book's, stationery, envelopes, and so on, the sums of £156 and £300, have been put down, and £i'2b for machines ; making a total for the three years of £12,160, for which <inline font-style="italic">n&amp;</inline> payment whatever has . been made to the Commonwealth by Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- Although we are serving the same people, the Government of Victoria makes a very substantial charge for all the services which it performs for the Commonwealth. As a case in point, I mav mention,'- for the information of honorable members, that formerly when the railway telegraph officers despatched a telegram for the public, the Railways Commissioners charged the Post and Telegraph Department 25 per cent. Now "they. retain 50 per cent. In many other ways the charges made by the State Government have been considerably increased. </para>

                            <para>- In the other States I may inform the -honorable member that the' local Governments provided almost from the inception of the Commonwealth for the sale of duty stamps at their own cost. It was only the State of Victoria which threw upon the Commonwealth the responsibility o'f selling these stamps, and Victoria has had the sole advantage of making use of Commonwealth officials in this respect. I am also informed that the Victorian Government has increased the railway travelling rates for the Militia. As to me point that we ought not to charge anything for such services, my reply is that the Post and Telegraph Department is a purely business Department of the Government, and that it is in accordance with the law passed by this Parliament that every service rendered bv that Department shall be paid for. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask the Postmaster-General a further question. Is it a fact that the Post and Telegraph Department - I. do not suggest under the Minister's direction - has insisted that when the Victorian Government wishes to supply duty stamps to the various staff offices - not contract offices - it shall communicate with each particular postmaster direct, instead of the Department taking the very small trouble of sending the duty stamps to the various postmasters, together with the ordinary postage stamps? I believe that this has caused a considerable amount of 'irritation. </para>

It is a pamphlet which professes to set forth the case for the western Capital Sites, and is apparently issued under the authority of the Western Capital League. It is a well got-up production, which apparently has cost a good deal of money. I notice on the back page that it has been issued by " William Applegate Gullick. Government Printer, New South Wales." I wish to know whether it has been issued at the expense of the Commonwealth Government, and if so, whether similar publications will be authorized' in the interests of the sites in the south and southeast? </para>

                            <para>- I assume that. I can assure the honorable member for Eden-Monaro that the pamphlet has nothing to do with the Commonwealth Government. Of course, if the State Government of New South Wales cares to offer facilities for the production of a publication of this kind, it is their concern and their responsibility. I may add, however, that it does not follow that because the pamphlet bears the imprint of the New South Wales Government Printer it is a Government publication; because I know that in some cases private persons can arrange, if they pay the cost, to have printing done at the New South Wales Government Printing Office. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question without notice. At the last Federal election some of the Victorian police were engaged at polling places. I understand that the Federal Government sent a cheque to the Chief Commissioner of Police for the purpose of paying these officers. The Chief Commissioner returned that sum to the Federal Government, and stated that he could not pay the police who were employed inside the polling-booths unless the officers who were engaged outside were also remunerated. I communicated with the Chief Commissioner of Police, and he stated that he would consent to pay the men if the Federal Government would agree to distribute the amount equally between those who were engaged outside and inside the booths. I sent the reply to the late Treasurer, and asked him whether he would be agreeable to adopt the course suggested. Statements have been made in the press to the effect that the Government would not consent, and I should now like to ask the Prime Minister whether he is agreeable to adopt the course proposed, and, if not, what his reasons are for declining to do so? </para>

The Government have paid over to the State authorities, a certain sum for the remuneration of the police officials who rendered direct services. That amount has been paid by the Police Department into the State Treasury, and is being held there pending a decision as to how it is to be allocated.

                        <para>- This matter is at present under the consideration of the Government at the instance of the Minister of Trade and Customs- It is only right that I should state that the whole position is rather complicated so far as taking over control of the Department by proclamation is concerned, by the fact that in none of the States, so far as I am aware, is there a distinct Department of Quarantine. In all cases matters relating to quarantine are administered by the Health Departments cf the States, and therefore a complication would be introduced if it were considered desirable to take control by proclamation. There is no distinct Department of Quarantine, as there was a Post-office or Military Department, that could be taken over in going order by the Commonwealth. I do not say that the difficulties are insuperable. It may be possible to make some arrangement by which certain officers can be recognized as quarantine officials, and in that way any obstacles may be removed. In any case, the matter is under the consideration of the Government, and we hope to arrive at a speedy conclusion so far as our recommendation to the House is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what practice has been followed at Thursday Island, but I am given to understand that war vessels coaling there have usually employed local labour. I find, on making inquiry, that at Sydney the opposite practice has been followed. There, the Admiralty employ the crews in coaling their ships, and in any case, it seems to me that the question whether the Naval authorities employ local labour or utilize the services of their own men is one within the discretion of the. Admiralty. </para>

                    <para class="block">The reason why I am asking for a Supply Bill before the presentation of the Budget statement, which previously in this Parliament has been presented before Supply has been asked for, is that we find it impossible to get the Estimates ready in time to permit of the Financial Statement being delivered during this month. The classification scheme of the Public Service Commissioner was presented only during the last week in June - the last month of the financial year just closed - and that necessitated the recasting of the Estimates, so far as salaries are concerned, throughout Australia. When it is remembered that the sending of the Estimates back through the Departmental heads involves in some cases a journey to and from Western Australia and other equally distant parts of the Commonwealth, as well as the time occupied in altering the Estimates themselves, it will be recognised that it was not possible to get the work done in the usual time upon this occasion. The particular Supply Bill which I am about to present contains nothing more than the usual votes for the current month, based on last year's Estimates, and not including any increase on account of the classification scheme or any other increments. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing new whatever, except that it includes the payment during this month of an item which would ordinarily be spread over a longer period, in the shape of , £30,000 for cable subsidies. These are distributed over three States, and, roughly speaking, represent £10,000 on account of each. The reason why I am asking for this amount in a lump sum is that it must be in England by a certain date, and if the Treasurer has not authority to transmit it at any time that may prove convenient,, he may be compelled to pay a heavier rate of exchange than would otherwise be the case. This amount. I would point out, would have to be paid in any circumstances. In the case of Victoria it represents the whole expenditure for the year. I draw, attention to that fact because usually honorable members do not like to be inadvertently deprived of their right of criticism in respect of any vote which has been completely expended when the ordinary Estimates come under review. Nevertheless it still comes within the general limitation that it is for services for which we are bound to pay. Consequently I do not think that there can be any real objection to this item ot £30,000. It is economical to vest the Treasurer with authority to take advantage of the money market at any period that may prove convenient for him to do so, because exchanges fluctuate, and sometimes facilities are available which allow careful officials to effect a considerable saving in the transmission of money abroad. Then there is a total sum of £18,000 in respect of ocean mail contracts. That amount represents one-fourth of the £72,000 which we have to pay under contract to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation and Orient Steam Navigation companies. I am asking for three months' supply upon that item, because, as honorable members are aware, the contract expires in a comparatively short period, and as it is money which must be paid, precisely the same arguments apply to it as are applicable to the vote for the ordinary cable subsidies. </para>

                            <para>- To mail subsidies. It will be found upon page 26 of the Bill. The amount in question - £18,000 - is for the whole of the States. These are the only two items contained in the Bill, outside of the regular salaries. Under these circumstances, I think that we are quite justified in asking that the amounts which I have specified shall be granted during this month. I may say that the Treasurer is always anxious to reduce the cost of exchange on these remittances to the motherland. In some instances if the States Treasurers are in credit in London, and do not particularly want the money there, we are able to make an arrangement with them which saves the entire exchange between here and London They allow us to draw upon them in London, and we allow them to draw upon us here. In various ways of that kind, every care is taken to keep these expenses down to the lowest possible limit. In pursuance of that policy, I am asking that these two sums shall be included in this Bill. They have to be paid in any case, and the only question involved is, whether they should be included in this measure instead of being held over until the general Estimates are submitted a month or two later. When alluding to this measure a day or two ago, I neglected to indicate that I also desired to pass a small Supplementary Appropriation Bill for a sum of £5,000, which is intended to cover arrears for the year 1902-3. This money was paid out of the Treasurer's Advance Account, and, therefore, has been allocated, but it was only brought to account with the different votes about seven or eight months ago. It is just an ordinary case of remanets, such as must be provided for from time to time. It does not involve any fresh expenditure. The money, however, has to be credited to the proper votes, in conformity with the. Audit Act. I ask that the Bill dealing with these small arrears may be passed immediately the Supply Bill has been disposed of. </para>

We must assume that, in connexion with the classification of the Public Service, the Public Service Commissioner discharged his very onerous duties with proper diligence. </para>

Consequently I do not think that any reasonable man can object to the course which Ministers are taking. They are strictly limiting their request for supply to the present month, with the addition of the special items which the Treasurer has mentioned, and personally I do not see any reason why we should not grant this-supply at once. </para>

                    <para>- I should like the Prime Minister to give the House some information, if it is convenient for him to do so, in regard to a statement which has appeared in the press that it is proposed to reinstate <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> I have a knowledge of the facts of the case, and think that if the Government propose to take this action they should place the papers on the table of the House. The matter is a serious one, and it is for that reason that I think the papers should be forthcoming for the information, not only of honorable members, but also of the military authorities and the public; I do not at present propose to discuss the merits of the case, but <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was treated most harshly, and was finally turned out of South Africa. It is not reasonable to assume that he was subjected to this treatment without cause, but, so far as my memory serves me, the reason for the extreme action of the Imperial authorities is not clear. He was kept a close prisoner for months, tried by court martial, and found guilty of failing to make a report in regard to a serious crime, and was reprimanded, and released from custody. Immediately afterwards he was re-arrested, kept a close prisoner, taken to the Cape, and placed on board ship, and, so to speak, kicked out of the country. He then returned to Australia, and his case has been under consideration by the Commonwealth Government for more than twelve months. The General Officer Commanding is very much adverse to his reinstatement, and gives his reason for this in an open and straightforward manner. </para>

                        <para>- They are on record, and I believe that they are not confidential. Previous Governments have hesitated to take any action. While Minister of Defence, I endeavoured to obtain full information with regard to the case, but was not very successful. To reinstate an officer who has practically been kicked out of the British Army in South Africa, and returned to Australia practically in disgrace, is a very serious step, and the Government should exercise the greatest care in taking action, in that direction. At the same time, no one desires that an injustice shall be done. So long a time has elapsed since the close of the war that it is now very difficult to elicit all the facts. </para>

                        <para>- It will be found, from a perusal of the papers in the Defence Department, that I have never written a word against him in any of the official correspondence. If he is as innocent as he says he is, and as those who advocate his cause assume him to be, it is strange that he has suffered for such a length of time the harsh treatment which has been complained of without making more protest. If I were an innocent person who had been arrested, and, while in durance vile, had been treated with the greatest harshness, dismissed from the Army, and sent away from South Africa in disgrace, I would not let one or two years pass without making a strong protest. I would use both voice and pen in making my wrongs known throughout the British Dominions. But although I long ago advised those who support <inline font-weight="bold">Major</inline> Lenehan's cause to take the one straightforward course open to them, and set forth his grievances in a petition to the King, which I promised to have sent forward through His Excellency the Governor-General, my advice has never been acted on. </para>

That, to me, is strange conduct. . I told those who were supporting his case in Sydney that the proper thing to do was to prepare a petition to the King, and that if such a petition were forwarded to me, I would look into it, and write a minute upon it to accompany it when sending it to the Imperial authorities ; but nothing was done. Notwithstanding the fact that the correspondence on the subject is voluminous, very little indeed of it is in the writing of the individual concerned. </para>

That was as far as the case had gone when the right honorable member for Swan resumed his duties, and mv administration of the Department ceased.

I heard  rumours of some other charge against him for his conduct in South Africa, but it related to a private matter, and I could not take notice of it, as it was not formally placed before me. The evidence submitted does not contain anything to justify taking away this officer's character, and unless the Imperial authorities can give better ground than appears in the papers for what was done, I shall support the action of the present Government. Representations were made on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> not only to myself, but also to the right honorable member for Swan, and I think to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, asking for reinstatement. </para>

The proper course to follow was to ask for the papers before making any statement about the case. So far as the Government is concerned, the ' Minister of Defence went into the papers very carefully, and I also have gone into the case. I have taken heed of the minute of the late Minister of Defence upon the matter, and I . say that, so far as the papers show, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> has been most unjustly treated. He has been treated unjustly as much by his own Government as by the Imperial authorities in South Africa. </para>

First, an officer can be cashiered ; or, secondly, he can be severely reprimanded ; or, thirdly, he can be reprimanded. Reprimanding is the lightest sentence that can be inflicted upon an officer. On going into the case thoroughly, the court martial, which was composed wholly of Imperial officers of high standing in the service - determined to inflict upon <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> the lightest sentence they could inflict. He was presented before them and reprimanded. But immediately afterwards, for some reason which only the authorities - other than those constituting the court martial - could explain to the public, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was placed under arrest, and deported from South Africa. I say that that was a most unjust and un-British thing to do. It rested with the military authorities to justify their treatment of an Australian officer in that manner. The right honorable member for Swan states that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> allowed his case to lie without taking any action. That is absolutely incorrect. The right honorable member made the same statement to imf some time ago. I had taken an interest in the case, in conjunction with the honorable member for North Sydney. About eighteen months ago, before I went to New Zealand, the right honorable member made a similar statement to me, but I was informed later that it was not correct. The right honorable member could not have been made aware of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> immediately he reached Australia, or within a few weeks of his arrival in Sydney, appearing to think that the proper persons to support him in his trouble were his own Government, made a complaint and asked for an inquiry into the whole of the circumstances. It seems to me that that was a proper thing for him to do, </para>

                        <para>- For . a considerable time the right honorable member opposite took no steps. Coming to the steps that were taken more recently, I may say that when I was asked to look into the case I had a great deal of prejudice with regard to it. Naturally I thought,, from newspaper reports, as did many other people, that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> had had something to do with the shooting of the Boers. The impression conveyed to most people outside was that he was in some way concerned in it. But when I looked into the papers for myself, and made inquiries, I found that such was not the fact. That brings me to the remark that the last Government did eventually communicate with the War Office with reference to the case. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that my first impression was incorrect. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was concerned, there was nothing more against him, according to the reply received by the Australian authorities from the War Office, than was before the court-martial, by which he was punished with the lightest possible sentence. That is at least sufficient to show that nothing further should have been done by this Government against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> What does a reprimand mean? Is it not a fact - I have been so informed, and I believe it to be a fact - that quite a number of officers holding important commands in South Africa were at different times reprimanded - I do not say for exactly the same offence that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was guilty of - by the Courts of Military Inquiry, and were allowed to continue in their commands in the Imperial Service. Perhaps in some cases an error of judgment had been committed, and they were reprimanded, and nothing further occurred. I do not pretend to explain the action - which seems to me inexplicable - of the British, authorities, other than those comprising the court martial, in taking subsequent steps against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> It was most extraordinary that, after the court martial had inflicted the lightest, sentence that could possibly be passed, on <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> the authorities should subsequently take steps to deport him from the country. </para>

                        <para>- That is evidenced by the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was asked to undertake the formation of the particular corps which he subsequently commanded. When it was proposed to form the corps, a cable was sent to the New South Wales authorities asking the State Government for an extension of his leave and for permission to utilize his services. That did not make it appear that he had behaved badly, either in the cause of the Empire, or as representing Australia during the South African campaign. That alone should, I think, have been sufficient to cause most of us at any rate to suspend our judgment in regard to his case. This matter was inquired into by several Ministers. The right honorable member for Swan, as Minister of Defence, first took it in hand. Whilst he was in charge of the Defence Department, however, I do not think that the matter came to a head. </para>

I do not suppose that any one of us would, for a moment, justify an action of that kind. In regard to that rumour, there is abundant evidence, from what I can glean, that if it were referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> he would be able to get those men who served under him at the time to say whether or not there was any truth in it. It is admitted to be a rumour only. The minute goes on to say : - </para>

                    <para>He was many miles away from the place where the crimes were committed, which formed the subject of the trial by court martial of Morant, Wilton,' and Handcock; and the very great importance attached to their trial suggests that, if there were anything beyond the two charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> he would also have been tried with them. </para>
                    <para>It would obviously be impracticable for this Department to act on rumours as if they were proved facts, which there is nothing in the papers so tangible as to justify me in so regarding them, it being, indeed, officially admitted that there is no proof of facts against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> beyond what appears in the evidence before the court martial. </para>
                    <para>A perusal of that evidence should satisfy any unprejudiced mind that it contains nothing against" <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> beyond the failure to report, for which he was punished, and for which his punishment was completed when the court martial rose after reprimanding him. </para>
                    <para>If the treatment subsequently meted out to tin's officer, namely, his "arrest, confinement, and deportation, was for the failure to report, then it would seem that he has suffered additional punishment on that account beyond the sentence of the court martial. On the other hand, if this treatment was on account of rumours, as to which possibly there was no evidence, then it is equally contrary to English justice. Whichever view is, therefore, taken, I cannot see my way to sanction the removal of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> from the Forces on account of anything that appeared in the evidence before the court martial. </para>
                    <para>Being thus thrown back upon that evidence, I find that his Judges considered a reprimand sufficient punishment for the offence there disclosed ; and it would be manifestly unjust were I, upon the same evidence, to sanction his removal from his own Forces in respect to what was considered adequate punishment by a mere reprimand by a tribunal of the Forces in which he was then serving. </para>
                    <para>With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan's</inline> claims for pay and gratuities, and for compensation, on account of the confiscation of his horses, these are matters which took place during his service in the British Army, and the claims which he puts forward are only referable to that Service. </para>
                    <para>They constitute, therefore, matters extraneous to the control of this Department, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> pursues them, his proper course is by petition through the Governor-General to the Imperial Government. </para>

                        <para>- Of course not. Any confidential papers will have to be held back by the Department. Personally, I expressed the view, before I took office, that if justice could be done to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> without holding an inquiry, it would be better that that course should be adopted, because if a general inquiry were entered upon, opportunity might be taken to deal 'with a number of matters extraneous, to the particular case. It seemed to me that no good purpose would be served by digging up all the allegations which might be put forward in a time of stress and trouble such as that was. Therefore, I was not anxious that an inquiry should be held, so long as justice could be done to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> If, however, it was impossible to obtain that, I said that everything else must go by the board. My idea was that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> must not be allowed to remain under an injustice which would reflect discredit upon the community as a whole. </para>

                    <para>- As one who, to some extent, has been associated with this matter, I should like to supplement what the Prime Minister has said, and to support the action of his Government. I must say that when I was first approached in connexion with the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> I was distinctly prejudiced against that officer. I had read press reports, which seemed to associate him with what were atrocious massacres in South Africa. As he had practically been put on board ship in South Africa and returned to Australia, I naturally thought that he must have some close connexion with those massacres. I informed the parties who approached me - gentlemen of reliability in Sydney - that that was my opinion, and I also added that if they desired any re-opening of South African matters, unless an extreme necessity existed to do justice to some person who had suffered injustice, I should be opposed to entering into the question of the dealings of the. British authorities with those who were engaged in the war. However, they asked if I was willing to consider facts if they were placed before me, and, whether if I thought an injustice had been done, </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">I would do my best to get it remedied. I at once replied that I would. I must confess ' that the information which was placed before' me astonished me. I had no idea that an officer could be subjected to such treatment upon such slight grounds. I would point out that this question became one, not between the British authorities in South Africa and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> but between the military authorities here and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> inasmuch as that officer, on his return to Australia was refused reinstatement on account of alleged- events in South Africa. What did that refusal to reinstate him mean? It meant that that officer, who had gone forth with a good character, who had entered the Forces in South Africa, who had done remarkably good work there, who 'had so satisfied the British officers over him, that when his contingent had returned to Australia, they requested him to remain and command another corps which was being raised, was not what his service showed him to be, but was an individual who had so disgraced himself by his association with ' certain massacres, that he ought not to be replaced in his position in Australia. That refusal to reinstate him was tantamount to finding him guilty of offences beyond those charged against him, and meant attaching a stigma to his name for life. That was a very serious position to take up, and one which could only be justified if the facts supported the attitude adopted by the Australian Military authorities. But what was the real position? The Prime Minister has informed us of the results of inquiries which were made from the British Government. That Government was asked, " Is there anything against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> beyond what was disclosed before the court martial ? " " No," was the reply elicited. What were the facts connected with the court-martial? Simply that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was found guilty of a technical error in failing to report the death of only one of the men massacred. That officer, however, declares that he reported all to his Colonel, who was a British officer, but who unfortunately was absent from South Africa at the time the court martial was held. </para>

                        <para>- We are not the parties to judge the case. The parties entitled to judge were those upon the spot when these events were of recent date - the parties who were acquainted with the whole circumstances of the matter. What did they in court martial decide? That <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was merely guilty of a technical offence. In support of that finding they inflicted upon him the lightest sentence that a court martial can impose  -  a reprimand  -  a sentence which has been inflicted in other cases in which the offenders have immediately gone back to their regiments and resumed their former positions. But upon his return to Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was prevented from re-joining his regiment. He was to be excluded from his position, to be asked to send in his papers, and to be retired from the Forces. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member can answer that question just as well as I can. The British Government declare that they have nothing against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> beyond what was disclosed before the court martial. We know that in war time many things are done under the stress of circumstances, and that very frequently an officer mistakenly exercises autocratic power. But if there is any reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was deported from South Africa beyond that which was disclosed before the court martial, surely it should be forthcoming 1 Where is it ? The British Government say that they have not got it. Should the technical offence of which he was adjudged guilty affect <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan's</inline> reinstatement in the Australian Forces? That officer was formerly a solicitor in Sydney. He is a man whose previous history and character are altogether opposed to his association with these disgraceful proceedings in South Africa. The court martial supports that view of the position by simply reprimanding him, and by admitting that he had no connexion whatever with those matters. Then the Australian military authorities refused to do what has been done in the case- of many British officers who have been reprimanded - to replace him in the local forces. </para>

                        <para>- That course has been followed times out of number, when a court martial has merely reprimanded an officer. He has been permitted to return to his regiment. The verdict of a court martial usually represents the extent of the offence which has been committed. In this case that verdict simply amounted to a reprimand, and the British Government assert that they have nothing against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> beyond what was adduced before that tribunal. But instead of sympathizing with him in the treatment to which he was subsequently subjected, the Commonwealth authorities proposed to further punish him, although there was really no evidence that he deserved to be dealt with in that way. The right honorable member can make no reply to the statement that the British authorities have nothing against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> except that for which he was tried by court martial. The court martial decided that he was guilty of only a technical offence. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! This discussion was initiated by the right honorable member for Swan, who spoke at some length, but since then he has been carrying on a running fire of interjections. As we are in Committee, the right honorable member will have another opportunity to address himself to the question, and I ask the honorable member for North Sydney to confine his attention to the matter immediately before the Chair. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The fact that he has been reprimanded does not constitute a stain upon the man's character ; but if the Military authorities controlling the Forces to which he belongs declined to reinstate him in the position which he occupied before he went to South Africa, saying " You have been guilty of actions which are unworthy of an officer, and should not be reinstated/' there would be a lasting- stain against his character. If he has been guilty of such actions he certainly ought not to be reinstated, but the British Government in its reply to the inquiry made by the Commonwealth Government, acquit him of everything save that for which he was dealt with by the court martial. The only remedy, therefore, for the injustice . which, on the evidence, has been done to this officer, is to reinstate him in the Commonwealth Forces. I am opposed to entering into the question as between <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> and the British authorities. We should not re-open old South African sores ; if this case is to be re-opened let action be taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> He has expressed the desire, as as soon as he is possessed of the requisite means, to proceed to England and press the matter with the War Office. When it appeared that he was not to be reinstated in the local forces he asked for an inquiry, but that request was not granted, for some reason which does not appear. </para>

The right honorable member for Swan was under a misapprehension in suggesting that he Had not done so within the last year or two, because the honorable member who succeeded him as Minister of Defence will admit that such a request was made. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member has the admission of his late colleague that my statement is correct. Although at the outset I was prejudiced against this officer I was forced to the conclusion, on looking into the facts submitted to me, that he was being unjustly treated, and I, acting in conjunction with the present Prime Minister, brought the matter under the notice of the late Government. They saw no ; reason for the action which had been taken, but two members of that Government, at all events, were not prepared to undertake the responsibility of reinstating him. The present Minister of Defence has done so. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the right honorable member will not make such a statement, because it is absolutely unjust to the officer in question. I saw him for the first time, to my knowledge, some two or three months ago, and in spite of the indication that he was likely to be reinstated he requested me to advocate an inquiry. He pressed the request, and desired that an inquiry should be held whether he was reinstated or not. I advised him that it was better that he should accept reinstatement - if it were offered to him - rather than insist upon an inquiry which would lead only to the re-opening of old South African troubles, which should be heard of no more, and possibly create friction between the British Government and the Commonwealth authorities. I said that if the wrong which was being done him were, remedied, he should be satisfied, but I had the greatest difficulty in persuading him that that was the better course for him to pursue. </para>

                        <para>- I am not familiar with military technicalities, but so far as I am aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> has not seen the Minister. That is the whole position, and I feel satisfied that when honorable members have inquired into the matter, as the Prime Minister and I have done, they will arrive at the conclusion that this officer would have been subjected to a most serious injustice had his reinstatement been refused, when it was acknowledged by the British Government that there was no reason, and that a serious stain would have been placed' on his character by the military authorities in his own country - such a stain as would attach not only to the man himself, but to his descendants, because these events become historic. I am sure that any honorable member who looks into the case, though he may at first be prejudiced, as I was, will come to the conclusion that the only way, not of meting out entire justice, but of doing a particle of justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> is to reinstate him in the position which he occupied before he went to South Africa. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened with a good deal of interest to the statements which have been made regarding this case ; and I was very pleased with the resume of it given by the Prime Minister. The case is one into which, as Minister of Defence, I went very deeply, not only because a big principle was at stake, since any false step might have involved a conflict between the Imperial War Office and the military authorities here, but because a man's prospects were in danger. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan's</inline> profession was everything to him. I think that he cannot be blamed for not having pushed forward an inquiry. He asked foi steps to be taken to reinstate him, and the Prime Minister of the day sent to South Africa for full information in regard to his case. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> I understand, waited until that information should be received before asking the Government to take further steps. When I took office, there was in existence a large pile of papers relating to the case, and the present Prime Minister, together with the honorable member for North Sydney, interviewed me upon it, putting the matter before me from their stand-point, and making representations in black' and white. I have always held that in these matters no notice can be taken of inferences, rumours, and statements in private letters which cannot be adduced as evidence, and if possible refuted by the individual concerned. Consequently, I refused to take notice of such information; but, having gone thoroughly into the whole matter. I came to the conclusion that Lenehan had not been well used. I do not remember that any one besides the gentlemen whom I had named saw me on his behalf. I was quite free from prejudice or bias in dealing with the case, because I did not know <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> nor should I .know him now if he were to enter the chamber. The representation of the honorable member for North Sydney made a strong impression upon me, because he admitted that at first he was prejudiced against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> I think that a great number of people have been prejudiced against him, because of the belief that something was done in South Africa which has not reflected much credit, on Australia, and in some dim, vague way we have associated <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> and others with the occurrence. However, there was nothing in the papers sent from South Africa - and they were very full - which associated <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> with the incident to which I refer. What caused a great deal of doubt in my mind in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan's</inline> innocence, and probably prevented the right honorable member .for Swan from coming to any decision on the case, was that it seemed strange that an Australian officer should be so harshly treated for so trifling an offence. The charge upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was convicted was what might be called a technical one. . His fault was a failure to report. </para>

                        <para>- The charge of failing to report would be a serious one if the officer concerned had not attempted to show that he had reported. The case was inquired into on the spot by men whose only object could have been to see that justice was done, and, after a careful examination, they gave <inline font-weight="bold">Major. Lenehan</inline> the lightest sentence that they could impose. But, immediately afterwards, he was bundled into prison on board ship, and sent back to Australia. His horses were left behind, and his back pay is still due to him. Any one who investigated his case would naturally think that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> must have committed some other misconduct to justify such treatment ; but when the War Office was asked if any other charges had been proved against him, nothing further of a condemnatory character was alleged. Under these circumstances, no other course was open to me than to attempt to clear <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan's</inline> character, and I accordingly wrote a minute on the subject a few days before I left office. No doubt it would have been better policy to leave the case to my successor, because it was likely to cause trouble ; but I have always held that there are other things besides political expediency, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> had been waiting for a long time to obtain justice, I felt bound to do what I could to reestablish his position. Therefore," I wrote a minute, and left it for my successor to act upon if he . chose, and to take the responsibility of his position by deciding whether <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> should be reinstated. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> should be given every assistance to prosecute a claim for compensation for the loss of his horses, and for the recovery of his back pay. I think that an inquiry should be made into all the circumstances of the case, so that the shadow still hanging over the officer may be entirely dispelled. My action was not taken until I had consulted my predecessors, who, I knew, were fully seized of the facts. But having gone further into the whole matter, with an open mind, I came to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> had been hardly treated. His reinstatement is a step for which the present Government must, of course, take the full responsibility, and I am glad that they are ready to make themselves responsible for some of their actions in regard to military administration. But I regret that there seems to be a growing tendency to deal with military matters in Parliament. I have to-day been giving evidence before a Select Committee which is inquiring into the case of another military officer, and I have been summoned to attend before another Committee which is pursuing a similar investigation. I do not blame the Government entirely for the appointment of these Committees; but I to-day protested against military matters of detail being dealt with by Committees. If this kind of thing continues, the Defence Department will be practically administered by Members of Parliament. However, the matter is one for the Government. </para>

                        <para>- The Committee before which I gave evidence to-day is that dealing with the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major J.</inline> W. M. Carroll. When in office I was pressed to agree to the appointment of either a Committee or a Royal Commission to deal with that case; but I declined to do so, and when informed that there was an inclination on the part of some honorable members to press for a Committee, 1 stated that I would resist the application, and would ask my colleague in the Senate to do the same. I do not desire to say anything in disparagement of my successor, nor do I altogether blame him for what has occurred ; but I do not think it is wise to introduce matters of military detail in Parliament. If we do, we shall have to increase the administrative staff of the Defence Department. Moreover, it is rarely that good results are obtained from the investigations of Select Committees. It has been my experience in the Parliament of New South Wales that the member who moves for the appointment of a Select Committee, and is generally made its chairman, is most often either well disposed to the person regarding whose case an inquiry is asked for, or has been pressed by the friends of that person to move for a Committee; and, consequently) the finding of the Committee is not of much value. </para>

Whatever may be the date of the letter, it opens up the very large question of the possibility of any man in the Defence Department being made the subject of letters, written to the General Officer Commanding, which contain no real evidence, and which should not be regarded seriously. It is not fair that a man's reputation should be ruined by some person writing behind his back to the </para>

It was announced three weeks ago that the Government intended to reinstate <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> and I should like to ask why action has not yet been taken in that direction ? It was further stated that the General Officer Commanding was so much opposed to the proposed reinstatement that he would not draw up the order, and that it would be necessary to pass an Order in Council providing for the appointment. I should like to know how long the Ministry propose to wait before they do justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> Are we to wait until the Council of Defence has been formed ? The Ministry have decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> has been unjustly dealt with, and that he shall be reinstated, and yet they are staying their hands, apparently because objection has been raised by the military authorities. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out that it is almost impossible to obtain reliable in formation from the Defence Department. Latterly I have adopted the course of asking questions in this House, rather than writing, and I still find myself in a difficulty. On four different occasions information supplied in response to questions asked in this House by me has subsequently been found to be incorrect. Some time ago, I thought that the Defence Department were paying too much attention to the recommendations of the Colonial Defence Committee, particularly in regard to our volunteer forces. This outside body, sitting in London, made a recommendation that our Volunteer Forces should be disbanded. I asked the Prime Minister a question on the subject, and I was informed that no such recommendation had been received. Later on, however, I pointed to a recommendation which appeared in a printed paper that had been laid on the table of the House. The Prime Minister then said - </para>

                    <para>It is regretted that, when replying to the previous question of the honorable and learned member, a later recommendation by the Colonial Defence Committee on this subject was inadvertently overlooked. The report containing the recommendation in question was made a parliamentary paper, being presented to the House of Representatives on the 19th September, 1901. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish honorable members to notice that, because a recommendation was made in September, 1901,' the Defence authorities did not consider it necessary or proper to give information regarding it, or apparently to search its records since that date. Yesterday I asked a question with regard to colours and other honours received in connexion with the late South African war. The Prime Minister gave an answer for which I do not hold him responsible, because I understand that the replies are simply placed in his hands by the Defence Department. </para>

That is a matter in which we might fairly expect to be supplied with correct information. On the 20th inst., I aske'd the Prime Minister a question as to the number of volunteers in each of the States, and I was told that the strength of the Volunteer Corps in Western Australia on the 1st March, 1902, was 2,220. According to a paper which was presented to this House on 18th July, 1901, there were absolutely no volunteers in Western Australia, all the forces being described as partially paid, and no alteration has since been made. I do not know how the discrepancy can be accounted for, except on the supposition that inaccurate information has again been supplied. I find that the Minister of Defence, in criticising the report of the General Officer Commanding, ' stated that the General Officer Commanding - makes the complaint that he was not informed about any agreement that was made between the ammunition factory at Footscray and the Department, and recommends that 10,000,000 rounds of ammunition for the forthcoming year should be purchased. He does not make that complaint for the first time. He has been told distinctly that there is no agreement, that there has been no arrangement, and that no effort has been made by the permanent head of the civil branch of the Department to block any one of his recommendations in that respect. On the contrary, we provide on our Estimates for 1,000,000 rounds more than he recommended, 11,000,000 rounds. I cannot understand what the real grievance is, or what reason there is for many of the statements which appear in this report. </para>
                <para class="block">Apparently the Minister himself complains that the General Officer Commanding has made incorrect statements in his report. He said that the General Officer Commanding had been told that there was no agreement, and that' no effort had been made to set aside his report. The matters to which I have directed attention may appear to some honorable members to be trivial. It may not matter very much whether there are 2,000 or 200 volunteers in Western Australia, but it is important that we should be supplied with correct information, and that information officially supplied should be reliable. I trust that the Prime Minister will ask his colleague, the Minister of Defence, to inquire into this matter with a view to insure that the information given to us shall be thoroughly trustworthy, and such as will afford us a sound basis for future action. </para>

                    appears to be regarded by some honorable members as a matter of very little consequence. I suppose that most of us were greatly shocked when we heard of the crime which was committed in South Africa by members of the Bushveldt Carbineers , for which two Australians were shot, and another was sentenced to imprisonment for life. In connexion with that case,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline>
                    appeared on the scene after the crime had been committed, and held an inquiry, but neglected to report the matter to his superior officer. This very serious neglect of duty has been designated by the late Minister of Defence as merely a technical offence.

Here is a man who commits an offence against his country, and the Government desire to whitewash him, although he pleads for an inquiry that his character may be vindicated in the face of his fellows.

He inquired into them, and it was his duty to report to his colonel, which the court martial found that he neglected to do. That circumstance, in. itself, shows that he was desirous of hushing up this foul crime. That is the stain which rests upon this soldier's character. Why do not the Government grant him an inquiry? </para>

                        <para>- At any rate the fact remains that he was reprimanded for his offence. It will be a public scandal if the Government refuse to grant this officer what he seeks as a British subject - an inquiry into his case. He asked for that inquiry in April, 1902, and it is within the power of the present Administration to accede to his request. But in effect they say, "No, we will not grant it ; but we will whitewash you." That will not remove the stain which rests upon this officer and upon Australia. Two men were shot for the crime which it is alleged that he was sent to report upon, and a third was imprisoned for life. Here is an officer who was sent to the scene of the murder to investigate the matter. He had to inquire into it, and to report to his superior officer, a course which it was found that he failed to follow. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that his letters appeared in public prints, justifying the action taken by the men who were shot. But I do not wish to discuss that phase of the matter. I say, " Grant this man an inquiry. Do not stain the escutcheon of Australia by reinstating an officer after having passed the whitewash brush over him." Let us gram him a public inquiry. If he establishes his innocence, he will stand high in the esteem of his brother officers, and will be respected by his fellow citizens. If we whitewash him, a slur will be cast upon him, and upon the innocents of his family. I trust that the Government will not reinstate him until he has been granted the inquiry for which he asks. Until this has been done, he will not have received justice. Should be succeed in dealing his character, I shall be one of the first to vote in favour of his reinstatement, but not otherwise. </para>

I know from bitter experience the difficulty of getting anything from him, particularly when he was in charge of the Department of Defence. Indeed, I do not mind telling the House of a case that occurred during his term of office, in order to show how anxious he is to do justice to a volunteer officer. I am bound to say that if he treated <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> in the same way that he treated the officer in whom I am interested, I do not' wonder that the former troubled no further. </para>

                        <para>- Well the right honorable member ought to know. I do not see what else the Government could do under the circumstances. ' If any fault is to be found in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan's</inline> case, it rests upon the ex-Minister of Defence in that he did not take steps to investigate the statements made by that officer. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that the right honorable member would be acting wisely if he abstained from these rude remarks, and allowed me to proceed. He need not make rude interjections, because, as far as I am concerned, they fall upon deaf ears. The right honorable member may be as rude' as he pleases, but I intend to have my say. Notwithstanding that the Chairman has already called him to order, he persistently interrupts. I say that when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> petitioned him, and stated certain facts, it was his duty to institute inquiries with a view to ascertain their truth or otherwise. To-day he asks if <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> wrote to his colonel, who is now in India? The honorable member for North Sydney says that he did. Then the right honorable member immediately inquires, " Did' he receive a reply ?" I would put the same question to him. Did the right honorable member write to this colonel in India? Certainly he had better opportunities for ascertaining the truth from that officer than had <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> It' is not likely that the colonel would reply to a communication from the latter, especially if any reply would be calculated to incriminate himself. The right honorable member ought to have communicated with this colonel in India, asking whether the facts as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> were accurate. But in this case, he seems to have adopted the same attitude that he has taken up in many others. He arraigns himself on the side of the officers of the Department, and before any one can get in, it is necessary for them to dislodge him from that position - an almost impossible task. I speak from experience in this connexion. At the present time there is a militia officer, who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan,</inline> is suffering an injustice though in a smaller degree. I trust, however, that it will be rectified, and as I see the Minister of Defence in his place, I take this opportunity of bringing the matter before him. When the inaugural ceremonies connected with Federation were in progress in Melbourne detachments of soldiers were sent over from the various States. Colonel Holborrow, of New South Wales, was given supreme command by virtue of his seniority. He had to organize the whole camp here. It so happened that at the time one of the captains of his regiment chanced to be in Melbourne in the capacity of a private citizen, attending the celebrations, and Colonel Holborrow, knowing that he possessed excellent administrative qualities, commandeered him on the spot, and. made him adjutant of the camp. It is admitted by the authorities that his -work was in every way satisfactory, and naturally he expected that, like the other visiting soldiers, he would be allowed his expenses. He applied to his superior officer, who recommended that his expenses should be paid. That recommendation was sent through the proper channel to the commanding officer in Sydney, but it was held that the request could not be granted, inasmuch as this officer had not been sent to Melbourne. No one quarrelled with that decision. I did not learn of this matter first from the officer himself, and although he feels that he is smarting under an injustice, I do not suppose that he will thank me for bringing it forward. As it was a special matter I interviewed the Minister, and requested him to treat it as such. I was then informed that the officer had the right of appeal over the heads of the authorities in Sydney to the Minister himself, and, after a good deal of persuasion on my part, be put in an appeal and asked that the papers be sent on to the Minister. Although that action was taken, at the instigation of the Department, to put the claim in order, the reply he received was that the claim was out of date, and could not be recognised. </para>

                        <para>- If I. were a Minister, and believed that an officer was suffering an injustice for the sake of the payment of a few pounds, the Treasurer would have to find the necessary funds, or another administrator would have to be secured for my Department. The Department recognises the justice of this officer's claim, and the only excuse it eventually could make for non-payment was that he should have made earlier application. That was his reward for loyalty to his superior officers. </para>

                        <para>- Further inquiry has since been made, but the claim has not yet been settled. I think that it should be allowed. The Department admits that the officer is entitled to receive his expenses, and I trust that the present Treasurer will find the necessary funds to enable justice to be . done to an officer who has suffered under this wrong for over three years. The matter is a very old one, but the officer is not responsible for the fact that it has not yet been dealt with. This incident is an illustration of the way in which the Defence Department is bound up with red tape. I cite these facts because they bear on the complaint made by the right honorable member for Swan that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> has not been sufficiently vigorous in prosecuting his claim for an inquiry. All the facts go to prove the contrary. We are told that he applied to the right honorable member, who was then Minister of Defence, in 1902 ; but was met with a refusal. In these circumstances, it is hardly likely that he would feel justified in making another application to the right honorable member unless he had fresh facts to put before him. </para>

                        <para>- It would enable him to clear up one or two matters and put his conduct in quite a different light. He alleges that he reported the incident in question to his superior officer, who is now in India, and the statement is made by the honorable member for North Sydney that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> has communicated with that officer, but has not received any reply. That is a matter which the Department should take in hand, although I do not say that it would be able to ascertain the real facts of the case. It may be that the officer in India,, to whom reference has been made, might in some way incriminate himself if he acknowledged the truth of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan's</inline> statement, and that may account fcr his refusal to answer the inquiry. </para>

                        <para>- No; it is a black page in Australian history ; but it is our duty to see that none of our officers are unjustly associated with it. The highest Court in the Empire has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was guilty of only a technical offence. The honorable member for Robertson made much of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> had been found guilty; but the fact that a pronouncement of " guilty " is made is in itself a matter of no moment. A man might be found guilty, of an offence in respect of which the imposition of a fine of 2s. 6d. would be considered a sufficient punishment. A man sometimes pleads guilty to a charge of furiously driving a motor car, and is fined£1 ; but I do not know that that is a very heinous offence. I would remind the honorable member for Robertson that the mere fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was found "guilty"" does not necessarily imply that he- was guilty of a very serious offence. Judging by the sentence, the Court regarded it as being a purely technical offence. On al] these grounds the Government are justified in reinstating <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> If he desires an inquiry every facility should be given him to clear his character from even the technical offence of which he was found guilty, and for which he has paid the penalty in South Africa. </para>

I am not in any way prejudiced against him. I have never seen him. But. I hold that it would be fairer to him, and also better from the point of view of the proper administration . of the Department, if an inquiry took place before . his reinstatement We know that one Minister of Defence thought that his claim could not be supported. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the right honorable member was in favour of reinstating him without . an inquiry. His successor may have held : a different view. If this course of procedure is to . continue, we shall have one Minister . of Defence holding the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> . should be reinstated, and therefore reinstating him. and the . next perhaps in favour of turning him out again. If he requests an inquiry, surety it is . only just that there should be one. If he is proved to have been guilty of only a technical offence, which, under the British Army regulations, would . still permit of <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> rejoining his regiment, it is . obvious that he should . be reinstated; but it would be unwise to reinstate him . until the result of . an inquiry was known. Whilst we are discussing the position of . officers : in the Defence Forces, I . should like to draw attention to several cases of injustice relating to the Permanent. Forces. A number of non-commissioned officers in the Permanent Forces went with troops to South Africa, and held commissions. Tn many cases they were given increased rank on the field ; but, owing to the exigencies of the Defence administration, they are unable now to occupy the honorable positions which they won on the field in South Africa. I have no desire to invidiously mention names. There are but few of these cases, and it would not require a very radical change in the Administrative Department to . enable them to be dealt with. Let me mention one case - that of a man who went to South Africa as a regimental sergeant-major. He was mentioned in despatches, and was granted the distinguished conduct medal. Subsequently he returned to Australia, but went out again as adjutant in another contingent He was promoted on the field to the rank of captain, was again mentioned in despatches, and received the D.S.O., which is granted to commissioned officers only. On returning to Australia, however, he was put back to his 'old position as a warrant officer. If he could hold the King's commission on the battle-field in South Africa, he . should be entitled to hold it in Australia. I hope that the Government will endeavour- to do something for these officers. </para>

                        <para>- Without responding to the honorable member's invitation to discuss that matter, I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to another fact. The instructional staff in New South Wales, and, indeed, throughout the Commonwealth, was reduced very considerably some time ago, but the establishment which the staff in New South Wales had to serve was very largely increased by additions to the number of corps. As honorable members know, the instructional staff must be kept moving about the country as much as possible, in order that proper instruction may be given to the various corps; but about two months ago orders were issued to stop them travelling. The result is that corps in country districts cannot secure that instruction which they were intended to receive, and the greater part- of the usefulness of these instructors has been lost. The reason for this order was, of course, that the travelling vote had been, exhausted. I sincerely hope that arrangements will be made- so. that there may be no recurrence of the- incident. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister used very strong, and quite unjustifiable language in speaking of my actions. I presume that he has read the papers, and he must therefore have seen that, up to the time when I left the Department, my only anxiety was to get to the bottom of the case, so that justice might be done. He will not find in the correspondence a word written by me which in any way reflects upon <inline font-weight="bold">'Major Lenehan,</inline> except that, in a resume" of the case which I submitted to my colleagues, I took exception to the action of that officer in not protesting more strongly and loudly against the terrible injustice and harshness with which he was alleged to have been treated. I thought that he had, to a -large extent, slept upon his rights. 6 h 2 </para>

                        <para>- Then I think he followed bad advice. When a man is suffering from injustice, he should protest against it, and use every endeavour to have it removed. I believe that the papers contain only one letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan-</inline> to the Department, and another letter from him to; I think, a Member of Parliament, which was sent on to the Department. All I did in connexion- with the ease to-day was to draw attention to it, and to ask. that the papers relating to it may be placed before the House. A good many things have- happened since I left the Department, and' <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> wish to have full information respecting the actions taken by the Government in this matter.' I know that many documents which are of a confidential character are frequently recorded by the Departments, and I do not desire that such papers shall be made public. Such a request would be unreasonable and improper. All I ask is that the public documents, which give the history of the case shall be laid upon the table for the information of the people- out- . side, and in the interest of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan.</inline> I wish also to refresh my memory as to what was done when an inquiry was asked for.. I think that- the position which T took up- was that,, as the alleged misconduct took place in South. Africa, it would bc useless to hold an inquiry here-, because no witnesses who knew the facts could, so far as we knew, be summoned to give evidence, and the only information available would be the: statement of the officer concerned. The better course I thought was to ask the Imperial Government for a statement of the- facts, and it will be seen that, with the assistance of the Prime Minister of the d;ay, the Department made every effort to obtain information from South- Africa, and from the War Office, and I believe that we also communicated with Lord Kitchener in India. Therefore, the remark of the honorable member for Parramatta, that I did nothing, was incorrect and unjustifiable. </para>

                        <para>- About that time. I think I know what came from the War Office, and it certainly was not satisfactory. Their replies did not give good reason for the harsh treatment to which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> was subjected. 1 was, therefore, placed in a dilemma. If good reason had been shown for the action of the British Military authorities, my course would have been clear, while, on the other hand, if the stigma had been removed from <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> it would have been only just to reinstate him immediately. I wish, however, to defend myself against the imputation that I had any desire to act unjustly towards that officer. As a matter of fact, we had nothing very definite to go on. The Home authorities seemed unwilling to say anything, and their answers to the long documents which we sent to them were very short. If <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> can be re-established in the good opinion of his fellows, no one will be more delighted than I at his reinstatement. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that much would be gained from an inquiry, because the misconduct complained of occurred in South Africa, and it will, therefore, be practically impossible to obtain information relating to it here. Those who have read the papers will see that I had at heart the interests of the Defence Forces and of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> himself. There appears very little to justify the harsh treatment which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> received ; but, on the other hand, it is difficult to imagine that such treatment was given to him without good reason. </para>

                        <para>- We generally assume, in judging the actions of persons in authority, that they do not act unjustly and harshly without good reason. One has more grounds for that assumption than for its converse. Even at this eleventh hour, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Lenehan</inline> should not be reinstated until we have at least received from him a full account of the facts as he believes them to be. It would be better to have some inquiry than none at all. If the public, after reading the papers, arrive at the same conclusion thai I have done, they will be very much astonished that the treatment extended to a British officer should not have been more justified by those in authority in South Africa. I regret, however, that he did not petition the King, and set forth his grievances. </para>

                (Bland- Treasurer When we adjourned last evening, I indicated that we, should consider the advisability of re-presenting the course suggested by the Government in connexion with the voting on the Capital Sites. The impression on my mind was that, in Connexion with the vote taken last evening on the amendment of the honorable member for Gwydir, some honorable members may not have thought that the issue was particularly clear that the apparent matter for decision was whether, or not, a fifty-mile radius from a given point should be described. That has been "agreed to by the House, but it seems to the Government that, at least, we can arrive at
                <inline font-style="italic">9.</inline>
                decision with respect to that starting point in each of the districts before the other vote on the districts themselves is taken. For instance, under the suggestion I am now putting forward, we should, before proceeding to a ballot in regard to the districts, decide which site in a given district should form the centre of the radial area of fifty miles.

                        <para>- With all respect to the honorable member, I say that that is not the question in regard to which honorable members voted last evening. It may have been in the minds of honorable members when they -voted for the amendment of the honorable member for Gwydir. I admit that the idea was the same, but the issue was not clearly put before the House. I gave contingent notice that I would move in the direction now indicated if the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Gwydir were defeated. No clear vote was given upon my proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I obtained the Speaker's ruling as to whether I could move in the direction I proposed. He then ruled against me. This is another proposal. I am still in the hands of the Speaker, but I think that the procedure now proposed is quite in order in relation to the resolutions carried last evening. If my proposal be adopted, a preliminary ballot will be taken in regard to the selection of one or other of the sites in the districts suggested, and a vote will then be taken upon the different districts with the sites remaining. </para>

All that the honorable member desires is that when we determine the particular district it shall have a radius of fifty miles from the point named - that is the district. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to' have your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as to whether this amendment is in order. From what I understand, we did more last evening than settle the district question. We also named the radial starting-points within each district. That being so, I do not see how we can determine upon a new starting-point under such a proposal as that embodied in the amendment. I understand that it is proposed practically to vary what we decided upon last evening by asking' honorable members to fix new starting-points within the fifty miles radii. </para>

                <para class="block">Bourke, I should certainly have to rule that the amendment could not be moved. If it were intended by the amendment to vary anything that was determined by the vote taken yesterday, of course it would be altogether out of order. It does not appear to me, however, that it is proposed to vary anything that was done yesterday. In connexion with the three votes which were taken on the amendments of the honorable member for Gwydir, it was determined that certain districts should comprise areas within a fifty miles radius of certain fixed points. What is now proposed is to select within those areas, without disturbing them at all, a particular site for the Capital. When any ruling was sought last evening, after the first amendment of the honorable member for Gwydir had been agreed to, I pointed out that what the Government then suggested could not be done at that stage, because they, desired that the words " southern district," "southeastern district,"" and " western district," should be struck out, whilst the House had determined, by adding other words, that they should not be struck out. There is, however, nothing to prevent the addition of these words, which do not conflict with the words added last night, to the resolution, as it stands, should a majority of the House so decide. </para>

Last night a majority of the House decided that the district in which the site for the Federal Capital shall be located should first be selected. The honorable member for Gwydir submitted a proposal which gave the House the option of deciding between the selection of a district first and of a site afterwards, and the choice of a site first and a district afterwards- It was decided that we should first select a district. What was the next step? The Government wished to alter that decision in some way, and you, sir, refused to allow them to do so.

There seems to be a very strong desire on the part of some honorable members to reverse the decision which was arrived at last night. </para>

If the Government wish to reverse that decision let them do so fairly and frankly. Let them declare that they disagree with that vote, and let them take the responsibility of trying to reverse it. </para>

                        <para>- Last night the House decided that the district in which the site for the Federal Capital is located should first be selected. The other Chamber has defined a Federal territory within this Bill. Yet in face of thaI the Government desire by the aid of a side wind to upset the decision arrived at upon the amendment of the honorable member for Gwydir. I do not take exception to their action, but I say that this matter should be decided in the open. All these accusations about "plotting" are mere idle talk. Every honorable member has made up his mind upon this question, but nevertheless we ought to be frankly informed of what is proposed. Now that the right honorable member for East Sydney has confessed that he is the power behind the throne, let reasons be advanced why the decision of last evening should not be respected. </para>

                    <para>- I really cannot understand how the Government intend to fit in another amendment of this character with the determination which" was arrived at last evening. Upon that occasion, the question which we were called upon to decide was whether the ballot-paper should take a certain form. We have already dealt with that matter., and now we are asked to make a condition precedent to what we have already decided to do. The proposal states that prior to the taking of a ballot for a district, certain things shall be done. This House has determined that before a site shall be selected the ballot-paper issued shall contain the words " Southern district, comprising an area within a radius of fifty miles from Batlow," and also similar words in respect of the other districts. Now, however, we are asked to undo our previous decision, and to adopt something which is practically in antagonism to it. This question, I understand, is warmly debated by honorable members advocating different sites. Personally, I am not interested in any of the sites. I have no object other than that of selecting the very best site available, irrespective of where it may be located, and, consequently, I claim that I am in a position to come to an impartial decision. Such a decision, however, cannot be arrived at by the House under the amendment of the Government. There is a danger lurking under it, to which keen attention should be paid. In the western district, for example, there is practically only one eligible site. We are all aware of that. When the vote is taken, it is only reasonable to assume that there will be a solid vote cast in favour of Lyndhurst. There are two or three other sites, it is true, which may find some supporters. Similarly, there is a possibility that some honorable members will support the Bombala site, and others the Coolringdon site, but a great majority will probably vote for Dalgety. The votes will thus be split, whilst the others will be solid all the time. The same thing will happen in the case of the Tumut sites. Some honorable members will support Tumut, and others the Tooma site. The aim of the amendment is practically to give those who advocate the claims of one site or another a power which will not assist us to arrive at a just decision. In speaking upon this Bill last evening, the right honorable member for East Sydney Said, " This is a case of four against 'one." We have simply to turn round that expression - to convert " Yes ' ' into "No ' ' - and we shall find that it is a case of one against four. As is generally the case, we can understand what the right honorable member intends if we reverse what he says. I claim that this amendment does not provide for a fair method of selection. The House will not be acting fairly to itself, or to those who desire to come to a just conclusion upon this matter, if it allows the vote of last night to be reversed by any decision which may be arrived at to-night. I do not see how -it is possible to insert something in this resolution which will practically nullify the vote which was taken last evening; and I shall certainly oppose any method of selection which, in my opinion, has for its object the undermining of the equal rights of the several sites. </para>

                    <para>- As one who is not interested in any particular site, I feel that the most important consideration in the initial stages of these proceedings is the determination of the question of territory. The House ought not to hamper the action of the Committee in the manner proposed. The selection of the territory is, in my opinion, even more important than is the selection of- a particular site within that territory for the establishment of the Capital. The site of the city itself might extend over a very small area. It might be possible to select a few square miles of country in any part of New South Wales that would be a very pleasant situation for the Capital itself ; but the surroundings of the city are even more important than the actual position of the Capital, the situation of its streets and buildings, and so forth. Section 125 of the Constitution seems to contemplate that the Federal territory should be first determined, and that the site of the Seat of Government within that territory should then be decided. That is the most logical way in which to deal with this question. We should choose the territory and then select the site. I therefore believe that the proviso proposed by the Government is calculated to unnecessarily fetter the action of the Committee, and that it will probably be most injurious in its effects. That being so, I hope that the House will reject the amendment, that we shall' then go into Committee, and that having selected the territory most suitable, and, on the whole, most convenient, for our purposes - a territory capable of affording an outlet for development in ages to come -we shall proceed to choose a site for the Capital within that territory. We should decide the more important question before proceeding to consider what is really a subordinate one. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to say a few words in reply to those who claim that the proposal now put forward by the Government is a reversal of the decision arrived at last night. I was one of those who voted last night for the amendment moved by the honorable member for Gwydir, and in the course of a speech which I made I urged that the radius should be enlarged. ' At the same time I pointed out that unless the House were given an opportunity to vote on every site separately a number of honorable members might be forced by combinations to vote for sites of which they did not really approve. In the last' Parliament I urged that we should have an opportunity to secure a direct 'vote of the House on the different sites, and that one site should be pitted against another. If my first preference were rejected, there are other certain sites for which I should vote, No. 2 and No. 3, but if I were called upon to vote on a district, it might happen that in the final vote I should have to support a site of which I did not approve. It seems to me that the. best course to pursue is to take a ballot in the way now proposed by the Government. I certainly understood- last night that the radius was to be increased, and although the proposal was much larger than I suggested, I did not quarrel with the proposition made by the honorable member for Gwydir. He had adopted the suggestion which had been thrown out, and I voted with him. I did not understand that it carried the inference that we -were not to have an opportunity to vote on the individual sites. If we have a full choice of a site in each locality, district will be pitted against district in the final vote. It seems to me that under the method proposed by the Government, every honorable member would have an opportunity to vote according to his sense of the relative value of each site. </para>

                        <para>- When a combination of those in favour of two sites in the one district takes place, the other sites are unfairly handicapped. If we voted on the districts, we might finally reject the whole of the proposed sites. That is a contingency which I wish to avoid, and it seems to me that the Government ' proposal offers an excellent means to narrow down the districts. There is a very large area in each district, and we should see that there is sufficient to enable us to erect the Capital on the most suitable site. It is much better that we should clear the ground one step at a time. </para>

                    <para>- It is unfortunate that we should have to fight this question over again. The matter now before us is precisely that which was under discussion last night, namely, whether we should select a particular site, or merely select a district, and subsequently choose a site within that area for the Capital. That was the whole subject of yesterday's discussion, and honorable members took that view of the position when they voted. It seems to me unfortunate that the Government should have resorted to log-rolling in order to introduce the same question again, for, although the wording of the proposition now before us is slightly different from that discussed yesterday,' it would, if carried, have precisely the same effect. I should like to know whether any honorable member who supports the Government proposal to first select the site of the Capital would adopt a similar course if he were about to select a homestead for himself. If an honorable member were called upon to select a homestead for himself in any of the proposed territories, would he willingly tie himself down to a particular part of the district before he had inspected it? I am sure that he would not. And yet, unfortunately, we find that when dealing with the affairs of the country - with the interests of other people- we are acting in a very different way. What could be more simple, straightforward, and business-like than to adopt the course first proposed by the Government - to first choose the locality in which it is desirable to establish the Capital, and then to carefully inspect every portion of the selected area. That work could be carried out within the next week or two, and then with all the knowledge that we could acquire from a further examination of the district, and with the whole of our energies concentrated on the one area, we should be able to select the best possible site within it. If we 'acted otherwise, we should, in all probability, repeat the blunder which we perpetrated last session. With that object lesson before them, the Government now gravely ask us to enter upon the same course of action. We know that last session a number of honorable members were very strongly impressed with the merits of 'one particular site. The fact is that they had very little knowledge of it, and those who last session were the strongest advocates of that site now admit that a blunder would have been committed had it been selected. What further information have we now before us? Are we not likely to repeat the same blunder? On the other hand, if we first' selected the whole area to be acquired we should have regard to the most essential conditions that should attach to a Federal territory, arid should then be able to select the best site, within it on which to erect the Capital. If that course were adopted our proceedings would not be delayed for more than a week or two. Surely when we consider the importance of the question, when we remember that it will affect the interests of future generations, we ought to be a little more impressed with a sense of our proper responsibilities, arid should endeavour to proceed in the way that will give the best results. I have no particular interest in one site more than another. T have not been conferring with any one in regard to a selection. There has been no log-rolling on my part; but I regret to see so much going on in the House. If honorable members would be guided only by the merits of the several sites, I am perfectly satisfied that we should make a wise selection. If they proceed in the same way as they would do if they were selecting homes for themselves, a satisfactory selection will be made ; but if we proceed in the way that the Government - acting under some extraordinary influence, which has diverted them altogether from their original proposals, which had been well thought out - propose, I am afraid that that will not be the result. I venture to say that the original proposal made by the Government was approved by an overwhelming majority of honorable members. That fact was demonstrated yesterday, when, notwithstanding all the log-rolling that took place, and the unholy alliance between the Government and the leader of the Opposition, those who opposed it could not carry the division within six votes. The result of that division shows what an overwhelming preponderance of opinion there must have been in favour of proceeding in the way first suggested by the Ministry. It is, of course, useless to request the Government to reconsider their decision, but I trust that the House will see that the proper course is adopted, and that honorable members will uphold the decision at which they arrived last night. </para>

                <para class="block">The paragraph emphasizes the fact that the whole of this procedure is entirely outside the course usually adopted. It is outside the Standing Orders, and to enable it to be followed the Standing Orders have to be suspended. What may be done in this informal way under a suspension of the Standing Orders will not afterwards bind the Committee on the Bill in the slightest degree. Speaking simply of what is conceivable, it is possible that the ballot may result in the choice of a certain site, and that the Committee on the Bill may subsequently select some other site. Any such course of action might be possible. It may further be possible, after the Committee has considered the question, and has inserted the name of one particular site in the Bill - and it might not be the site chosen as the result of the informal ballot - to recommit the Bill, and to insert the name of some other site. The Bill might then be again recommitted, and the name of yet another site substituted, and that procedure could be continued, if the House pleased, time after time. The sense of the House may be taken in various ways. I have no hesitation in saying that whatever may be done in this House in this informal way will not bind honorable members in any particular way when dealing with the Bill in Committee. </para>

I remember that upon that occasion he complained that no investigation had been made of the merits of the sites, and he pleaded for delay, so that experts might be sent to report upon them. There was then no question of other . sites. The honorable member himself would have admitted that Parliament was in a position to select a site, except for its lack of information as to the value of land, and other particulars, in regard to the sites proposed. He, therefore, urged that the selection should be postponed until experts had had an opportunity to investigate the country surrounding the proposed sites, and to report upon their eligibility generally. He was not satisfied with either the preliminary investigation of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline>
                    or with that of the Commission ; and he is not satisfied now. I am afraid that he will not be satisfied for many years to come. He will always want further inquiry by new experts. To be consistent, he should declare that, in his opinion, the site of the Seat of Government should not be chosen for some years to come.

I have not heard that statement made here before, and I should like to listen to an expression of opinion upon it from the members of the Government and their supporters. I have no indication to lead me to suppose that it is possible for the leader of the Opposition to do anything with the members of the Government Party, let alone "get at " them in regard to the Capital Sites question. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable member would have been more consistent if he had voted with the rest of the corner on that point. At any rate, it is about time that we arrived at finality on this question. We are really in the same position now as we were in two and a half years ago; we have not got any nearer to finality. If there are other sites which have not been fully dealt with, there will be nothing to prevent us from reconsidering the matter later, if we choose to do so, since Parliament can always reverse its decisions. If a site were discovered which promised to be a sort of Elysium, 1 am sure that Parliament would not hesitate to go back on its decision. But, so far as we know, all eligible sites have been exhausted, with the exception of the Tooma site, which has been unearthed at the last moment, and therefore we are as well able to make a choice now as we shall be at any future time. I think that, in the interests of this Parliament itself, we should endeavour to secure a habitation of our own as soon as possible. I welcome the proposal of the Government as a step towards finality, and I hope that honorable members will help them to secure a decision on a straight and clear issue. </para>

                    <para>- Your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> has made it perfectly clear that no site can ultimately be chosen unless it is approved of by the majority of honorable members. That being so, it hardly matters which site is chosen in the first instance, since the important question is which site will win at the end. The selection of a site for the future Capital of Australia is a matter of such great importance that it goes beyond one's ordinary sense of responsibility to party, to electorate, or to State. We are called upon to decide what is the best site for all Australia. Whatever we may know of the views of our constituents, or. of the opinions of the public of our State, we must each of us have at the back of his mind the desire that such a site shall be selected that the future visitor to the Federal Capital will feel that in choosing it we had regard to the interests of the whole Commonwealth. ' I. have been asked which site I favour. My reply is that I favour the best site. So far as the Tooma site is concerned, if its merits will stand an investigation, and the majority of honorable members come to believe that it would be the best to select, we shall be bound to choose it. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the method to be adopted is of great importance. What we wish to arrive at is the best method for securing a right decision. It is understood that, whatever may be the result of the ballot, we shall not be precluded by the rules of the House from retracing our steps if we discover that we have made a mistake. But we do not wish to make a mistake. The honorable member for Gippsland has suggested that there has been some underhand work in connexion with the proposal of the Government. If so, I know nothing of it. At no time have I lent myself to anything of the kind. A similar suggestion was made when the matter was last under discussion, but if there was any log-rolling at all then, it was done by those who imputed it to others. I hope that that experience will not be repeated. We have been asked by the Government to choose one of three districts, each of which contains several suggested sites. There is no consolidation of interests, so far as the western district is concerned. Three different sites within that district have been strongly advocated, and, therefore, it would be much fairer to submit each site separately for the decision of the House. That was the attitude I took up in the last Parliament when I strongly urged that honorable members should consider the claims of the respective sites, and decide which was the best. That is the decision at which we have now arrived, and I am glad that the Government have recognised the wisdom of endeavouring to secure a distinct choice. In the southern district there are half-a-dozen sites, three or four of which have received a fair amount of support. There are also two or three sites in the south-eastern district. If the Lacmalac site were to be selected, I should not vote for the southern district. I should- prefer any site in the south-eastern district, even Delegate or Coolringdon, to Lacmalac, and, therefore, the determination of the House as to the best site in any one district would very largely influence my votes in regard to the districts. I have taken the trouble to visit and inspect all the sites for myself. I have not been content to judge from the reports alone, but have made a personal inspection. I agree with the honorable member for Richmond, that we have a most important obligation to discharge, and that it is of the utmost importance that we should make a selection that will meet all the requirements of the case, that will reflect credit upon ourselves, and secure the approval of the majority of the people of the Commonwealth, not only to-day, but in time to come. Therefore, it seems to me that petty personal considerations should find no place in this discussion. We should not be swayed by the circumstances that a particular site is in the electoral division represented by a particular honorable member, or in a particular part of New South Wales. We should endeavour to select that site within the whole territory of New South Wales, outside of the 100-mile limit, that would best 'lend itself to the purposes for which it is intended. If we are prepared to view the matter from this broad, stand-point, we need not entertain any fears with regard to the proposal submitted by the Government. The opponents: of the Government proposal have urged that it might be used improperly, with a view to secure the adoption of a site that would defeat the selection of a particular territory. If honorable members are disposed to regard the matter from any such narrow and selfish stand-point, they will not do credit to themselves or justice to the people they represent. If honorable members honestly desire to deal with this matter straightforwardly - and if they are not so disposed they should leave the selection of the site to some other body - the Government proposal offers the most satisfactory means of arriving at a decision. The sites in one district should be dealt with entirely apart from those in others, and the merits of each should be considered impartially. Some honorable members are apparently so used to log-rolling that they suspect others of engaging in schemes similar, to those in which they have themselves taken part. There is no reason for supposing that any unholy combination has been entered into, with a view to secure the adoption of a western site. The Government proposal would not specially lend itself to the manipulation of votes, but, on the other hand, would clear the way for the selection of a territory, and would enable honorable members to see from the outset the direction in which they were being led. If the Government proposal be defeated, we shall have to select a territory embraced within a fifty-miles radius from some given centre. Within such a radius there might be large tracts of land which would be utterly unsuitable for the purposes of the Capital site. Take the western district,, for instance, a radius of fifty miles from Lyndhurst would extend westward to Eugowra in the neighbourhood of Forbes, and would embrace territory which has never been mentioned as suitable for the purposes of a site. Thus to the westward the radius would overlap on the western plains, whilst on the eastern side it' would encroach, upon the territory included in the 100-mile limit from Sydney. We should come to some decision as to the site to be selected within that area, and we can only do that satisfactorily by means of some such proposal as that put forward by the Government. The late Government proposed, from the outset, to select a site for the Capital, and not the territory, and investigations were entered upon accordingly. To-day we are no further advanced in respect of those investigations than we were when the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was in charge of the business of the House, and invited the last Parliament to deal with this question. If we are to make the best use of the information which is at our disposal, we must deal with the matter from the standpoint of one or other of these sites. I believe that nearly all the eligible sites within these areas have already been reported upon. I claim that, upon the official information that is before us, we should proceed to select the best possible site in the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- To my mind, the proposal to practically reverse the decision which was arrived at last .night constitutes a very bad precedent. Upon that occasion we decided that we should first select the district in which the Federal Capital should be situated, and afterwards the site. In this matter, most honorable members, although they avow their perfect honesty of purpose, seem to be frightened of the "other fellow." Had we voted upon the question yesterday, we should have been very much more advanced than we are at the present time. I think we should be acting wisely if we selected a district first, and the .site afterwards, on the principle that we should always choose the greater before the less - a process which is generally known as that of "boiling down." Before we can select a site it seems to me that we must choose an area. To preserve the intention of the Constitution, I shall oppose the amendment of the Government. I cannot understand why they are so anxious to reverse the .determination which was arrived at last night, except upon the assumption that pressure has been brought to bear upon them. It is not necessary .that I should occupy further time. The sooner that we decide this question the better. I am not particularly concerned whether we first select the district or the site; but I do not believe in reversing decisions which have been- arrived .at -by this House., 'because, if such a practice is to be tolerated, there will be no finality .to our proceedings. </para>

                    <para>- The position is that we have mow decided to limit our selection to three districts embracing the whole of -the Capital sites that have been brought under our notice. Naturally, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> thought that the next step would be to select one of those districts. The .adoption of that course wou'ld not .have prevented any honorable member from fully weighing the relative merits of the sites "contained in that .district. Under the proposal of the Government, there .is .a danger -that votes will be split, and that, I believe, is the object " underlying it. Moreover, it seems to me that the adoption of the amendment will -unnecessarily multiply the work which we have to do. I (have mo particular .interest in any site, .but I am .anxious to avoid .any .splitting of votes. That seems to .be the danger underlying this particular proposal. It -seems -to me that the proper course for us to- follow is to. select, the. area first, and subsequently to choose the site. Otherwise' we shall probably find certain honorable members, voting for the Gadara site, others for the; Tumut site, and still others for the Tooma site thus, splitting the votes. Under the Government proposal it would be possible for. an. honorable member to deliberately vote in favour of a. weak site for the purpose of excluding a strong site from the final ballot. </para>

I merely desire a majority of the House to speak out. The honorable- member' for Bass said that we should vote on districts, and not. on sites1, because: the greater' includes the less, but the Capital must be somewhere near the centre of the selected territory; and if we first selected the territory we might find it necessary to make- an alteration, after we had chosen the site of the Capital itself. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> shall' support the Government proposal, because I think it offers the best method to- determine which site the- majority of the House favour. , U have not engineered this proposition-,, nor. have I attempted to influence any vote-..

                    <para>- I should like to point out, <inline font-style="italic">im</inline> a very few words - because the matter has been thoroughly discussed - the reason why I. think the honorable member for. Gippsland should recognise the anxiety which animates us in regard to this matter. Upon the. face of it, the view advocated by the other- side appears to be thoroughly sensible and fair.. It is- said that we- should choose a district and then devote ourselves to; the determination of the best site for the Capital in that district. On the surface, that seems a perfectly logical and sound position to take up ; but I wish to point out how, on the facts, it would work out with absolute unfairness. If honorable members who are in favour of a particular district were also equally favorable to all the sites in that district, we ought to be able to obtain a straight decision. But, as a matter of fact, that is not so. Take the district represented so- faithfully by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. He knows very well that there are honorable members who would vote for Bombala, but who would not vote for Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the honorable member will allow me to place my views before the House. If it were a question of district versus district there would be no difficulty. I can quite understand the statement of the honorable member that he is at a loss to know why so much trouble should be made over this question; but, as a matter of fact, the interest of honorable members is not confined to one district. If, for instance, we ask even the most erratic honorable member on the other side to state his order of preference, we find that it goes from one extreme to another. His first choice may be Tumut, or this new cemetery which has been discovered, Tooma. His first choice may be Dalgety, and his second choice Lyndhurst, but his third choice may be Tumut or Tooma, so' that his order of preference ranges over the three districts in a most irregular way. That is the complication which arises. The fact is that if, for example, any of the advocates of Bombala were prepared to give a second vote for Lyndhurst, they would be compelled, if we voted on districts, to commence by wiping out their second choice altogether, in order to give Bombala a chance. When they came to vote for Bombala they might be beaten, and would then wish, of course, to exercise their second votes in "favour of Lyndhurst. But that site would have gone; it would have been wiped out. </para>

                        <para>- I do not address my arguments on this question to the representatives of these districts. If we had to choose, on this occasion, between heaven itself and Tooma I know where the honorable member for Hume would have his picnic. It would take place not in heaven but in Tooma. I do not wish to waste my time' upon the log-rolling representatives of site-hunting localities. I shall not waste my time on the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. On all other subjects those two honorable members are as straight as a cork-screw; but on this particular question they must allow me to appeal to other honorable members. </para>

                <para class="block">Government be adopted. I suppose that my honorable friends of the Labour Party will give the Government credit for perfect straightforwardness in what they have done. I am not one of the two or three honorable members whom the Government are anxious to conciliate in the present crisis. If the Government wished to act in that way their attention would not be directed to me. They would devote their attention to other honorable members in this House, so that their straightforwardness in accepting the fair view emanating from their direct opponent in the House - from the man from whom they expect the least - ought not to be a reason for suggesting some unworthy motive on their part, lt is surprising that this rope of steel, which is branded "cork," has become such a rope of sand. I admit that I do not make use of that figure of speech in any wrong sense, because this is a matter entirely outside party politics. I should be very sorry indeed if any one were to apply any party pressure in this matter. I wish honorable members to understand that my anxiety ' is not to influence them as to the selection of a particular site. I do not wish to interfere with their freedom of choice; but I desire that Lyndhurst shall be given a fair start. Honorable members may wipe it out if they please, but let it have a start from scratch. It ought not to be wiped out before the others get a start; but that would inevitably be the effect of the procedure which some honorable members advocate. I would infinitely rather have had the proposal of the honorable member for Corinella. I saw that there was risk of great abuse under his scheme, but, at any rate, it provided machinery for the fair expression of the opinions of honorable members in the order of their preference. </para>

At the time, the proposal I am now discussing was not before the House ; but it would have been infinitely fairer when we came to deal with particular sites. My great objection to the original proposal of the Government from the first was the manifestly ridiculous use of the word " site," as applying to an area within a radius of fifty miles. How can one speak of the site for a Capital, and" then refer to an area within a radius of fifty miles? </para>

                        <para>- We might as well have said within New South Wales, or within a radius of 100 miles. To agree to such an area is to select, not the site for a Capital, but the territory within which the Capital site shall be chosen. No honorable member will deny that if we proceed with the method of choosing an area within a radius of fifty miles, there must be a further decision of the House at some later time to determine the precise locality of the future Capital of the Commonwealth. No one would say that the Government should be allowed to choose a site within a radius of fifty miles of some specified place. That shows that my complaint was a just one, and that, instead, of making progress towards the selection of a site, we are getting further away from our object than we were two years ago. When the late Government brought in their Bill, they put before us the names of certain localities which were thought eligible as Capital sites, and the Bill provided that the Seat of Government should be "at or near " Bathurst, Albury, Orange, Lyndhurst, Bombala, Dalgety, Lake George, or Tumut. Those places were mentioned, not as areas, of Federal territory, but as sites for the Federal Capital. The Constitution itself prescribes that the Parliament shall first determine the site of the Seat of Government, and then ask for a territory which will include that site. Our first step is to choose a site, and our second is to ask for a territory. We do not definitely determine the Seat of Government until the territory asked for is granted to or acquired by us; but our first duty is to choose a site for the seat' of Government. That is the line which was followed last time. The Government then in power asked the House to choose a place "at or near" which the Seat of Government should be. If the two Houses had on that occasion chosen the same site, the Government would have negotiated with the Government of New South Wales for the acquirement of a territory which would include it. Now, however, we are in a worse position than we were in then. The Senate has done what I am objecting to. I do not suppose that the members of that Chamber have acted under influence, but it is a singular thing that they have chosen Bombala as the site of the Seat of Government, and have then fixed upon an area within a radius of fifty miles of that place. </para>

                        <para>- It is irregular to refer to the action of the Senate, and therefore, to preserve Parliamentary decorum, I am putting a supposititious case. We know that there are two rival Capital sites within fifty miles of Bombala. That suits the honorable member for Eden-Monaro beautifully, because they are the only two sites in his electorate. If there were more sites in that electorate, he would like an area wide enough to include them all to be chosen. If we agreed to the decision of the Senate, he would get all he wants. But there are honorable members who, while they would vote for Dalgety, would, if that site were not chosen, vote for some other site which is not in the south-eastern district, while there are other honorable members who would vote first for Bombala, and, if it were not selected, would vote next for another site outside the south-eastern district. Under the original proposal of the Government both those who wish to see Bombala chosen, and those who wish to see Dalgety chosen, would be compelled to vote for the south-eastern district. </para>

                        <para>- There is only one site in that district which is now before us. I am speaking to practical business men. There may be a hundred sites in the district if we go into the matter very closely, but we are dealing with it as men who know what the voting was on the last occasion, when Lyndhurst stood at the top of the list for five ballots, and Bathurst and Orange lasted for one ballot only. There is only one site in the Lyndhurst district which is being practically considered now. That has been the effect of the last ballot. I think, however, that if a site is chosen in each district first, and that then the districts are dealt with on their merits, all will have a fair start. Under the present arrangement the supporters of four other sites will have a common interest in exterminating Lyndhurst, to prevent a second vote from being cast for that site after the first ballot has been taken. How much better is the plan of the Government ! Under that plan no district will be wiped out on the preliminary ballot. In each district is a site which, in the judgment of the whole House, must be the best site in that district. Surely there could not be a fairer way of testing the merits of the districts than for the whole House to decide as one united body, which is the best site in each district, quite apart from the merits of the rival districts, or of the rival sites in other districts. We are now asked practically to address our intelligence to discriminating between districts A, B, and C. We decide first which is the best site in A ; then, which is the best site in B ; and, lastly, which is the best site in C. Having thus chosen a representative site for each district, but having exterminated none of the districts, we allow a fair fight, site bv site, and district by district. The objection to the other mode is that one district would be wiped out without the chance of a second vote, whereas the two remaining districts would have such a chance. </para>

It was their own fault if other honorable members did not' go. He offered equal facilities to all, I understand. I was not asked, but that is a mere detail. Some honorable members were asked. I do not know what the process of selection was; but as the undertaking was managed at' Government expense, I think that every honorable member should have been invited. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing to be got by running after me. The honorable member knows that very well. I am willing that the honorable member should enjoy any advantage which he has obtained from that picnic. From all that I can hear, Tooma is a lovely place for a burial ground. No one could wish to lie in a more beautiful spot. I understand that if has been only lately discovered. However, we are not discussing the merits of the sites at the present time. That discussion is reserved for a later stage. What I am drawing attention to now is the unfair results which would follow if we did not adopt the proposal of the Government. It is to their credit that they have seen that their original proposal was not a fair one, and have therefore adopted a modification of it. Their present proposal was certainly not made because of the exercise of any influence on my part. If it is' due to' anything, it is due to the arguments urged in this Chamber yesterday. I understand that the amendment was in print then. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The only subject to which I addressed myself yesterday was the importance of doing that, and it now turns out that it had previously been the intention of the Government to do it. That disposes of the suggestion that I had been endeavouring to influence them. I am the last man who could do so. They are proposing what is a fair thing, and I hope, that the House will consider the proposal. It is no light matter to disregard the protest of any body of members in regard to a question which has some sort of interest to the State which they represent. We should, so far as we can, treat the States generously in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we have done so, and I desire that the reputation of the House shall be maintained. It comes with rather a surprise to me that, in a House which has the desire to act fairly, within bounds, to each State, so little regard is now being paid to the protest of such a large majority of the members representing New South Wales. It is not a protest against the choice of a site. If it were that, honorable members might say that it is unreasonable for New South Wales to attempt to dictate to the Commonwealth as to where the Capital shall be. But, as it is a question of giving a fair chance to all the sites - a fair chance to the site which is most favoured by the people of that State - surely our requests _ and protests might be received with fair ' consideration. The other States will, no doubt, come along in the future with.' matters, by' which their interests are particularly affected. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly withdraw my statement, especially as the honorable member for Hume has- withdrawn the congenial epithet which he used. I am in no sense offering a bribe. I am not asking honorable members to deflect from any choice of any site that they may have in their minds. I am not endeavouring to warp their judgment in regard to any particular site, but I am making an appeal - and such an appeal is generally successful - to the instincts of fairness of honorable members by asking them to exercise their consideration towards one of the States of the Commonwealth. If I asked them to change their views, or to vote for some portion of New South Wales which, in their opinion, was not the best, merely out of consideration for the interests of that State, I might be regarded as making an improper appeal. But when I ask honorable members to act with common sense and fairness, and to give a fair start to New South Wales in a matter so vitally affecting her, surely I am not making an improper appeal. ' That is the only request I am making. I am pointing out the effect of following a certain course. If there were only one site which-the House had any notion of adopting in the southern and south-eastern districts, I should not have a word to say except that the last method proposed would result in a waste of time, and throw us back, but inasmuch as there are rival sites in each of the two districts which are supported by bodies of antagonistic supporters, some of whom would vote for Lyndhurst upon the second ballot, I think that I am submitting a fair proposition. If the sites were narrowed down to one in each district, honorable members would be asked to choose between Tumut, Bombala, and Lyndhurst, and the selection could be made with absolute fairness. We should then have a fair start. But the existence of two absolutely separate and antagonistic bodies in each of the two districts referred to introduces an element of unfairness, because they have the effect of creating a' double-headed compact in opposition to the Lyndhurst site. </para>

                <para>Seems to us that if any element of unfairness were introduced, we should not save time, because the whole question would have to be reconsidered in Committee. The same thing would happen if a site were selected which did not thoroughly represent the desire of the majority of honorable members. Unquestionably the whole matter would have to be gone over again in Committee. Therefore, no good object can be served if honorable members act other than fairly and honestly. There is no escaping the fact that, under any method, the majority of the Committee must determine which site shall be selected, so that, it seems to me, this very long debate over the method of selection has been; to a large extent, unnecessary. I ask honorable members to agree to the proposal made by the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I am influenced in my attitude towards the Government proposal, first, by . the belief that every honorable member attaches great importance to the step we are about to take, and to the effect which it will have upon the future community of interests between the various States, and particularly between New South Wales and Victoria. I am influenced also by the conviction that every honorable member wishes the selected site to have the approval of the majority. Further, I hold that I must be influenced in the vote I shall give by the presumption that 'no honorable member will prostitute his position as a representative by casting his vote for the purpose of promoting the interests of any individual site against his own honest judgment. If this be the correct view to take, I was perfectly justified in urging last evening that it was better for us to place the whole of the districts upon a uniform footing before proceeding to vote with regard to them. I think that the Government proposal is in the direction of fairness, and that it will best enable us to arrive at a just decision, and to obviate the possibility of bitterness arising in New South Wales, owing to a decision being arrived at by means of ' a catch vote. Therefore, whilst I still favour the method under which we select a district, I think we should, first of all, decide amongst ourselves as to the best site in each area submitted to us. If we do this we shall place all the districts upon a uniform footing, and shall be able to deal with them fairly- and justly. We shall be in a position to give a straight out vote in connexion with each of the sites. If it can be shown that any improper voting has taken place in connexion with the selection of the sites, with a view to defeat the selection of any particular district, I shall hold myself free to take any action that may be. within my power to render abortive the action of the honorable members concerned, whose conduct, under such circumstances, must be regarded as dastardly if such means were adopted. </para>

                    <para>- When I spoke upon this question last evening I was of opinion that there was very little difference between the two courses suggested, although I favoured the selection of the districts first, and the choice of the sites afterwards. Before the matter came up for discussion in the House I had conceived a plan exactly similar to that now suggested by the representatives of New South Wales. I thought that the time had arrived when those honorable members who had more than one site in their respective districts should,, make up their minds as to the one best "suited for the purposes of a Federal Capital. I considered that after we had chosen the best site in each district, we could then proceed to make a final selection. I was influenced in another direction yesterday, but I never thought that there was any particular advantage presented by one plan over the other. It seemed to me that if we selected the districts first, the site finally chosen might not prove to be the one of which we most highly approved. We might, for instance, be very much in favour of one site, and consequently cast our vote in favour of the district in which it was located, but the final decision might be in favour of another site in the same district, of which we did not approve. On the other hand, if we selected the sites first, Ave might, upon finding our first choice rejected, transfer our support to another district. For instance, if I were in faA'our of one site in the Bombala district, and another site in that district, which I did not favour, were selected, I might transfer my support to Lyndhurst or Tumut. In the one case, Ave might lose the site of which we approved, and still be restricted to a particular district, whilst in the other case Ave might have to fall back upon our second preference as to site. It cannot be said that there would be any absolute gain in either case. We must also remember that after your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -Speaker,</inline> we have the right to suggest any site to take the place of that which may be selected by the ballot. I think that constitutes a great safeguard to honorable members in dealing with this matter. If the right honorable member for East Sydney fails to secure the selection of the site which he favours, he will still be at liberty to move the excision of any other site with a view to its insertion in lieu thereof. If we look at this matter all round, and assume that no attempt will be made by honorable members to vote for a site from ulterior motives, it will be seen that no danger whatever exists that we shall not finally secure the site which is favoured by a majority Of this House. I think that all this discussion is unnecessary, because, under either plan, we shall secure what we want. Believing that both systems are good, I shall now view the matter from another stand-point. Of course, I recognise that under the Constitution the Federal Capital must be in New South Wales. I also recognise that out of twenty-six representatives of that State, quite twenty are in favour of one particular site. We know that they reflect the views of the majority of the people of New South Wales, who are unmistakably favorable to the selection of the site in the western district. For my own part, seeing that by either process we shall secure the selection of the site which is favoured by a majority of the House, I feel inclined to be very generous - especially as it will not cost much - to the representatives of New South Wales. I do not like the suggestion of the right honorable member for East Sydney, that some honorable members have been guilty of what is commonly called " log-rolling." The more we keep such charges out of our discussions, the more likely are we to avoid such practices. Upon  a national question of this sort, we have no right to assume that any honorable member will be actuated by other than the purest motives. There never was a time when the responsibility of honorable members was greater than if is upon the present occasion. We are invited to settle for all time the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, and it will be to our eternal discredit if we do not exercise that responsibility to the best advantage. Personally, I have long ago decided which particular site I favour in the western division, the south-eastern division", and the southern division. ' That being so, and in order to show the people of New South Wales that we are determined that they shall labour under no imaginary grievance, I intend to vote with the right honorable member ' for East Sydney. </para>

                    <para>. - It will, perhaps, be most convenient to the Committee to enter upon a consideration of the relative merits of the several sites on this clause. I am not an advocate of any particular site, and, therefore, do not propose to open the discussion by dilating on the advantages of any one of them. </para>

                    <para>- This is a vital clause in the Bill, and it is somewhat extraordinary that those most directly interested in the selection of a site appear to have nothing to say in regard to it. If we allow the clause to pass as it stands, the result will be the selection of the southeastern district, presuming that the Bill be not rejected on the third reading. I rose chiefly to intimate that I propose 'to move an amendment. We are not likely to select the site of the Capital within the next quarter of a century, judging by the rate at which we are proceeding to deal with the question. The suggestion has been made that some honorable members are so dishonest that they would resort to any trickery to defeat the supporters of sites to which they are opposed, with the ultimate result that no selection would be made for some time to come. The only way to secure the speedy selection of a site is for this or some other Government to take the matter into their own hands, and to make the Seat of Government Bill a Ministerial measure. We know, however, that neither this nor any other Government is likely to do anything of the kind. It would be a very strong Ministry that would accept that responsibility. If it did, with the result that some site other than Dalgety or Bombala were selected by this House, we should at once be in conflict with another place. It is a question whether the Senate could be induced to alter the decision at which it has arrrived. </para>

                        <para>- My complaint is that it is not a question for consideration by a caucus, and until it is made a caucus matter, either by this or some other Government, a determination will not be arrived at. If another place insisted on adhering to the decision at which it had arrived, the only way in which it would be possible to secure a settlement of the difficulty would be for a strong Government to make the Bill a Government measure, and, after returning it to the Senate a second time without avail, to bring about a double dissolution, and allow the country to decide. As there is no likelihood of an agreement being arrived at, I think it is time some other method were adopted, and I therefore propose to move for the appointment' of a Commission, consisting of one representative of each State, to make a selection. It would then be for. the Government of the day to accept the responsibility of disapproving of the decision of the Commission. We have heard honorable members accusing one another of intriguing and log-rolling, and even bribery has been suggested. When this is the feeling of the House, can there be any likelihood of ah early determination? </para>

                        <para>- When that statement appears in cold print it will not be read as a joke. Inasmuch as in the opinion of some honorable members the House is not to be trusted to perform this delicate task, it is about time that some other method were resorted to. In common with many other honorable members, I hold that- we should endeavour to settle the question as speedily as possible. We are at present occupying an absurd position. A statement was made in the Victorian Legislative Assembly last night which was an insult to the whole of the members of the Federal Parliament. It was said, in effect, to members of this Legislature, "We don't want you; get out." The Victorian Parliament generously gave us the free use of this building; but it is not very pleasant to have that fact thrown' up from time to time. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The site chosen last session by this House should not have been selected. Had it not been for the action of the representatives of certain States, who are exceedingly anxious that a particular selection should be made, the decision arrived at by this House last session would not have been secured. Much has been said in criticism of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver's</inline> report on the action of the Commissioners in selecting the Lacmalac site. Before I visited Lacmalac I was under the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> had exceeded his duty ; but, having inspected the site, I am now convinced that every word in his report is absolutely correct. The Commissioners went out of their way to select Lacmalac, and no one can give any reason for their action. No six men outside a lunatic asylum would think of selecting such a site. </para>

                    <para>- Much as we have complained of provincialism in the opposition outside to any settlement of the Capital question, I think we have a great deal to complain of in the Chamber itself. I am not prepared to admit that the capacity of the House to settle the question has gone from it. Surely there must come a time when we shall* approach the question at close quarters,' and finally deal with it. I am thoroughly satisfied of the earnestness of the attempt of the present Government to get it settled, and I do not think that any honorable member can take objection to the course of procedure which has been adopted, though I agree with ' the last speaker, that it would have been better if the Government had taken the responsibility of proposing a site, and trying to get it accepted by both Houses of the Parliament. But as the question has so far been considered as a non-party one, I do not think that we can expect the present Government to take that attitude in regard to it, especially as individual Ministers have expressed different opinions as to the merits of the sites. I agree with what was said by the honorable member for Richmond this afternoon about the subject being a very much larger one than a question affecting the interests of any constituency or any one State. We have to deal with it from the point of view of the interests of Australia, and I have made up my mind to approach it from that stand-point. I have formed an idea as to which is the best site, and I voted for that site consistently when the ballots were taken two years ago; but I do not assert that that is the only site which is eligible, and if a majority of the Committee declared for one of the other sites, I would be prepared to give way. If I cannot get Lyndhurst, I am prepared to vote for Dalgety, and if Dalgety is not chosen. I shall vote for some other site in the southern district; but I am determined that, so far as I am concerned, the matter shall be definitely settled this session. I do not take much account of the objections which have been raised to the proposal to deal with the sites in districts, because it is apparent to me that, until the third reading of the Bill has been agreed to, it will be open to any section whose members feel aggrieved at the decision arrived at, either, because they suspect collusion of rival interests, or think that the result of the ballot was accidental, to have the Bill recommitted for the purpose of remedying the matter. I do not, however, apprehend that the decision of the ballot will be accidental. An analysis of the voting on the last occasion showed that only one vote could be called in question, and it was frankly admitted that this vote was cast by mistake. The error was admitted almost as soon as it was made. Otherwise, a straight-out vote was taken. In view of that experience, we may anticipate a straight-out vote again on the present occasion. I think that independent members of the- Committee - that is, independent in the sense of not being pledged to any one site - should not regard themselves as "cribbed, cabined, and confined" by the action of the three honorable gentlemen who are advocating three particular sites. The time must sooner or later arrive when we shall have to throw them over, and set to work, irrespective of their attempts to form coteries in support of one site or another. We have either to decide the question, or to confess our inability to deal with one of the most important and interesting subjects which has been brought before us. With regard to the clause now before the Committee, I take great exception to the manner in which it was originally drafted. It at first read - </para>

                        <para>- No doubt that is so. But if we chose as wide an area as the clause originally provided for, the advocates of rival sites within that area would be so many that Parliament would have almost as much to do in locating the site of the Capital itself as it has to do now. I think we should say that the Capital shall be situated within a few miles of some particular place. Having done that, we might adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for . Kennedy, and appoint a small Commission to decide upon the exact location. - I would be quite ready to appoint the right honorable member for Swan as a Commissioner for such a purpose. He is a gentleman of great experience in these matters, an undoubted patriot, and comes from a State which is not directly interested, so that he would not be affected by the rivalry of Victoria and New South Wales. But whether we allow the right honorable member, like Constantine of old, to go to the district with lance in his hand, and trace out on the spot the bounds of our future Capital, or intrust the work to several gentlemen, we shall do better in the first instance to definitely determine the site within a mile or two, than to say that it shall be placed within a wide area. The clause, as amended by the Senate, extends the area much beyond the original intention. If reads - </para>

                <para class="block">There we have two conflicting arid absurd designations. The definition contained in that clause falsifies all notions of logic. To say that the Seat of Government shall be within fifty miles of Bombala is in itself a sufficient designation of the locality. But in addition to that it is provided that the Seat of Government shall be located in an area which also takes in Dalgety, and which forms a large parallelogram, comprising more than the 900 square miles subsequently provided for. I do not intend to trouble the Committee any further on this subject. I have already expressed my opinion on the merits of the rival sites, and I am quite ready to cast my vote to-night. I hope that there will be no more disputing on the subject, but that as soon as the Committee is thoroughly seized of all the facts that can be put before it, we shall take a ballot, and definitely settle the question. I hope, at any rate, that we shall not come to the lame and impotent conclusion at which we arrived last session, so that the matter has to be relegated to a future Parliament. , I hope, too, that we shall recognise the great importance of the subject to the future of Australia, and disregard the temporary interests of our constituencies, and of our States. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Kennedy was perfectly right when he stated that there is a tendency on the part of honorable members in dealing with this matter to follow the public opinion of the electorates and of the States which they represent. There are greater a'nd nobler purposes to be served. I interjected when the honorable member was speaking that we might leave the question to be settled by the King. A similar trouble arose in Canada, and it was suggested that some one absolutely trustworthy should be left to decide the matter. Eventually the selection was intrusted to the Queen. In connexion with the selection of the Federal Capital of the United States George Washington was empowered within certain limitations to select the site. It was decided that it should be situated on the Potomac, but otherwise he was allowed to exercise his choice. I do not know of any man in Australia who stands in a position similar to that formerly occupied by Washington- in the United States; but there is something in the view of the honorable member that some person not locally interested and trustworthy, and with opportunities to obtain the fullest and best information, should decide the question. I do not suggest that honorable members are not competent to deal with the matter - possibly some of them are a little too competent. I think that it is highly probable - and I say this with a full sense of my responsibility, and with a knowledge that the sentiment is not popular in New South Wales - that the best site for the Federal Capital may probably be found in the great drainage- centre of Australia, upon the Upper Murray, near Mount Kosciusko. A number of reliable men who have seen that district - I have not been there myself - tell me that in no part of Australia have they ever witnessed such a glorious panorama. </para>

                        <para>- I am perfectly sure that no considerations, with regard to abundance of water supply or magnificence of scenery would cause the honorable member to vote for any other than a western site. It is only natural that those honorable members who represent western constituencies should vote for a western site, and that those whose constituents are in the southern part of New South Wales should vote for a site in that part of the State. I know what electors are, and what human nature is. It is of no use setting high ideals against material interests. Considerations of material advantage will be paramount, and honorable members are not likely to fly in the face of their constituents. Almost every constituency labours under the hallucination that the right site is to be found within its' own boundaries, and local bias plays a most important part. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro tells us that in his district natural beauties abound. He tells us of the place - </para>

                <para class="block">Now, what does the honorable member for Hume say with regard to the Bombala site ? His description of that site reads like a page from Nansen's <inline font-style="italic">Farthest North.</inline> It could have applied to the great lone land beyond the Saskatchewan, where the only things to be seen are an occasional moose or a Cree Indian. The honorable member told us that ho sounds were heard near Dalgety except when the west wind blew, and the howls of the dingoes were wafted over the snow. The Capital should unquestionably be situated in a spot possessing great natural beauties. Some honorable members' ideas of natural beauty are embodied in the book which has been circulated by the advocates of the Lyndhurst site. But I cannot imagine anything more prosaic or more commonplace than the features there presented. Anthony Trollope stated that we were so proud of Sydney Harbor that it might be supposed we had dug it out ourselves. Notwithstanding the way in which people laugh at us, we are proud of Port Jackson, which is the most beautiful harbor in the world. It is worthy of all that has been said of it, and must make the most favorable impression upon visitors who make their first landing in Australia upon its shores. Any man who has a heart above that of a wombat, or has any conception of what he owes to his country, must wish that when the railway train sweeps into the Federal Capital the passengers conveyed by it shall have presented to them a view that cannot be equalled in any other part of the Commonwealth. Such a view is, I believe, to be found upon the Upper Murray. Upon the question of water supply, I would urge that we should not contemplate only a supply of water sufficient for our baths, or for watering our gardens or parks, but should also consider the part which water will play in beautifying the landscape. Water in itself may not be a thing of beauty, but it has a relieving effect when combined with other physical features, and tends to perfect the scheme of beauty. There is no other part of Australia likely to be chosen which has .streams running all the year round, and which are at their fullest in the summer time, when water is most wanted. Not only from the spectacular stand-point, but also from the utilitarian point of view, we should seek a site in connexion with which we shall have a supply of water ample for all domestic purposes, and also for generating electricity and sup plying power in other forms. We should also hold in view the aid which water will render in providing means of recreation for the population of a Capital. Unfortunately, or fortunately, as the case may be, the compact entered into with regard to the 100-mile limit has eliminated from our choice many of the great beauty-spots upon the New South Wales  coastline. I know that in that State it is not popular to advocate the selection of a site near the Victorian border. But I do so - as I explained this afternoon - upon the broadest ground, and knowing that it is in opposition to the temporary feeling of my own State. But what is that temporary feeling in comparison with a proper appreciation of this subject ? In years to come, when our children and children's children visit this site they will realize that their fathers were above provincialism, and that they were prepared to choose the best site, even though it was situated far away from Sydney, and- near the Victorian border. Our compact here to-night is to do the best we can for the Commonwealth as a whole. Believing, as I do, that a suitable site may exist within fifty miles of the Murray River, where the water comes from the snow-clad ranges, and where the best spectacular result produced by the magnificent handiwork of nature is to be found, -I must vote for that site. I should like honorable members to recollect one great fact in connexion with beauty. Men may make a pretty site by means of parks and buildings, but nature alone can make a magnificent site. We might form a pretty place at Lyndhurst, or in many other parts of New South Wales, but unless nature has done her best all the beauty which we can impart to any site in the shape of parks, and buildings will never elevate our Capital to the position which it should occupy. I wish- that it were possible for honorable members to visit this site. I wish that the representatives of New South Wales could see it. If the Welaregang  site is as 'good as it is alleged to be, we ought to know more about it, because, after all, we have not sufficient information in detail. This is a topic upon which a person might talk at very great length. In connexion with this matter we have a special responsibility. If the Welaregang  site is as good as it is represented to be, I implore the House to wait another fortnight, and to give honorable members an opportunity of visiting it. If the representatives of New South Wales then de-' clare that it is not a worthy site, I shall have nothing further to say. I wish that, before to-morrow, the Prime Minister would think over this matter. Does he not see the difficulty in which we are placed? Although I believe that the Welaregang  site is not deficient, either in regard to its water supply or building area, still, no man is in a position to finally pin his faith, to a particular - spot without possessing an absolute knowledge of it in detail. We must select a site, not by way of compromise, but on account of its magnificence- - a site which Australia will regard as a worthy one. If Welaregang  be that site, I ask the Government to give us an opportunity of converting the representatives of New South Wales to the views which I have expressed. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad that the Mother State has been able to supply this House with an honorable member whose brilliant advocacy of scenery and water- will enable us to give effect to these attributes of national character. My honorable friend, like every other man of gifted imagination, occupies a position of peculiar advantage, owing to the fact that he knows nothing whatever of the particular locality of which he has .spoken. Imagination is the first essential of poetic excellence, and he occupies the happy position of being highly imaginative. Upon the strength of the impression made upon his mind by reports which have reached him from some stragglers who safely returned to the centre of civilization a day or two ago from a highly festive excursion, the honorable member for Richmond positively announces to the House that a particular site, which was not previously discovered by the member for the district, is the most beautiful in the whole world. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said more than that. He said that it was the most beautiful site in the universe, but, subsequently, corrected himself by substituting the words " in Australia." Is it riot a singular circumstance that one of the most indefatigable local members that Australia ever had, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. William</inline> Lyne, who has an intimate knowledge of that part of Australia - a knowledge which has been derived from association with it as a settler for many years, because he resided within 200 or 300 miles of it - is it net remarkable that when he impressed upon Australia that there were certain eligible Capital sites in his electorate, this particular site which our friend has described in such magnificent terms, was never once mentioned by him as being good enough for a local pound ? It is a place which, I believe, is very beautiful. If I thought that in the settlement of this question our first consideration should be the beauty of any site, I say, at once, that from all I have heard, I would admit that it is one of the most beautiful spots in Australia. If I thought the matter could be settled in that way, I should be one of the first to say that we should have some further time to enable honorable members to get a more general and a more accurate knowledge of this particular site. But I fancy that the honorable member for Hume, if he ever thought of this site, dismissed it from his mind, because of the view which the late Government had of the main question to be studied in connexion with the selection of a Capital Site. I have before me the terms of the Commission which was issued by the late Government. I think that the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, countersigned the proclamation, but it was within the Department of Home Affairs. The Government issued a commission to a number of skilled gentlemen, who were to report, at considerable expense - I do not say unreasonable expense - upon the different sites which had been mentioned. There were a large number of sites. The proclamation set out in their order the considerations which this Commission of skilled men should have in view. The first place was given to accessibility. I wish to say that I think that the late Government properly and wisely put accessibility at the very head of the requirements. You can get up pleasure trips to beautiful scenery, but when a Capital has to become the centre of the executive business and the legislative business of a business Commonwealth, you have to consider something more than beauty. According to the view of my honorable friend, the member for Richmond, there could have been no doubt whatever as to the wisdom of placing the great Capital of the United States near the Falls of Niagara. You have plenty of water there. They would have had there the most beautiful waterfall then known in the whole world. But if any one happened to visit Niagara, as I did a year or two ago, he would have found that this scene of grandeur, which stands in the very front of the great sights of the world, has settled near it the population of a little village hamlet. Amongst 80,000,000 of highly enterprising wealthy people, prone to every form of enjoyment and luxury, we find this magnificent scene simply settled as a village-hamlet would be settled. </para>

                        <para>- But with a population of 80,000,000 to-day, there is a village hamlet close to Niagara. Notwithstanding the enormous growth of this mighty people, with this magnificently beautiful natural attraction close at hand, it is merely an attraction for pleasure-seekers, not for men of business. Men of business - except with reference to the motive power to be derived from these magnificent falls - do not consider them. Men of business do not live on beauty. They do not flock to places of great natural beauty for business purposes. The business world is not carried on by means of picnics to Niagara or by means of excursions to the Blue Mountains. We put the true national idea of this question .upon a ludicrous basis, to my mind, if we forget the obvious necessity for an accessible site, and lose our heads in a rapture about a certain volume of water, and a certain view of distant mountains. So far as a view of a mountain is concerned. I rather think that Dalgety is within view of Kosciusko. But I do want to impress upon honorable members that we are not selecting a place for a picnic, or for a pleasure resort. We must have some regard for the interests of the serious affairs of State, to say nothing of business, and, first of all, for the accessibility of the site with reference to the rest of Australia. We must have some regard for the use which is to be made of the site as the centre of our Government, and' the centre of our Legislature. We must, as the late Government did, put that question at the very head of the requirements. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman,</inline> in the report which has been furnished - and he is a gentleman whom I take to be a most competent man, and one who had the advantage of personal knowledge of this beautiful 'district - adds most significantly that the most serious question of accessibility has to be determined. I did not visit Tooma, for various reasons, but in fairness to Tooma, I should have gone if I had not felt that even if it were the most lovely site in the world, it is from other conditions one which we could not accept. One who arrives at that opinion does no injustice to a site in not visiting it. Therefore, I feel that I am doing no injustice to this site, having regard to the grounds of the opinion at which I have arrived. I rule it out absolutely on the point of accessibility. I will admit, if you like, that it is the most beautiful site in the world. But if we wanted merely beauty could we get a grander panorama than we have in the Blue Mountains. There are no grander views in Australia than are to be found there. </para>

                        <para>- Some parts of the Blue Mountains are, but some parts are not. The range is a very extensive one. But I mention that incidentally. If the Blue Mountains had been outside the 100-miles radius, who would ever have suggested building the Capital there? Probably no one. When the late Government put forward this proclamation,- no doubt they were acting under skilled advice; they had the advantage of that advice. What was the point which they put next in importance? - " (2) Means of communication." </para>

                <para class="block">That is nothing to my honorable friend. So long as there is a scene of beauty, a trip of two or three days in a coach is not of the slightest consequence. If the weather were wet, that would be inevitable. One of my honorable friends, who is an ardent believer in another site in another part of the State, was impious enough to pray that half-an-inch of rain would fall upon the recent picnic, because the result would be that those honorable members who took part in it could not, in that event, possibly be back in time to take part in the division. I understand that in wet weather this place, which is mountainous - there are a number of spurs in the ranges converging upon it - is one of the most difficult places with reference to means of communication. On the Victorian side it is difficult ; but on the New South Wales side what would it mean? You first go to, I think, Culcairn. Then you travel upon a branch line to Germanton, and then there is about fifty or sixty miles of coaching to be done. Taking the journey from Tumut, it would be forty-six miles; but I am taking it from the existing line to Germanton. </para>

                        <para>- I have not visited the district', but I am informed that the character of the country is such that an enormous expenditure would be necessary to enable the ' Capital to be properly approached by railway. I shall say, however, that the necessary railway communication would involve an outlay of£500,000. Would this Committee expect New South Wales to disburse half-a-million of money in constructing a railway to carry honorable members to that out-of-the-way part of the State? Would they have the audacity to ask New South Wales to do anything of the kind? If any other State were asked to incur such an expenditure, what a howl of execration there would be. Other States are terrified by the proposal to expend money in the establishment of the Capital, although it is a Commonwealth object, yet they apparently expect New South Wales to construct a railway at this enormous expense to carry us a distance of forty or fifty miles. </para>

                        <para>- We are not "dead-heads," because our railway fares are paid by the Commonwealth. These are considerations, however, to which every honorable member must attach a certain degree of weight. The accessibility of this site from the capitals of the great States is decidedly inferior. I am now dealing 'with the question of accessibility with absolutely no reference to any one State. I am putting the facts for the States and the representatives of each State. The difficulties are the same in both cases. Could we expect Victoria or New South Wales-they have now to look at their money pretty closely before they throw it away - to build a railway in the one case running up to the Murray and in the other either along the Murray from Germanton or down from Tumut to the Murray? The building of the two lines would involve the expenditure of£1, 000,000, and could any reasonable man expect the two States to incur such a liability? These are matters which business men have to take into consideration. We do riot wish to make the holding of a seat in the Federal Parliament more difficult for the representative men of Australia than it is. Wherever the Capital may be, the position will be difficult for honorable members of this Legislature. Even- with the Seat of Government in a great city like Melbourne honorable members have to suffer inconvenience in attending the Parliament; but what is that inconvenience when compared with that which would be suffered in attending the sittings if the Federal Capital were established at some inaccessible spot? Could we sit gazing on Mount Kosciusko for . three months at a stretch ? It is a lovely spot to visit for a day or two, but even my honorable and enthusiastic friend would die if he had to remain there for three weeks. The rapturous view's gleaned from picknickers are very entertaining, but we are dealing with a matter of vast business conce'rn, and have to come down from the clouds that dignify Mount Kosciusko and my honorable friend to the prosaic facts with which the Commission was called upon to deal at the instance of the honorable member for Hume. What were the considerations to which the Commissioners were to have regard ? We find that they were to consider the question of climate: I have no doubt that the climate at Tooma is all right, and the same may be said of the climatic conditions of the other sites. But, having regard to the first two points which the Commissioners were to take into consideration, I submit that, if Tooma were the most beautiful spot in the world, it would stand self-condemned because of its inaccessibility. I have no hesitation in saying that I would rather vote for Tumut than Tooma. It would be infinitely better if those who admire beautiful sunsets and magnificent mountain effects were given a weekly excursion to Kosciusko - if they would go there instead of talking about it - and had everything provided ibr them on a sumptuous scale, rather than that the States should have to incur an unnecessary expenditure of a million of money simply to enable those who have to legislate and to do business in the Federal Capital to reach it conveniently. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt; but, fortunately for myself, although I was once a poet, the poetic would, in that case, gracefully" blend with the practical. Let us consider Lyndhurst from the point of view of accessibility. There is a great State railway running practically from Melbourne to Lyndhurst, and not touching at Sydney. A man may travel from Melbourne to Lyndhurst in two hours less than the time occupied in travelling from Melbourne to Sydney. Men of business and of common sense must take into consideration the fact that a locomotive is running practically into Lyndhurst, and that a man coming from Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, or Victoria, may enter a train at Melbourne and find himself in Lyndhurst next morning, two hours earlier than if he travelled on the main trunk line to Sydney. These are matters which affect the first two heads, or questions, which were submitted for the consideration of the Commission, and my own view is that, having regard to these considerations, Lyndhurst is the best site. Where does beauty come in in this category? There are ten heads, and when we come to the tenth, what do we find ? Picturesqueness. There are about sixty lines under ten heads in the Royal proclamation, and the very point on which my honorable friend is so strong, is dealt with in about the fiftieth line under the tenth heading. A sensible course was adopted in placing the question of beauty so far down in the list. Lovers of natural beauty could, resort to these lovely spots from the Seat pf Government if they were so inclined. If, for example, Tooma were selected, honorable members could have a country residence on the top of Mount Kosciusko, without very great inconvenience, because it is not very far away. I hope the Committee will understand that I am not acting unfairly in refraining from visiting Tooma, because if I went there and saw that it was the loveliest spot on the face of nature, I should have to condemn it, on the ground of want of accessibility and means of communication. I come now to Dalgety and Bombala. They are sites which I prefer to Tumut. I have had the advantage of travelling from Cooma to Dalgety, and my recollection is that a distance of something like thirty miles separates the two towns. </para>

                        <para>- It has. If we wish to select a site which has no railway communication, we must study the wishes of the State to some extent, provided that we expect it to construct a line for our convenience. We are now talking in this Chamber as if the whole matter rested solely with the Commonwealth ; but when our Government have to deal, as business men, with the Government of New South Wales, a number of business considerations will press upon them, and will lead, no doubt, to some reasonable solution. We cannot expect New South Wales to run an expensive line to nowhere. Consequently, we should have, in the case of Tooma, a coach journey of fifty or sixty miles, which ' in " itself would, I think, make the whole project inadmissible." If it were likely to be a convenient site in the future we might decide to submit to very serious inconvenience for the next ten or fifty years, because of the future advantages to be gained from its adoption. I am going on the assumption that the enterprise of New South Wales, which is conducted by men who have money to risk and money to make, is more intelligent than the views taken in this matter by honorable members who have no personal interest at stake.. Where is the hand of destiny pointing, so far as we can judge from the furrows which enterprise, is driving across the face of Australia? Where are those furrows, which will increase in depth and breadth as the years go by, leading? They point in many directions, but none of them point to Tooma. Judging from the descriptions of the place which I have read, it seems to be one of those beauty spots which no one who has his way to make in the world would live in. If it were a wonderfully productive district, I think that, in spite of its lack of railway communication, it would have shown more marked evidence of development than we have any notion of to-day. If the soil of the district were really good, it would have been more closely settled. The finger of destiny points to various trades, but it never points in the direction of Tooma. In studying the interests of the millions who will develop. Australia in the years to come, we should pay regard to their business "convenience more than to their desire for the beautiful. It is not the love of the beautiful which makes a nation great. The beautiful can be bought in pictures, or seen in art galleries, or if one wishes to study it in nature, he can make a holiday trip to some beautiful spot. But when one is thinking of business considerations he studies his convenience, not his love of the beautiful. It is those who study business convenience most who most frequently have opportunities to gaze upon the grandeur of nature. I would put all the sites to that test. Dalgety, Bombala, Tooma, and Tumut are all far removed from the broad tracks of the nation's progress. But when we speak of Lyndhurst, we speak of a place which, because of its natural wealth, is bound to become one of the great centres of industry. The Lyndhurst district has great mineral wealth, and its soil is very rich. I do not put forward the Lyndhurst site because of its beauty, though it possesses a fair share of beauty. It is a site which is open to some praise on that score. But if we study the by no means hidden springs which control the movements of settlement, and the growth of population in new countries, we must see that Lyndhurst, which, after all, is not so far removed from Melbourne, and is connected with the great system of railways which is really Australian, in spite of the differences of gauge, must become a large and beautiful city, because it is so closely in touch with the industrial life of our people. According, as honorable members lo'ok on the map with the eye of the tourist or with the eye of the business man, they must make their choice of the proposed sites. If we are going to choose our Capital from the sickly tourist point of view, we might go anywhere ; but if we are going to deal with the question as business men, and pay regard to the movements of population on this great continent, we shall leave the arguments derived from the possession of the beautiful to some other occasion, and study practical business convenience. We should remember that the Federal Capital is to be built for the grandest of all business objects. It is not to be constructed as a place of resort for the idle and the rich, as the place to which people are to be taken by guides, to admire the elevation of "our only mountain," or the tints of our lovely gloaming. Those are pleasures which the poor cannot afford, and which the business man has not time to enjoy, except in his hours of idleness. If we wish to make our great Capital, a mere mooning resort for the idle and the rich, let us choose Tooma as a site. But .if we wish to lay the foundation-stone of a city which will some day or other form part of the great family of Australian centres of industry, instead of a township removed to a distant place like some mysterious object of nature, having no connexion with the national life of the people, we shall choose Lyndhurst. Lyndhurst would not be under the domination of any of the great cities. The locality is situated at a great distance from Sydney, and it is separated from that city by the Blue Mountains. But it is the heart of an industrial rural population. If we wish to choose a Capital which will be connected with the future development of Australia, we shall not try to discover a place which has a beautiful view; we shall rather study the convenience of our people. We shall not choose a place so remote and so difficult of access that only the poorest intellects will bury themselves there. Tooma would be a paradise for mediocrity, but it would be a misfortune for the nation to have the Capital in such a place. We wish the Capital to be the centre of our national life, and of the national power, and the- source of our national legislation. We do not wish to make it a township to which tourist parties will go to spend a day or two. The facts which I have mentioned in respect to Tooma should "be sufficient to condemn that site in the estimation of business men. I now leave New South Wales out of the question altogether. I thought it my duty , to refer to that State when I was dealing with the method of procedure for selecting a site, but I was defeated in what I then proposed, and I therefore deal with the matter now, not as a representative of New South Wales, but as a member of the Federal Legislature. I invite the attention of honorable members to the form in which the Bill has come to us. As I said last night, we have for three years past been spending money to obtain accurate reports on all the sites eligible for a Federal Capital, and have been setting ourselves, as a body of capable men who expect to be judged by our constituents by the ordinary standard of business capacity, to the task of fixing a site for the Seat of Government, not of choosing a Federal Territory. The Bill introduced two years ago invited us to say that the site of the Capital should be at or near a definite spot, and the measure now before us is declared to be a Bill to determine the Seat of Government. The Constitution points out that - </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is not in the Senate, yet he has got the Senate to put four towns in his electorate into a Bill for this national object. From Cooma a line is drawn somewhere in the direction of the western setting sun, until it strikes the Victorian border, and thence it returns along that border to the Pacific Ocean. And yet this is called a Bill to determine the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth ! Are our ideas of building a Capital so extensive that we propose to have a building plan of about 300 miles? I used a strong word, which, perhaps, I ought to withdraw, but it really amounts to something like what I said - to call this a Bill to determine the site of a city. Why, it is a Bill to determine that the Capital city shall not be anywhere else in New South Wales than within a big district'. That is the meaning as well as the effect of the Bill. We can have any spot we like in that big area, but all the rest of the State is excluded, and when that is barred off, then we can at some remote period in the history of Australia address ourselves again to the question of determining the site of the Seat of Government by deciding which of these several towns or localities shall be adopted. Is not that playing the fool in the face of Australia, not only with the people of New South Wales, but with this question? If the Government would straightforwardly ask Parliament to pass a Bill to acquire a territory - although it would be putting the cart before the horse- </para>

                        <para>- But the Constitution most sensibly says - " First find the point of your' Capital city, and then get your territory in relation to that point." That is the logical proper arrangement of the Constitution. Under the plea of determining the site of the Seat of Government, we are deliberately determining a big area out of which we shall carve a territory in which we shall select the site of the Seat of Government. That form of dealing with the subject is not worthy of the business capacity of the House. It is creating endless trouble. We desire to have this question, which excites a certain amount of feeling, settled with reasonable speed ; but, under the phraseology of the Bill, we are not doing anything of the kind. I hope that the House will do its duty to the subject by making up its mind about the site of the Capital. Let us do our duty. We admit that we are. here to fix the site of the Capital, not to fix a territory in order to have another fight afterwards over a site. Suppose that we passed the Bill as it has come down from the Senate, would not there be a fight between Dalgety and Bombala? Will the honorable member for Eden-Monaro get up and say that his electorate will be content to rule out one of the sites and take the other? </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to press my honorable friend unfairly. That would simplify the matter very' much. That, I think, ought to simplify our task in another way. Since the representative of the district is prepared to take that course, surely the Government especially, if it turns out that the House is in favour of one of the towns in this district, will do its part in a businesslike way by proposing that that place shall, be the site of the Capital. We are not bound by the words in the Bill. Let us do our duty ; let us carry out the title of the Bill, and determine the Seat of Government. Let us be done with the subject, because we are now simply taking up time over a question which has already caused a great deal of feeling, especially in New South Wales. When it has been settled in the way now proposed, after infinite trouble, we shall have got no further forward than we were, because the whole battle will have to be fought over again. Supposing that clause 2 of the Bill is passed into law. My honorable friend may say, " I am content to take Bombala and wipe out Dalgety," or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> But there is not a town in that area which will not begin to clamour to be the Capital site, and it will be entitled to consideration. We may then have eight or ten rival sites in this small area, and we shall have to fight this battle over again. </para>

                    <para>- We have had two speeches which have been principally devoted to a criticism of the site which is said to have been newly discovered on the Upper Murray, and is known in our discussion to-day as Welaregang . From the honorable member for Richmond we had a very glowing description of the beauties of that site, and some very strong reasons why it should be selected by the House; while we have had a denunciation of that site from the right honorable member for East Sydney just as strong as the panegyric uttered by the honorable member for Richmond. I am not sure which speech will best promote the chances of the site, because I think that the highest compliment has been paid to the Upper Murray site by the attention bestowed upon it by the right honorable member for East Sydney. </para>

The Upper Murray site was included within the area then selected. I regret very' much that the honorable member for Moira is not present to-night. He has worked over the Upper Murray country for the last twenty years, and there is no man in this House who is a better judge of country. He says that there is no other site which approaches that upon the Upper Murray. It is comparatively out of the way, and has been somewhat neglected because of the absence of railway communication ; but it is a very fine agricultural district, and the best large stock that comes to the Melbourne markets is sent down from that locality. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman,</inline> who, I understand, is a man of good repute, and has lived for some five or six years in the -Upper Murray country, speaks in high terms of the proposed site. </para>

                <para class="block">If honorable members desire to give all the sites fair play, they should place them upon the same footing. All the sites, with the exception of that upon the Upper Murray, have been reported upon, and therefore full particulars should be made available to us in regard to the one last suggested. The Tight honorable member for East Sydney made special reference to the question of accessibility. The proposed site on the Upper Murray- is situated only fifty miles from Germanton., and a similar distance from the Tallangatta railway line, and therefore/ it certainly cannot be regarded as inaccessible. We have been told that nothing has been heard of this site previously, but that is not correct because it has been mentioned for the last two or three years. A strong recommendation in its favour is that the land could be acquired at a comparatively small cost- at a much less cost than could the Lyndhurst area. The saving effected in this way would fully recoup the outlay involved in the construction of a line to connect the site with the existing railway systems. The right honorable gentleman said that we should have to deal with New South Wales, and he made that statement almost in the form of a threat, implying that if we did not meet the views of the representatives of- that State, we should not be able to come to any understanding. I shall be quite content to allow the matter to stand at that. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Some very flowery language has been indulged in as to where the finger of destiny is pointing. I do not know that it is pointing in the direction of Lyndhurst, of which I had never heard before it was mentioned in connexion with the selection of the Capital Site. If the right honorable member for East Sydney wants to know where the finger of destiny is pointing in Australia, I can tell him that it is directing us to the place where our silver rivers are running. That is the point at which industry, cultivation, and prosperity will reach their highest developments. The Upper -Murray area embraces the spot which the Royal Commission on Water Supply recommended as the site for the great reservoirs which will eventually prove the salvation of this country by keeping the Murray running full all the year round. One reservoir at Cumberoona, it is affirmed, will supply 180,000 cubic feet per minute all the year round. A great deal has been said regarding the aesthetic side of this question. I do not despise scenery, but I do not intend to support the selection of a site simply because it possesses that qualification. We should choose it upon business principles - because it contains good land, and is readily accessible. The report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman,</inline> if carefully considered, will show that this site is equal to any other site which has been mentioned. I trust that in the interests of all Australia the Government will defer a decision upon this matter until a thorough examination has been made of the Welaregang  site. At a later stage, I intend to move the adjournment of the debate, with a view to test the feeling of the House upon that question. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that the right honorable member for East Sydney has left the Chamber, because he devoted most of the time which he has occupied in addressing the House - and he has been talking a great' deal, in fact -we have had a perfect diarrhoea of words from him - in directing attention to myself. During the debate upon the resolutions he expressed himself in anything but reasonable, fair, or gentlemanly language, and subsequently he made what he intended to be a very severe and determined attack upon the Upper Murray site. Every one, however, must have recognised that he spoke in ' absolute ignorance. He has not visited that site, and consequently all his arguments were based upon what he has been told. Every statement that he made was absolutely without foundation. For example, when he declared that it was inaccessible, he did not know what he was talking about'. As a matter of fact the Welaregang  site is one of the easiest to reach bv rail. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will speak afterwards it will be a very great convenience to me, because the reporters cannot take down two speeches at the same time. The construction of the railway to Welaregang  is completed to Germanton, and flying surveys have been made to within thirty miles of this particular spot. The country is easy, and the cost would not be much. Indeed, it would, perhaps, be the cheapest line that could be constructed to any of the sites. </para>

                        <para>- Probably, before the debate is finished. I shall have something to say concerning the Bombala site. The length of this second projected railway would be about forty-six miles. When the Murray was crossed, difficult country would have to be covered in order to connect with the line at Tallangatta or Beechworth. If the Victorian Government desire an extension in this direction to the Murray, and thence to Tumut, so as to almost duplicate the line from Sydney, they should ascertain whether it is not possible to get a survey from Beechworth; but I believe the idea is to connect with the North-Eastern railway at Huon Lane. </para>

The upper Murray is more extensive, and Kosciusko gives added grandeur. I do not say that it is positively the best site ; and honorable members are not going to put words into my mouth, with the deliberate intention of using them against me at another time. I will do my duty. I have never been afraid to do it. The right honorable member for East Sydney said, in a glib, off-hand sort of style, that he was going to put on one side all conditions of beauty and of grandeur of scenery, and that he was going down to the bed-rock of business. </para>

                        <para>- What I meant to say was that the statements which the right honorable member for East Sydney had used, upon ' the authority of other people, are absolutely untrue, and that he should have ascertained if they were true before he used them in this House, instead of trying to influence honorable members' minds in a way that was not worthy of him. When he makes statements as to the question of scenery, and as to accessibility, based upon other people's reports, I say that he makes an unfair attack upon a particular site at the outset of a discussion which is going to last a considerable time. I repeat now what I said the other night, that the reason why I did not submit this particular site on a previous occasion, two or three years ago, was because I felt that it was so far south, and so near the Victorian border, that the Sydney people would object; and I was only induced afterwards to take any action upon it in consequence of the action taken by the honorable member for Grampians. That honorable member was very energetic in securing an extension of the territory named in the Bill dealt with last' session, so that it would include this site. I have obtained a copy of that measure, and find that it provided that'. the Federal site should be Tumut, but that the Federal territory should extend to the Murray River. That was the first occasion on which this . site was brought under th'e notice of the House. It was again brought forward by the honorable member for Grampians, with the result that the so-called picnics to which the right honorable member has unfairly referred, in terms that are most reprehensible, took place. I should like the right honorable member to put himself to some little inconvenience in order to secure more information relative to this and to other sites ; he certainly ought to do so before he speaks of the visits of inspection as picnics. He is too fond of the comforts of his own home - too fond of his own bed - to undergo the inconvenience of travelling to the various sites in order to secure that information which he really requires. It was not because Tooma is in my electorate that I joined in the request that it should be inspected. It is well known that I was very anxious last session to secure the selection of Tumut, because I believed it to be the best and most beautiful site. Now that I know that some of the other favoured sites - Bombala and Dalgety - are further south than is that advocated by the honorable member for Grampians, the objection which I had to the extension of the territory to the Murray is removed; provided, of course, that those other sites are to be considered. Tooma is more accessible than are some of the sites in the south-eastern district. It possesses one of the best climates in Australia, and comprises land which is, perhaps, unequalled in any part of the Commonwealth. There, also, are to be found the head waters of the only great river in Australia; but apart from the grandeur of the scenery - a consideration which the right honorable member has sought to belittle - there are many reasons why it should prove one of the best sites for the Capital. I did not intend to speak to-night, but, in view of the concentrated attack of the right honorable member for East Sydney, I felt that it was my duty, as the representative of the electorate which contains the site that has been so viciously attacked by him to make some reply at once and let the antidote go forth with the disease. </para>

I am assured, on the authority of a very reliable man, who is himself a pastoralist, that at one election in which he was interested, the Association engaged a special train to run from Melbourne for the purpose of conveying voters to the poll with a view to furthering the interests of the candidate who was a member of their body.

                            <para>- I regret very much that I have transgressed, but- my view was that the honorable member was not charged with want of veracity, -and that it was merely stated that what he had said was not accurate. He further proceeded to challenge me to produce the books of the association ; hut before one can be expected to do that, some definite charge should be preferred. If any definite charge is made, I am sure that it will be met, even if the production of the books is necessary. It will be remembered that this matter was dealt with when we were discussing whether organizations. having political objects should he allowed to register under the Arbitration Bill. I was satisfied at the time that the honorable member's assertions were mistaken,' and I thought it not right <inline font-style="italic">to allow</inline> his statements in regard to the Pastoralists' Associations to pass without an answer. </para>
