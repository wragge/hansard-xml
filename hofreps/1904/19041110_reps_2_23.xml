            <para>.- I would suggest to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, who I understand has charge of this matter, that this is scarcely a good opportunity for taking up a large question like this. It is a matter involving very important considerations, and I confess that I am not prepared to deal with it. Of course it would be a great convenience to honorable members if my honorable friend would state his views on the subject. It would help us if we had an opportunity of hearing him but after that my honorable friend will probably consider the propriety of adjourning the debate. I shall be only too glad to hear his views. </para>

          <para class="block">I admit that the subject is one which will require very serious consideration. It is a matter of some moment when an alteration is suggested in the mode of control of an industry, the products of which are subject to duties which yield a revenue of about &#163;1, 332,000 annually. I admit that the subject is embarrassed by several difficulties. In the first place, it is argued by many persons that this Parliament has not the power to manufacture and conduct the sale of tobacco. Upon this question, however, there is a considerable difference of opinion, and I regret that my knowledge of constitutional law is not greater. We have, however, two classes of powers conferred upon us by the Constitution, the first being those which are specifically set forth in that instrument, and the second, the powers which are necessarily implied from its wording. Under the first head, we have no power to deal with the manufacture and sale of tobacco; but I maintain that under the second head we have the fullest authority conferred upon us. In section 51, it is provided that - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">Then certain matters are enumerated. My contention that certain implied powers are conferred upon us, is supported by a number of constitutional authorities. I propose to quote from Quick and Garran&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth,</inline> the opinion expressed by Lord Carnarvon, when dealing with the Federal Constitution of Canada. That Constitution, although not the same as ours, is in many respects similar. Lord Carnarvon said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Federal Government can claim no powers not granted to it by the Constitution ; powers actually granted must be such as are given expressly or by necessary implication. The instrument is to have a reasonable construction according te the import of its terms; where a power is expressly given in general terms, it is not to be confined to particular cases, unless that construction grows out of the context or by necessary implication. The Constitution deals in general language. It does not provide for minute specifications of powers or declare the means by which those powers shall be carried into execution. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I claim that that opinion justifies the belief that in every Constitution such as ours, similar implied powers are conferred. To the words &#34; or by necessary implication,&#34; I wish to draw special attention. Upon further referring to the very useful work from which I have just quoted, I find that various other decisions have been given which have a particular bearing upon the question now under discussion. The British North America Act of 1867 gave the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada, in relation to matters not exclusively assigned to the provinces. I do not claim for a moment that we have such power without limitations. </para>

I do not wish to labour my argument upon that aspect of the question, but I would direct honorable members&#39; attention to the provision under which the Commonwealth has power to regulate trade and commerce between the Commonwealth and other countries, and amongst the States.

I contend that in view of that definition, and of the general powers given to us under the Constitution, our authority covers a very wide range in reference to all matters affecting trade and commerce, and that we have the power to regulate monopolies which have the effect of restricting the liberty of exchange between citizens in a State or between the citizens of two or more States, and at a later stage I will show where this is being done by the monopoly. I should like to have some information from the Minister of Trade and Customs with regard to the attitude which the Government are prepared to take in the event of a tobacco monopoly being proved to exist. </para>

It is very difficult to secure proofs from those who are interested in the tobacco combine in Australia that they are the only persons who are able to conduct business operations with any degree of success. I have every reason to believe that, outside one huge combination, there is only one small firm in Australia which is interested in the tobacco trade.

A few days afterwards it was announced that the amalgamated company, which was called the British-Australian Tobacco Manufacturing Company, had acquired the Australian business of T. C. Williams, of Richmond, </para>
            <para class="block">Virginia, an Americantobacco manufacturer, who had perhaps the largest sale of aromatic imported tobacco in Australia - that is, that they had acquired the sole right of distributing their tobacco. A little later the company also acquired the business of David Dunlop, who manufactured chiefly the &#34; Derby &#34; brand of tobacco, for a term of 100 years. Then it was stated in the newspapers that Kronheimer and Company, of Melbourne, distributors and importers of tobacco, and W. D. and H. O. Wills and Company, English manufacturers, had amalgamated their Australian businesses under the name of Kronheimer Limited. This firm then absorbed the business of the National Cigarette Company, and closed its factory ; and shortly afterwards was appointed the sole distributor in Australia of the goods of the American Tobacco Company which the British-Australian Tobacco Manufacturing Company had been formed to fight. About the same time Kronheimer Limited was appointed sole distributor of the States Tobacco Company, and, on retirement of Alfred Gross and Company from the Australian trade, took over that business too. Last of all, the British -Australian Tobacco Manufacturing Company, which had been formed to fight the foreign companies, appointed Kronheimer Limited sole distributor of their manufactures in Australia. </para>

            <para>The world tobacco trust, represented by the partnership between the Imperial Company and the American Tobacco Company, continues to expand. When the trust entered the cigar field in America three years ago, it acquired a large number of factories, all of which, with one exception, were north of the Potomac and east of Chicago. Recently, nearly a dozen of these factories have been closed - various reasons have been given - the truth is, it is part of a plan to transfer the manufacture of cigars to the south, where negro labour can be obtained at a very low rate - while northern factories are closing southern ones are opening. </para>

          <para class="block">Under these circumstances, it must be apparent that this combine is taking action in other parts of the world, with a view to getting the manufacture of tobacco carried on only where cheap labour is obtainable. Upon the 15th of June 1904, in an article headed the &#34; Tobacco Trust,&#34; &#34; Industrial Companies&#39; Rapid Growth,&#34; &#34;American Methods.&#34; rhe same journal shows how the trust first fought with and then amalga-. mated with all the leading British firms, the predominant British partners being W. D. Wills and H. O. Wills, Ltd. These persons are credited with being the chief partners in the British-American combine, which, to a large extent, is controlling the markets of the United States and Great Britain. I shall presently show that they also possess a very considerable financial interest in the monopoly which exists in Australia. The article continues - </para>

          <para class="block">Upon the 13th of June, 1904, after giving a history of the growth of the world&#39;s combine, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Chronicle</inline> says only in States such as France and Austria, where tobacco manufacture is a national monoply, are the operations of the trust excluded. For the purpose of illustrating the relationship which exists between the British American tobacco combine, and the monopoly which controls the trade in Australia, I have taken the trouble to obtain from the Melbourne Share Register, a list of the large shareholders in the companies carrying on operations here. Their names will indicate that they are good Australian citizens, who take a big interest in the welfare of the people of this country. Upon the 13th April, 1904, I find that the following persons held the respective shares assigned to them in the States Tobacco Company : - Louis Philip Jacobs, of St. Kilda, 28,350; E. L. Sutton, of Sydney, 11,250; C. H. Reading, of Sydney, 11,250; W. G. Shaw, 10,800; and H. R. Dixon, 9,450. In the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, which was registered on the 4th August, 1903, the share list shows that George Cameron, of Petersburg, held 17,400 shares. I ask honorable members whether upon this evidence alone we have not reasonable grounds for believing that the individuals who are interested in the tobacco trade in the United States are also interested in the combine which exists in Australia ? </para>

          <para class="block">That was undoubtedly a refusal to answer the question, which, I think, shows pretty clearly that the fight referred to in the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is merely a matter of bluff. With the exception of the small Victorian manufacturing firm of Dudgeon and Arnell, there is an absolute monopoly in the tobacco trade of Australia. Many nations which are in the van of human progress have nationalized the tobacco industry. Among them, I may mention France, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Roumania, Greece, and, latest of all, the great rising Eastern nation of Japan. In France the tobacco industry was nationalized during the seventeenth century, and it is a remarkable thing that no serious effort has yet been made to revert to the condition of affairs which existed prior to its nationalization. In 1901, the population of that country was 39,000,000 people, who had under cultivation for tobacco-leaf 44&#62;SS6 acres, from which were produced 5S&#187;9I4,i69 lbs. of leaf, or about 11 cwt. to the acre. In 1889, 20,000 hands were employed in the manufacture and distribution of tobacco there, while rn 1900 there were twenty national factories engaged1 in the manufacture, and the quantity sold reached1 the total of 84,867,235 lbs., the average price being 3s. iod. per lb., and the average consumption per inhabitant about 29 ozs., the State Treasury, after all expenses had been deducted, receiving the handsome net profit of &#163;i3&#62;215&#62;799- The revenue received from tobacco by Great Britain during the same year was only &#163;10,500,000, or about &#163;3,000,000 less, although that country has a larger, and, on the whole, a wealthier, population than that of France. </para>

              <para>- I venture to say that the percentage of women was no greater than it is in this fair country of Australia. Italy, during 1902-3, with a population of 32,961,247, produced &#163;8,405,369 worth of tobacco, the net profit for the State being &#163;6,419,237. Those figures show that the nationalization of the tobacco industry has not been attended with disastrous results to the countries which I have mentioned. In 1880, there were numerous tobacco factories in Australia, and 1,941,296 lbs. of leaf were grown. But <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> show the result of the influences at work during the past twenty-four years- </para>

              <para>- No; but things have been drifting in the direction of a combine for many years. In 1903, the production of leaf in this country was only 802,237 lbs., a falling off of about 1,140,000 lbs. There must be some pretty strong reason to account for a decline of that magnitude in twenty-four years. </para>

              <para>- There is something in the honorable member&#39;s interjection, because when the State of Victoria was offering a bonus on the production of tobacco leaf in this State, the inspectors reported that the efforts of the growers were directed to producing a heavy leaf, without much regard to quality. During  1903,  the manufactured tobacco imported into the Commonwealth amounted to  3,028,102  lbs., valued at  &#163;350,531.  Those amounts were made up in this way : Tobacco4  2,573,244  lbs., valued at  ,&#163;194,767  j cigars,  319,588  lbs., valued at  &#163;112,265;  cigarettes,  I35&#62;27&#176;  lbs., valued at  ^43,499-  During the same year,  5,163,724  lbs. of leaf were imported, valued at  &#163;233,360.  At that time there were  1,200  acres under cultivation, producing  802,237  lbs. of leaf, a great falling off when compared with the production of  1896,  when there were  5,000  acres under cultivation. </para>

              <para>- It was better than an average year ; it was a high year ; though it is impossible to get a fair average unless a long period is taken. When we find the production of tobacco leaf falling from  5,000,000  lbs. to less than  1,000,000  lbs., we cannot but conclude that there is something wrong. The inducements offered for the production of tobacco have not been such as to encourage growers to persevere in their efforts. The tobacco combines are interested in plantations in the United States and elsewhere, which are worked by black labour, and they desire to draw their main supplies from those sources rather than from local growers. </para>

          <para class="block">Almost the same may be said of Australia. The monopoly- is gradually extending its influence, and all those who are engaged in the tobacco business are absolutely frightened to speak from the fear that their means of subsistence will be taken from them. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat has spoken about the machine in politics, and he has stated that machines have no souls. I am perfectly sure that a trust, such as that which now exercises control over the tobacco industry in Australia, has absolutely no soul, and the fact that our producers and distributors are to a very large extent being victimized by the trust must cause us to indulge in the most un- satisfactory reflections.

          <para class="block">That is the position of the tobacco trade in the young, bright, and prosperous land of New&#39; Zealand. So far as the position in Australia is concerned, I claim that the tobacco trust is an octopus, which is becoming a menace to the peace, order, and good government of the (Commonwealth. I shall first of all deal with the case of the producer. I know that honorable members opposite are very much concerned about the producers, who are entitled to the fullest consideration at our hands, because they have to encounter all manner of special difficulties in carrying on their operations. They are subject to all the caprices of the seasons, which may at any moment bring ruin upon them. I, therefore, think that I shall have the sympathetic &#39;attention of honorable members- opposite when I urge that they should receive every encouragement. Something should be done to improve the conditions under which the growth of tobacco can be engaged in. As I have previously stated, the production of leaf fell away within a few years from  5,000,000  lbs. to  1,000,000  lbs., and the acreage under crop decreased from  5,000  to  1,200  acres. This was owing to the lack of a profitable market and reasonable prices. The tobacco manufacturers had the whole matter in their hands, and the growers were at their mercy- The planters had to accept the prices offered by the combine, or allow their crops to rot. We should take steps to insure a fair market for any leaf that may be produced, and we should release our growers from the control of the monopolistic combinations which are making large profits in the interests of capitalists living in Germany and America. We should take a patriotic as well as a business view of this question. Our first consideration should be for the welfare of the people who pay the taxes and help to build up the country. My honorable friends say&#39;, &#34; We have the greatest respect for you, but when it comes to a question of nationalizing industry, we must leave you.&#34; They profess the utmost friendship for the producers, but when it comes to a question of giving them a square deal and providing a market in which no favour will be shown, they will not permit the nationalization of the industry. </para>

              <para>- I have not stated what price the Government would be prepared to pay for Australian leaf, but the producers would not be under the thumb of the monopolistic combine who now pay what they like. According to the information . I have received, the combine are not giving Australian leaf a fair deal. It is asserted thai it is of inferior quality. Unfortunately I am not at liberty to disclose the name&#39; of my informant, on account of the awful consequences which might ensue to him, but I am led to believe that inferior Australian leaf is used only in the hand-made material, and that the better class of Australian leaf is mixed with American leaf, manufactured by machinery, the product being sold as American tobacco. I have been told that _ this action is being taken to discredit the Australian leaf. I now come to the position of the manufacturer. We have no reason to be proud of the conditions which exist in this industry. The workshops are certainly no better than they ought to be, and I believe are not so good as they would be if the State were controlling the industry. The honorable member for New England has interjected about the proportion of women who are employed in this trade elsewhere. Approximately,&#34;  250  females and  240  males are employed in Victoria. I am assured that the females include fifty girls who, judging by their short frocks, may be taken to be under the age of fifteen years.

              <para>- I understand not. It is another case which shows the curse of piece-work. It is generally admitted that that country is happiest in which the wife can stay at home and do the house-work, and the husband can be employed outside for reasonable hours, and at a reasonable wage. I do not think that the figures J have given can be seriously questioned, because I am assured by a senator that in the year 1902, although the exemption was fixed at &#91;he low sum of &#163;125. only one man engaged in the tobacco trade in Victoria paid income-tax. Of course I am referring to the working employes, not to the foremen or &#34;Yankee bosses.&#34; That goes to prove that the workers are engaged at a starvation rate of wages, and that we ought to take some steps to alter their conditions. Coming now &#39;to the distributor, I understand from a reliable authority that unless a man gets the permission of Kronheimer and Company, in this city, it is impossible for him to start a retail business. A man is unable to get supplies  unless he starts with the good grace of this double-headed combine. Is it right in this age that a man should have to go down on bended knee to the head of a monopolistic combination, and ask for permission to start in business? Again, a distributor has to subscribe to certain conditions which I shall quote from the circular issued by the combine. </para>

          <para class="block">Does not that interfere with our power under the Constitution to regulate trade and commerce amongst the States. Apparently that power is being usurped by this monopolistic combine, and it is time that we interfered. The position of the capitalists is quite clear. They say, &#34; If we like, we can raise the price. If you do not sell the goods at our price, you shall get no more supplies, and you must starve.&#34; Again, take the mode in which the combine conduct their business. They have dismissed their travellers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnell</inline> stated in his evidence the other day, that his firm have received numerous applications from travellers, who had been dismissed or put off by the combine during the last few months. The. monopoly has no need to send round any men to canvass for business, because when a retailer sells out he is not allowed to give an order to the other firm. He must send to the combine for fresh supplies, and, therefore, they have no need to keep travellers. The same remark applies to advertising. The combine have taken every possible step to economize the management of their huge business. Of course it is done with a view to get as much profit as possible from the customer. If we take the consumer, we find that his position is also an unsatisfactory one. I understand, from a notification which has been circulated, that after a certain date the combine will issue goods of a certain shape, size, and weight. It is to have supreme control even over the shape of the tobacco which a man may smoke. If he visits one shop in search of a certain quality of tobacco, and cannot obtain it there, he will find, upon applying at the next establishment, that it is also under the thumb of the same combine. Thus it will be seen that unless the monopolists choose to manufacture the particular class of tobacco which the consumer requires, the latter cannot obtain it, because the combine controls <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> only the manufacture of the tobacco, but also its distribution. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kronheimer</inline> has affirmed that the price of tobacco has not been raised as the result of the combination. Technically speaking, that is correct, but I am led to believe its cost was enhanced just prior to the amalgamation of the companies being effected. I would further point out that, although the price of tobacco has not been raised, the size of the plugs which are supplied to the distributors has been reduced. It is declared that that course has been adopted for the purpose of assisting the distributors. I can scarcely conceive how, unless a consumer is given so many plugs to represent a certain weight, and they do not do so, any such statement can be justified. A few years ago it was impossible to obtain more than twelve plugs of tobacco to the pound. Now, however, I understand that it is possible to obtain fifteen plugs. What can we gather from that circumstance? I recognise that it is unreasonable to expect this Committee to agree to my proposal without first entering into a full consideration of its effects from a financial stand-point. In this connexion, I regret that I am compelled to deal with my .subject after a wearisome allnight sitting.  Although I have prepared quite an array of figures relating to the financial aspect of this question, I shall epitomize the results of my research as far as possible. I find from research that the annual profit upon imported tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes within the Commonwealth would be &#163;572,029, &#163;316,439, and &#163;112,857 respectively. These sums aggregate &#163;1,001,325. The profit upon locally produced tobacco added to the foregoing amount increases the profit to &#163;2,005,758 annually. If we deduct the Excise and Customs duties now received by the Commonwealth, less 3 per cent, from the amount in order to allow for the cost of the collection of our Customs and excise duties upon tobacco, we shall derive a profit of &#163;673,454 per annum upon nationalization. These results are based upon a manufacturing price of 2s. per lb. The cost of tobacco production in France is something like 9d. per lb. The sum of is. 3d. per lb. is thus allowed to meet the different conditions which exist in Australia, where better wages are paid to the employes. As evidencing the enormous profits -which are being made in this industry by private enterprise in Australia, I may mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has stated that Messrs. Cameron Bros., of Sydney, are clearing &#163;50,000 annually. Of course I recognise that if we nationalize the industry we shall have to deduct from the amount of our profits the cost of nationalization.  1  have already pointed out that under sub-section xxxi. of section 51 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth has power to acquire all the land and buildings necessary for controlling the industry. If we assume that the resumption of the requisite land and buildings, and the purchase of machinery, would involve an. <inline font-style="italic">outlay</inline> of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000,000,</inline> it would mean - allowing for interest at 4J per cent. - that &#163;45,000 would require to be deducted from the &#163;673,454 to which I have&#39; previously alluded. The next question which will be seriously argued has reference to the Government&#39; control of the industry. I know that the assertion is frequently made that a Government cannot conduct any department of business as economically as can private enterprise. My brief experience of political life has taught me that where some departments are directly under - the thumb of the Legislature, they are not likely to be as successful as they otherwise would be. But I would point out that even in regard to its socialistic legislation, Australia has already recognised the wisdom of vesting control in many instances either in commissioners or- in boards. For instance, the control of the Public Service is in the hands of a Commissioner, and the management of the railways of the States is also undertaken by Commissioners.  1  believe that if we nationalized a huge business such as the tobacco industry, from which we receive&#39; an annual revenue of more than &#163;1,300,000, it would be incumbent upon us to remove its management from direct political control, and to vest it in a Board of Commissioners. The experience which I have gained during the last few days has shown me the absolute necessity for taking steps to deal as soon as possible with those who are termed by the Constitution our &#34; invalid and oldaged poor.&#34; The committee which is now inquiring1 into old-age pensions systems, and of which I am a member, were yes.terday informed by the Government Statist of Victoria that there are 206 charitable institutions In the State, from which 114,341 persons received out-door relief, and 70,540 indoor relief during the year. </para>

              <para>- No ; but we understood that the percentage of persons treated more than once in the year was not large. It appears that within so prosperous a State as Victoria one in every nine of the inhabitants is in receipt of aid from charitable institutions. This is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs, and the sooner the Commonwealth gets rid of the conditions and restrictions which surround the payment of the pitiful dole which is now given under the name of old-age pensions, the better it will be for the fair fame of this country. I have a great deal of material which I have not used, and I would very much have liked to address myself at length to the pension portion of this resolution, but I understand that under the rules of the House the debate must be adjourned before half-past 4 o&#39;clock. I trust, therefore, that the figures which I have presented, and the tale I have told, will be accepted by honorable members as authentic, as they are the result of considerable inquiry, and that we shall nationalize the tobacco industry, appropriatingthe profits thus Obtained inconnexion with the surplus returnable to the -States, in establishing an adequate system of old-age pensions for the support of the aged and deserving poor of the Commonwealth during their declining years. </para>

          <para>That, in order that all citizens of the Commonwealth may be placed upon an equal footing with respect to Income Tax, the Government should introduce a short Bill forthe purpose of imposing a Federal Income Tax, to apply to all persons in the Commonwealth, who, by the decision of the High Court, escape payment of State Income Tax. </para>
          <para class="block">As honorable members have been here all night, and it is only reasonable that they and the officers of the House should be allowed to obtain some rest, I shall deal with this motion as briefly as I can; but I feel it my duty to speak on it now, because I may not have another opportunity to do so this session. I do not suppose that any honorable member, or any Federal officer, desires to escape his fair share of taxation  by being treated differently from other citizens. I have the greatest confidence in the High Court, and it would be presumptuous for me as a layman to criticise its decisions. I regret that some persons, who have no more knowledge of the law than I possess, have expressed themselves in terms of uncalledfor indignation on the subject. I am satisfied that the Justices of the High Court have done their duty in interpreting the Constitution as appeared to them just and right, and I am glad that they have decided that there shall be no appeal to thePrivy Council, because the question involves the interpretation of our Constitution, which I hope will never be referred to any other tribunal than the High Court, which was established to decide such questions. It cannot be denied, however, that the judgment of the High Court on the subject under review will deprive the States of an amount of revenue which, in my  opinion, they are justly entitled to. The Prime Minister has said, in regard to the matter, that - </para>
          <para>The judgment of the High Court cannot be set aside by any authority within the Commonwealth ; nor can the Government take any action to compel observance of a law which that judgment declares to be unconstitutional and also illegal. </para>
          <para>That is not the point. Neither course need be resorted to in order to do justice. This Parliament has the power to remedy the defect of the Constitution. I feel that it is the duty of the House to exercise that powe&#39;r. We ought to resolutely set our faces against class taxation, and I believe that Ave have done so up to the present time. It is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution to discriminate between individuals, or between States. But while Federal members of Parliament and Federal officers are not liable to pay State income tax, there is a discrimination between citizens of the Commonwealth. We have two situations to consider. We have the present situation, under which, doubtless, Victoria would claim income tax on a portion of the salaries of Ministers, members, and the head-quarters staffs of the different Departments, as well as on the salaries of officers who are permanently resident here. But in the near future, when the Seat of Government is established in New South Wales, income tax will not be payable to any State on the salaries earned by the Federal officers or other persons in the Federal territory because it will not then be a portion of New South Wales. It will be seen, therefore, that in imposing an income tax this Parliament is only anticipating what will necessarily have to be done in the course of a few years. It will be quite easy for honorable&#39; members to find fault with the wording of the motion. Perhaps it may be declared by legal members to be unconstitutional to pass a law which would enable the States to collect an income tax from those officers who are now escaping payment. </para>

              <para>- It would prevent differentiation. At the present time, honorable members who represent Western Australia have not to pay income tax; but the representatives of other States are liable to pay income tax. I would suggest that this Parliament should pass a Federal income tax which would apply equitably to all persons in the Commonwealth, when it would be within the power of each State Parliament to abolish the State income tax. I would suggest &#39;the adoption of this plan, in the interests of the States, because the revenue from the Customs House is shrinking considerably, and is likely to greatly embarrass the finances of some States. If we were to impose a. Federal income tax, which would apply equitably to every citizen, we should be able to return a much larger sum to the States. </para>

              <para>- There is no obligation on the Commonwealth Government to hand back to the States more than a fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue; but up. to the present, I am glad to say that more than that proportion has been handed back. I have no doubt that precisely the same thing will be done in the future as in the past. If a Federal income tax be imposed, the States are bound to get more money returned than they are now getting. I feel quite sure that an increased revenue would not lead to any extravagance on the part of this Parliament, and that it would take into consideration the fact that States had Had to abolish their income taxes. It has also been suggested that this Parliament might pass a short Bill to enable the States to collect from members of the Federal Parliament and Federal officers the sums which are claimed under the State Acts. </para>

Another sug gestion which I discussed with an honorable member before it was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> on Tuesday, is that the Treasurer should be empowered to deduct from each salary an amount equal to the State income tax, and credit it to the State. </para>

              <para>- No. It appears to me that the whole question is bristling with difficulties, unless we adopt the direct method of imposing a Federal income tax. It is becoming quite clear that the Constitution is vexatiously vague in regard to many provisions. This particular defect in the Constitution was not pointed out by any member of the Convention, and even if it had been I suppose that it would have evoked some difference of opinion. I wish to make it clear to the country that there is no desire on the part of any honorable member - and I believe no desire on the part of public servants - to evade any form of tax which they should be called upon to pay. I understand that some honorable members paid income tax to Victoria. But it would not be right for the honorable member for Wentworth to pay income tax here, because his allowance is not earned wholly here. It was not fair on the part of Victoria to claim income tax in respect of the whole allowance. </para>

              <para>- I believe that every honorable member, although he is not willing to move for an increase, is agreed that the allowance is not sufficient ; but I do not think it ought to be increased by the adoption of this method. Whilst the temporary Seat of Government is located in Melbourne, Victoria would derive a larger share of income tax than that to which she would otherwise be entitled. During that period this city will remain the  head-quarters   of the various Federal staffs, and consequently has no right to complain if the representatives from other States pay income tax to those States. Of course, where persons receive all the advantages of citizenship, they have no right to be relieved of taxation which falls upon other citizens. Our Constitution gives an equal voice in the government of the country to every man and woman, and I am sure that they look to their representatives in the Commonwealth Parliament to remedy any injustice which may be inflicted upon the States under the provisions of that Constitution. If the House desires any steps to be taken in the direction I have indicated, it will be the duty of the Government to devise some means of solving the present difficulty. If no other course be open to them than that of the imposition of an income tax upon all the citizens of Australia, I trust that they will not hesitate to adopt it. I am sure no honorable member desires that any friction which can be avoided shall be created between the Commonwealth and the States, especially upon a matter in which the latter have a just claim. In order that we mav spare the members of our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff from any further work this afternoon, I shall content myself with submitting the motion. </para>

            <para>. - There is no doubt that this matter has excited a good deal of attention, and that, from the point of view of the States, it may perhaps justly give rise to a considerable degree of irritation. As honorable members are aware, the Premier of Victoria has addressed me upon the subject, and I have invited him to make any suggestion which occurred to him to give practical shape to his communication. However, he seems to repose such unlimited confidence in my capacity to deal with the difficulty that he proposes to leave it entirely in my hands. I am very anxious for many reasons - for great public reasons - to show by practical effort the sincerity of the desire of the Government to cultivate the most friendly relations with the States Governments, and with the people of the States in their capacity as States. I have merely to say that it will be the duty of the Government to very seriously consider this question. </para>

              <para>- In. a certain connexion I suggested that those who had made offers to pay the income tax might make them with greater confidence under the existing circumstances ; but I was then speaking with that degree of seriousness which the ludicrous suggestion which had been put forward demanded. I really do desire - and although there ha9 been no consultation upon the subject in Cabinet, I am sure that my colleagues equally share my desire - to meet any real difficulty or hardship which is entailed upon the States by the working out of our Federal Constitution. I do not wish to throw the slightest doubt upon the correctness of the judgment of the High Court. So far as the Government&#39; are concerned, we propose to accept that judgment as a correct interpretation of the Constitution. Nevertheless, I must confess that I do see ways of bringing about a practical removal of the difficulty which has arisen, if it  be  thought fit to adopt them. At this late period of the session I cannot pretend to bring  forward  a matter of that sort, but I can certainly promise that it will receive the earnest attention of the Government, and that if we arrive at a certain conclusion in reference to it, we shall deem it our duty at the beginning of next session to give effect to that decision. We cannot promise any more than that at this late period of the session. With reference to the motion of the honorable member, I think we all agree that he proposes a step which is quite impracticable. </para>

          <para>Mi. REID. - That is a much larger question than that which we were previously discussing. Under the guise of a particular hardship which has arisen, owing to a  legal decision, the honorable member suggests that we should impose a large measure of national taxation which has nothing whatever to do with that decision. I cannot credit him with adopting a very rational method of advancing a policy of that sort. If he is in favour of a national policy in regard to the imposition of an income tax, it should not be confounded with a difficulty which applies only to a small section of the community. </para>

              <para>- I wish it to be distinctly understood that my remarks do not apply to a general income tax. The difficulty which has arisen is one which affects (Commonwealth public officers, and persons engaged in the service of the Commonwealth. I confess that I do see ways of removing these hardships without in any way invading the principles of the Constitution. It is a matter which we ought fairly and seriously to consider, and I think it will be considered in that way. But with the arrears of legislation devolving upon us,  1  cannot pretend to bring forward a matter of that sort at the fag-end of the session. After the observations which I have made upon the subject, I suggest that the honorable member should withdraw the motion. </para>

              <para>- There may be a strong feeling. The effect of the decision, will, however, be very much less when the Federal Capital is established. For my own part, I have always paid income tax in Victoria during the time I have been here. At first this State levied income tax upon the whole of the emoluments of Ministers and members of the Commonwealth Parliament. Subsequently, however, the authorities altered their decision, and advised honorable members that they would be charged upon income tax only upon the salary and parliamentary allowance which they derived during the period that they were actually within Victorian territory. I should like to know if that is a reasonable way of treating Federal representatives who are compelled to come here to attend Parliament. We are here only temporarily while Parliament is in session - not as permanent residents. Certainly we have been in Melbourne a good deal longer than we hope to be in the future. For I trust that in future the sessions of Parliament will not be as long as they have hitherto been. If all the States acted in the same way as Victoria is acting, and charged Ministers and members of the Commonwealth Parliament, income tax upon their official salaries and upon their parliamentary allowances, whilst resident within their borders, a Minister or member going to Queensland, or to South Australia, or Tasmania, for a few days, would have to pay income tax upon the proportion of his salary which is earned there. The only State in which he would be exempt is Western Australia. Is that a proper proceeding for the States to adopt? In Victoria, each year I am obliged to send in a statement as to the number of days that I have been resident here, and I am charged income tax upon the amount of my parliamentary allowance during that period. I certainly think that objection should be raised to the practice of the Income Tax Department, in dealing in this miserable way with the members of the Commonwealth Parliament. Of course, my remarks have not the same force in regard to postal or other officials who are permanently resident here. But I certainly think that no attempt should be made to collect income tax from members of this Parliament while temporarily here to perform their parliamentary duties. I always entertained the impression that the High Court would decide in the way that it has done. We know very well that the property of the States cannot be taxed by the Commonwealth, nor can that of the Commonwealth be taxed by the States. There is a great  principle involved in that doctrine. If it is admitted that the States have the right to tax a Federal officer, they might impose differential taxation.. Indeed, there would then be nothing to prevent them from levying upon him a tax equal to the amount of his salary. When we consider the proposal, we cannot fail to recognise how unreasonable it is. </para>

              <para>- The more we look into this matter the more it appears to be a storm in a tea-cup. When the Fed  era! Capital is established no question of &#39;this kind can arise so far as members of Parliament and the officials attached to the central Government are concerned, and it cannot be contended that any great injury is being inflicted upon the States under present conditions. I do not think that the States are displaying a Federal spirit in attempting to levy income tax upon members of Parliament. If the States had the power to tax Federal agencies they might impose differential taxes upon members of this House and Commonwealth officials, which might deprive them of the greater part of their salaries or allowances. I do not see how any other decision could have been given by the High Court, and I think that altogether too much is being attempted to be made of the matter. </para>

            <para>- I am in entire sympathy with the motion, and I think that the difficulty which has been created by the decision of the High Court may be very easily overcome. It would be fully within the competence of this Parliament to deal with the question. We have the power to enact that our officers shall be subject to the income tax payable by the ordinary citizens of the States in which they reside. We could collect from each officer a sum equivalent to the amount of the income taxes imposed by the States, and hand it over to the States Governments. </para>

              <para>- The Commonwealth has the power to fix the salaries of its officials and to limit or reduce them in any way it thinks fit. . We could reduce the salaries by imposing an income tax upon lines similar to those adopted by the States in which the officers are residing, and hand the money over to the States in the proportions in which they were entitled to it. A small Bill containing a few clauses could be passed through this Parliament without any difficulty. I agree that it is irritating and unfair that individuals should be required to pay income tax levied in States other than those in which they are domiciled. But I think that, speaking generally, Federal officers should pay income tax according to the laws of the State in which they reside. The decision of the High Court has created a great deal of irritation against the Commonwealth, and we should endeavour to escape the difficulty created by it. The sooner we apply the remedy the better for the Federation as a whole. </para>

              <para>- I do not care what amount is involved. The question is one of principle. It was never intended that any section of  the  community should occupy the position of a favoured class. If the decision of the High Court is to hold good, we shall be transferred back to the old days of privilege. No such contingency was even dreamt of at the time of the Federal campaign. This matter is one upon which all the States are united, and I submit that the feeling of irritation which is now uppermost is . justifiable. I thoroughly believe in the preservation of States rights, and this is a matter with which I believe States rights are at stake.  I have the greatest pleasure in supporting the motion, because I think the remedy is one that can readily be applied bv this Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I cordially support the proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh. I was pleased to hear the announcement of the Prime Minister to the effect that the whole question would be looked&#39; into with a view to applying a remedy. I cannot conceive of any honorable member feeling gratified at the position which we occupy as the result of the decision of the High Court. It is an invidious one, because we are looked upon by the public as having practically exempted ourselves from the payment of taxation, whilst others, probably not so well able to pay, have to bear the burden of the expenditure incurred by the States. The amount of money involved has nothing to do with the question, which is purely one of principle. A day or two ago, I submitted a question to the Prime Minister, which I fully anticipated would elicit an announcement similar to that made by the right honorable gentleman to-day. On the former occasion, the Prime Minister seemed to think that there was no way out of the difficulty, but I am glad that he is making further inquiries. Those honorable members who so strongly advocate the application of the voluntary principle to our legislation will now have a chance of putting it to the test. If we wish, we can pay the income tax, but the States authorities have no power to compel us. When I first came into this Parliament, I paid my income tax in South Australia, which I regarded as the proper place. After the decision had been given in the Wollaston case, however, the Deputy-Commissioner of Taxation, in South Australia, told me that I would have to pay the income tax in Victoria, and I handed over the full amount demanded by the Victorian authorities. I consider that the tax should be paid by members to the States in which they reside. There is no doubt that a great deal of feeling -has been aroused by the decision of the High Court, and it is as well that this feeling should be allayed as quickly as possible, in order that the interests of the Commonwealth may not be prejudiced. The anomalies which must arise under present conditions cannot fail to give rise to great dissatisfaction. We may imagine the case of two officers working under the same roof. One may be a State officer and the other a Federal public servant, the latter receiving the larger salary. The fact of the State official being obliged to pay income tax, whilst the Federal officer is exempt, must give rise to a great deal of bad blood. That is not a fair position for officers of the Federal service, or for members of this House, to occupy. The Government should take the first opportunity to introduce some measure which will have the effect of removing the distinction which at present exists between Federal and States officers. </para>

            <para>- Whilst to some extent agreeing with the remarks of the honorable member for Hindmarsh and those who have supported him, I think that due weight has not been attached to the constitutional aspect of this question. The provisions of the Constitution form the basis of the ruling given by the High Court. They did not consider the question from the point of view of expediency, but pointed out that if the States were to be permitted to indicate what taxation should be borne by officials who were under a different Government altogether, the Constitution would be to some extent abrogated. The Constitution was framed in the anticipation that within a very short time the Parliament would meet at the Federal Capital, and that a large number of Federal officials would be established there. When that time arrives we shall be liable to any taxation that may be imposed by the Federal Government upon the residents within the Federal territory. The framers of the Constitution no doubt had this in their minds, and therefore safeguarded us against State taxation of our agencies. The present position of affairs seems to be an anomaly, and if some years are likely to elapse before the Seat of Government is established in Federal territory, there may be some fairness in the demand that a law shall be passed to extract from members of the Commonwealth Parliament and Federal officials the taxation which, but for the judgment of the High Court, they would have to pay to the Governments of the States in which they live. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and no doubt the States Treasurers will graciously accept the money. I think, however, that the High Court, in giving its judgment, had in view the time when the Commonwealth Parliament will meet at the Seat of Government in the Federal territory, and Commonwealth officers will be located there, when, of course, they will be subject to the special taxation imposed upon all residing within that territory. </para>
