          <para>- I desire, with the permission of the House, to make a personal explanation. My reason for doing so is that I do not wish that any vote which 1 may give upon a future occasion shall be taken to have been affected by the attitude of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> towards me. In a leading article that newspaper states that my appearance on the Opposition side of the Chamber would have caused intense interest had it not been for the fact that it was known that my personal disappointment because I was not included in the present Administration had been very great To prove that that statement is absolutely -incorrect, I should like to . lay a few plain facts before the House. I saw the then leader of the Opposition, the right honorable member for East Sydney, on the day after the Deakin Government were defeated, and had a little conversation with him. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for Wilmot has stated that he desires to make a personal explanation, and so long as he confines himself to that he will be in order. If I find that, as the right honorable gentleman suggests that he may do, he is wandering into. matters which are irrelevant, I shall call his attention to the fact. </para>

            <para>- I have npt the slightest intention to refer to any irrelevant matter; I merely wish to say that the result of that interview was satisfactory to me. Shortly afterwards a manifesto appeared over the names of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and the right honorable member for East Sydney, and as it did not quite correspond with what I understood to be the arrangement, it aroused certain feelings in my mind. However, the right honorable member for East Sydney was not sent for by His Excellency the Governor-General on that occasion. Time passed, and the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill was further considered. Every honorable member knows that I have from start to finish been intensely, opposed to that measure, and that I have voted against it upon every possible occasion, believing that in doing so I was acting in the best interests of the public. I acted in that way some three weeks ago. The vote was taken on a Friday, and the honorable member for Bland afterwards announced his intention to resign. On the following day, at two o'clock, before the right honorable member for East Sydney had been sent for, I wrote a letter to him, declaring my intention to take the part of an independent member. </para>

            <para>- It is no fault of mine that that letter was not placed at once in his hands. I gave it to the honorable member for Macquarie, who will bear out my statement. That was done before the right honorable gentleman had been sent for, when he could by no possibility have formed his Cabinet, and I think refutes the statement of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that I have been animated by a feeling of personal annoyance at not having been included in the Ministry. </para>

            <para>- I do take newspaper statements seriously, especially, when they appear in a journal which circulates throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and are republished in other newspapers, particularly in those of my own State. I do not think that I, or any other honorable member, should be supposed to be actuated by motives of petty jealousy in the votes which we gave. However I may vote in the future, I shall vote as conscientiously as I have done in the past. I think that the right honorable member for East Sydney and the honor able member for Macquarie will bear me out in what I have said. </para>

That measure has reached such a stage that a few hours more would have, been sufficient to finish our work in this House.

              <para>- I am speaking in the interests of Western Australia, and I do not think that I should be interrupted by members from that State. The measure was just about to be disposed of finally by this House. A very few hours' work would have attained the object that the people and the representatives of Western Australia have desired so long, and for which they have worked so arduously. What is the reason for this hurry ? Surely we might have disposed of the Bill, to which I have alluded, before the honorable member for Bland gave notice of his adverse motion, as we did in the case of the Arbitration Bill? If, of course, the debate upon the Bill were likely to occupy a week or two, political exigencies might demand that the no-confidence motion should be proceeded with. But, seeing that it was not likely that long speeches would be made, we could have finished the work to-day or to-morrow at latest, and the measure that is so important and so urgently desired in. the interests of Western Australia, of the Commonwealth, and Federation itself, would have been disposed of, so far as this House is concerned. Is it fair or reasonable that this measure should be cast aside, and its progress set back for months probably, and especially when there is no urgent reason whatever for doing so? </para>

              <para>- Will they proceed with the Arbitration Bill ? Is it fair to Western Australia that this precipitate action should be taken? Why was this notice of motion given to-day instead of tomorrow, or even next week? I should like some one to answer that question. Unless the intention was to delay the passing of the measure and, in view of the large majority by which the resolution was passed last night, I cannot believe that that was the motive - I am at a loss to account for the action of the leader of the Opposition. lean only say again that I very much regret the action which has been taken, because I conceive that it is unjustifiable, and absolutely opposed to the interests of the State I represent. A large majority of honorable members have declared themselves in favour of the proposed survey. The Bill was not likely to be the subject of any further great controversy. because honorable members had already given their decision, and we should. have disposed of it in a few hours. I am certain that the people of Western Australia will be greatly disappointed at the result, and I can only express' my astonishment that my honorable friends of the Labour Party, who have worked so hard, and are so much in sympathy with the proposal, .should have allowed the present action to be taken. The effect of our adjourning from to-day until Tuesday may have the effect of postponing the passing of the Bill for months, and will be regarded as most unfriendly by the people of the western State. </para>

I am sure that the right honorable gentleman will agree with me that in seeking to place the blame for delay upon the shoulders of the Labour Party he is doing them a grave injustice. </para>

              <para>- At this stage I merely desire to say that the action of the leader of the Opposition, in giving notice of motion at this stage, was due entirely to the attitude assumed by honorable members opposite, who are opposed to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. It was not the fault of honorable members on this side that the notice of motion was not withheld in order to allow the Bill to be passed. Some honorable members opposite threatened to block the Bill if it were brought forward. Moreover, the measure was given only the second place on the notice-paper, Supply being placed first in the order of business. Therefore, it was evidently not the intention, of the Government to permit the Bill to take first place in the consideration of honorable, members. </para>

I spent a good deal of time this morning in endeavouring to ascertain their views, and I sent word to the right honorable gentleman himself before ten o'clock to-day, asking him to ascertain how far the opponents of the measure were willing to let it go without any serious debate, resting on the vote given last night as their excuse for abstaining from anything like stone-walling tactics. </para>

              <para>- If I had been assured of that, I might have adopted a different course. I was not aware where the honorable member could be found, but I spoke to one or two. other honorable members, who did not seem inclined to waive their rights in the matter. Then, again - as has already been pointed out - the discussion of grievances and of private members' business would have occupied the House until half-past 6 o'clock this evening. I understand that there is quite a crop of grievances to be ventilated. Therefore, if any two or three honorable members had cared to talk out the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, they could easily have accomplished their design. Regarding the reasons which induced me to give notice of motion today, instead of to-morrow, I wish to say that I was aware that a large number of honorable members were leaving for the other capitals this afternoon, and I feared that if I deferred action until to-morrow, it might have been impossible to obtain a quorum, and in that way the discussion of the question of want of confidence in the Government upon Tuesday next would not have been possible. </para>

              <para>- No?, very well. However, even with this motion in the way, there is no probability that the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill will meet with any further serious delay in its passage through this House. There is a majority behind that measure, and if those who are opposed to it will, to some extent, forego their right of speech, it should not take long to dispose of it. </para>

              <para>- I will ask the right honorable member for Swan, who interjects, to remain silent for a moment. I intend to challenge him, with a view to ascertain if he has the courage of his opinions. Whether the right honorable member, who has had considerable parliamentary experience in Western Australia, entertains a different idea from mine in regard to carrying on the Government of the country, I do not know. I dare say there is a bit of the iconoclast in me as well as in the right honorable member. If he presses his objection to a division I shall vote with him. At the same time I doubt whether he will do so. I regard his action this afternoon as a little exhibition of fireworks, which is intended for advertisement purposes. Seeing that I voted for the motion relating to the survey of the Transcontinental Railway, and abstained from speaking upon it, in order' to expedite its adoption, I have a right to strongly resent his action this afternoon. </para>

            <para>- I entirely differ from the right honorable member for Swan upon this matter. I think that the country will owe a debt of gratitude to the honorable member for Bland for affording honorable members an opportunity of further considering the survey of the projected Transcontinental Railway. I am aware that at the present juncture it is impossible for me to debate that question, but I sincerely hope that the interval which will be allowed for further consideration will induce several honorable members to change the views which they now entertain. ' Owing to my position as Chairman of Committees I was debarred from speaking upon the motion under discussion yesterday, but I hope to have an opportunity of fully expressing my opinions upon the 'second reading of the Bill. I trust that when that time arrives a very much better appreciation of the difficulties which the Commonwealth is al present undergoing will be exhibited by honorable members, who. for some unaccountable reason, seem to have suddenly altered their expressed opinions upon a question which- very vitally affects the wellbeing of Australia. </para>

            <para>- It is quite evident that the last speaker is preparing for an election. Personally I think that the right honorable member for Swan should have taken exception to the action of the Prime Minister, who submitted the motion relating to the special adjournment, rather than to that of the honorable member for Bland. I rise chiefly to point out thai it is idle for him to attempt to blame the Opposition for delaying the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. Even if the honorable member for Bland had deferred giving notice of his motion until tomorrow, we should have been no further forward. </para>

              <para>- I will show that we should not. Hid the notice of motion been given to-morrow, we should presumably have passed the Bill through this House in the interim. Under ordinary circumstances it would then have 'been forwarded to the Senate, where it would have been made an Order of the Day for Tuesday next. But the moment that notice was given of a motion of want of confidence in the Government, there would have been no discussion of other business, either in this House or in the Senate. As far as I am aware the right honorable member for Swan has no reasonable ground for complaint, unless he is prepared to declare that the honorable member for Bland had no right to give notice of his motion for several weeks - until after the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill had been disposed of. </para>

When I say that I understand the Prime Minister has made a bargain with his protectionist minority, he immediately goes into convulsions of humour. It is just as well that the Government's protectionist minority should see the fun of the position, and recognise how humorous is the suggestion that the Prime Minister would keep any promise made by him in this respect. In view of the development likely to take place next week, I should like the Prime Minister to say, before the House adjourns, whether it is his intention to see that in the administration of the Departments local employment </para>

I was pointing out that just prior to the division which took place last night on the motion for an appropriation in connexion with the preliminary survey for the Transcontinental Railway, I suggested to the right honorable member for Swan that if the Bill relating to that matter were ready, the House would probably agree, as honorable members appeared to be so unanimously in favour of the motion, to pass it through all its stages that night. </para>

              <para>- A distinct threat was made by the honorable member for Moira that if the House were asked to pass the Bill through all its stages that evening we might expect a debate extending over at least two days. He threatened that he would read various reports, and do his best to obstruct the passage of the Bill. After consultation, I and some of my fellow representatives of Western Australia this morning saw the leader of the Opposition, and inquired whether, notwithstanding this threat, it was not worth while making another attempt to persuade honorable members opposite to allow the Bill to pass through all its stages this afternoon, and to postpone the notice of motion of want of confidence until to-morrow. The leader of the Opposition at once' said that if he could persuade Government supporters to adopt that course he would willingly postpone his notice of motion. 8 a 2 </para>

These loud interjections across the chamber, and the conversations which are taking place in a loud voice, render it almost impossible for the honorable member to proceed. </para>

Nothing was further from my thoughts than to suggest that they were willing parties to delaying that measure, for I know that they have always been earnest advocates of the railway. What I wished to convey was that it was their duty to have brought more influence to bear to prevent the notice of motion of want of confidence being given before that Bill had been dealt with. </para>

The Bill dealing with the survey could not have been passed through all its stages last night without the suspension of the Standing Orders. That was impossible. </para>

              <para>- Why the passing of the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie Railway Survey Bill should be postponed and ignored, when the postponement of the notice of the motion of want of confidence for probably one day would have passed the Bill, is difficult to understand. I wish to refer to a remark made, not only to-day by the leader of the Opposition, and other members of the Labour Party, but by members of the Labour Party sitting in another place, while visiting Western Australia, to the effect that I was for three years a member of the Barton and Deakin Governments, and did nothing to push forward this measure. Any one who repeats that statement grossly misrepresents my action, because no one can honestly say that I have not done all that I could to advance the project. </para>

              <para>- I am not blaming honorable members. I desire to thank them, not to blame them; but when they say that I did nothing they are very ungenerous, and are trying to injure me politically in the estimation of the people of my own State. But they cannot do it. It would take some one more powerful than the leader of the Opposition to injure me there. Still it comes with a bad grace from him to misrepresent my actions in this matter. Any representative of Western Australia who says that during the three years in which I was in office I did nothing, has a very poor knowledge of my exertions and of the trouble which I took in the matter. Do honorable members think that the Government was committed to the project, so that every speech of the Governor-General contained a reference to it, without any one urging the matter forward, and without any arguments or facts being brought to bear in regard to it? If so, they have very little knowledge of what took place. The remark of the leader of the Opposition is as incorrect as it was uncalled for; but it is only in keeping with what has been already said by. members of the Labour Party who desire to misrepresent me before the people of the western State. It has been said before, and the interjection of the member for Coolgardie might lead one to think that he holds the same view. Hitherto I was always of the opinion that he and I, and the other representatives of Western Australia, had been working together as vigorously as we could to push forward this project. My complaint is that, as the House was doing good work in passing important measures, and had nearly passed this Bill, this motion, which means a delay for an indefinite time, and perhaps other things- </para>

              <para>- The honorable member does not know me if he thinks that. I advise the honorable member to look after himself, which will probably give him quite enough to do without troubling about me. The House has been doing good work during the last few days, and it was a mistake to interrupt business by giving notice of a motion of which notice might have been given equally well one or two days later. The effect will be that the people of Western Australia will believe that there is some ulterior motive ; and the facts before us certainly make it appear that there is something behind this action of honorable members opposite. There is no reason whatever why the motion should not have been deferred for a day or two, so that we might have disposed of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, the Papua Bill, and some other measures, in the same way as the mover was careful to dispose of the Arbitration Bill, before hurriedly launching his no-confidence motion. </para>

What the honorable member for Bland said was that the right honorable member had not, during the three years that he was in the Ministry, brought the project for the construction of the Transcontinental Railway to a successful issue. The right honorable member was nob- just to the honorable member for Bland in saying that he had done nothing in the matter during the four months that he was in office. As a matter of fact, the first really practicable step taken in connexion with it was his proposal to the Premier of Western Australia, that that State should pay more than her <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> share of the loss during the first ten years. In that action, he went a long way in furthering this proposition, and to reconcile Parliament to its acceptance. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that the right honorable member really intended to be quite so unreasonable as he seemed to be, and I do regret very much that he should, at this stage, have taken the opportunity to cast reflections upon members of this party, and also to put his colleagues from Western Australia' in a false light before the people of that State. I feel sure that, upon reconsideration, he will regret having done so. As far as this matter is concerned, I can corroborate every word that was said by the honorable member for Fremantle, in regard to the efforts made during the day, to induce the Government supporters in the corner to abandon their opposition. </para>

              <para>- The fastidious conscience of the honorable member who has interjected is an annoyance to himself as well as to every one else. With reference to' the statement of the honorable and learned member for Corio, I should like to point out that the question to which he refers was put down for the 7 th September. Through some mischance, the question was not brought under my attention until the morning of the 7th. Until that moment I had not the remotest idea that such a question was upon the paper. When the House met on the 7th, I asked the honorable and learned member to postpone his question for a week. He did so, and it appears on the paper for to-day. I have the answer in my hand, and intended to read it; but, as every honorable member with any parliamentary experience is aware, the moment a notice of motion such as that of the leader of the Opposition is given it becomes impossible even to put such questions. Consequently, I was debarred by nothing for which I was responsible from answering the question to which the honorable and learned member has referred. I wish' to say that when I smiled at what the honorable and learned member said I was not smiling at the urgent necessity for the revision of the Tariff, which is now the object of interest to the Opposition, but I was smiling at the attempt to drag a rather stale red herring across the trail. I also wish to say that since the motion of which notice has been given is one which will afford every honorable member the fullest opportunity to deal with every subject of interest, the desire to commence these observations so soon' as to-day is evidence of a morbid appetite. </para>
