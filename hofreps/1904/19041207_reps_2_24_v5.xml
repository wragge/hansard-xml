I wish also to ask the right honorable gentleman whether there is any public document in his hands, or in the hands of any member &#39; of the Government, which will show the rate of wages paid in this industry in New South Wales, and in South Australia, and whether, if there is, the right honorable gentleman will have the paper laid on the table of the House. </para>

Martin, of Gawler - is affected by the fact that a portion of the wages of employe&#39;s in that factory may be represented by an interest upon profits - that the employes may be partly shareholders? </para>

                            <para>- That, naturally, was the import of the honorable member&#39;s question. What I asked was that all the circumstances connected with the tenders should be taken into consideration, particularly those under which the men had an interest in .the profits. I do not wish to infer that they receive a share of the profits, but I was counsel for them in objecting to their being compelled to take out a certain proportion of their wages in shares, and I do not wish them to be doubly penalized through loss of work caused by rejection of the tenders. </para>

But there are two of the northern ports of Queensland where the tidal conditions are such as to render it imperative that Sunday work should be done occasionally. </para>

                            <para>- When the right honorable member for Adelaide ha charge of the Customs Department he was strongly opposed to Sunday work, and would not permit it under any conditions unless it could be shown that the greatest loss and inconvenience would result from the refusal of such permission. The right honorable gentleman permitted Sunday work at the ports to which <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> have referred. I have been considering the matter ever since I came into office, and my immediate predecessor, who also went into the matter, granted the permission at one of these places, up to a certain date, and refused it at the other. After going fully into the matter, I found that the conditions were in both cases the same, that they were both tidal ports and open roadsteads, where the ships could not stay outside the harbor; also that the tidal conditions were such that they had to come in on the Sunday or pass on. </para>

                            <para>- I may say that the honorable members who represent Keppel B ay have both expressed themselves strongly in favour of granting the concession at that place. The only persons opposed to the concession were the workers at Flat Top, who do not like the idea of Sunday work. The men at these places are paid is. 3d. per hour on work days, and in granting the concession I have imposed a condition that Sunday work shall be permitted at these places only if the men employed are paid 3s. per hour. </para>

The condition I have imposed will, in my opinion, discourage Sunday work as much as possible, and on the other hand, it will compensate those who, against their wish, are required to work on that dav. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree that there is great hardship in having to keep stock on vessel&#39;s any longer than is necessary. On the other hand, I found that if we were to open the door in the way suggested the result might be to make Sunday work general. That is the report which has been submitted to me by the officers of the Department who are intimate with the conditions at these ports. Whilst I should be the last to wish to keep stock on board a vessel any longer than is absolutely necessary, I see the danger which has been brought under my notice - that the making of the concession asked for in this instance might lead to Sunday work being made general. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask the honorable gentleman whether in imposing the condition that the workers who will have to work on Sundays at &#34;Keppel Bay and Flat Top are to get 3s. per hour, he proposes to make the shipping companies- pay those men the increased rate of wages from the time they are engaged at the port or from the time they actually start work? I should explain that those who have to work in Keppel Bay are engaged in Rockhampton. The wharfs at Rockhampton are forty miles from Keppel Bay. and these men will be five hours in getting down to what the honorable gentleman refers to as &#34; the port.&#34; It will be clear that these men will lose a considerable amount of time in getting to the place at which they have to start work, and I therefore inquire whether it is the intention of the honorable gentleman to- enforce payment of the increased wages from the time the men are engaged for the work. </para>

                            <para>- I obtained the rates of pay per hour at present paid in the different ports, but the particulars I obtained did not mention when the work commenced or ceased. I increased the Sunday rate by 50 per cent. Just now, they are paying 2s. an hour for Sunday, and, I think, is. 3d. for week-day work. When I increased the Sunday pay by 50 per cent., I did not make any alteration in the hours. I do not know when the time starts, but whenever it may be there was no alteration made in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- I think I have already informed the honorable member that I was not disturbing the decision which had been come to by my predecessor, and had no intention to disturb it, unless it was shown that definite promises had been made to the divisional returning officers by those having authority to make such promises. In such cases, I think it would be only right that the honorarium which some of the officers have claimed should be paid. If evidence of such promises is given in any case. I shall act on the decision already stated. </para>

                        <para>- It would be fairer if the honorable member would give notice of a question of that kind. It is rather an important question, and one which has not been brought under my notice hitherto. I was not aware of any trouble in regard to the matter, though I know that in some cases postmasters have objected, on the score of the pressure of postal business, to transact electoral business. In such cases they have not been forced to take positions as returning officers. </para>

                    <para>- When speaking upon this subject last evening, I dealt with the right of the employes to the treatment indicated by the leader of the Opposition. I showed that it would tend to the greater security of the law if the question of competence were made a far more important factor in the decisions of the Court. I do not intend to pursue the matter at greater length. I am satisfied with the appeal which I have made to the Government to deal with the question apart from party considerations. I ask .them to consider it as a matter of equity. In my opinion, the amendment of the leader of the Opposition will make the Bill operative, although it is not all that&#93; I desire. Cannot the Prime Minister be a little more reasonable? Is it right for him to use the small majority which he has for the purpose of imposing conditions which he. must know will hamper the administration of the Bill, and certainly interfere with the effectiveness of it? I fully expected, when the amendments came down from the Senate, that they would at least receive the sympathetic consideration of the Government, and, seeing that no party issue was at stake, that the Government would desire to make the measure more practicable than it was previously. I have already quoted the opinions of men who know what they are talking about, and who have acquired their knowledge in the severest school possible, that of experience. I have also quoted the opinions of men on the judicial bench, who have had charge of the administration of similar laws in the States, and the opinions &#39;of men who have been associated with unions for a lifetime. But it seems that these appeals to the Prime Minister will be of no avail. I only know that if this clause is passed as the right honorable gentleman desires, we shall have something to regret in days to come, because, I am afraid, the Bill will prove an inoperative measure. If honorable members on this side were as determined as I am to safeguard the interests of those whom they represent, they would be prepared to fight to the end in defence of the principle at stake, and no considerations of personal convenience would be allowed to interfere. There are honorable members who may have to explain their attitude on this measure - to explain why they exhibited such apathy - if the prophecy I have just made should prove correct. I have some feeling of sympathy with honorable members opposite. I know they are anxious to return to their homes, irrespective of the legislation which they leave behind, after a long and trying session. But, as I have said, no considerations of personal convenience should be allowed to influence those on this side of the House, who feel that they have a mission and a duty to protect, at all hazards, the interests of the men and women affected by this Bill. We have been told by several honorable members that only certain unions are likely to be brought within the operation of the measure. No honorable member, however, can prophesy with accuracy what conditions may arise, if such a law be passed. There is not only a possibility, but a probability, that many of the trades and callings now followed in the States may be brought within the purview of the Bill; at any rate, there is a possibility of trade unions being brought into&#39; such contact with them as to bring them within the sphere of a Federal law of the kind. Why should we single out only one or two unions? Even if these unions represent only 8,000 or 9,000 men, we have no right to conjecture that they will be the only organizations affected. We have to provide not only for the conditions of to-day, but for conditions which may arise hereafter. It appears to me, however, that there is an anxiety to place on the Statute-book of the Commonwealth an impracticable piece of legislation. The Prime Minister now has an opportunity to associate his name with legislation which &#39;would be welcomed with pleasure by generations unborn; yet with all his aspirations and ability, he is not prepared to wrest himself from the trammels of the organization which seems to most influence him at the present time. Surely the Prime Minister has had sufficient experience in passing legislation to know that it is not always a commendation to have one&#39;s name associated with a particular measure. Many laws have been passed in the States which reflect not credit, but, very often, grave discredit on the framers, who are thus proved to have been utterly unfitted for the work they undertook. There is not the slightest doubt that this clause contains the main point of the Bill, and unless the provision be passed in accordance with the wishes of honorable members on this side4 all the other clauses, however professedly libera&#93; they may be, will prove absolutely inoperative. This clause is undoubtedly the main-spring of the Bill ; and it is of no use the Prime Minister endeavouring to close his eyes to the fact by stating that he is looking after the interests of the community - that his heart is bleeding for the non-unionists who will be left out in the cold. No explanation will avail the right honorable gentleman, if, in the future, it should&#39; be found that unionism is decaying for want of an incentive. Of course, we know that by that time the Prime Minister may be placed comfortably in some judgment seat - that he may have passed away from the troubled sphere of politics. That is an unfortunate feature of our legislation as conducted by the politicians of to-day. Those politicians carry no responsibility beyond a certain date ; t they are here to-day, on the highest pinnacle at which their ambition has aimed, and to-morrow they take liberties with legislation which they have hitherto advocated. They feel that, come what may, they will be safe in some haven, comfortably sheltered from all political warfare. When this Government was formed I thought we were in a very happy position, inasmuch as, if we could not get a reply from one half of the Prime Minister, we should be able to get one from his other half; but I find that I was deluded in that expectation. The Minister of Customs is &#34;equal in all things&#34; with the Prime Minister in th&#39;is double-headed Government ; but from the former we only get an echo of the latter gentleman, who is practically conducting the business of the House. The Minister of Trade and Customs, as a prominent State politician, has advocated legislation representing a marked advance on that which prevailed prior to his attaining office; and if I thought that that gentleman was actuated by sincerity - by a high personal ambition to protect the interests of those who are contemplated by such legislation - and not by political necessity, I should have no hesitation in appealing to him. But there are professed democrats who have deluded the&#39; people into the belief that the legislation they favoured was in the interests of unionists and toilers generally, and we appeal in vain to the Government, on the ground of logic, common sense, or experience. The Government will not advance one inch towards a compromise. The Minister of Defence is probably capable &#39;of constructing a subtle amendment for a particular purpose; but surely the Prime Minister is not going to tie himself to an amendment framed by a gentleman who has had no practical experience in industrial matters. I can not think that the Government intend to adhere to this amendment simply because it has been prepared bv the Minister of Defence, especially when men with fifty times the experience of that gentleman can prove that the provision would be injurious in its operation. Practical men, having regard to the antecedents of the Minister of Defence - practical men who take an unbiased view of the history of that gentleman </para>

                        <para>- I am not complaining. I have too big a case to fight to permit my personal feelings to have play. A man can rise superior to that consideration when he is fighting for the rights and liberties of thousands of workers in the Commonwealth, who are anxiously waiting to see whether this Parliament is prepared to put fetters upon them. In Sydney, the other day, an organization unanimously passed a resolution appealing to this Parliament to prevent this class of legislation from being passed. We have the great unions of the Commonwealth appealing to honorable members to prevent the enactment of the very provision we are now seeking to modify. Whilst I hear these legitimate appeals from the workers through their organizations, I have something more to interest me than the mere question whether I am technically out of order. I am always desirous of keeping in order if possible, and if I do err, sir, it should be remembered that it is only human to err. I was dealing with the amendment which the leader of the Opposition has moved, not as an indication of what we should like, but as an alternative to that for which the Government contend. We are not now debating the question as to whether this legislation as proposed is what we desire to be enacted. We are prepared to come to a compromise. We are prepared to abandon our ideal for a time, and endeavour to meet the Government half-way, but they are not willing to budge an inch from their position. The clause before the Committee has been mainly responsible for- the wrecking of three Governments. For nine months the Parliament has been practically engaged upon this measure. What has it produced? If it were producing a practicable measure I. should have no objection to remaining here for another period of nine months, or longer if necessary. The successful operation of the Bill will depend upon this clause. Some honorable members seem to think that it ought to be . passed1 with &#39; the same speed as a mere machinery clause or a clause dealing with regulations. But the provisions which have been embodied in the clause since it was introduced have practically cut the heart out of the measure. Apparently, honorable members on the other side wish to. place on the Statute-book a law which will be inoperative and unnecessary, or they are trying to make the people believe that they are endeavouring to honestly legislate for the removal of those labour difficulties which always arise in a new country. For the settlement of industrial disputes we have adopted a method which is not yet known outside the Southern Hemisphere. We are seeking to place on the Statute-book a law which will be an example to the rest of the world. In New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia the law contains a provision largely similar to the amendment which has been moved by the leader of the Opposition. No unbiased man can say that in any of those three countries the law has not been a blessing, not only to the employes, but also to the employers. On the one side, it has secured continuity of employment, and on .the other side it has given security to capital. By granting preference to unionists in the measure, we should not only secure the rights of the employes, but also preserve indirectly the rights of <inline font-style="italic">bond -fide</inline> employers who are trying to do their best to develop the industries of the Commonwealth. We cannot, therefore, be charged with acting from a selfish stand-point. Although it has been made apparent that each side objects to the clause, the Government are nevertheless prepared to force upon them this objectionable legislation. I do not say that the attitude which has been taken up by the leader of the Opposition is the best one in the interests of the Bill. What I contend is that when neither employers nor employe&#39;s desire the Bill to be placed upon the Statute-book, a compromise could be arrived at. The Prime Minister could reasonably say to us, &#34; If you are prepared to strike off all the conditions which have been stipulated during the last nine months, I am prepared to allow the Court to judge . from the evidence the wisdom or otherwise of granting preference.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I do not care from what quarter an amendment may come, so long as it is likely to have a beneficial effect, and its mover is sincere. I am technically out of order in answering interjections ; but it is rather amusing for the honorable member for Lang to ask me to take him as a guide in dealing with this class of legislation. It would be ridiculous to attempt to place upon the Statute-book a law which experience teaches us would only be a delusion and a snare, and I feel that I have_ a right to stand here as long as my physical powers will permit in order to oppose such a proposal, but as I do not wish to repeat the remarks I made yesterday, I desire to have an opportunity of looking through the proofs of my speech. Therefore I shall postpone any further observations for the present in order that I may safeguard myself against repetitions, and also prepare other matter of special interest, which I desire to lay before the Committee. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland throws us back to the position we occupied before the Bill was forwarded to the Senate, and I regret that it should have become necessary for us to go over the old ground again. The present trouble seems to arise from the fact that whilst honorable members on ..this sidle of the Chamber propose to give definite directions to the Court, honorable members opposite wish to leave the Court to practically make a law for itself. We think that the Court might by reasonable means - without taking a poll of those engaged in the industry, or insisting upon absolute proof - very easily satisfy itself as to the side upon which the majority lies. Under the Government proposal, a clear and distinct issue would be placed before the Court, but the amendment of the honorable member for Bland would, by the introduction of the qualifying word &#34;substantially&#34; leave it to the Court to make a law for itself. One Judge might say that 10 per cent, of those engaged in an industry constituted a substantial number, whilst others might insist upon a larger percentage being shown. The leader of the Opposition has. stated that he desires that a substantial number shall really be a majority, but his intention is not definitely expressed by the amendment. It has been strongly contended that it would be impossible for the unions, without a great deal of trouble, to show that they represented an absolute majority of those affected. I do not, however, anticipate any trouble on &#39;.that score, because I assume that the Judge would take it for granted that all in the claimant union were in favour of preference. Statistics as to the number of persons engaged in any particular industry would be available, and upon these the opponents of preference would have to rely. Therefore, their case would probably be weaker than that which could be presented by the applicants for preference. If the leader of the Opposition is ready to admit that a substantial number of those affected by an award would really represent a majority, or almost a majority, it would be as difficult for applicants for preference to establish the fact that they substantially represented those affected as it would be for them to demonstrate that they represented an actual majority. </para>

                        <para>- My objection is that the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland would leave it open to the Court to make a law for itself, whereas, in my opinion? the Court should merely administer the law. As I have said, it would be as difficult to arrive at a decision as to whether the applicants substantially represented those affected as it would be to prove that they represented a majority. The Government do not intend that there should be absolute proof with regard to that majority, but that we should trust the Court to satisfy itself upon that point. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Gwydir and the honorable member for Grey have made certain references to myself, which I do not feel inclined to allow to pass unchallenged - although I have made denials previously. It has been stated by the honorable member for Gwydir that I have declared myself opposed to this Bill, lock, stock, and barrel. That is an absolute misrepresentation of the facts, because I have never so declared myself. I have, on the contrary, taken particular pains to explain that I am not opposed to the Bill, but to certain provisions, which I regard as objectionable. The honorable member for Grey states that I had declared that my object in supporting the Bill was merely to wreck the late Government. I never declared that to be my object, and that was not my object. The measure has not been used for that purpose, so far as I am concerned. Therefore, the honorable member had absolutely no justification for attributing any such motive to me. The vote to which the honorable member evidently refers, which helped to wreck the Deakin Government, was upon an amendment to include the public servants of the States - simply a detail of one clause of the Bill. It did not affect the Bill as a whole. </para>

                    <para>- I desire merely to point out very briefly indeed the reasons why I cannot accept the Government&#39;s proposal, and why I prefer the amendment proposed by .the honorable member for Bland. Something very much more important than the mere difference of words distinguishes the respective attitudes assumed by the two parties in this Chamber. I wish to give one concrete example - because, after all, an ounce of practice is worth a ton .of theory - which came under my notice in the Arbitration Court of New South Wales only three weeks ago, to show that there is a fundamental difference between the proviso and the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland. The Trolleymen Draymen, and Carters&#39; Union, of which some mention has already been made in this Chamber, is one of considerable strength, numbering some 1,200 members. In connexion with a dispute which was submitted to the Arbitration Court for settlement, the union sought for preference for its members, and the employers endeavoured to show that the majority of those engaged in that calling were not members of the union. They did not succeed in this, and it was established that the majority of those in the employment of the respondent association were members of the union. I pointed out to the Court, however, that the union did not embrace anything like a majority of the persons engaged in the industry affected, or actually engaged in industries cognate to that of the Carters&#39; Union. There are 1,200 persons in the union, whilst there are at the very least 3,000 persons engaged in driving vehicles in the streets of Sydney. I have no doubt there are very many more than 3,000, but I adopt that estimate because its correctness may be established by the most cursory inspection of the traffic. If we had had to show that we as a union represented a majority of those engaged in the industry, to say nothing of those affected by it, we&#39; should have utterly failed. We should not have been able to obtain preference, and, if that had been denied, the award would have been, of no service. If, by reason of the decisions given previously, we had not been quite certain that we should obtain preference we should never have gone to the Court, but might have decided upon action which, if taken, might have involved those in commercial circles in very great loss. We should have settled the matter very speedily one way or the other by refusing to work. Here, then, is one of the strongest unions in New South Wales which would, under such a provision as the Government favour, have failed to make good its claim for preference. The provision for preference is the basis of the measure ; without it no unions will register ; and, unless the unions did register, the Bill would become a dead letter. Therefore, I shall oppose the passing of the Bill if it embodies this obnoxious provision, and I shall throw upon the shoulders of those who approve of the provision - some of them doctrinaires who believe in what they say, some of them (bitter opponents of the Bill, and some of them indifferent to anything but getting into recess - the responsibility of defeating the object of the measure, and rendering it absolutely useless. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>
                    COOK (Parramatta).I have listened again to the case which the honorable and learned member for West Sydney has placed before the Committee. An unfortunate feature of the arguments of the opponents of the proviso is that every case which they have cited, apart from that of the Shearers&#39; Union, is one which can. by no possibility come before the Court. It is impossible to conceive of a trolley and draymen&#39;s strike extending over the whole of Australia. Where is the sense in quoting a case which, would have point enough in its application to a State arbitration law, but which can have no point whatever in relation to a Commonwealth law? That is my answer to the honorable and learned member. He declares that an ounce of fact is worth a ton of theory. So it is if it has any relevancy at all to the case which we are considering. The fact is that it is almost impossible to conceive of a trolley and draymen&#39;s strike extending beyond the confines of any one State, and therefore, his argument completely falls to the ground. Honorable members upon this side of the Chamber are opposing the amendment of the leader of the Opposition for various reasons. My reason for doing so is that in its application to any organized union - to any case which we can conceive will come under the operation of this Bill - there is no practical difference between it and the proposal of the Minister of Defence. The leader of the Opposition himself has repeatedly stated that there is no practical difference between the two proposals, and that in the working of the measure there will be no practical difference so far as the principle of majority rule is concerned. He has repeatedly affirmed that he does not desire to obtain a preference for minorities. He has said that any Judge would interpret his proposal to mean that a majority of those engaged in any industry affected by an award must first approve of a preference being granted, and he wishes it to be interpreted in no other way. That has been stated by him time and again. For the very reason which he has assigned) and knowing it to be the practical truth of the matter, I say that the proposal of the Minister of Defence, which is embodied in the Bill, and the amendment submitted by the leader of the Opposition, are practically identical, the only difference between them being that the provision already contained in the measure is a very much plainer and more straightforward statement of the position. I shall, therefore, oppose the amendment, inasmuch as it constitutes a more difficult and indefinite way of stating the same facts.

That Government were endeavouring To bring under the notice. of the Committee a certain .amendment when they were defeated, as the result of a very ingenious flank movement on the part of the Minister of Defence. So that two Ministries have already been sacrificed ostensibly upon the altar of this measure, and the probability is that a third will be sacrificed if it is disposed to make it vital to its existence. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is entirely in the hands of the Ministry. If they wish to make the question a vital one, they are as much entitled to do so as were their predecessors. I do not know that any complaint could be urged if they decided to make it vital. An attempt has been made to show that there is practically no difference between the proposal of the Government and that of the leader of the Opposition - that, in the actual operation of this legislation, they would prove almost identical. That is the view entertained by the honorable member for Parramatta- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member&#39;s knowledge of the industrial side of this question ought to entitle him to express an opinion upon it. If there be no difference between the two proposals, what is .the reason for all this wrangling and fighting? Why do the Government attach so much importance to the words which are already embodied in the Bill ? We are now being asked to consider, not a decision of this Committee, but a decision of the other branch of the Legislature. That Chamber has thought it advisable to disagree with the wording of the clause under consideration in the form in which it left this Committee, and has asked that other words may be inserted. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the leader of the Opposition will admit that. He prefers the Senate&#39;s amendment to the provision inserted in the Bill by this Committee. Failing to secure the adoption of the former, he desires to bring the measure more into line with the views of the Senate upon this particular matter. I entirely differ from those who urge that the proposal of the Minister of Defence as embodied in the Bill, and the amendment of the leader of the Opposition, are practically identical. </para>

                        <para>- I think that there is a substantial difference between the two proposals. I would, also point out that that view is shared by competent legal authorities, and also by those who are engaged in industrialism, who take a leading part in the unionist movement, and whose opinions are valued by large bodies of organized labour. I am glad to find that the Prime Minister recognises that there is a difference between the two proposals. The Committee will not be misled, therefore, into supposing that no difference exists, and subsequently express disappointment when they learn - as the result of the decision of the Arbitration Court - that they have misconceived the position. I desire to make a short quotation from a gentleman who, it will be admitted, is an authority upon this point. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. Wise, who is the author of the New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of the 29th October last contains a very able article written by him, entitled &#34; Compulsory Arbitration, How it has worked in New South Wales, Preference to unionists absolutely necessary.&#34; I do not propose to quote extensively from this article, but I wish rather to direct particular attention to a paragraph relating to the very matter which is now under consideration. Under the heading of &#34; What McCay&#39;s amendment meant,&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> puts the position thus : - </para>

Nor do I know of any one who has had any experience in the practice of the Court who does not admit that the insertion of such an amendment would make the preference clause a dead letter. </para>

I did not happen to be present in the Chamber when the honorable and learned member for West Sydney was addressing himself to this question, but I understand, from the reply of the honorable member for Parramatta, that he instanced the case of the trolley and draymen in this connexion. In the opinion of the honorable member for Parramatta, that case did not apply to the present Bill, inasmuch as he declares that the industry represented by that union is not likely to come under its operation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it is. The probability of such a thing is certainly remote, but the honorable member must recollect that there are unions of that character throughout the various States, and. consequently, it is quite possible that a difficulty may unexpectedly arise which may affect the interests of that industry in more than one State. That, however, is a matter of surmise. In the article to which I have referred <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> deals with another industry, namely, that which is represented by the Amalgamated Engineers&#39; Union. He points out that that union represents an industry which requires a considerable amount of theoretical, ns well as practical, study upon the part of its members. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the association embraces both marine and land engineers; but I cannot speak authoritatively on the point. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> points out that the members of the Amalgamated Engineers&#39; Association require considerable theoretical, as well as practical, knowledge, and that, for that reason, the union is a highly organized one. On the other hand, there are many men, outside the union, employed for the most part as engine-drivers in the industry which it represents, but who have no such qualification. About six years ago, the present Prime Minister introduced a Bill in the Legislature of New South Wales which related to -engineers, and more particularly to those in charge of mining machinery. Prior to that there was no State legislation dealing with the matter, and any man who, by .working as a fireman, had obtained a slight knowledge of machinery, was entitled to take charge of an engine if he could find an employer ready to trust him with one. Such men lacked expert knowledge ; they were a menace to those engaged in the works in which they were employed, and the Bill was, therefore, introduced in the interest of human life. A number of accident&#39;s directly traceable to insufficient knowledge on the part of those placed in charge of engines and machinery had occurred, and the Bill was consequently introduced to regulate the industry. It provided that if a man could show that at the time of the passing of the Act he had a practical knowledge of machinery, he should receive a certificate entitling him to engage in this occupation. Failing this, he had to pass a fairly stiff examination to prove his fitness for the work, and, on doing so, received a certificate without which he could not Tie employed as an engineer. As the result of this legislation a number of men who, up to that time, had been in charge of machinery, employed more particularly in mining operations, were deprived of this means of employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> points out that a similar course has been followed in some of the other States, and he shows that while the Amalgamated Engineers&#39; Association represents the competent men of the industry, there are many men in charge of engines and machinery who -do not possess the same qualifications. </para>

                        <para>- Until the passing of the measure to which I have referred, they were able to do so. That Act, however, excluded them, and a considerable number of those previously engaged in the industry were registered under it, although they could not pass the special examination as to fitness. We are legi&#39;slating now, not for New South Wales, but for the whole Commonwealth, and we must bear in mind that the conditions vary considerably in the several States. The regulations in some of the States are perhaps more stringent than are those prevailing in New South Wales, while in others we have a state of affairs similar to that which we had in New South Wales prior to the passing of the legislation I have mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> points out that under this Bill, members of the Association applying for preference might be met with the opposition of men who were not equally qualified, and who rightly believed that if the concession were granted, their opportunities for employment would be curtailed. The mere fact of their opposition would throw upon the Association the onus of proving that they represented a majority not merely &#39; of the most competent men in the industry, but of those actually engaged in it. The leader of the Opposition, and those who agree with him in opposing the Government proposition recognise the difficulty, if not the injustice, of throwing upon such a body of workers the onus of proving not merely that the majority of the members of their union are in favour of preference, but that their application has the approval of a majority of those engaged in .the industry, including many with whom they are not in touch, and whose opinions it would be practically impossible to ascertain. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> says - </para>

It requires &#39; that character, ability, and skill, when they exist in a trade union, should be recognised by the Court, and have due weight given to them. In fact, the practice of the Court of New South Wales has been only to grant preference in cases where the conditions stated in

It is the opinion of a gentleman who not only holds a very high position in the legal profession in New South Wales, but is specially qualified to deal with the subject from the industrial stand-point, by reason of his close study of, and his association with, a similar piece of legislation now in operation in that State.

                        <para>- I belong to the race from which the right honorable gentleman springs, and which has always been noted for being pretty strong at the finish - especially if the fight be a losing one. I do not wish, however, to unduly take up the time of the Committee. I cannot complain of the attitude of those who openly assert that they are opposed to legislation of this character, and are anxious to render it as futile as possible. THey have clearly indicated their position, and I have no hostile feeling towards them. They are entitled to hold the opinion that the measure is undesirable just as I am entitled to believe that it will tend to solve the labour problems which we have to face. But the point which I wish to emphasize is that those who desire to make this legislation as effective as possible, and who contend that there is no real difference between the Government proposal and that put forward by the Opposition should ask themselves which of the two would go furthest in the direction of making the measure a workable one. If they believe, after careful consideration, that the Government proposal is right, we cannot quarrel with them, but if, on the other hand, we can show - as I think we have done - that the Government proposal does not go so far in that direction as would the Senate&#39;s amendment or the modification of it proposed by the leader of the Opposition, that fact should have some weight with them. I have to make a choice between the two propositions, and, as the result of careful consideration, I have decided that the Senate&#39;s amendment or the modification of it proposed by the leader of the Opposition, would do more to make this a workable measure, acceptable to industrialism, than would the Government proposition. I am supported in the view I take not only by legal authority, but practically by universal industrial authority, which ought to be competent to express a sound opinion on the point. That being 50, I shall vote as before to secure a modification of the clause as favoured by the Government. So far, I have not taken up an attitude of hostility to the Bill as it stands. I recognise that concessions have to be made, and that it is impossible for an honorable member to secure the passing of a measure which carries out to the full all that he thinks desirable. Even a Minister charged with the duty of drafting an important measure generally finds on submitting it to the House that he cannot carry it in the form in which he thinks it should be placed on the Statute-book. He has to make concessions. I have not assumed an attitude of direct hostility to this proposal. Failing to obtain what I wish to obtain, I have endeavoured to have the proviso amended so as to meet my wishes as nearly as possible, and I express my regret that my efforts in this direction, and the efforts of those associated with me, have met with so little success. I trust that as these are vital matters, the Committee will even now see its way to make concessions, not only to those who in this Chamber are opposed to this proviso, but to members of the other House, whose opinions should obtain some consideration at our hands. I appeal to those who are favorable to legislation of this character, and who wish to make the Bill effective, to seriously regard the position placed before them by the Senate, the leader of the Opposition, and those who support him, and the representatives of industrialism outside. </para>

                    <para>- While the honorable member for Gwydir was speaking, he referred to the attitude of the honorable member for Lang in regard to this matter generally. I interjected that the position of the honorable member for Lang was clear, because he had supported the measure in order to defeat the Deakin Government. The honorable member, later on,, made a personal explanation denying the accuracy of my statement. I wish, therefore, to quote the following extract from a speech delivered by him earlier in the session, and reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> on page1174:- </para>

                    <para>To my mind, the crux of the present position is, not whether the employes of the States or the railway servants shall be included within the operation of this Bill, but whether a Ministry, which is responsible for the mischievous legislation from which we have suffered during the past two or three years should be permitted to continue to occupy the Treasury bench. I believe that that is the only consideration which will influence a great many honorable members on this side of the House in voting on this amendment, it is our duty to turn the present Government out of office at the earliest possible opportunity. I am pledged to that course. I only regret that I cannot make use of a weapon which would be more congenial to my taste. However, in political warfare, we are not always able to exercise a choice as to the weapons which we shall employ. Recognising the injury which the Government are doing to the prestige of Australia, I cannot reconcile it with my conscience to vote in such a way as will continue them in office f ot one moment longer than is absolutely necessary. My only hope is that, as the result of the division, changes will be brought about in the near future that will lead to a Government taking office that will be more in accordance with our ideas of the basic principles of democracy. We wish to see government of the people for the people by the people, and I hope that we shall have a Government commanding a majority that will enable it, without any coercion on the part of a third party - no matter what that party may be - to carry on the affairs of the country in an effective manner. It is because I desire to bring about such a change that I, for one, am not prepared to do anything to assist the present Government to remain in possession of the Treasury bench. </para>

                        <para>- -Yes, but the passage which I have quoted - and I made a lengthy citation in order that I might not be accused of unfairly representing the honorable member - shows that he has supported the Bill in order to defeat the Deakin Government. I have a decided objection to the proviso which the Senate wish to omit. As I explained to .the Minister of Deft nee last week, there are, to my mind, two serious questions involved. My first difficulty is in regard to the word &#34; application.&#34; On two or three occasions, when I held office in connexion with the Shearers&#39; Union, it would have been absolutely impossible to put into effect the requirement of the proviso in regard to the making of an application - cases in which, within a few weeks, and sometimes within a few days, after the men had started out to their work in different parts of the Commonwealth, the employers decided to reduce the rates of wage. In one case a reduction, where men found themselves, from 20s. to 18s. was proposed. In all cases the executives of organizations try, as far as possible, to obtain the opinions of their members before taking any course, but there are occasions when an executive cannot do this, and even the secretary has sometimes to act without consulting his local committee. In such cases, how could a majority of the union indorse an application? </para>

The proposal of the leader of the Opposition to substitute the words &#34;substantially in number and competence&#34; does not meet with my approval. It is true that the Arbitration Courts of New Zealand and New South Wales have, in nearly every case, considered the competence and numbers of those represented in an application, but I should like , to see the Bill passed without this limitation, so that the Court might exercise its own discretion, and give a decision in accordance with equity and good conscience. </para>

                        <para>- That will not suit me. If the amendment of the leader of the Opposition is agreed . to, the Court will be compelled to act on the lines laid down. Of course, there have been, and always will be, complaints about the decisions of the Court, no matter what we may provide. Persons will apply for preference or concessions, and will be discontented if they are refused. In New South Wales and New Zealand, however, there have been very few complaints from the organizations of employe&#39;s, though a good many complaints by employers have been published in the newspapers. I support the amendment of the honorable member for Bland only on the ground that it is in accordance with the practice of the Arbitration Courts in New Zealand and New South Wales. I should have much preferred to leave the Court untrammelled by any limitations or suggestions. No one is more anxious than I am to have this matter settled, but my principal concern at present is to prevent the Bill from being converted into a machine for inflicting injury upon unionists, and into an instrument of tyranny. Those who have taken an interest in the trade union movement must know that from the very earliest period it has involved great sacrifices on the part of those who have been prominently identified with it, and that it has, at the same time, accomplished great good. The unionists are now being asked to give up the only weapon which they have been able to use effectively in the past - sometimes at great cost to themselves. The danger is that upon surrendering their present rights and liberties they will receive in exchange something that would be much less effective as a means of protection. As a matter of fact, apart from legislation of this kind, they have nothing to fear. Their forces were never more effectively organized than at present, and they could employ their old methods with greater advantage than ever before. They recognise, however, that strikes afford only a barbarous means of settling disputes, and that they involve in suffering and loss large numbers of persons who are in no way connected with the disputes. Therefore, they are prepared to accept a measure such as that now before us, so long as adequate provision is made for their protection. I am disappointed that the Prime Minister should have thought it necessary to so strictly adhere to the proviso. It cannot be contended that the language which the Government &#39;have adopted is so perfect that it could not be improved. </para>

                        <para>- The Court might recognise the difficulties which beset a large union in obtaining evidence which would establish its claim to represent a majority of those affected by a dispute, but it would be hampered in giving a decision upon what it might regard as the merits of the case. Surely we are justified in assuming that the Court will be a competent tribunal, and such as we could trust. Do honorable members for a moment suppose that the Court would grant preference to a few trades unionists, to the prejudice of several hundreds of persons outside the union, unless there were some special reason for doing so? If 100 constituted a majority of the persons affected, and the applicants could prove that they represented only 99 persons, the Court would be prevented from granting them preference. The same arbitrary distinction would be made in the case of non-unionists, who might be opposing preference. It is not to be supposed, for a moment, that the Court would grant preference, even to a majority, if it were shown that injury would be inflicted upon a large number of other men. I believe that in every case the Court would, if untrammelled, give a decision upon the merits. Why should we not instruct the High Court ? &#39; </para>

                        <para>- My feeling is that the Bill, if carried in the form approved by the Government, will give satisfaction to no one. In view of the fact that the alteration of the measure no longer involves the fate of a Ministry, honorable members ought to direct their best energies to making it workable. Up to the present time we have not had the slightest evidence of any such inclination on the part of honorable members opposite. They say that the proviso is perfect. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment of the honorable member for Bland is not merely a verbal alteration, but recognises an element which is entirely ignored by the proviso as it stands. It provides for the substantial representation in numbers and competence of those engaged in an industry. </para>

                        <para>- Because in some cases it is very difficult to prove that the applicants represent a majority. I fail to see the importance of the provision for the representation of majorities. Where do the elements of equity and good conscience come in, if the &#39;Court is to be restricted in the way proposed? It seems useless to argue further. The amendment apparently is, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, unalterable. It is the embodiment of the wisdom of honorable members opposite, and, therefore, cannot be wrong. The opinions of those who have been associated with trade unions almost from their youth go for nothing. </para>

Obviously, some honorable members wish to utilize this Bill as a piece of legislative machinery to destroy the political aspect of trade unions. That is their object. I appeal to the honorable and learned member for Wannon to say whether he does not believe that the measure will cripple the political character of those organizations ? </para>

If the honorable memberforParramatta were upon this side of the Chamber, and another Government attempted to deprive unionists of a preference, he, as a. unionist of many years&#39; standing, would take up a very different position. When he talks about coercion, I ask him to remember that he himself has stood upon the shaft-top of a coal mine, and refused to allow men to go below until they had become unionists. </para>

                        <para>- For over ten years in this State, whilst I was engaged working in the mines, no man was permitted to go below unless he were a unionist. Yet we are now asked to sacrifice all the rights which unions have hitherto enjoyed upon the altar of a measure which is ostensibly introduced to benefit those organizations. I say that in the absence of a Bill of this description trade unions have nothing to fear. In spite of opposition of the character offered to them by the &#39;honorable and learned member for Wannon and others who would have crushed these organizations if it were possible to do so, they succeeded in making wily politicians bend to their will long before there was any Labour Party or any Political Labour Leagues in existence. </para>

                        <para>- It is very difficult to discriminate. When I used that term I meant that every reform movement has its origin outside of Parliament. I have never known any legislation to be enacted which had its origin within the walls of Parliament. I did not use the term &#34; wily &#34; in any offensive way. We know that at the last election the present leader of the Government &#39; went before the electors upon a certain issue. He thought that it was wise for him to raise that issue. The leader of the Deakin Administration, however, said in effect, &#34; No, we intend to make fiscal peace the issue at the elections.&#34; Similarly to a great extent all Members of Parliament are compelled to pay attention to which way the wind is blowing. I intend to support the amendment, although I am not at all enamoured of it, and would much prefer to leave the Arbitration Court unfettered in the exercise of its discretion. </para>

That amendment had not then been thought of.

                    <para>On the merits of the proposed amendments, I have, so far, an open mind. I mention these matters to show that there is no justification whatever for the feverish haste that has been displayed in pressing forward a measure of this character at the beginning of a session which might have been devoted to useful legislation. The Government, however, are entirely responsible for that, and for any consequences which may follow their act. To my mind, the crux of the present position is, not whether the employes of the States or the railway servants should be included in the operation of this Bill, but whether a Ministry which is responsible for the mischievous legislation from which we have suffered during the past two or three years shall be permitted to continue to occupy &#34; the Treasury bench. </para>

                    <para>- I confess that the amendment proposed by the leader of the Opposition does not go far enough to please me. It is certainly a vast improvement upon the clause in the -form in which it is proposed by the Government, but that is all that can be urged in its favour; Doubtless it was submitted with a view to showing the Government that its author is prepared to meet them in a reasonable way. But I would warn the leader of the Opposition that in submitting to .continual encroachments by the Government upon the principles of the Bill, he is likely to sap the very foundations of unionism. It is possible for him to yield too much in that direction. It is absolutely unjust that one of the parties to this legislation should be asked to forego all the advantages which it at present enjoys without receiving anything whatever bv way of compensation. </para>

                    <para>- I &#34;regret that there is not some ready means of settling differences that occur between the two Houses of the Parliament. The amendment made by the Senate is a very important one, but the Government, in their wisdom, cannot see their way to accept it. It was carried by a fair majority in another place, and has the support of a very large minority in this Chamber. So far as this and the other amendments made by the Senate are concerned, it would appear that it is a question of a large majority of the Senate, plus a large minority of this House, against a small minority in the Senate, plus a small majority in this House. I am perfectly certain that if we could bring the 1.1 1 members of the two Chambers together to settle the question, this amendment would be carried. It does not ask that&#39; an injustice should be done to any one. It is contended that it seeks to give to one set of men that which non-unionists could not claim. If that be so, what is there to prevent non-unionists from joining the ranks of unionism? That argument is, to my mind, as illogical as would be the contention that it is unfair that any one wishing to join either of the two professions of law or medicine must first prove, by passing* certain examinations, that he possesses the knowledge entitling him to call himself a doctor or a lawyer. Then, again1, no man is allowed to call himself &#34; reverend,&#34; and to perform a marriage ceremony, unless he is registered and belongs to the union; no medical man can sign a death certificate unless he is registered, and belongs to the union of the medical profession; while no man can charge certain sums in respect of advice to a litigant unless he has been admitted to the legal profession. There are a great many members of the legal profession sitting on the opposite side of the Chamber, and I ask them to seriously consider whether it would not be well for us to accept the Senate&#39;s amendment, and to go away joyous and happy, to seek rest from the turmoil through which we have passed since the opening of the session. To me the issue is an extraordinary one. Seventy-five members of this House, returned by the aggregate wisdom of the various majorities in the different . constituencies of the Commonwealth, propose to reject an amendment made by another place, and to insult the greater part of the population of Australia, as represented by that Chamber. Three Ministries have been wrecked in connexion with this measure, and, without desiring to make any unpleasant suggestion, I would point out that a fourth is now in trouble in regard to this very question. I propose to make a suggestion which ought to appeal to the intelligence of the Committee. If I may claim the kindly courtesy of the Prime Minister, I think that information should be placed before us as to what would be the cost of obtaining the opinion of the voters who created this Parliament in regard to any difference arising between the two Houses. There is no doubt that this amendment, and the others dependent upon it, constitute the sole difference of opinion between the two Chambers, and that there is, a large majority of the members of the Parliament as a whole in favour of them. I obtained from one large city company, which carries out the work of addressing envelopes, information which enables me to form some estimate of what would be the cost of taking an open referendum through the Post Office. It seems to me that difficulties of this kind could be easily settled if the Prime Minister and his colleagues, with the approval of the majority of the House, sought the opinion of the people in what may be called, for the sake of clearness, an open referendum. In round figures there are 2,000,000 adults in Australia, and 2,000,000 double post-cards might be issued bearing the question whether the electors to whom they were addressed would accept the Bill, as amended by the Senate, or as it was sent by us to another place. On the 31st December last there were 2,073,200 adults in the Commonwealth, but the number enrolled was only 1,893,586. Taking the larger figures, the cost of 2,000,000 double postcards would be , &#163;1,500. The charge for addressing 1,000 envelopes in the city of Melbourne is 7s. <inline font-style="italic">6d&#39;.,</inline> and at &#34;this rate the cost of addressing the 2,000,000 post-cards would be , &#163;750. Then we may allow &#163;1,000 for the cost of checking and scrutinizing the answers, although I do not know why this work should cost . &#163;250 more than that of addressing the cards. Allowing a further sum of &#163;750 in respect of contingencies, we have a grand total of &#163;4, 000 By making such an expenditure, we should be able to ascertain the desire of the electors of Australia in regard to a difference of opinion occurring between the two Chambers on a question of great moment. I feel, sure that honorable members will agree that such an expenditure would be trifling, as compared with that incurred as the result of the desire of the Opposition on the one hand, to see the Bill carried in a form in which it would &#39;apply to every unit, and the desire1 of honorable members opposite on the other, to confine its operation to a limited number. The expense attendant upon the retirement of three Ministries alone must have been much greater than would be the cost of taking a referendum in the way I have suggested. We contend that every human being should be able to come under the provisions of this measure, and that we should not render it difficult for the Court to determine whether a union applying for preference substantially represents the workers in the trade, or calling, to which it relates. I am informed by a gentleman that whilst travelling in one of the tram cars of this city he saw- an officer approach the conductor, and heard him say, &#34;Give me all the money in your pockets.&#34; The conductor had to comply with this request. After this rudely-spoken officer had left the car my friend inquired what was the reason for his action, and was told that it was the result of a new regulation, which compelled conductors to produce the money in their possession whenever they were required to do . so. In the eyes of a stranger unacquainted with the true position of affairs, the action of the officer suggested that the conductor was a thief. I am sure that honorable members, and more particularly the representatives of New South Wales, would not permit such a system to exist in Sydney. If the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland were carried, and the employes of the tramway service in Melbourne were allowed to form a union, I feel satisfied thai that organization would more than represent the majority of those actually engaged in that calling. I plead with the Government to endeavour to arrive at some easy method of settling these difficult questions. I presume that if the life of this Parliament extends over its full term of three years, similar difficulties to that which. now confronts us are likely to recur. We are to-day &#39;face to face with a situation the equal of which has never previously occurred. We have the will of a second Chamber more democratic, more advanced, and more in touch with the people of Australia than is that which is commonly called the people&#39;s Chamber, flouted by a small majority in this House. The two Chambers are in conflict, and I think that the suggestion I have made would be a ready means of settling the difficulty. It would not lead to the employment of an additional postal officer, and as the Department is under the control of the Federation, the cost of postage would be avoided. As the result of such a referendum we should get rid of the present unsatisfactory position. Whether the Opposition, or the Government won, if the Ministry in its generosity saw fit to accept my proposal there would be an end to the trouble, and the Ministry and its supporters, in common with the Opposition, would be abb to enjoy a well-earned holiday. If the Government are determined not to accept the Senate&#39;s amendment they will receive the support of all the Conservatives in Australia, if such a class of politicians still exist here. At present the great Protectionist Party of Victoria is rent asunder, and I appeal to them to unite in supporting the amendment which the honorable member for Bland &#39;has submitted in a spirit of fairness, and for which I myself intend to vote. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Bland is of the very essence of compromise, and one which, if there be any idea of concession on the part of honorable members opposite, ought to be accepted without demur. It would certainly make the Bill more workable, and would obviate the tendency to litigation which might otherwise arise. We are here to place this measure on the Statute-book in clear, unmistakable Anglo-Saxon terms, so that he who runs may read. We are not here to create work for lawyers ; our duty is to declare on the face of the Bill exactly what we mean. We are assured by the Government that they are anxious that the Bill shall be not a dead letter, but an effectual means of settling disputes between employers and employes. If that be so, there is only one way in which they can achieve their purpose. The position is narrowed down to this : that if the Government are anxious to make the Bill a workable one they must recognise that the amendment proposed by the leader of the Opposition is a finger-post, pointing the clear road to right doing, and that they ought to accept it. The Government proposal would lead to endless litigation, and would prove a fruitful source of profit to members of the legal profession. It would never be accepted by trade unionists as the final method for the settlement of disputes. The amendment requires that the Court must be satisfied that the organization applying for preference substantially represents the industry affected in point of number and competence of its members. I am glad that the last three words have been added, because a numerical majority may not substantially represent an industry. A majority which substantially represents an industry must be a competent majority. I do not think that honorable members are fully aware of what the trade unions take upon themselves in accepting the amendment. We pledge them to see that their members are competent, that they have served their apprenticeship, and are skilled handicraftsmen. lt will be the duty of every trade union appealing for preference to show that it has a numerical superiority over the non-unionists in the trade, and that its members have served their apprenticeship, and are skilled in their trade or calling. The honorable member for Melbourne pointed out that the medical profession is a close trade union, which no man can enter who has not obtained the necessary diploma. Similarly, in the leading historical branches of the Christian </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Church, no one is intrusted with ministerial functions who has not passed examinations which justify his being called to that high position. Further, no one can appear in the courts of the country on behalf of another if he. has not shown himself to be possessed of the legal .training necessary to make him a fit guide in legal matters. Trade unions are now being put on the same footing. By accepting the amendment, we shall require the trade unions to insist upon the technical training of their members. Thus the amendment will serve a double purpose. It will secure that those who are most interested in a trade or industry shall, when necessary, be able to obtain preference from the Arbitration Court, and it will guarantee to the public at large, and to employers in particular, the competence of members of trade -unions. All through, the trade unions have insisted on the apprenticeship of workmen. No men are more jealous of the black-leg or the unqualified workman than are the properly qualified trade unionists. We want to encourage this feeling, and the amendment will do so. The proviso, however, would, as it stands, lead to endless litigation, because of the difficulty of proving whether the majority of the trade affected was or was not contained in the trade union applying for preference. We wish to make the Bil! a credit to ourselves, and I am sure that the Government would like it to be a workable measure ; but if the proviso is passed as it stands, the measure will be valueless. With the amendment of the Header of the Opposition, we can commend it t.o the trade unions, and it will, I believe, be acceptable to them; but, without the amendment, it would prove a curse instead of a blessing. I would rather see the Bill consigned to oblivion&#39; than vote for a measure which would increase industrial strife and trouble, and multiply litigation. Let us have an end to political hypocrisy, and seriously set ourselves to provide for the settlement of disputes by rational and constitutional methods. When we &#39;have done that, we can lay the flattering unction to our souls that we have done what we could to prevent unnatural strife between capital and labour, and to bring about an era of peace and good-will. The worker will have the assurance that &#39;his rights will be respected, while the capitalist will know that he will receive justice and consideration. So far from the measure hindering investment, and driving capital from the country, it will give an inducement to capital to come here. If, however, the amendment is not accepted - and I am afraid that it will not be - it will be only a matter of time before an amending Bill is introduced, because the measure will be found to be utterly unworkable. The preamble sets out that the measure is a Bill for an Act&#39; for the settlement of industrial disputes. Let us make it what it professes to be. It cannot be a true Conciliation and Arbitration Bill unless the amendment of the leader of the Opposition, which is , in the nature of a compromise to meet the views of another Chamber, is accepted. I ask honorable members to consider this matter with a. view ,to avoiding a crisis. The amendment has been moved in a spirit of conciliation and compromise, and, if it is negatived, the Government must take the consequence. </para>

Knowing their patient tactics, I am led by instinct to the conclusion that some of my supporters must be beyond the reach of the division bells. I am very anxious that in the settlement of these important issues, which must, at some time or other, inevitably come before the people, our conclusions shall not be the result of snatch votes, sprung upon one side or the other. In dealing with my honorable friends opposite, I have never asked for a division until they were fully prepared. I do not say that a surprise was intended just now, but the sudden clamour for a division, sounding on the ears of an old parliamentarian, and coming from an Opposition that has seemed to be entirely oblivious to the value of time, or the expense of parliamentary institutions, makes my supposition a probability. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to transgress the rules of debate, even in making an explanation, but as the discussion has been prolonged I am anxious to clearly define the position of the Government, and of those who are supporting them in this matter. As honorable members will recollect, I desired last night, because of the great .amount of time which has been occupied in the consideration of the Bill, to have a division forthwith on the amendment of the leader of the Opposition. That amendment is well known, since it is word for word the same as a suggestion made by the honorable member in this chamber some months ago, when the proposed recommittal of clause 48 was before us. I therefore was very brief in my utterance last night, but now that the&#39; debate has been prolonged to such a length, I feel it necessary to state clearly the view of the Government in regard to this proposition. There are persons who differ as to the importance of the amendment of the honorable member for Bland. The honorable member for Parramatta quoted the honorable member as saying that in his opinion his amendment was practically the same as the proviso adopted by the Committee, </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not. I wish to say only a few words. I differ from the honorable member for Parramatta. I think that there is a substantial difference between the two amendments. If there had not been, the late Opposition would have had no justification whatever for refusing to recommit the clause, or for taking up the stand they did. The only justification we could have had . was that there was a serious difference between the two amendments ; so serious was it that we were not prepared to consider any modification of our proposal. Now that the honorable member asks us to consider a modification of precisely the same kind that we were formerly unable to accept, I want to define the position of the Government in this way : If the two amendments were substantially the same, I should have no objection in the interests of the Bill to adopt the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland, but the Government consider that there is a vital difference between the two proposals, and that prevents us from accepting the modification before us. </para>

                        <para>- That is not for the right honorable member to say. The Prime Minister has at last distinctly explained why he cannot accept the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland. He has stated that in the event of its being adopted, if 100 men belonged to a union, they could control 900 others engaged in the same industry. As a matter of fact, that does not occur under the law as it is applied in New South Wales and in New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>- The Arbitration Court in New South Wales has proceeded upon practically the same lines as those proposed by the honorable member for Bland. It has taken into consideration the question whether the applicants for preference represent a fair percentage of those engaged in the industry. In order to show the improbability of such results as those predicted by the Prime Minister being brought about, I would point out that in New South Wales recently, a union, embracing 250 men, applied for preference, but as there were 1,250 men employed in the industry, the Court held that the unionists had no just claim for preference. </para>

                        <para>- Does the right honorable gentleman seriously pretend that if there were 250 men in a union, they could prevent 750 non-unionists in the same industry from obtaining employment? It is absurd to maintain any such thing. The right honorable gentleman &#39;has no right to insult honorable members upon , this side of the Chamber, and also the Chairman, by stating that he has been listening to sickening repetitions. That is not only a reflection upon honorable members, but also upon the </para>

                        <para>- I wish to place upon record the fact that the proposals embodied in this Bill are absolutely antagonistic to the legislation which is operative in two of the States at the present time. The measure does not reflect the progressive character of that legislation. It constitutes a retrograde movement, and consequently is unworthy of this Parliament. What kind of an object lesson will this Bill afford to those States in which no arbitration law is in operation to-day? It will probably &#39;have the effect of inducing them to model their legislation upon the same lines. As honorable members are aware, the operation of the New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Act is limited to six years, at the end of which period it must, be re-enacted or its provisions will lapse. In view of that fact, I exceedingly regret that the Government cannot approach a little neaiei to legislation wfoich is reasonable and effective than they have done. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite a different matter. I certainly did say that the Court, in the absence of any limitation, would be guided by the practice which has already been established in New Zealand and New South Wales. That practice is to insist, as far as possible, that those who apply for a preference shall constitute a majority. But I contend - and I have always contended - that there is a very wide distinction between my proposal and the amendment which was carried at the instance of the honorable and learned member for Corinella. </para>

                    <para>- I am very sorry to again interpose in this debate, but the matter under consideration is of some concern to me. In the electorate which I represent there is a very large number of unionists, and I wish to put myself right with them, in view of the statements of the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. What I said, during the course of my previous remarks, was that the leader of the Opposition had insisted that his amendment was the only practical means of insuring that- the President of the Arbitration Court should not grant a preference unless a majority of those interested in the award asked for it. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The honorable member does not object to majority rule, but to the difficulty that would be experienced under the proviso which the Government support in proving that a majority were in favour of a preference. I, on the other hand, can foresee no difficulty whatever in convincing the Arbitration Court in connexion with all well-organized unions that a majority of those engaged in the industry desire a preference. Since there will be no difficulty in convincing the Court of that fact, there is no need for any further amendment. </para>

He believes that in actual practice the President of the Arbitration Court will require to be convinced that a majority approve of that preference, -and he entertains no objection whatever to that tribunal .refusing a preference to minorities. The Government wish to retain in the Bill a straightforward intelligent proposal for granting a preference. That proposal directs that the Judge must grant a preference if there be a majority of applicants in favour of it. </para>

                        <para>- I know he can ; but if we were to refuse to do so, we should have to conceive a set of circumstances which are almost outside human comprehension. Does the honorable member for Bland say that under this clause, if an ordinary dispute occurred, and a majority of those affected applied for a preference, the Court would refuse to grant it? Such a proceeding is almost unimaginable. The provision directs that where a majority asks for a preference, the Court may grant it, but &#34;may &#34; there, I take it, means &#34;shall.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I assume that the Court will interpret this clause as it will interpret any other provision in the Bill. Consequently I claim that when a majority applies for a preference, it will be granted, unless an extraordinary state of things should arise. If such a state of things did arise, no doubt an extraordinary way of dealing with it would be adopted by the Court. But, under ordinary circumstances, 1 claim that the proviso in the clause amounts to a direction that the Court shall extend a preference to unionists when a majority apply for it. Since the leader of the Opposition desires only to insure that a majority should receive a preference when they ask for it, I claim that the Government proposal constitutes a straightforward method of Sealing with the matter, and is therefore preferable <inline font-style="italic">tb</inline> the indefinite and difficult method which is contained in the amendment. </para>

                    <para>-, The honorable member for Parramatta is distinctly under a misapprehension as to the meaning of this clause. He imagines that the effect of the provision in its present form is that if a majority approve of a preference being granted to unionists, the Court is bound to concede that preference., I venture to say - and I am prepared to pledge any reputation which I have upon my statement - that he is wrong. If he thinks that he is going to persuade the unionists in his constituency, to whom he has referred, that that is the case, he is making a great mistake. The provision here is simply negative. It is not proposed to give preference unless there be a majority. It is just the same as if we gave a person power to distribute pennies among a number. of school children, but subject to the condition that he must not give a penny to any child unless it had a clean face. That would not mean that he would give every child a penny. I should be very sorry if on an important division of this sort, when the probable majority is so slender and when the Prime Minister rests solely upon majority rule, as he calls it, there should be even one vote cast on the wrong side owing to a misunderstanding of the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to express my appreciation of the fact that the misunderstanding as to what the leader of the Opposition did or did not say in regard to this proposal is being cleared up. I feel that as the result of an interjection made by the honorable member for Parramatta in regard to this matter I have been placed in a false position. Earlier in the day, while I was endeavouring to show the difference between the Government proposal and that put forward by the Opposition, I understood the honorable member for Parramatta to interject that the leader of the Opposition on a previous occasion had expressed the opinion that there was no difference between his amendment and that which was carried on the motion of the honorable and learned member for Corinella before the Bill was sent to another place. </para>

                        <para>- It is sometimes difficult to clearly hear interjections made by honorable members. My impression was that the honorable member meant to say that the leader of the Opposition had expressed the opinion to which I have just referred. I was not in a position at the moment to verify that assertion. I accepted it as being correct, and proceeded to controvert the opinion said to have been, expressed by the leader of the Opposition by quoting the views of the late Attorney-General of New South Wales, the Hon. B. R. Wise. I am glad that the matter has been cleared up, and that the leader of the Opposition has not at any time taken up a different attitude from that which he now assumes on this question. </para>

                    (Bland).- I have no objection to the amendment of the Senate being agreed to, but to my mind, it, together with the general provision prohibiting unions from engaging in politics, carries us a great deal further than a number of honorable members desired to go when thcoriginal clause was before us. It seems to me, therefore, proper that we should state as definitely as possible how far it is intended to go. What I understood was aimed at in the original amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corinella

                    <para>- With the exception of one or two words, it was drafted by the honorable and learned member, and modified by an amendment of the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs, being accepted by the then Government in its modified form, though with a reservation as to the phraseology. What I understood was aimed at was the prevention of unions from obtaining preference if their members were constrained to take part in party politics. That was the object of the prohibition, as understood by myself, and, I think, by other honorable members, and, as I indicated the other day, I have no objection to such a limitation. I admit that to compel a man&#39; to&#39; support a political propaganda in which he does not believe is to impose a hardship upon him. But the clause, as it left this Chamber, and as it has been amended by the Senate, goes a great deal further than that, because it prevents unions from obtaining preference if they continue that form of political agitation which has no connexion with party politics, but which has been practised from the initiation of unionism, long before the parliamentary representation of labour was thought of. Such a prohibition would be a distinct hardship on unions, and, I am convinced, would be repugnant to unionists, whether they had a sneaking regard- for the Parliamentary Labour Party or not. The great majority of them would not register under the Bill, if they were restrained from engaging in any kind of political agitation, which is the effect of the amendment of the Senate. A union could take no political action whatever, no matter how free that action might be from party politics, or how important the question to the union taking action, if the amendment of the Senate were accepted as it stands. For instance, the question of workmen&#39;s compensation is one upon which trade unionists have every right to agitate, without reference to party politics. They desire to arouse the public to the need for taking steps to protect workmen from injury in the pursuance of their ordinary avocations, it may be through the negligence of their employers ; <inline font-style="italic">hut</inline> no such action could be taken without having some political objective, and therefore a union would have to choose between taking such political action, and refusing to come under the Bill and obtain preference. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the amendment of the Senate raises the whole question, because it qualifies a clause which has been agreed to by this Chamber. We have a right, therefore, under the rules of procedure to which I have been accustomed, following the procedure of the House of Commons, to qualify such a qualification, to whatever extent may be deemed necessary. The right to take political action is essential to unionism, &#39; whether the union be an organization of &#34;employes or an organization of employers. It is impossible to conceive of effective action being taken in the interests of any class without political action being engaged in. Is it proposed to take from unions their power to engage in agitation which has political ends in view, as the price of letting them come under the Arbitration Bill? If that is the attitude of Parliament, very few unions will think it worth while to make the sacrifice. The Bill already requires them to give up a weapon which during the last fifty years has proved most effective, though it undoubtedly has on occasion acted in boomerang fashion, injuring those who have used it. On the whole, however, the workmen of British-speaking communities have obtained enormous and incalculable advantages by using their right to strike. That right is now being taken from them, because the Bill prohibits striking. They are now required, if they desire preference - and we who support the measure say that without preference it would be impossible to work the Bill effectively - not to engage in any political agitation. Even if every member of the union were in favour of spending money on some political action, which might be entirely non-party, not a penny could be so spent without impairing any preference that might have been granted to the union. A union could not resolve to spend any part of its funds in political action without perhaps having to forego an award obtained from the &#34;Court after days or weeks of anxious inquiry. That seems a very curious position for us to take up. Perhaps I shall be pardoned if, in this connexion, I quote a few remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cohen, in the New South Wales Arbitration Court. I do not propose to read the whole judgment, which was given in connexion with a dispute between the Australian Workers&#39; Union and the Machine Shearers&#39; and Shed Employees&#39; Union. Exception had been taken by the Machine Shearers&#39; and Shed Employees&#39; Union to the political objects of the Australian </para>

                <para>Following in the same line, I now come to the objection to amalgamation with the Australian Workers&#39; Union, in consequence of the political element embodied in its constitution. (See rules 54-7.) Having arrived at the conclusion that it is perfectly legitimate for a trade union to own and publish a paper, I must logically follow it up by also declaring my opinion that political advocacy of its views comes within its scope. It seems to me perfectly legitimate, as the constitutional method of finally giving effect to the opinions it may hold, that it should seek to have those views ventilated in the Parliament of the country by representatives of its own choosing, and where requisite or necessary embodied in the Statute. I think I would be correct in saying that all Acts of Parliament have been the result of advocacy which may be aptly called &#34;political &#34; - nay, the very Act we are now considering, and under which this tribunal is constituted, is the outcome of political discussion, and the ultimate maturing of political opinion. And, assuming, as I think I may correctly, that trade unions had a large share in the political action (including the return of their approved parliamentary candidates), which resulted in legislation deemed hy the Parliament to be beneficial to the State, how can it be effectively urged that political action should be declared to be outside the function of trade unions? </para>

            <para>That opinion, coming from a learned gentleman, who apart from any bias, one way or the other, has had unique opportunities during the last year or so, of forming an opinion upon this subject, and of studying in detail the rules of the greater number of the unions in New South Wales, should carry weight with honorable members and with the country generally. One can understand honorable members opposite - indeed, honorable members on either side of tha Chamber - objecting to any provision which might have the effect of assisting one particular party or another; but the claim I am urging now is that there should be no bar placed in the way of that legitimate political action which has been characteristic of trade unions ever since their inception, and the prohibition of which would alter completely their whole complexion and the methods which they have adopted for years past. I take it that we do not seek to amend the Trade Unions Acts of the various States. We do not wish ;o put disabilities upon the unions which are not imposed by any of the States Acts. Nothing of that kind was contemplated when this proposal was brought forward. All that was urged was the desirability of preventing men from being coerced into political action against their wishes, and of preventing the funds of the unions from being used in a manner contrary to the desires of the members. Sp far as that aspect of the matter is concerned, I have no objection to offer to provisions which will secure that end. Honorable members may remember that, when this clause was before us on a former occasion, although I accepted it, I made a reservation as to the phraseology. I told the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs, that I accepted the spirit of the proposal, but was not convinced that the phraseology was all that could be desired. </para>

                    <para>- So far as this amendment is concerned, it prohibits certain organizations from appearing in Court to oppose applicants for preference, so long as their rules or other binding decisions permit the application of their fund&#39;s to political purposes, or require their members to do anything of a political character. That organization may be one of employes, because in New South Wales, upon one occasion, an organization of employes objected to preference being granted to another union. So that all that I have said up to the present applies to this particular amendment. I do not wish at this stage to say a great deal more upon the general question. In my view, it is necessary to define clearly what is meant by the term &#34; political purposes,&#34; and I think that we should make such a provision as will insure that, whilst party political action may be barred, the ordinary political action which has formed part of the machinery of unionism in the past shall not be interfered with. The provision as it stands practically prohibits operations by the unions which are allowed under every State Trades Union&#39; Act. I think it ought to be clearly understood how far the Committee proposes to go, and therefore I move - </para>

            <para class="block">I do not pretend that this list is complete, but I have endeavoured, in the first place, to generally provide that action taken on behalf of all those engaged in an industry, irrespective of whether they are unionists or non-unionists, merely affecting their status and general conditions as workmen, shall not be deemed to be political in the sense in which political action is prohibited under the Bill. I feel sure- that honorable members generally can sympathize with that view. If their object is merely to restrain the unions from coercing their members into taking political action of a party character surely they can have no objection to exempting from inclusion in the term &#34; political purposes &#34; those actions or agitations which are absolutely non-party in character. None of these matters are ordinarily considered as within the range of party politics, and with a view to having them clearly denned, I submit my amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to raise a point of order upon a matter of considerable importance. Clause 55 of the Bill upon which this further proviso has been adopted by the Senate, so far as this particular question is concerned, consists of two parts, one authorizing the registration of certain associations as organizations, and the other providing that no registered organization shall be entitled to a preference declaration while it is political. That, briefly, though not quite accurately, expresses the meaning of the provision. The Senate agreed to that proposal. It agreed that a registered organization should not be entitled to a declaration of preference, whilst it was political, and in view of the provision in&#39; an earlier section to the effect that certain persons, or an organization, might, if they chose, oppose an application for preference, the Senate added a separate and distinct provision that no opposition to an application for preference should be permitted by an organization which was political. The Prime Minister has moved &#34; That the Senate&#39;s amendment be agreed to.&#34; Now, the leader of the Opposition proposes to move an amendment which includes the words &#34; political purposes in this section.&#34; I wish to call the special attention of the Committee to the last three words. With the addition of those words, the definition of &#34;political purposes&#34; will affect not only the proviso to which the Senate asks this Committee to agree - it not having been previously embodied in the clause - but also those portions of the clause which have been agreed to by both Houses. It means that these shall be altered </para>

                    <para>- Both this Committee and the Senate have agreed, in the first place, that associations may be registered as organizations; and, secondly, that when they are registered, they shall not be entitled to a declaration of preference if they are of a political character. The Senate proposes to add that no opponent of preference shall be allowed to appear before the Court to oppose the granting of a preference if the organization which he represents is of a political character. The leader of the Opposition wishes to move that &#34; political purposes&#34; in this section shall not include certain things. His proposal, I would point out, covers the proviso to which both Houses have agreed, as well as the other proviso which the Senate has proposed. If the honorable member for Bland disagrees with the view which I am urging, he is impaled upon the horns of a dilemma ; either he has to say that this definition does not alter the meaning of the word &#34; political,&#34; in the portion of the clause which has been agreed to by both Houses - in which case it is useless - or he has to confess that it affects what both Houses have agreed to. </para>

                    <para>- Let us suppose that the Senate had not sent down this amendment relating to the opposition to preference. It would certainly not &#39;have been competent for any member of this Committee to move such an amendment as that before us relating to political purposes. The proposal of the leader of the Opposition, I maintain affects a provision which has been agreed to by both Houses. As it is drafted it affects the provision which is contained in clause 55, relating to applicants for preference. It does not merely affect that provision in regard to opponents of preference. If its scope were limited to that, I should raise no objection. But both Houses having agreed that no organization shall be entitled to a declaration of preference if its funds may be devoted to political purposes, or if its members may be required to perform acts of a political character, I submit that the proposal constitutes an attempt to alter something which has been agreed to by both .branches of the Legislature, and that it is, therefore, beyond the power of this Committee to entertain it. Whoever may be right, to my mind, the issue is perfectly clear. It is, &#34; Can the first proviso be amended under the plea of amending the second proviso ?&#34; The proposal of the honorable member for Bland, in its very terms, shows that it applies, not only to the second proviso, -but also to the first. Pending the decision of the point of order, I intentionally refrain from discussing in any way the merits of the proposal itself. </para>

                    <para>- So far as this point of order is concerned, I may say that the Government have been taken at no disadvantage, inasmuch as a good many days ago I informed the Prime Minister that I intended to attempt to qualify the term &#34; political purposes.&#34; That that knowledge was general upon the other side of the Chamber is evidenced by the fact that it was well understood that a point of order was to be raised in connexion with it. Consequently the Government are at no disadvantage whatever. With respect to the point of order itself, I may preface my remarks by observing that it is a well understood rule of Parliament that whenever there is the slightest element of doubt regarding the construction of the Standing Orders, or as to the general parliamentary practice, the decision should always lean towards that course which will allow of the greatest possible freedom and latitude being followed especially in an endeavour to arrange any difference which may exist between the two Houses. From the constitutional standpoint, it is in the highest degree desirable - if there is a difference of opinion between the two Chambers - that no effort should be prevented which might lead to a. settlement of the matter in dispute. We should bear in mind that it is not merely this question which we are now considering, but rather the general principles upon which differences between the two Houses shall ba settled. </para>

                    <para>- I maintain that there is. I shall, however, deal with that aspect of the question presently. A decision given upon this question may have a restrictive effect when a much more serious difference of opinion exists between the two Chambers, and consequently it is highly desirable that no action should be taken which would have the effect of curtailing our rights. I claim that there is a difference between the two Houses. Of course, if the Government proposal be carried, that difference will cease to exist. But if it be not carried, a difference will exist between the two Houses upon this question, as upon three other questions. I maintain that clause 55 has not yet been approved by the Senate. It has been approved only contingent upon an alteration being .made in it. In the absence of that amendment, there is no evidence that the Senate is in favour of the clause. There is no evidence as to how that Chamber will regard it eventually. Assuming that the Senate, instead of adding to the clause a proviso in the form which has been adopted - and the form of the proviso is a mere accident, because after all we have to look to the purpose of any amendment - had inserted in it after the words &#34;entitled to,&#34; the words &#34;apply for or oppose,&#34; the effect of the alteration would have been to include both the original proviso and the one which the Senate now suggests in one paragraph. Then we should have had the words - </para>

            <para class="block">Would the Minister contend that it would not be competent for us to amend that proposition - that it would not be competent for us to attempt to define the term &#34; political purposes?&#34; I say that no such contention would have been urged if the amendment had been made in the way I suggest. The Senate has decided that the original proposition sent from this House shall be qualified in a certain manner, and the form which that qualification takes does not alter the position. The question of form is .nothing ; the point which we have to remember is that they have made a qualification. My contention is in the first place that clause 55 has not been adopted ; that consequently, the proviso which the Senate has inserted is a qualification - and a material qualification - of the original provision, and that any qualification which we desire to impose on that made by another place as a condition to our assenting to their additional proviso, would be strictly relevant to the general purposes of the original proviso, and that made by another place. Both these conditions are met by my proposition. Surely it cannot be held that the definition of the term *&#39; political purposes &#34; is not relevant to the Senate&#39;s amendment. As its amendment is a qualification of the original proposition which was put forward, we are entitled to define the term &#34; political purposes &#34; before agreeing to it. Standing order 192, which was quoted by the Minister of Defence, practically repeats - although in a slightly different form - the procedure laid down by <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> and I take my stand upon the practice laid down at page 478- </para>

            <para class="block">I contend that my amendment is consequent upon and relevant to that made by another place.

When, on a certain occasion, I disallowed any reference to that matter, an honorable member interjected that an amendment in this direction would be moved. I was therefore to that extent - and to that extent only - made aware of the fact that this amendment would be submitted. I have made inquires on my own account, and must at once confess that the point is one of very great difficulty. I have not been able to find any precedent which would serve to guide me. I should therefore feel obliged if honorable members would give me their assistance in arriving at a decision. I realize that the question is a very important one, and that any decision I might give would have an important bearing upon the matter under discussion. I may say at the outset, that I feel that some proof is necessary that the amendment is in order. With regard to one remark made by the honorable member for Bland, I would point out that if the Senate had inserted certain words in the proviso to clause 55, the difficulty, so far as I am concerned, would have wholly disappeared. We should then have had the whole provision before us, but at present I feel that we have simply to deal with an amendment in. words which has been sent down by another place. </para>

                    <para>- I appreciate the language which you have used, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> and recognise that, as the Minister has said, he did not have an opportunity to see the amendment until a couple of minutes before it was submitted. I feel, however, that if the honorable and learned gentleman had seen the words of the amendment at a reasonable time before it was moved, he would not have felt the difficulty which he says he now experiences. I hope that this discussion will be devoid of party spirit or feeling. I am endeavouring to look at the question from an absolutely impartial standpoint, because I feel that it affects not only the matter immediately before us, but the privileges of this Committee. It is very important that the hands of honorable members should not be tied, and that. our course should not be hampered by any unnecessary restraint. The position may be put briefly. Clause 55, as sent to another place, provided that no preference should be given to any organization whose rules permitted its funds to be applied to political purposes, or if its members were required to do anything of a political character. The Senate thought fit to insert the proviso, to which they have asked our assent, which is to the effect that no organization should be allowed to oppose an application for preference, if its funds could be applied to political purposes. &#39; The members of another place said, in effect,&#39; &#34; We shall not give you this restriction, unless you put a similar restriction upon the opposing body.&#34; The proviso inserted by them now comes before us, and we have to assent to or dissent from that restriction. The leader of the Opposition now says, &#34; Let us put in a further proviso, which says in effect: &#39;We have no objection to the proviso which the Senate has inserted, as long as it defines what are political purposes.&#39; &#34; That is the whole point. It simply means that we are quite content to accept this proviso if another place will say exactly what is meant by &#34;political purposes.&#34; I have tried to discover concrete instances of the position, and a case in point has occurred to me. Supposing that some offence were created in a Bill which was first in our charge, and that we provided that no penalty should exceed ,&#163;50. Then let us suppose that the Bill was sent to another place, and that it chose to say that no penalty should exceed ,&#163;100, thus enlarging the amount of penalty that could be imposed. When the Bill came back to us we should not be able, if the Minister&#39;s argument be correct, to insert a qualification, saying in effect, &#34;We will accept the provision that no penalty shall exceed .&#163;100, provided that intention or knowledge be proved on the part of the person who does the wrong.&#34; Supposing, for instance, that in regard to some Customs offence we had proposed <inline font-style="italic">/l$o</inline> as the maximum penalty, and that another place said, &#34;Let it be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.&#34;</inline> Then sup- pose that on the Bill being returned to us we said, &#34;We have no objection to the penalty being increased to .&#163;100, provided that it be proved all through that there was a criminal intent.&#34; The point at which I venture to say the Minister has gone wrong is this : he thinks that even if an amendment be relevant to the sub-clause it is irregular if it affects something else. There is no authority in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> or in any book of proced&#39;ure for such an assumption. The Minister says in effect to the leader of the Opposition, &#34; True, your amendment relates to the Senate&#39;s addition, but it also relates to something else, and therefore it ought not to be allowed.&#34; That position is not supported by any of the books on procedure. It would be utterly impracticable. Every word in a Bill affects every other word in it. When a Bill is returned to us to be dealt with, we cannot say that any words proposed to be inserted must affect a proviso inserted by another place, and nothing else. The Minister has been good enough to refer to certain Standing Orders on which I intended to rely.

            <para class="block">So far the <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> position is all right. We wish to amend the amendment of the Senate, and I apprehend that the only point which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> have to consider is whether the amendment of the leader of the Opposition is relevant to the&#39; addition to the clause made by the Senate. If it is not relevant, it is out of order, but if it is relevant, it is in order. You have nothing to do with &#39;its ulterior effect upon the construction of the Bill.

                <para>It is also a rule, that neither House may, at this time, leave out or otherwise amend anything which they have already passed themselves ; unless such amendment be immediately consequent upon the acceptance or the rejection of an amendment of the other House. &#34; Leave out &#34; ; that is the very point which is dealt with in standing order 207. We cannot alter our accepted words unless something has been done by the Senate, which is a reason for qualifying what we have done. But to &#34; leave out or otherwise amend &#34; is quite different from adding something in the nature of a proviso upon a proviso. I know that your attention has been called to this point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> and therefore I shall not speak at greater length. But in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> reference is made to the <inline font-style="italic">Commons&#39; Journal,</inline> and particular reliance is placed on what occurred in England in connexion with the Municipal Corporations Bill, about seventy years ago. In the <inline font-style="italic">Commons&#39; Journal</inline> will be found instance after instance of amendments which have the effect of saying, &#34;-We will agree to the amendment of the Lords provided that they will qualify the meaning of certain Words throughout the Bill.&#34; That is what is being done here. I submit, not in the interests of the Opposition, or even of the Bill, but in the interests of proper parliamentary procedure, that it would be lamentable if, when the Houses were trying to come to an agreement, and we had approached so nearly as we are now, we could not find a half-way house at which we might meet. We are willing to accept the amendment of the Senate prohibiting unions from getting preference if they have political purposes, provided that they agree to assign a certain meaning to the words &#34; political purposes &#34; throughout the Bill. As regards the effect of the clause, I have no hesitation in saying that, from our point of view, it will be a very healthy one. I am not, however, dealing with that matter now. I do not think honorable members intended to prevent an employers&#39; organization from applying its funds for the printing and circulation of pamphlets against the Immigration Restriction Act, the Pacific Island Labourers Act, the Victorian Factories Act, or any similar measure. But if the amendment is agreed to as it stands, any organization whose rules permit a penny of its funds to be used for any such purpose- will fee debarred from appearing before the Court to oppose an application for preference. The amendment goes far beyond what we had in view. The amendment of the leader of the Opposition will have a retro-active effect, which is perfectly justifiable, and that effect will be a healthy one, because we went too far in the first instance. I do not think honorable members wish to penalize unions of employers or employes because their funds may be spent in pamphleteering or in employing lecturers or lecturesses </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that a good deal of confusion has been caused by the leader of the Opposition in using the word &#34; union &#34; in reference to the amendment. We have nothing to do with the political purposes, activities, or expenditure of unions. They do not come within our. control. The Bill has to do only with organizations, upon whom it is sought to impose conditions which we do not seek to, and could not. impose on unions. It must be remembered, in dealing with this matter, that the House, in the first place, imposed certain conditions on organizations applying for preference. The Senate has replied) &#34; The conditions which you have imposed apply only to organizations of employes, because they are the only organizations which will ask for preference. Why not impose the same conditions on organizations of employers who oppose them?&#34; </para>

                    <para>- No, that is impossible. It seems to me that the Senate is perfectly reasonable in providing that the conditions which are imposed upon organizations asking for preference shall be imposed on organizations resisting such applications. The honorable member for Bland is willing to agree to the Senate&#39;s amendment if the words &#34;political purposes&#34; are defined as having a certain meaning. If that were the whole of his proposal, he would occupy a stronger position than he does. But he goes further, and proposes that this definition shall apply to those words throughout the whole clause. If he proposed to amend the amendment of the Senate, what the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne terms the retro-active effect of his proposal would have passed unnoticed, and his position would have been firmer, though it cannot be denied that if the words &#34; political purposes &#34; are given a certain meaning in the Senate&#39;s. amendment, they may, later on, be similarly interpreted wherever they occur. </para>

                    <para>- Yes, I do. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> uses the words &#34;directly relevant,&#34; whilst in our own Standing Orders the phrase adopted&#39; is &#34;strictly relevant,&#34; and I contend that the amendment cannot be regarded as directly or strictly relevant to anything beyond the proviso. Inasmuch as the Senate has accepted the proposal made with regard to organizations applying for preference, without any amendment &#39;or definition whatever, they clearly had no intention to alter that. That is to say, they intended to accept that provision without alteration. But they propose an addition affecting those organizations which oppose preferences,, and this amendment proposes that &#34; political purposes &#34; in that amendment shall have a certain meaning. Permit me to point out that honorable members opposite are proceeding upon their own interpretation of the meaning likely to be attached by the Court to the words &#34; political purposes.&#34; For aught I know, &#34;political purposes&#34; may include, in the mind of the Court, any or all of the things mentioned in the amendment of the honorable member for Bland. The honorable member is proceeding on the assumption which, to my mind, appears largely unwarranted, that the Court will hold that no unions will be entitled to oppose preference if they are pursuing any of the objects he has indicated. I would not venture, off-hand, to say in advance what the Court, after argument and consideration, will regard as being exclused by the words &#34; political purposes.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- Both the honorable member for Bland and the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne have strayed into the consideration as to what is healthy or unhealthy, what is desirable or undesirable, and the respects in which the House should be free or fettered. I am not now dealing with the merits of the amendment. I am pointing out that the whole argument of the &#39;honorable member for Bland turns upon his own interpretation of the meaning of the words &#34; political purposes.&#34; The honorable member&#39;s arguments on that point were not in their proper place. I do not think that this definition of the words &#34; political purposes &#34; would exclude a number of the purposes to- which the honorable member for Bland has referred. I think that many of them might be defined as labour or industrial matters, and probably would not be excluded as political by the </para>

Therefore the honorable member for Bland must not claim any weight for his argument, owing to his own interpretation of the words &#34;political purposes.&#34; I feel sure that they will be found to be . far less restrictive than he is inclined to believe. As the honorable member for Northern Melbourne has pointed out, it would be possible by a re-interpretation of words embodied in an amendment submitted by the Senate to affect the meaning of a whole Bill which we had previously passed, and to which the Senate had already agreed. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member is adopting a very broad interpretation of the word &#34; qualify.&#34; In the sense in which he applies it, any proposal, whether of a negative or positive character, would be a qualification of everything else. It appears , to me that this is a proposal which has been added to the clause, and that we can only deal with the Senate&#39;s amendment. We ought not to introduce words which will affect other clauses of the Bill. Bourinot, at page 677, says - &#34;One House may not amend any part of a Bill which it has passed and sent up for concurrence.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- I dissent from the view taken by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. The question is one solely of the interpretation of the words &#34;strictly relevant thereto. &#39; &#39; The view put forward by the honorable and learned member is that the word &#34;strictly&#34; means &#34;exclusively,&#34; and that the amendment must relate exclusively to the proviso before the House. I entirely dissent from that interpretation. The amendment must, however, be one which distinctly modifies the particular proposal before- the Committee. It must therefore be one which is &#34; strictly relevant &#34; to it. It must either add to it or modify it in some way. There must be some clear visible connexion between it and the proposal which is under consideration. The next point which arises is &#34; What is the meaning of the word &#39;relevant&#39;?&#34; According to ordinary acceptation, it means &#34; having applicableness or pertinence; applicable, pertinent to the purpose; appropriate.&#34; First of all we have to be satisfied that any proposal before the Committee is one which can be connected with the amendment of the Senate. We must establish clearly and distinctly that it has reference to it, otherwise it is excluded from our consideration. What is the position? The original provision in the Bill provided that organizations must be registered. The Chairman will recollect that objection was taken to the proposal of the present Minister of Defence upon the ground that it was not relevant to this clause. It was urged that a proposal relating to a preference was being inserted in a provision dealing with the registration of1 unions. . &#39;Upon -that occasion you, sir, ruled that it was relevant to the clause. </para>

                    <para>- Nevertheless, you ruled that it was relevant. Now it is further proposed that those who are&#39; opposed to the granting of a preference shall have certain conditions imposed upon them. That is the effect of the whole provision. This clause has been modified by the Senate, and returned to the House. We take up the position that, we are quite prepared to accept the clause in its modified form, so long as we are allowed to still further modify it by the insertion of words defining &#34;political purposes.&#34; Then the question arises, &#34; Is the proposal of the honorable member for Bland relevant?&#34; I submit that it is. A motion to define that term is relevant to the issue. Our next consideration should be, &#34;Is it strictly relevant?&#34; I claim that it is, because it defines the term used in the Senate&#39;s amendment, and no other term. It defines the meaning of &#34; political purposes.&#34; If we were to say that the honorable member&#39;s proposal should apply only to the Senate&#39;s amendment it would then be exclusively relevant. It is quite true that this particular part of the clause has been passed by the Committee and sent up to the Senate, and that the Senate has made a modification in it. Surely, then, it is open to us to insert another modification ! Surely we are not to be excluded from dealing with it simply because, in order that we may be able to accept the Senate&#39;s amendment, we desire to add a further amendment. As a matter of fact, what the other Chamber has returned to us is the entire clause as it left this Chamber, with an addition. I take the view that we are quite prepared to accept that clause, upon the condition that we are permitted to add a further modification to it. If we do not possess that power, our powers are very restricted indeed. After all, the question resolves itself into one of interpretation. It becomes a question of what is the meaning of the words &#34; strictly relevant?&#34; </para>

                    <para>- No. All that the Senate has done is to declare that when anybody opposes preference it shall be subjected to certain conditions. We say in effect, &#34; Very well; we are prepared to accept that proposal, provided that the conditions are defined.&#34; Surely it cannot be urged that the defining of those conditions makes the proposal of the honorable member for Bland not &#34; strictly relevant &#34; to the amendment. I submit these remarks only with a desire to assist you, sir, in deciding the point of order which has been raised. In construing statutes, the general practice is to preserve the common law unless it is expressly repealed or modified, and the common law of Parliament means that we shall enjoy full liberty of speech and of action. I submit that you, sir, will not lay down any narrow rule of construction, and by so doing deprive this House of any rights which it possesses. I maintain that, if you interpret the word &#34; strictly &#34; to mean &#34; exclusively,&#34; you will place serious impediments in the way of a peaceful solution of difficulties between the two Houses. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that, in amending this clause, one object which the Senate had in view was to give effect to the general principle which permeates the whole Bill, of placing both parties to disputes likely to come before the Arbitration Court upon terms of absolute equality. The statement has been made that only one class of persons can apply for the granting of a preference. I shall presently show that it is within the power of employers to apply for a preference. The intention of this provision is to provide equality of preference. If we alter the Senate&#39;s amendment only, we shall interfere with the whole spirit of the clause. I would point out that there are cases in which employers may apply to the Court for a preference. Take the pastoral industry as an example. The pastoralists number very many thousands, and occasionally the Australian Workers&#39; Union has been called upon to supply the men required by them during the shearing season. It is therefore quite conceivable, in connexion with an award of the Court, that the pastoralists may ask that the organization in question should supply them with labour, and to supply it to them first of all. That would be a case of preference. If the reasoning of the Minister be correct, it will be impossible for us to make the measure a workable one. We ought to endeavour, as far as possible, to overcome difficulties between the two Houses, and it &#39;seems to me that when we desire to bring all the provisions of a clause into harmony we cannot separate an amendment made by another place from that with which it is connected. To reverse the decision of the Senate would be to do something contrary to the spirit of fair play to all parties which actuated another place in inserting this provision. It seems to me that an excellent case has been made out for the. amendment which the leader of the Opposition has put before the Committee, and that it is clearly in order. </para>

                    <para>- I am at one with the. honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in the view that the point of order raised is a most important one, affecting not only the question immediately before the Chair, but the relations of the two Houses. The more subtle point, as to relevancy, has been debated at length by the legal members of the Committee, but with all respect, it seems to me that they have not thrown much light on the subject. I do not think it is wise that we should determine the point at the present juncture. In view of the importance of the amendment, and the serious bearing which any decision given by the Chairman would have upon the relations of the two Houses, I think it would be wise for the Minister to withdraw his point of order. If that were done, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  Chairman  would have an opportunity to&#39; carefully study the question, and to decide it at a later date. It is generally contended that the decisions of a  Chairman  of Committees do not create precedents, but we cannot get away from the fact that they must largely guide our future actions. If the point of order be pressed at this stage, it seems to me that it may ultimately be dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and that we may have conflicting decisions. I hold that the procedure which we follow in dealing with the clauses of a Bill in Committee should be observed when we are considering a message from another place. When a clause of a Bill is being considered in Committee, Ave may deal with it sub-clause by sub-clause, or as a whole. An amendment may be -made in a sub-clause, and, that having been dealt with, we proceed to consider the next provision. It is true that we may not go back to the first part of a clause, which has once been dealt with in this way, but if necessary we may insert any proviso to qualify that which we have already passed. Why should we not be able to adopt the same course in connexion with this matter? The amendment made by the Senate modifies the clause as agreed to by the two Houses. I agree with the contention of the Minister as to the position in regard to that part of the clause which precedes the proviso in question, but I hold that we are entitled to insert any further proviso to that made by another place. We have a right to insert any proviso affecting the whole clause. If that were not within our power the procedure by which we are governed in dealing with a Bill in Committee would be wrong. If we are to be confined to the exact words used by another place it seems to me that, in the event of the Senate desiring to come into conflict with this Chamber, it might so frame an amendment that we should be unable to deal with it. It might make an amendment practically nullifying a clause as passed by us, and we should not be able to modify it. Another point I desire to raise is that the question has already been put from the Chair. </para>

In view of the importance of the matter, and the effect which the decision of the Chairman might have on the relations of the two Houses, I hope that the point of order will be withdrawn, so that the question may be determined on some other occasion.

I desire, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> to submit another phase of the question to your consideration. The Senate has inserted this proviso in clause 55 alongside one which existed in the Bill as it left this Chamber, and it has used the very, words, &#34; political purposes,&#34; that we used in the preceding proviso. It is conceded, as it must be, that we can give our interpretation to the words &#34; political purposes &#34; in the Senate&#39;s amendment. And does any one venture to say that it is consistent with common sense that we are to be permitted to define the words &#34;political purposes&#34; in the Senate&#39;s amendment, and to allow a different meaning to attach to the very same words in the immediately preceding proviso ? </para>

If an amendment were made by the Senate introducing the words &#39; &#39; political purposes &#39; &#39; into the interpretation clause, and saying that those words, as used in some particular clauses of the Bill, should have a certain meaning, could we not extend that provision to certain other clauses? </para>

                    <para>- I am not so sure that it would not, but the position would not be so clear as it is at present. I say distinctly that the Senate has inserted a proviso to this particular clause, and has bound it up with the immediately preceding proviso. No one can say that the two provisos are not most intimately connected. The one is the converse of the other, and when we find that the Senate has introduced a provision affecting organizations - which may be other organizations, and, in practice, would be other organizations than those referred to in the immediately preceding proviso - we have a right to say to it, &#34; If you desire that to be included in the enactment we wish to tell you distinctly what we mean by, and what&#39; shall be taken to be the meaning of, the words &#39; political purposes.&#39; &#34; What I desire to point out is that it seems a most dangerous thing that we should be told that an amendment, although it complies with the Standing Orders, and is strictly relevant to the Senate&#39;s amendment, is to be rejected, because its effect goes further. Is not the whole Bill one, and is not every clause to be construed by the light. of every other clause? The amendment of the Senate, providing that organizations shall not be permitted to oppose the granting * of preference, if they come under the ban of political purposes, does not say that the meaning of &#34; political purposes &#34; so used shall be different from the meaning of political purposes&#34; where used in the other proviso. If we are at liberty to say what the words mean in the Senate&#39;s amendment, surely we are at liberty to say what they mean in the other proviso, because of the intimate connexion between the two ! I say that there is no warrant in the Standing Orders for the rejection of the amendment of the honorable member for Bland. There would be a warrant if it were not strictly relevant to the amendment of the Senate, but as it is strictly relevant, there is no such warrant. In note K, on page 677, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bourinot</inline> refers to an amendment in the body of the Bill, consequent upon a Lord&#39;s amendment, given in 120 English <inline font-style="italic">Commons&#39; Journal,</inline> page 197. That is an absolute warrant for going very much further than is proposed in this instance. </para>

                    <para>- In that case the question would not arise ; but if the words do occur in any other part of the Bill it is probable that any definition of them inserted in the Senate&#39;s amendment would probably be held to extend throughout the measure. The Senate has expressed its intention that the two provisos shall stand side by side, and be bound up together, and as we undoubtedly and undeniably have the right to amend the Senate&#39;s amendment, it seems to follow as a matter of common sense, and to be within the expressed words of the standing order, that we can define the meaning that we intend shall be given to the words &#34;political purposes.&#34; Remembering, moreover, that the policy which should actuate a Legislative Assembly is that it should not fetter itself more than is absolutely necessary, I think we should proceed with the consideration of the proposed amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I am very grateful to honorable members for the manner in which they have discussed this matter, although i regret that I am not yet able to materially shift from the position which I felt disposed to take up at the beginning. The Standing Orders make provision for the consideration of amendments, and in dealing with such amendments we are limited, not bv any action which we may take ourselves, but bv the Standing Orders. I find myself confronted with an amendment upon an amendment of the Senate, which, in my opinion, will have an effect beyond the amendment to which it applies, as it specifically covers other ground, and I have to ask myself whether I am justified in accepting an amendment having such an effect. Honorable members have not yet been able to advance satisfactory reasons why clause 55 should be considered as under the consideration of the Committee in its entirety. If the reference to us had been in terms like these, &#34; The Senate desires to secure the insertion of certain words in clause 55,&#34; or &#34;The Senate will agree to clause 55 if the House of Representatives will agree to the insertion of certain words,&#34; it would be competent for the Committee to deal with the whole clause, but, as things are, we can deal only with the amendments of the Senate as they stand. The amendment of the honorable member for Bland creates a difficulty. In using the words &#34; in this section,&#34; he has drawn my attention specifically to the fact that the words which he wishes to define aTe to be found in another part of the clause, and it is his desire to apply his definition to them. If the words &#34;in this section &#34; were omitted from his amendment, there would be no difficulty, so far as I am concerned, because I should only be called upon to rule as to whether the amendment was strictly relevant to the Senate&#39;s amendment. At the present time, the question is not one of relevancy, but of application and effect. I shall be very glad if honorable members can show me that clause 55 is under discussion, and can be amended as proposed. </para>

                    <para>- I was about to say that, to my mind, if the amendment were ruled out of order, it would have a restrictive effect upon our action in the event of any future disagreement or difference with the Senate. I should, therefore, like a course to be taken on this occasion similar to that which was taken some three years ago, when, a highly important question of procedure having been raised, it was, after the Chairman of Committees had given his opinion, referred, on the motion of the present Prime Minister, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I make this suggestion because I think it highly desirable that a definite course of procedure should be laid down by obtaining the opinion of the chief presiding officer of the House. Otherwise we might have two opinions - one governing our proceedings in the House, and the other governing our proceedings in Committee. </para>

                    <para>- As honorable members are aware, the Minister of Defence and myself were forced to consider the amendment of the honorable member for Bland very hurriedly, and, coming to the conclusion that it was not strictly in order, a point of order was raised by my honorable and learned colleague. But, as the debate has gone on, I have become more and more doubtful on the point. I agree with the Chairman that the question is one of some difficulty. We are perfectly willing, however, to withdraw our objection to the amendment. </para>

I wish to withdraw the point of order, to save time, because, if it is referred to the Speaker, there will probably be a lengthy argument. If we are allowed to withdraw the point of order we shall be very glad to do it. I do not wish to obtain a ruling that would have the effect of restricting the liberties of honorable members. I quite appreciate the position assumed by the leader of the Opposition when he says that we should never be anxious to restrict the rights of honorable members in matters of this kind. We have had time to consider the matter in the light of the discussion which has taken place, and do not wish to press the point of order any further. </para>

                    <para>- In matters of this kind one does not desire to be influenced in one&#39;s judgment by the character of the proposal before the Committee. When I drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the matter, it appeared to him, as it did to me, that the amendment went beyond our powers in regard to the Bill. I am free to admit, however, that there is a great deal to be said on the other side. I do not say that I have been converted to the view of honorable members opposite, but no harm, can arise from the withdrawal of the point of order. If a decision be still insisted upon, it is conceivable that the Chairman, or the Speaker, or both, may take a restrictive view, which we might subsequently have occasion to regret. </para>

                    <para>- I do not wish to do anything that will impose any permanent restriction upon debate. I think that it is only fair that we should propose to withdraw the point of order and leave the Committee as free as it was before the point of order was raised. The time devoted to this discussion will not be wasted, because the arguments used will be placed on record, and be available for reference upon future occasions when similar points arise. I submit that, with the concurrence of the Committee, the Chairman might allow the point of order to be withdrawn. I think that we may fairly give honorable members the benefit of the doubt. I may mention to the honorable member for Kennedy that, in the absence of the Prime Minister, it is obvious that I could not take upon myself the responsibility of adopting his suggestion, but I communicated with the Prime Minister directly he entered the Chamber, and he adopted the course suggested at the very first opportunity. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to offer one or two remarks with regard to the contention of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, that, as certain provisions in clause 55 relating to the granting of preference had been passed by the House and forwarded for the concurrence of the Senate, it was beyond our power to in any way alter them. He urged further, that the Senate had made an addition to the clause which introduced totally new matter, having no necessary relation to what we had done in the prior part of the clause. May I point out that the provision suggested! by the Senate cannot be considered apart from the provisions of clause 55. The proviso is connected with the words which immediately precede it, and is merely an addition to the clause as adopted by this House. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as separate and distinct. The Senate would probably not have agreed to our proposals if it had been precluded from adding the words contained in the amendment. That being so, the argument of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat that something entirely new has been proposed, appears to me to fall to the ground. We are really dealing with one provision which has been constructed in two parts by this House and the Senate respectively. If that view be adopted, possibly a great deal of the difficulty felt by the Chairman will disappear. </para>

                    <para>- I am of opinion that it is not competent for the Committee at present to amend the clause, apart from the proviso proposed to be inserted by the Senate. I hold, further, that the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland would tend in that direction. Against the argument that such a ruling would limit the liberties of the Committee, I desire to say that I have already announced my willingness to accept the amendment, if the words &#34; in this section &#39; &#39; are excised. Honorable members will, therefore, see that there is no restriction of their liberties. I should have preferred that, by the omission of these three words, the decision regarding their application to another part of the clause should have been left to another authority. But I have listened very carefully to the remarks of honorable members, and I again desire to thank them for the assistance which they have given me, and for the manner in which they have addressed themselves to this very difficult question, lt is one for which there is no precedent. I do not think that a similar case has previously occurred, and therefore I have been compelled to rely strictly upon my interpretation of the Standing Orders by which we are governed. I therefore rule that the proposal of the honorable member for Bland travels beyond the scope of the amendment made by the Senate, and that consequently it is out of order. </para>

The last occasion upon which a very important question of procedure cropped up was on the 12th November, 1901, when the point was raised as to whether an honorable member was in order in endeavouring to increase the rate of duty under the Tariff beyond the amount covered by the Governor-General&#39;s message. Upon that occasion the Chairman ruled that it was in order to do so, and thereupon the present Prime Minister suggested that the point should be referred for decision to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline></para>

            <para>Mr.Crouch. - I notice that the standing order provides that if any objection be taken to a ruling of the Chairman, it shall be stated at once in writing, and may forthwith be decided by the Committee. I submit that that means that the Committee should decide the question immediately. I am glad that the Chairman proposes to stand to his guns. I fail to understand why he should be called upon to stultify himself in this matter. I admire a man who is ready to defend a position which he has assumed, and I think that it is a very great mistake for suggestions to be mark&#39; from both sides of the Chamber that the Chairman should abrogate his rights in connexion with this question. </para>

                    <para>- I do not desire to detain the House at very great length, because this very important point has already been considerably debated, but I would point out that any procedure which is likely to affect the possibility of arranging compromises between the two Houses of the Legislature must have a very important bearing upon <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> decisions which will be arrived at. I fesl that it is highly desirable, in the interests of legislative peace, that where there is an element of doubt as between one proposal and another, the leaning should be towards the adoption of that course which offers the greatest freedom for arranging a settlement of any differences which may exist between the two Chambers. I contend that the proposal which I have submitted is in order, because it aims at qualifying an amendment which the Senate has made in clause 55 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. That provision, as it was returned to this Chamber, contains the following proviso: - </para>
                </talk.start>
            </interjection>
            <para>And further provided that no organization shall be entitled to appear before the Court to oppose an application for preference by any organization so long as its rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its, members to do anything of a political character. </para>
            <para class="block">I contend that by inserting that proviso the Senate. has materially qualified clause 55 as it left this Chamber. Had that provision been passed in the form approved by this House, it would have been open to any organization to appear before the Arbitration Court and to oppose the granting of a preference to unionists. The amendment of the Senate has had the effect of debarring some organizations from opposing the granting of a preference. It applies to organizations both of employers and employes, and therefore constitutes a very material qualification of clause&#39; 55. That being so, I maintain that we have a right to qualify the Senate&#39;s amendment by defining the meaning of &#34; political purposes.&#34; Our Standing Orders declare that so long as an amendment is strictly relevant to the amendment of the Senate, it is in order.

                    <para>- I do not propose to argue this matter at length, for, in addition to what the&#39; Chairman has said, the honorable member for Bland, if I may be permitted to say so, has put the case very fairly before you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker-</inline> I merely wish to say that I raised the point of order practically on the ground that the amendment, while affecting that sent to us by the Senate, would not only by its effect, but by the very use of the words &#34;in this section,&#34; affect something to which both Houses had agreed. I refer to the earlier proviso in clause  55,  which I submit it would not be competent for us to affect - at any rate in express terms - by further amendment. I urge that clause  55,  as sent to the Senate, declared that, so far as this House was concerned, no person - and I &#39;use the word &#34; person &#34; in its broadest sense - could ask for a preference except upon certain terms. The Senate inserted an entirely separate proviso, that no person should be able to oppose the granting of preference except on the same terms. Our proposal limits the powers of those who desire preference, and the amendment made by the Senate limits the powers of those who wish to oppose preference. The Senate accepted our conditions relating to application for preference, but the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bland avowedly seeks to limit applications for preference which both this House and the Senate have agreed upon. That was the main ground of my contention.  I  do not propose to labour the matter by quoting the Standing Orders bearing on the question, or what <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> says with reference to it, because I know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that you are familiar with those points.

                <para>I take it that, unless that standing order forbids the proposed amendment, it can be put. The proposed amendment, in my opinion, does not come within the prohibition, and, therefore, may be put. It is no answer to that argument to say that it affects some other portion of the Bill. That is almost the inevitable consequence of any amendment. The Senate, by amending clause 55 in the way it has done - by inserting what I may call a co-relative proviso to one immediately preceding it - cannot have intended that a different meaning should be given to the words &#34;political purposes &#34; in the one proviso from that which is attached to .the use of the same words in the other. As we have a right to define the words &#34; political purposes,&#34; in the one case, &#34;It seems to be perfectly consequential that we should have the right to do so in the other. I feel sure &#39;that common sense and legality agree in giving the Committee power to consider the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- In the first place, I wish to express my extreme regret at having to differ in any way from the ruling given by my honorable friend, the Chairman of Committees. It has always been a pleasure to me to support any decision which he has given in the exercise of his functions, and it is, therefore, with regret that I find myself compelled on this occasion to differ from the ruling which he . has given. I should like, next, to say that if I had any doubt upon the question submitted to me, I should certainly give the benefit of it in the direction of conferring the largest possible powers on this House in determining any issue. I think that in any case of doubt we should rather seek to enlarge the powers of the House, than to limit them. For that reason, if I were in doubt on this question, I should give a ruling in the direction I have indicated. On this occasion, however, for reasons which I shall very briefly state, I have no hesitation in arriving at a decision, lt is true that, as the Minister of Defence has said, there are two circumstances contemplated in the two. provisos - the proviso in the Bill, as sent up from this Chamber, and&#39; that which has been inserted by the other branch of the Legislature. There is the proviso relating to an application for preference, and that relating tq opposition to any gift of preference. But I have to look, not so much at the form, as at the substance of these proposals. When I examine the two provisos, I see that the other branch of the Legislature has most carefully followed, to the very letter, the form&#39; of our proviso in framing that which it has inserted, evidently intending that whatever principle applied to opposition to an application for preference should also apply to any application for preference. The same principle was intended to apply in each case. In fact, the Senate really asks us to insert after the word &#34; Court &#39; &#39; in the proviso which we passed the following words: - &#34;or to appear before the Court to oppose an application for preference by any organization.&#34; Then the proviso would read on as passed by us. The substance of the whole difference between the two branches of the Legislature is evidently that whatever conditions are intended to apply in one case shall apply in the other. The conditions in each case&#39; must be identical. We have therefore not two separate matters, but one, to deal with, and that is the nature of the restrictions which are to apply either to an application for preference or to an opposition entered to such an application. On that ground, I rule that we may determine in any way which the House may desire what definition shall be applied to the words &#34; political purposes &#34; appearing equally in both provisos. The definition which we apply will have reference, not only to the second proviso inserted by the Senate, but also to that of which it forms an essential part - the proviso which was sent up from this House to the Senate. There are one or two other points which I think strengthen that view, but, as on this ground alone it seems to me that the matter is clear, I am content to leave it at that, and to rule that the amendment, if the House pleases to accept it, is one that we may make to the proviso which has been sent down. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been able to carefully consider this amendment, and find that it has the great advantage over all the arguments which we have heard for weeks and months past in reference to this vexed question, that it fairly and honestly recognises the interests of the workers as a whole, that it recognises the interests of unionists and non-unionists alike. I should like to clearly direct the attention of the Committee </para>

                <para class="block">We are now on very different ground from that on which we have been fighting for some months past. The attempt to compel a court of justice to grant a preference, as between unionists and non-unionists, has now been safeguarded by two particular provisions. One of these provides that no such preference shall be given unless a majority of the persons in the industry- that means unionists and non-unionists indiscriminately - approve of preference being given. The other is a limitation, but not of any provision in the Bill. There is no limitation in the Bill. Some honorable members may perhaps misapprehend the point. There Is no limitation attempted as to the organization of or the means of working the unions of Australia, in this Bill ; there is no attempt to interfere with their concerns, affect their organizations, or limit their powers. The proviso is that, before you can get this preference from the Court, you must show that your union or organization - they are practically the same - does not spend its funds upon political agitation. The object of that proviso is plain. It is not to discourage trade unions. Those who are opposed to trade unions do not find me by their side. As I have said over and over again, I am entirely in sympathy with such bodies, so long as they do not attempt to exercise their powers to control their fellow-citizens. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that, after the laboured incubation of this amendment, I shall be allowed to say a word or two in regard to it. I have only just made its acquaintance. I wish to recognise everything that is good in it, though that, no doubt, is a source of keen disappointment in some quarters. I am not going to be made to appear to favour the limitation of the legitimate political rights of any man or body of men. We have got beyond that day. But we, on this side, have stood up against allowing any organization or body of men to obtain preferences from Courts of Justice which distinguish between one worker and another, except under certain safeguards. So long as the objects sought to be attained are in the true sense public objects, common to every man in the community, whatever his industry, I am opposed to any limitation of freedom. What is it that the amendment wishes to separate from the prohibition of the Bill ? First we have &#34; the regulation and preservation of life and limb,&#34; the passing of legislation for the preservation of the lives and limbs, not of trade unionists only-, leaving their fellow-workers uncared for, but of all workers in every industry. Is there any one who objects to legitimate agitation for the improvement of the laws relating to the preservation of life and limb ? If so, I am not with him. Such agitation might have been objected to 200 years ago, but I do not think that it is looked upon with suspicion in Australia nowadays. I have no desire to discourage and ban it. I say to the trade unionists and to the working men of Australia, &#34; So long as your object is the general good of the workers, without claiming any right or privilege to yourselves which is denied to your fellows, I have no objection to your agitation for the improvement . of your conditions.&#34; The next thing that is provided for is &#34;compensation for injuries or death.&#34; We all know that that has been recognised as a subject of legislation in every country in the British Empire. There is no such country where such laws are not in existence, and I have no objection to any agitation for their improvement. But, like every other movement, it must commend itself to the intelligence and good sense of a majority of the electors and of the Legislature. The right to express opinions on these subjects, with a view to securing reform, is one which I deny to no man, and to no body of men, but I should strenuously oppose an agitation for a special law to preserve the limbs and lives of unionists only, no care being taken 3f non-unionists. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that it has not been advocated, but I am drawing a distinction between the track which my honorable friends have been following for weeks past, md that which they are now on. They have now come back to a common ground, in which we can meet them. The third subject is &#34; sanitation.&#34; Does any human being object to agitation for the improvement of the sanitary laws of the country? I do not, so long as the sanitation is to include the dwellings of non-unionists as well, as of unionists. I would object to sanitation which passed over non-unionists foi the benefit of unionists. The preamble, however, covers both parties, and confirms the principles for which we have been fighting so steadfastly during all these weary months. We have asked that no discrimination shall be made in these matters between those who are members of organizations and those who are not. I welcome my friends back to the broad ground of national legislation. The fourth subject is &#34; the sex and age of employes.&#34; There have been laws on the statute-book even of the mother country for a long time past preventing inhumanity by the employment of children of tender age in industrial occupations whose burdens they were unfit to bear, and prohibiting conditions under which the sexes have been employed together in a manner repulsive to every feeling of modesty and self-respect.&#39; Who objects to agitation for the improvement of such laws, so long as not only the unionist boy and the unionist girl, but all boys and girls are legislated for? The fifth subject is &#34; hours of labour.&#34; In many of the States the hours of labour in. some occupations are already regulated by statute. In Victoria there is such legislation affecting the miners, and I believe that there is similar legislation in New South Wales. The Postmaster-General,. when Minister of Mines and Agriculture in that State, had the honour to pass a law which very much improved the conditions of the miners, and although he tried to provide for a limitation of &#39;hours of labour, he failed to do so, because of the action of the more conservative House of the Legislature in throwing out his proposal. Then there is legislation on the New South Wales statute-book regulating the ages at which children may be employed. T have no objection to any man, or any number of men banded together in a trade union, taking political action to bring about even better legislation upon such subjects, though, before such legislation can have effect, the electors and the Legislature of the country must agree to it. The &#34; remuneration of labour &#34; is another legitimate subject for political agitation by the workers of the Commonwealth. I do not wish to limit the healthy individual freedom of any man or of any body of men in Australia. We have so far-been dealing with a widely different subject, with the demand that a Court of Justice shall use its powers to make distinctions in every-day work between one man and another. That is a different thing from preventing individuals from agitating for domestic reform by the improvement of laws relating to the comfort and the conditions under which workers are employed. I should be very sorry to think that any member of this House wished to impede such activity. The &#34;protection of salaries and wages&#34; has, I understand, been provided for in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I think there is no one who does not sympathize with the abuses which have occurred over and over again through men who, after working week after week on a large contract, have, when it is finished, been deprived of their wages, sometimes by misfortune, and at other times by dishonesty and fraud. Is there any one who does not sympathize with the desire of the workers to secure the payment of the wages which they have earned? Now I come to the last of the matters enumerated in the amendment of the honorable member for Bland. I understand my honorable friend to wish to embrace all matters that cannot be specified, similar in character to those that are mentioned. The honorable member will see that the words &#34; conditions of labour generally,&#34; might permit of the circulation of a socialistic propaganda. I know that the Honorable member does not wish to use ambiguous words that can be construed in two or more different ways. I feel quite sure that he does not wish to introduce, at the end of the amendment, a provision that will be more important and far-reaching than all the others, and to couch the provision in .general words, the meaning of which cannot be easily understood. My honorable friend does not draw up amendments in that spirit. My desire is that the matter shall be clearly expressed, and I suggest that, for the words &#34;conditions of labour generally,&#34; we should substitute the words &#34; similar conditions affecting employment.&#34; There is another amendment that I would suggest, namely, that the word &#34; industrial,&#34; in the opening paragraph of the amendment, should be excised. The term &#34; industrial matters &#34; is there used in a general sense, and not in the technical sense in which it is employed in other parts of the Bill. Under the interpretation clause, the term &#34;industrial matters &#34;.has a technical definition, and it would be as well to avoid any possibility of confusion. </para>

                    <para>- I am very glad indeed that the Prime Minister has seen his way to accept the amendment. I think that it will tend to a large extent &#34;to soften the feeling which has undoubtedly arisen with regard to the attitude of the Government in respect to the Bill. I should like to say - and this is the only reason why I made an interjection whilst the Prime Minister was speaking - that it seemed&#39; to me that he was travelling over the old ground to a certain extent. There should be no misunderstanding in the country as to the attitude maintained by the- Opposition with regard to the matter referred to by the right honorable member. We never for a moment advocated anything with the slightest intention of influencing the Court and causing It to deviate from the strict path of official duty. Nothing could be further from the truth than to suggest that we had any such intention, and nothing could be further from the effect of the provisions advocated by us. There is not a line in the Bill, or a syllable, which dictates, to the Court that it should ever give preference irrespective of the circumstances connected with the application. All the Bill says about preference is that the Court shall have the fullest power to give or refuse, according as it thinks just or right, and if not a single word of limitation had been inserted in the Bill, there would not have been the smallest possibility of influencing the Court except by evidence and legitimate argument. But limitations have been imposed which are not found in any other similar measure. These limitations, which were not objected to by the members of the Opposition, relate to the notice to be given to persons interested in any application made to the Court, as to the nature of the organization which shall be entitled to ask for preference, and&#39; other matters. I say, without any fear of successful contradiction, because the Bill itself will show it, that the only fight on the part of the Opposition in relation to the matter of preference has been conducted with the object, not of gaining an advantage for unionists over non-unionists, but of assisting unionists to achieve their legitimate aspirations, which are directed to the good of labour at large. If there had been the least indication of a desire on the part of the Labour Party to insert in the Bill any provision that would have given the unionists an unfair pull over non-unionists they would have found me opposing them. </para>

In relation to this amendment, for which I am to some extent responsible, I desire io point out that there has been no departure by the Opposition from the position taken up from the first, and I do not think it is fair to represent to the country that we are now abandoning the fight in which we have hitherto been engaged throughout the discussion of this Bill. We must place oh record the fact that our efforts in regard to preference have been in the direction of enabling unionists to secure the amelioration of the conditions of labour for all workers alike. </para>

                        <para>- Then let us remove the misunderstanding, if one has existed. Does the right honorable gentleman wish to have it believed - I do not think he does - that the unionists and the Labour Party, who are supporting them, are endeavouring to steal a march upon the non-unionists of this country ? The demands we made were legitimate, and this amendment is in perfect consonance with them, because the unions which are endeavouring to improve the conditions of labour would be placed at a decided disadvantage if there were no power to grant preference. The penalization of the unions would be so great that they would be deterred from making any efforts to advance the cause of labour. When we admit that any political purpose that has not for its object the advancement of labour of every kind, whether organized in unions or not. is indefensible, so far as preference is concerned, we make no departure from the principles we have advocated from the beginning. </para>

                <para class="block">The two great points upon which the Prime Minister relied find no place in this Bill. The first point had reference to political interference with the Court, and the second, which he urged constituted a departure from the position to which we assent in this amendment, was that an undue advantage had been sought on behalf of unionists. Neither of these matters finds any place in this measure. I wish it to be remembered - and I desire to place the fact upon record - that the great advance which has been made in liberalizing this measure is not due to the Government side of the Chamber, but rather to the Opposition. </para>

The honorable member for Wannon has asked whether the honorable and learned member for Indi is in order in discussing the general principles of the Bill. My reply is, &#34; Certainly not.&#34; But I would point out that the honorable and learned member is not now discussing the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- When I was interrupted, I was discussing nothing but the amendment. The Prime Minister stated to-night that what was embodied in the amendment was all that the Government had fought for. If that be so, it is remarkable that no such proposal ever emanated from them. It remained for the Opposition to bring forward, not only in principle, but in form, an amendment which I venture to say will exercise a very beneficial and enlarging influence upon the whole measure. I believe that it will not only satisfy the desires of the real friends of the Bill, but that it will go a long way towards conquering the bad feeling which has been engendered in our discussions. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member had not been upon his feet more than five minutes before he showed unmistakable indications of great disappointment ; and from that moment his speech has been a tirade against the Government - not for resisting the amendment, but for adopting it. I speak as an outsider, who was absent from the Chamber when the proposal was adopted by the Prime Minister. But it does not take one long to understand the honorable and learned member for Indi. The five minutes during which I was present in the Chamber were sufficient to convince &#62;me that though the honorable :ind learned member had begun his speech by expressing pleasure that the Government had adopted the amendment, he was really sorry that they had done so, and is now anxious that the country sha.ll know that he is the designer of it. He informed us in a modest way that be had had &#34;a little to do with it &#34; himself. From the moment that I saw its phraseology, I recognised the designer. Although, as a whole, that amendment is unobjectionable, it contains certain words which are utterly unnecessary, and which have been inserted only to parade something with which the honorable and learned member has never exhibited any sympathy, namely, a desire to help non-unionists. Why do we require, at this stage, any definition of what are &#34; political purposes &#34; in the case of non-unionists? They have no organizations, and no attempt has been made to limit them in any way. This piece of legislative &#34; burly &#34; is thrown into the amendment merely as a sort of political bird lime, and to give to the public the idea that the party for whom the honorable and learned member now speaks has throughout been most anxious to assist the non-unionists of Australia. </para>

Is this amendment designed by the honorable and learned member to indicate that henceforth unionists and non-unionists are to be a happy family, and that no harsh terms of opprobrium are to be applied to the latter? If that were so, one would hail the amendment with unlimited pleasure, because it says - &#34; Political purposes &#34; in this section does not include obtaining or maintaining provisions applying to all persons in any particular industry - </para>

                        <para>- The whole purpose of the amendment is to place something like a definite interpretation upon the word &#34; political.&#34; Though the proposal is designed not to block other matters from being held to be of a non-political character, it practically lays down the lines upon which the powers of existing unions may be exercised without depriving them of the right of having their cases adjudicated upon by the Arbitration Court. But in the case of non-unionists, everybody who reads these words, even with a minimum of literary * intelligence, must realize that they are utterly unnecessary. If the honorable and learned member for Indi, as the creator, or even one of the parents, of this amendment, imagines that the public of Australia will think that the Labour Party have always been anxious to provide for the non-unionists, as well as for the unionists, he is welcome to his belief. But, although I hold that the words to which I have referred are utterly useless, they are quite harmless. As an affectation of good-feeling towards the non-unionists, they have no value. The public have been reading the debates upon this Bill for months past, and they know the attitude which the Labour Party has assumed towards non-unionists. The word &#34; scab &#39; &#39; has been thrown across this Chamber over and over again ; and the honorable and learned member for Indi is entirely in sympathy with the use of that word. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the honorable and learned member&#39;s repudiation, I withdraw my statement, and apologize most humbly. He has addressed the Committee as if the acceptance by the Government of this amendment constituted a complete vindication pf his attitude upon the question from beginning to end. I have no hesitation in saying that the object of the amendment was not only to embarrass the Government, but to embarrass the whole of their supporters before the people of Australia. It has utterly failed to do so. If there ever was anybody who was &#34; hoist with his own petard,&#34; it is the honorable and learned member. I regard the amendment really as a concession, because so long as the word &#34; political &#34; remained undefined, it was quite possible to contend that the advocacy of such a scheme as the nationalization of the tobacco industry was an allowable function of trade unions. But the honorable and learned member for Indi has now laid it down, in terms to which I cannot take exception, that the functions which those organizations are permitted to discharge are purely of an industrial character. Nobody has contended for a moment that a trades union should not be permitted to use its organization for any and every such political purpose, so long as it did not attempt to make itself a sort of seed-bed of Socialism - a kind of nursery for the espousal, of the nationalization of State industries. </para>

                        <para>- As one of the most pronounced individualists in this Parliament, I hail the amendment with confidence, because under its operation the wings of these organizations will be clipped, so as to prevent them being used for unlimited political purposes; and that owing to the efforts of the Labour Party itself. Who could object to this proposal? The &#34; preservation of life and limb &#34; does not involve any political principle. Neither does the question of &#34; sanitation &#34; nor of the &#34; sex and age of employes. &#39; &#39; &#34; The hours of labour &#34; is a matter upon which unionists are justified in seeking legislation. &#34; The remuneration of labour &#39; 1 relates to the wages which a unionist shall be paid. I have justified the existence of trades unions for many years. Seventeen years ago, I published a magazine article, a considerable portion of which was devoted to justifying trade unions as a means of dealing - through their officers - with a large body of men, whom it would be impossible to reach individually. Nobody can object to a trade union maintaining a particular rate of wage, any more than one can object to a bank maintaining its rate of interest, or keeping down its rate of discount. Passing on to the matter of the &#34; protection of salaries and wages,&#34; I claim that that constitutes merely a repetition of the same thing. The last words, if I may say so without any warmth, have a somewhat dangerous aspect. Although every lawyer in this House is aware that the doctrine of <inline font-style="italic">ejusdem generis,</inline> when applied to this provision, would have the effect of limiting irs operation to matters of a kindred nature to those which precede it, it is desirable that the public should understand that the last of this category may be intended as a sort of drag-net to bring in a number of matters which were not included in the preceding paragraphs. As long as it is perfectly clear that it is not intended by paragraph 8, to include matters which are not covered generically bv the preceding paragraphs, I shall have no objection. There is one other objection which I am sure that honorable members generally will recognise. In the last sentence in the general provision, which precedes the category, the phrase, &#34;The following industrial matters &#34; is used. &#34; Industrial matters &#34; is a term that is defined in the interpretation clause. </para>

                        <para>- Then, I see no objection to the proposal. I can only say that I am very glad of the opportunity to convince any one who has any doubt about the matter, that, although I may, at times express myself very emphatically upon industrial questions, I have always been an advocate of trade unionism. I have no desire to see trade unions limited in their functions, as long as they are not used, contemporaneously with their being adopted for the purposes of this measure, and as organizations which non-unionists may have to join, as seed-beds for political purposes, which have nothing to do with that which I should call legitimate union, work. Subject to that condition, I hail the amendment with pleasure, and I say quite seriously to the leader of the Opposition, that, so far from regarding it as a concession on the part of the Government, or of rabid individualists, I should look upon it as a definition which has a curtailing rather than an extending effect upon the term &#34; political &#34; as used in the Bill in which it is to be inserted </para>

                    <para>- With regard to the remarks made by the Prime Minister, I may say that I have no objection to the elimination of the word &#34; industrial.&#34; If that be done, it certainly will not limit the operation of the proviso, and it may perhaps prevent any conflict with the term &#34;industrial matters,&#34; as defined in clause 4. Coming to paragraph 8, I think that it would perhaps be as well to substitute for the words &#34; Conditions of labour generally &#34; the words &#34; Other conditions similarly affecting employment.&#34; That would remove the objection which has been put forward. The honorable and learned member for Parkes has stated first of all that he regards this amendment as a restriction of the original proposition. Considering that the original proposition, if insisted upon, would have debarred unions from taking part in political agitations of any character, I fail to see where the restrictive effect of this amendment comes in. The effect of the original provision was certainly to prevent a union from taking any political action with respect to matters of the most legitimate character, and having no relation to party politics. </para>

                        <para>- It was drafted by the honorable and learned member for Corinella, and subsequently modified, as the result of a proposal made by the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs. The honorable member for Parkes has spoken of the anxiety which, according to him, has been suddenly displayed by honorable members of the Opposition for the interests of non-unionists. Curiously enough, the Labour Party draws the greatest amount of its support from non-unionists. Does the honorable and learned member mean to say that in New South Wales the unionists would alone be able to return to the Parliament the number of labour members who are elected? The honorable member also knows that Sydney, where the bulk of the unionists of New South Wales reside, has the smallest measure of labour representation. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Lang, the honorable and learned member for Parkes, and also the honorable and learned member for Wannon, have fallen into an egregious error in regard to this matter. In my experience of unionism, the only men to whom such opprobrious epithets have ever been applied are not the non-unionists as a class, but that particular section who are ready to step in, and accept work under conditions against which unionists are striking. Men who take work in an industry in relation to which there is a strike in progress, have had applied to them by unionists generally such terms as &#34; scabs &#34; and &#34;black-legs,&#34; as well as other opprobrious epithets. But non-unionists generally are not .of this class. They are men who, from one cause, or another, are not in the ranks of unionism, but who, in the vast majority of cases, are in absolute sympathy with the efforts of unions to better the conditions of the working classes. That sympathy is made manifest, not only in the political arena, where, as I&#39; have said, the Labour Party derive the largest proportion of their support from non-unionists, but also in connexion with serious labour disputes. When the maritime strike took place, men who had never been organized put their hands in their pockets, and liberally assisted the unionists who were struggling for what they considered to be reasonable conditions of employment. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The great bulk of non-unionists have always manifested their sympathy with trade unions, and that fact has always been recognised by the unionists themselves. Unionists have never been so selfish as to refuse to share with others the benefits they have won. With the exception of one or two union&#39;s, which have attempted, as honorable members opposite have said, to set up a sort of close corporation - a proceeding to which 1 have for many years offered the most strenuous opposition - every trade organization has been glad to throw open its doors to non-unionists, and to share with them the privileges which their energy has succeeded in winning. In these circumstances, it is ridiculous for the honorable member for Parkes to argue in the way he has done. There is certainly no foundation for the suggestion that our amendment has been put forward merely with a view to embarrass the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I did not think it desirable to publish the proposed amendment until I had satisfied myself that it was framed in the best possible way to secure the object at which I was aiming, and at the same time to insure its meeting with success. One is justified in these circumstances in refraining from publishing the terms of a proposed amendment until he is quite certain that it is in the best form. The amendment has been submitted with a genuine desire that unionists shall be allowed to take part in legitimate political agitation - in political movements in which they have been able to engage for years - a right of which it would be most improper for us to attempt to deprive them. I ask leave to amend the amendment by omitting the word &#34; industrial, &#34; and also to amend paragraph VIII. so that it will read, &#34; Other conditions similarly affecting employment.&#34; </para>

I do not know whether he is, but I know some honorable members who are. The honorable and learned member for Parkes is a consummate actor. I venture to say that no honorable member who may speak to-night in the way that he has done will be secretly boiling over with indignation, as he is, at the action of the Government in accepting the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Every book and every article that the honorable and learned member has written shows that he is absolutely opposed to the labouring classes of Australia. Whenever he has had an opportunity to strike a blow at the labour movement in Australia he has done so. He would now endeavour to hoodwink the Committee, and lead it to believe that he is glad to see some action taken in the interests of labour. The position taken up by him is most amusing&#39; I may say that there are other actors in the Committee, and that the Prime Minister is amongst them. I do not make this assertion in any malignant spirit. </para>

                        <para>- We saw tonight .the most consummate piece of acting that it has been our privilege to witness for some time. I enjoyed in a quiet way the exhibition of sincerity made by the Prime Minister in accepting the amendment. It was also amusing to listen to his eulogy of the State Government of which he was the head. He asserted that that Government had rendered great . service in the interests of labour, but when he appealed to the Postmaster-General it seemed to me &#91;that the information received from that honorable gentleman discounted his statements. He was reminded that the State Government of which the right honorable gentleman was the head did not carry the Eight Hours Bill. </para>

                        <para>- But did not place it on the statute-book. I wish to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to one or two inaccuracies in the statement made bv him in accepting the amendment. What did the Government do in the first instance? Did they not propose to accept the amendment as inserted by the Senate? Although the Prime Minister has now accepted the amendment, he had previously moved that the Committee agree with the amendment of the Senate, which would prevent the members of organizations from exercising the rights which he is now willing to give to them. Therefore, one of two things must have happened. Either he did not give sufficient consideration to the Senate&#39;s amendment, or the interest in the unionists and the non-unionists of Australia, which was so prominent a f feature in his speech, was created in him very suddenly. I congratulate him upon being able to wheel round so quickly,, and accept an amendment of this kind, after doing all he could to defeat it with a view to the passing of an absolutely contrary proposal. I think that the amendment of the honorable member for Bland will greatly improve the Bill, and will tone down a great deal of the opposition which would otherwise be shown to some of its provisions. The Prime Minister took the various parts of the amendment one by one, and said, in regard to each of them, &#34;No one can object to this; no one can object to that.&#34; The Opposition never objected to giving the trade unions the fullest opportunity to move for legislation on all these matters. The amendment of the Senate, however, to which the Prime Minister wished the Committee to agree, would have prevented unionists and others from utilizing their funds for political purposes without defining the meaning of those words, and in this way I believe that every union would have been prevented from expending a penny in securing the return of any member of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps not. However, the only way to secure the amelioration of the conditions of the labouring classes is to return to Parliament men who will pass legislation dealing with compensation, hours of labour, sanitation, and so on. If the unionists do what they were told to do when the strikers were being tried at Deniliquin, they will seek to redress their grievances at the ballot-boxes, and not by strikes, and the amendment of the honorable member for Bland will enable them to do so by allowing them to spend money in securing the return of candidates pledged to advance the subjects named. </para>

                        <para>- They will be able to spend their money in returning members to this Parliament ito secure for them every reform which can be obtained under the Constitution. Therefore, under the amendment, -the definition of &#34; political purposes &#34; will be as wide as is necessary. Instead of the unions being restricted in the employment of their funds in a manner which, to my mind, is not right, they will be allowed to employ them in any way they choose. </para>

They will thus be able to support the return to Parliament of men who will give them the laws which they desire. I congratulate the Prime Minister upon the way in which he was able to turn round. After fighting against a provision of this kind, he is now accepting it. </para>

                    <para>- I have risen solely to elicit one or two facts which ha%&#39;e not yet been put before the Committee. We have before us an amendment which will allow industrial organizations to take action in seven specified and one general direction, without being thereby prevented from obtaining preference from the Arbitration Court. It is clear that all the Liberals -in this Chamber, I myself amongst them, are fully seized of the advisability of giving unionists the right to endeavour to alleviate the conditions of the working classes in the manner proposed. That has been made abundantly clear by the speech of the Prime Minister, which, in my opinion, is the best which has been delivered on this proposal. Until the honorable and learned member for Indi, and the honorable member for Hume, spoke, there was no discordant note amidst the general jubilation with which the amendment was received. But the honorable member for Hume has gone further than any other honorable member who has addressed the Committee on the amendment. He has told us that, under it, the industrial organizations* formed to facilitate the administration of the measure, which non-unionists will be compelled to join because of the preference clause, will be able to declare for what parliamentary candidate their members should vote, and for whose return they will devote their funds. </para>

But, if, for the sake of argument, every party in the political arena proposed to forward the objects stated in the amendment, the question would arise, to which of these parties should the funds of the organization be devoted, and the settlement of that question would be in the hands of one or two persons. </para>

                    <para>- I am in the exceptional position this evening of having no longer to fight for the political liberties of those whose position was endangered by this clause. It is no longer necessary to point out that honorable members who were ostensibly discussing the preference clause were really discussing the subject now before the Committee, because what they objected to. chiefly was, not the manner prescribed for the determination of the majority affected by an application for preference, but that the men and women who constitute the trade unionists of this country, and who have done so much for the emancipation of their fellows, should be allowed to continue their good work. I hope that the Prime Minister will accept my congratulations on his marvellous conversion in this matter. So sudden a conversion by one holding such a high position was never before seen in the history of this, or any other country in the world. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased to hear the right honorable gentleman say that. To my mind, the Prime Minister estimated the chances of carrying a motion antagonistic to the proposal now before the Committee, and discovered, on counting heads, that place and power depended on his backing down, because the common sense and justice of honorable members had been appealed to by those who know what the wants pf the people are. I take no notice of the attempts of the honorable and learned member for Parkes, and his echo, the honorable member for Wentworth, to square their consciences with the acceptance of an amendment against whose principle they have been fighting for weeks and months past. Non-unionists, as well as unionists, have obtained benefits from the efforts of the latter, and I am glad that &#34;the &#34;Prime Minister has now consented to allow them to continue their good work. As a legislative enactment cannot be framed to distinguish between unionists and nonunion.ists, the Prime Minister is making a virtue of necessity. It is absurd to say that we are backing down because we do not differentiate in this amendment between unionists and non-unionists. All along the line the non-unionists have benefited from the sacrifices made by unionists. The honorable and learned member for Parkes, an aristocrat of the individualistic school, has changed his opinions. He cannot translate himself to this side of the House, and has had to square his views with those of his leader. I sympathize with the honorable and learned member. He certainly is not made df the material which will enable him&#39; to leave the Government side of the House and join those with whom he now professes to be in sympathy. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. Like the unions, our ranks are open to all. I regret that the honorable and learned member so far forgot his dignity as to make references to certain terms applied in the heat of the debate by some honorable members on this side to non-unionists. Those remarks were directed, not to non-unionists generally, but to those of a certain type who, like criminals, have shown themselves prepared to rob their fellow-men of that which they had acquired by their own labours. It is a slander upon the non-unionists as a class to apply to them the terms which the honorable and learned member has repeated this evening. </para>

                        <para>- My remarks refer only to a certain type of non-unionists. There are good and bad in all sections of the community. Among the members of the profession to which the honorable and learned member belongs there are to be found some of the greatest scabs and blacklegs that ever existed. Whilst we are much indebted to the honorable members who have evolved this amend&#39;ment, since it will have the effect of rendering the Bill less objectionable, we are also entitled to congratulate ourselves upon the light which the action of the Government throws upon the circumstances which led to the removal of the&#39; late Government from office. It is now evident that the motion upon which the late Government were ejected from office was a mere make-believe and a sham, and I desire nothing better than the opportunity that will be afforded to me a- little later on to explain the whole position to the people of the country. The amendment is not all that I could desire, but I recognise that compromise is a leading principle of politics, and that, so long as we do not sacrifice principles, we are sometimes justified in making concessions to the views of others. Whilst, however, the clause relating&#39; to preference remains in the Bill in its present form, even this concession will not satisfy the unions. I shall vote for the amendment, inasmuch as it affords the best way out of a somewhat difficult position, and reserve to myself the right to exercise my vote at a&#39; later stage in the manner that I think necessary Po conserve the best interests of those I represent. </para>

                    <para>- A marvellous change, the full purport of which I am not yet able to appreciate, has come over the spirit of our dream, and our actualities in the House, since I went to tea. Apparently it is a good thing to go to tea. When I left the Chamber a question had been raised by the Minister of Defence as to whether the amendment was in order. Upon my return I find that the point of order has disappeared, and that the Prime Minister has accepted the amendment. I think that that is good work for two short hours. All around me there is a chorus of congratulations upon. the amazing readiness of the Prime Minister to adapt himself to his changing environment, which the honorable and learned member for Parkes, who is a great Spencerian, would tell us is one of the marks of fitness to survive. That organism which can adapt itself to an ever-changing environment is the best fitted to survive in this best of all possible world&#39;s. </para>

                    It is impossible not to look pleased when I find that among the faces around me not one is awry. I think, however, that it is not so much the prospect of passing trie amendment, as the hope of reaching home for Christmas, that is casting a beautiful halo over everything. Although I may look&#39; pleased, I am yet in some doubt as to whether this amendment will accomplish all that is claimed for it. When one considers tHe readiness with which honorable members who have never shown any leaning in our direction have adopted tha amendment, and the amazing unanimity with which they are now smiling a cheerful acquiescence, such a doubt is excusable.

                        <para>- Then, are we to understand that the powers of the unions under this amendment are to be limited to political action only in cases where a candidate advocates only these matters set forth in the amendment? What appears to me to be obvious is, as the honorable member for Gwydir said, that we already enjoy the rights which it is proposed with this flourish of trumpets to confer upon us. Every union has the right to agitate for the improvement of the conditions of employment, and, so far as I know, has always claimed the right to exercise it. The method which they generally adopt is to send out a circular letter, or to ask a candidate, either publicly or privately-, whether he is in favour of such and such a thing which the union desires to see brought about. If the candidate is favorable to the views of the union, and he is the only one among those who represent themselves who leans in that direction, it would appear to be the obvious and undeniable duty of the union to support that man. </para>

                <para class="block">I take it that the amendment of the leader of the Opposition does not deprive the words which I have just read of the limitation which they impose upon the clause. When a proviso limits the effect of a clause, and, later on, some powers are, by exception, taken from the proviso, all the matters which are not specifically mentioned in the exception are still forbidden by it. That is the rule generally applied to the interpretation of a statute. Consequently, it would seem that as the expenditure of fund&#39;s under this provision for certain purposes is forbidden, and as in the exception to the proviso - which is what the amendment of the honorable member for Bland practically amounts to - power is not given to expend funds in that direction, funds may not be so expended. Therefore, the rights of unions are limited, so far as their action in this particular direction is concerned&#39;. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt. It appears to me clear that the effect of the amendment of the honorable member for Bland is to confer upon them the power to do certain things. But it does not provide them with the means with which to do them. And if what I have said be true regarding the words dealing with the application of funds, it is also true regarding the other part of the proviso which refers to organizations of a political character. In the amendment, &#34;political character&#34; is defined as not including certain matters. But as those in themselves are of no value if the method by which alone they are to be obtained is barred, I have serious doubts whether the amendment means anything at all. Nobody can predict how far the Arbitration Court will say that it extends. We must be glad that we live in a time when fixity of principles is no longer regarded as the mark of a great man, and when that politician is considered the nearest approach to a statesman who can, within half-an-hour, make such a <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> as we have seen to-riight, and find himself supported by the whole of that gallant, but rather discordant dishevelled phalanx which sits behind him. </para>

                    <para>- I am very glad that the Government have accepted the amendment. From the beginning, I failed to see any objection to allowing trade unions to agitate politically for a direct amelioration of the conditions surrounding the employment of their members. I did object, however, to compelling men to subscribe to funds which, were devoted to that purpose. However beneficent the object may be, I hold that men ought not to be obliged to subscribe to it. I regret that the Committee did not accept the amendment which I submitted upon a previous occasion. Personally, I am of opinion that it is a great mistake to endeavour to ban expressions of opinion of any character. 1&#34; assure the honorable and learned member for Indi that there has been no . change, at all events, in my attitude upon this question. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the slightest objection to doing so. . The Bill actually endorses agitation to a certain extent. If honorable members will look at the definition clause, they will find that &#34; association &#34; is there defined as &#34; an organization composed of representatives of employers or employe&#39;s, or for further protecting the interests of employers and employes.&#34; These organizations are allowed to be registered: seeing that we allow them to be registered is part of the machinery of the Bill. </para>

Why not allow members of organizations to agitate directly ? The Bill impliedly recognises the right of members of trade unions to agitate politically for the direct amelioration of their conditions ? I cannot see any logic in saying that whilst we &#39;approve of the right to agitate by allowing unions to become organizations, we shall not permit them to agitate directly. What we really should do is to define &#34; political&#39; purposes &#39; &#39; to mean &#34;industrial matters.&#34; The latter term includes all matters relating to work, pay, hours, privileges, &#38;c.

                        <para>- Could not Tom Mann stand upon a platform and advocate the absorption of certain industries upon the ground that such a step would lead to the better remuneration of labour? I do not object to the amendment, but I do object to forcing men by means of a preference to subscribe, whether they like it or not, to trade unions. Upon the whole, I welcome the amendment as a concession in principle to the desire of some honorable members, that unionists should be allowed as hitherto to agitate for a change in the conditions of labour in the direction contemplated by the appointment of an Arbitration Board. </para>

                    <para>- Tomorrow morning the people of Australia will be rather dumfounded when they read the utterances of the honorable and learned member for Parkes. I am pleased that in him we have a convert who has informed us to-night for the first time that he is in favour of everything which is contained in this amendment. I hold in my hand a little work upon <inline font-style="italic">Liberty and Liberalism,</inline> the author of which is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith, who is none other than the honorable and learned member himself. If honorable members will take the trouble to peruse that interesting work they will be astounded at the change of front which we have witnessed to-night. Upon page 358 of that publication I find the following : - </para>

                <para>I turn now to the subject of legislation for the registration of factories, of which a startling example already exists in the Colony of Victoria; having been placed upon the statute-book within the last two years. The provisions of that Act have been conveniently summarized by one of the leading local manufacturing firms for the ready comprehension of their employees. The following is that summary : - &#34; No one under thirteen can be employed in a factory. No female can work more than forty-eight hours in a week. No male under sixteen can work more than forty-eight hours in a week. No girl under sixteen can be employed between the hours of six in the evening and six in the morning.&#34; </para>

I would remind you, sir, that the amendment relates to such matters as the preservation of life and limb, compensation for injuries or death, sanitation, the sex and age of employes, the hours of labour, the remuneration of labour, the protection of salaries and wages, and other conditions similarly affecting employment. The quotation which I have read from, the book written by the honorable member for Parkes is certainly relevant to such questions as hours of labour, sanitation, and Che age and sex of employes ; but <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not propose to make any further extracts from it. The honorable member also issued a paper relating to strikes. </para>

                        <para>- No; but the honorable and learned member for Parkes goes much further. In this book he stated that he was opposed to the very principle which he has accepted to-night, because it would prevent the manufacturers from obtaining cheap labour. I am pleased to learn that he now thinks it undesirable that children under thirteen years of age should be allowed to work in our factories. But why this change of front? When the people of Australia learn to-morrow what has happened in regard to this measure, I think it is well that they! should also learn who they have to thank for it. It has not been due to the generosity of the Government. Throughout the afternoon the Ministry have been doing all in their power to prevent this amendment being considered by the Committee. </para>

The question which was considered this afternoon had absolutely nothing to do with the merits of the amendment, and I shall ask the honorable member to refrain from making any statement which might reflect on honorable members who supported the point of order relating, not to the merits of the case, but to a purely technical question. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in the habit of exceeding the bounds of legitimate debate, or pf reflecting on honorable members, but I wish to show what led up to the acceptance of the amendment by the Government. It is my duty to let my constituents know to whom they are indebted for this proposal. They are indebted, not to the Government and honorable members opposite, but to the Opposition, supported by three honorable members, who let it be clearly understood that unless the amendment were carried the Government would not remain much longer in office. I am delighted at the change of front which has taken place on the part of honorable members opposite ; but they will have some difficulty in explaining their position to members of the Employers&#39; Council, and still greater difficulty in explaining their action to those non-unionists for whose interests they recently professed so much anxiety. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member certainly does not relish the position. He is afraid that he will be called upon for an explanation. Honorable members opposite will not be able to claim any credit for the passing of this amendment, and they will have the greatest difficulty in explaining why they suddenly decided to accept a proposal against which they have really been fighting for years. I am not. enamoured of the Bill. Unfortunately, even if the amendment be carried, it will not assist us to ward off one of the greatest disasters that has ever overtaken the Commonwealth. I have good grounds for fearing that within the next six months Australia will be in the throes of an industrial dispute compared with which the last maritime strike will sink into insignificance. Unfortunately, we have done nothing to avert the threatened disaster. Although the Government have agreed to accept the amendment, I am far from satisfied with what is being done. If honorable members opposite think they, have made too great a concession to the Opposition, I invite them to join with me when the resolutions are reported, in voting against the adoption of the report. This measure will not do very much for the great mass of the workers of Australia*. I know that honorable members opposite are under the impression that they have made a great concession to the Opposition. But in what way have they done so? I agree with the honorable and learned member for Werriwa that this amendment is a limitation, but it is not such a limitation as he would like to impose on the actions of unionists. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I desire to do. An honorable member who reads the views put forward in this book will immediately join the Labour Party. I hope that the honorable member for Parkes will continue to show improvement in this direction. I shall not further detain the Committee; I have not spoken at any length, and rarely do so, but I wish the people of Australia to know that they are indebted- more particularly to three honorable members of this House, and to the Opposition generally, for the fact that the Bill will be a more liberal measure than that which only -a few hours ago was likely to be thrust upon them. </para>

                    <para>- It is pleasing to realize that after the great conflict of opinion which has occurred during our consideration of this measure, harmony once more prevails. Now that our little differences have been settled, why should there be any exhibition of annoyance on the part of the Opposition? Is there some feeling of disappointment? Do they consider that they have obtained something which was not worth &#39;asking for, or is their annoyance due to their realization of the fact that by the action of the Government, in accepting the amendment, they have gained nothing more than that which was already in the Bill ? So far as I am able to understand the situation, the definition of the term &#34;political purposes,&#34; which is contained in this proviso, is already covered by the interpretation clause, which defines the meaning of &#34; industrial matters.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- An honest effort was made by us to provide that the funds of unions should not be used for political purposes, but it may be that our intention was not clearly defined. I am amongst those who have been prepared from the first to go as far as possible in that direction. What I desired was to prevent the utilization of the funds of a union in the way disclosed in &#39; the case of the Australian Workers&#39; Union.&#34; It cannot be fairly said that the. Government, or the honorable members supporting them, have attempted, by voice or vote, to prevent the workers of Australia from using their influence and such funds as they can command, to improve their position; but we object to their using such funds to deprive their fellow workers, who cannot see eye to eye with them on questions of party politics, of the means of gaining a livelihood. I am glad that we are coming to a better understanding of the position. There has been, not so much a difference of opinion between the Opposition and those on this side of the Chamber as a misunderstanding. I cannot, however, see why there should be a feeling of distrust in the minds of honorable members opposite now that the Government have accepted the amendment of the leader of the Opposition. Although that amendment may put the position more clearly, it does not go any further than the provisions already in the Bill. There is not a single paragraph in it which is not, in my opinion, covered by the interpretation of &#34;industrial matters.&#34; The honorable member for Hindmarsh says that they are not indebted to honorable members on this side of the Chamber for any concession. I do not quarrel with him for that statement, but he might extend a little consideration to honorable members on this side. </para>

                        <para>- I have yet to learn that all the sweet reasonableness of the race exists among honorable members of the Opposition. As the honorable member has spoken of the possibilities of industrial strife, I wish to express the opinion that those who profess to do so much for the benefit of the workers should make themselves conversant with the industrial conditions which are now confronting our people. They should consider whether the workers are able to live up to the doctrines preached by their leaders. If they think that by working six hours a day for five days a week they can produce as much material wealth as is produced in other countries by people who work ten hours a day, T hope that their ideas will be realized, though I fear that they are mistaken. Those who preach these doctrines forget that the workers of Australia have to obtain a livelihood in competition with the workers of the world. The difficulty is not so much a question of wages as a&#39; question of obtaining work. Unless there is work to be done, this Bill, good as its objects may be, will not confer upon the workers the benefits which they expect to receive from it. </para>

                    <para>- I do not see now what we have to fight for. It seems to me that the war is over, and that we can lay aside our Winchester rifles and cannon. We can rejoice that we have brought conviction to the Government, that they have seen the error of their ways, and have repented. The sinner who has repented is received, even at the eleventh hour, with as great a welcome as the sinner who repents in the first hour. While the lamp continues to burn, the vilest sinner may return. Now that the Government have repented, we should be prepared to give them absolution. I am sorry that the honorable member for Hindmarsh has abused them. He should rather have praised them for keeping a mind open to the preaching and teaching of the Opposition. I was afraid that this show would have been burst up at Christmas time before we had done anything. The honorable and learned member for Parkes had a great deal to say about the action of members of the party to which I belong in calling non-unionists scabs. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member is labouring under a stupendous multiplicity of hallucinations. The men whom we call &#34; scabs,&#34; &#34;black-legs,&#34; and &#34;red herring, black-hearted roosters,&#34; are those who leap into the breach whenever there is a strike, and rob of their bread and butter unionists who are fighting for some great industrial principle. In America, the immoral beef trust has forced up the price of meat so high that thousands of poor persons have to live without meat ; but, notwithstanding this increase in price, the butchers of Chicago recently reduced killing wages, with the result that their men went out on strike, and their places were filled by others to whom we apply the terms &#34;scabs,&#34; &#34;blacklegs,&#34; or any other name which would give expression to our eternal contempt for them. It must not be forgotten, however, that thousands of non-unionists vote for members of the Labour Party. In my division there are only 1,000 unionists, and yet I polled &#39; oh the last occasion between 4,000 and 5,000 votes. Where should I have been if it had not been for the non-unionists? I do not get in by the votes of a minority, and whenever I am returned to Parliament it may be known that the country I come from&#39; has been pretty well stirred. I think that, now the amendment of the leader of the Opposition has been accepted, we should place the Bill on the Statute-book. It will be two years yet before Parliament dissolves. </para>

                        <para>- Those who speak of an early dissolution may have common-sense, but they are destitute of uncommon-sense. Let us put the measure on the statute-book, and then, if it does not work, we can remedy our mistakes by means of an amending Bill which will do what is required. I do not wish it to be thought that I am satisfied with the present Bill, because I am not. But I am willing to give it a trial. We should prove all things, and cling to those which are good. We on this side are the friends of labour. No doubt honorable members opposite are also the friends of labour. We, however, are the friends of organized labour. While many honorable members opposite exalt industries, we as a party exalt labour. Labour owes nothing to civilization, but civilization owes everything to labour. </para>

                    <para>- I shall not detain honorable members very long, . and desire merely to echo the idea underlying the remarks of the honorable member for Moira when he said that we had been misunderstood. The words of the song, &#34; Not understood,&#34; must often have occurred to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> during this debate. I shall not repeat them now, for two reasons - first, because to do so would lengthen your onerous task, and you would probably rule me out of order; and, secondly, because I do not know them. We on this side of the chamber were fighting for the great democratic principle of majority rule, and we now discover that honorable members opposite, when that principle, upon which they were elected, conflicts with the principle of preference to minorities, are ready to give way to it. There has been a misunderstanding, but now we are all in agreement, though we discovered the fact but an hour or two ago. The supporters of the Government desire that the unions registered under the Bill shall be primarily industrial, not political and shall be used to ameliorate the conditions of the people and improve the lot, not of a small section, but of the great body of the community. We have discovered now that we are in agreement with honorable members opposite on that subject too. They also now believe that the benefits of the measure should be given to the whole of the people, and not to a limited section of the community, so that there has been another misunderstanding in that case. I should not have risen to speak had not one or two honorable members appeared to be astonished at the action of the Prime Minister in accepting this new-born baby around which we are all clustering, full of hope and satisfaction. When the leader of the Opposition offered it to him, he would have been justified in remembering that it is dangerous to trust the Greeks, even when they come bearing gifts; but he did not show any distrust, nor make any Cassandra-like cry. He paused for a moment or two to see whether the baby was in order, and, having discovered that it had none of the ailments to which children are frequently subject, that it had not the thrush or appendicitis, although the investigation may have disclosed a Semitic origin, he received it into the bosom of the party. I make these remarks to show how unreasonable some honorable members are. The head of the Government . did no more than any person would have done in social life. He merely saw that the child was reasonably satisfactory before receiving it into the home circle. It is a matter for regret that during these debates honorable members have not shown a little more consideration for one another. Now that honorable members opposite realize that we are prepared to go as far as we can in the direction of real reform, they should withdraw some of the undesirable but characteristic statements which they have made, with the object of prejudicing us. We felt all through that the progress of the country depended, not upon any class or sect, nor upon our legislating in favour of minorities, but upon our passing laws in the interests of the whole of the people. We know how our forefathers had to fight against the privileged classes, and yet in the twentieth century we have been asked to set up another privileged class, which desires to govern the masses of the community. Our refusal to do this has been the cause of difference in regard to the matter now under consideration. Now that the golden gates have been opened, through which every man can. march unmolested to his labour, and without being compelled to belong to any organization created to advance the interests of any small section, harmony should prevail, and it might be acknowledged that each side of the House has been misunderstood by the other. </para>

                <para class="block">Whilst I accept it as the lesser of the &#39;twoevils between which I have to choose at present, I shall at a later stage vote against it. I represent organizations which have been built up at infinite trouble. Many of the men connected with these organizations have spent years in gaol because they have stood up for their industrial and political rights, and I do not feel prepared at this stage to accept anything but the full measure pf political liberty which has been gained at such great cost: Some years ago we were told distinctly that the only effective way in which we could redress our grievances as unionists would be by securing political power. The Judges advised us from the bench to seek our remedy through the Legislatures. Now that we have made our organizations so strong that we have compelled our political opponents to swallow the principles of a lifetime, an attempt is being made to deprive us of some of our most valued privileges. In Australia, and in other parts of the world, the two antagonistic forces of labour and capital are struggling with all their might to obtain the upper hand, and we cannot afford to consent to any legislation which will have the effect of rendering our organizations less powerful or effective than they are to-day. Our principal means of achieving our ends is political action, and I object to limitations such as those which would be imposed under the amendment. There are many. matters upon which the trade unions should be free to take action other than those which would be embraced by the provisions of the amendment. Whilst I admit that the amendment will to some extent minimize the injustice which would have been done to unionists, it will still involve a large surrender of their powers. I was very pleased to hear the statement of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat that the trade unions will not be affected unless they register themselves as organizations for the purposes of the Bill. If that be so, the measure will not interfere with our organizations, because they will refuse to come under its operation. The Bill was introduced in this Chamber, in the first instance, for the purpose of tiding over an industrial difficulty, but it has now assumed such a shape that it will prove a curse, because it will deprive the organizations which avail themselves of its machinery of their liberty of political action. They will have no power to combat the operations of the large trusts and combines which are now operating to the serious prejudice of the workers, and which, in other countries, are grinding them down to the depths of slavery, and I cannot, therefore, place the stamp of my approval upon any such legislation. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members opposite have endeavoured to persuade the public that they alone represented the interests of the workers, but it must be clear that honorable members on this side of the Chamber ,had only) one object in view, namely, to secure justice and equality for all classes of the community. Honorable members . opposite started with a determination to secure unlimited preference to unionists. If that demand had been conceded, the unions would have become an immense political power, and the Bill would have -been used as an instrument for capturing the whole legislative forces of the Commonwealth. Having been defeated upon that point, honorable members shifted their ground, and desired to secure unqualified political power for the organizations registered under the Bill. In my printed address to the electors at the last election, I indicated that I yielded to no man in my desire to see justice done to the workers, and I stated that I would support every legislative measure designed to raise them and improve their condition. I do not find in the amendment any departure from the lines which I laid down for myself on that occasion. As far as the paragraphs contained in the amendment are concerned, I am in entire sympathy with them. </para>

                        <para>- That is impossible, because there has been no change in my attitude. I claim that I have always exhibited a desire to advance the interests of that portion of the community which enjoys less privileges than do the minority ; but I shall always resist any attempt to coerce any section of the people. To-night it has been demonstrated that this Bill has practically been a stalking horse for party considerations. To-night we have found a solution of the difficulty which confronted us, and we have discovered that from a humane stand-point there was practically nothing separating the rival parties in this Chamber ; but I consider that the Opposition have secured a concession in principle upon which they are perfectly justified in congratulating themselves. </para>

                    <para>- I welcome the action of the Government in accepting the amendment of the leader of the Opposition. I do not &#39;regard their action altogether in the light of a victory for honorable members upon this side of the Chamber. I consider it is rather a triumph of the democratic principles which permeate this House. It is idle to deny that there is a good deal of democracy upon the Treasury benches. At the same time I shall fight to obtain a change in certain amendments which have been effected by this Committee. I am not content with the Bill, but I believe in the principle of accepting a bun- if you cannot obtain a whole loaf, and I am prepared to trust the other Chamber to alter its defects. I welcome the amendment before us, and I trust that when the measure has been disposed of, we shall devote ourselves to legislation for the welfare of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ROBINSON</inline> (Wannon).- When this Bill was being discussed in another place, I felt that a great deal of weight attached to the considerations urged by some honor able senators there, and that the word &#34; political &#34; ought to be defined to prevent a prohibition being imposed upon the discussion of industrial matters. Accordingly I was sorry that a more earnest attempt was not made to give a better definition to that term. I do not object to trade unions in any shape or form. The attitude which I have consistently adopted is that I object to any body of men being coerced into joining those unions which have political objects. I know that the honorable member for Kennedy is of opinion that we have destroyed the usefulness of the measure, and I understand that it is his intention to vote against the adoption of the report. What makes the Bill obnoxious to him, to a large extent commends it to me. I think that the Government have done right in accepting the amendment. It practically involved giving away nothing, because I am of opinion that the contention of the honorable and learned member for Angas is correct, and that under the interpretation clause, trade unions could have agitated upon the matters referred to in the amendment without being interfered with by the Arbitration Court upon the ground that they were spending their money for political purposes. I think that that is a sound position to take up ; but, as it might lead to litigation hereafter, it is wise to place in this clause a distinct statement of what are to be considered political matters. I am glad that the honorable member for Kennedy entertains the belief that the &#34; fangs &#39; &#39; - so to speak - of the Bill have now been drawn. </para>

                    (Bland).- Whilst the prohibition imposed upon the right of unions to take part in politics has been agreed to in a form which meets the objections that I entertained upon that score, I must say that, in the absence of any proper provision for granting a preference, free from restrictions which, in my judgment, will render, it impossible for those organizations
                    <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                    comply with the procedure laid down in the clause, I feel that this Bill will not accomplish the results which we all hope for. Believing that the whole effectiveness of the measure will be impaired by this provision, it is impossible for me to take the responsibility of recommending it to the electors. I am of opinion that it will toe absolutely ineffective, owing to the restrictions imposed upon the granting of preference. I am fully convinced that with those restrictions it cannot achieve the object for which it was originally put forward, and consequently I cannot recommend anybody outside of this House to place any faith in it. At the same time I do not feel inclined to object to the adoption of the report, because the Senate has yet to consider the Bill in the form in which it is returned by this Chamber, and it is just possible that it may hit upon some method of regulating the granting of a preference which will meet the objections of honorable members opposite. In that hope I am quite prepared to agree to the adoption of the report.

                        <para>- The view I take of this matter is that for those who desire a Bill of this sort at all, it would be a great advantage to have on the Statute-book the foundation for a system of arbitration. If, as the result of an appeal to the electors, it transpired that we were wrong, and that the Opposition was right in the position taken up by us with respect to the three or four serious matters on which we differ, it would be infinitely more easy for my honorable friends - provided they commanded the support of a majority of the electors - to give effect to the views they have at heart by amending a measure which was already in operation than it would be for them to undertake the terrible responsibility of building up the whole measure and passing it through the two Houses of Parliament. If the fabric of the principle of arbitration were placed on the Statute-book it would make the path of my honorable friends towards their goal much easier than it would otherwise be. I most earnestly commend that view to the serious consideration of the Opposition. It is admitted that nineteentwentieths of the provisions of the Bill have been accepted by both -Houses, and that there are only one or two points - I admit that they are most important matters of principle - at issue between us. If a- majority of the electors approved of the stand taken by the members of the Opposition it would be far easier for them, on coming into power, to be able to introduce a short amending Bill, whose provisions need not occupy twenty lines, to give effect to their views, than it would be for them to go over the whole work again. I earnestly submit that view to the consideration of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>- This will probably be the last opportunity that honorable members will have to express their opinion with regard to this measure, and I think it is desirable to make my position clear. I totally disagree with the suggestion of the Prime Minister, that this Bill would lay the foundation of a whole system of arbitration, and I very much regret that in passing this legislation we are about to set a very bad example to the States Parliaments. This Parliament has been elected upon the broadest possible franchise, and as it has been elected by a democratic people, its legislation ought certainly to be democratic. Nevertheless it has imposed restrictions upon the self-government of industrial organizations that are not to be found in any of the State legislation on the subject. These restrictions, to my mind, must retard the whole movement of trade unionism. Every one must admire the heroic struggle which trade unions have made to secure better conditions for the workers. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that I am not clear as to the limits of this debate, but I am endeavouring to follow the lines adopted by the Prime Minister. In spite of the fact that the Government accepted the last amendment proposed by the leader of the Opposition, I consider that the Bill is unsatisfactory. We have invited the State Legislatures, which will have to deal with this question, including the Parliament of New South Wales, which will shortly be called upon to consider the desirableness of re-enacting the State Conciliation and Arbitration Act, to interfere with the most important of all principles - the right of trade unions to seek to improve by constitutional means our social and political life. To my mind, this Bill will interfere with the free exercise of the franchise. Honorable members are unanimously of the opinion that trade unions have a legitimate right to seek to improve the conditions of the working classes, and yet many honorable members who profess to hold this view would restrict their operations in that direction. I deny that there is any attempt to coerce men to join unions, or that labour members seek to control such bodies. The idea is absurd. </para>

That report covers the decisions of the Committee on the four amendments which came to us from another place. Any discussion which bears upon either one of those amendments, or the whole of them, would be in order ; but any debate on the general aspect of the measure will not be in order. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the field of discussion is wide enough to allow me to clearly explain my position. I have not Spoken since certain amendments have been under consideration, and I do not wish it to be understood that my silence means approval of the decision of the Committee. I have, from the very outset, taken a great interest in this measure, and I wish to clearly define my attitude. An effort has been made in the most unfair way to interfere with the operations of trade unions, and I hold that as the result of the passing of this measure, the work of these admittedly noble institutions will be hampered. I am opposed to the restrictions which have been imposed. Trade unions have always done their very best for all persons engaged in the industries which they represent. Hence I say that the limitations which have been imposed will retard the whole movement for the betterment of the conditions of the workers. The measure will not be found satisfactory, and I throw upon the Government the whole responsibility for it. It is true that they have not been in charge of the Bill from the outset; but the Government in office, when it is finally passed, must bear the whole responsibility, because they need not have taken it up in the condition in which they found it. I refuse to accept the responsibility of being a party to the adoption of certain of these clauses. I accepted one amendment because it was the best we could get; but I feel satisfied that the measure, as a whole, will be unsatisfactory, and I wish to enter an emphatic protest against it. </para>

                    (Kennedy).- Before the vote is taken, I wish to say that I shall vote against -the adoption of the report, because I believe that it relates to certain clauses which will destroy the effectiveness of the Bill. I believe, that unionists in coming under this measure, will be making, a great sacrifice in the interests of industrial peace, and that they will not receive anything like the return which they are entitled to expect. They are entitled to receive full preference in compensation for the sacrifices they are making, and it was the general idea of the framers of the Bill that that should be extended to them. The refusal of the Committee to grant it, is one reason why I shall vote against the adoption of the report. I shall vote against it because I am also opposed to class legislation of the kind of which a majority of the Committee has approved in trying to exempt certain sections of the community, namely, the agricultural labourers and the domestic servants, whose present position is little better than slavery, from the operation of the measure. I am also opposed to it because it attempts to take from organizations the right which they have enjoyed for many years past to use political influence for the redress of grievances. The workers have been continually urged to take that course, but the Bill practically prevents them from doing so. Having stated the reasons why I cannot support the measure, I shall content myself with voting against it.

                    (Wentwortb).- As one who at the last elections opposed the measure, I feel that I owe it to my constituents, as well as to the House, to explain my reasons for the course which I now propose to pursue. I do not intend to state now the reasons which actuated me in opposing the Bill, because I set them out fully in my second-reading speech. Some of those reasons have disappeared, because of the amendments which have been made in the measure. It has, however, been borne in upon me during the ten months that we have been in session, in which period we have been engaged chiefly on this measure, that there is a very strong majority in this Chamber and in the country who desire to have the Bill passed into law, and I can see that if I were to exhibit the spirit of factious opposition which has been displayed by honorable members opposite, I should not be advancing the cause of my constituents.

                    (Gwydir).- I wish to say a word or two in justification of the vote which I intend to give on this matter. I have already shown pretty plainly that I cannot vote for a Bill which takes from the unionists rights and privileges which have been given to them by State laws. I have not changed, my opinion, but the Bill is taking from the unionists rights which they have enjoyed ever since we obtained constitutional government, although by means of a compromise we have got back some of these tights. I am opposed to the Bill as amended, because it does not give preference and full political liberty to unionists, and therefore I shall vote against it being placed on the Statute-book.

                    <para>- The action of the Government in connexion with the Senate&#39;s amendments leads me to take a pretty serious stand at this stage. I anticipated that the proposals of the Senate, in regard to the inclusion of farm labourers and domestic servants, and the removal of the workable restrictions placed on the granting of preference, would have been accepted by the Government in a spirit of compromise. They have, however, disagreed with all three amendments, and I understand that they accepted a part of the amendment of the honorable member for Bland, enlarging the political freedom of unionists, only when they found that a number of members would leave their ranks and vote against them if they did not. If, in my opinion, the&#39; Bill requires too great a sacrifice from those who were primarily responsible for its introduction - the trade unionists of this country. I believe that after another ejection ot two at most, with their present freedom unrestricted they will be able to exercise their political influence to such good effect that a majority will be returned here, who will place upon the Statute-book a measure which will not unduly interfere with their liberties as this measure would do. </para>

                        <para>-The action of the Government in trying to have the amendment moved out of order did not indicate a desire on their part to meet us. I am thankful for- what we have got in that amendment, because I think that there is more in it than the honorable member for Kennedy sees there. A very broad and liberal interpretation can now be placed on the political action of unions. Notwithstanding the acceptance of that amendment, however, there still remains the provision which requires applicants for preference to demonstrate to the Court that they represent a majority of those affected. Still, I do not think that this is the stage to vote against the Bill, and I am willing to give an opportunity for its re-consideration by the Senate, because I hope that that House will insist on some proposals for the improvement of the preference clause. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member&#39;s remarks applied to the decision which I was compelled to give, as well as to the action of honorable members in raising the point of order. I regret to be compelled to refer to the matter, but I feel that it is necessary to do so, because I wish the honorable member, and those to whom we are responsible, to know that the merits of the amendment were not under consideration while the point of order was being discussed. I hope that there will be no misapprehension in the public mind on the subject. Those who dealt with the point of order had regard purely to constitutional considerations, and made no reference to the details of the amendment itself. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has misunderstood the position. In the first place, the honorable member for Kennedy asked - as he had a perfect right to do - upon a point of order, whether the reasons could be put separately from the Chair. When such a request is made, it is obligatory under our Standing Orders that the questions shall be put separately. Then, the honorable member commenced his speech, intimating that he had not distinctly heard the reasons when they were first read. Thereupon, I directed the Clerk to read them, and after that had been done, I allowed the honorable member to continue his speech. </para>

                        <para>- The action of the honorable member for Parramatta has compelled me to make a fourth speech. I object to the reasons advanced in the message for the exclusion of agricultural labourers from the operation of this Bill. I believe that that is one class of labour which is likely to be organized throughout Australia in the very near future. It is well known that at the present time strenuous efforts are being made in that direction in Queensland, New South Wales, and other parts of the Commonwealth, and that money is being devoted to that purpose. Consequently, I claim that in the very near future there will be a huge organization of farm labourers. Further, I oppose the reasons embodied in the message, because they do not convey to the Senate what is really at the root of this legislation, namely, the fact that it is class legislation. I realize that it is idle to occupy much time in placing my views before the House&#34;, because the majority of honorable members are opposed to me. Nevertheless, I think that the opinions of the majority should be couched in such terms- </para>

                    <para>- The Prime Minister has declared that the reasons embodied in the message are only . those of the Government. I would point out, however, that when they reach the Senate they will be regarded . as the reasons advanced by this House. I object to the statement contained in reason No. 1, because there is no evidence to show that the conditions of trie farm labourers vary in the different States. I deny that the conditions surrounding their employment vary even as much as do the conditions in other industries. In any case, that is not a sufficient reason for refusing to accept the amendment relating to them. </para>

                        <para>- We know that the Government have other reasons for adopting this course. There is no reason why farm labourers should not be -brought under the control of the Court in the same way as are other workers. The same remark will apply to domestic servants. The maritime dispute of 1891 extended to various unions, and there is no reason why &#39;a dispute among domestic servants should not extend beyond the limits of any one State. The conditions under which domestic servants are called upon to labour are practically similar in all parts of the Commonwealth. Take the position of domestic servants in hotels. </para>

                        <para>- At all events, I disagree with the exclusion of farm labourers and domestic servants. I hold that no one who can be reasonably brought within the provisions of the Bill, should be excluded from it, and that the reasons proposed to be given for the exclusion of these persons are not correct. I . do not know of any debate which has taken place in this House that would support the giving of these reasons. The Government think that because certain workers are not organized, they never will be; but that merely shows that they know very little about trade unionism. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like the House to consider these amendments to-night. Last week I promised the honorable and learned member for Bendigo and others to provide statutory power in the Governor-General to appoint a commander of the troops in time of war, instead of leaving the power to be exercised, as at present, under prerogative. In pursuance of that promise, 1 had inserted, while the Bill was before the Senate, an amendment providing that the Governor-General should be empowered to &#34; appoint an officer or officers of the Defence Force to command the whole or any portion of the Defence Force in time of war.&#34; In the next place, I promised that provision should be made for securing the seniority of the Inspector-General. Accordingly an amendment was made in the Senate providing that the Inspector-General and the Director of the Naval Forces &#34; shall have such seniority and powers as may be prescribed,&#34; the words &#34;seniority and&#34; being inserted. In the Senate, there was also inserted the words &#34; or performed &#34; after the word &#34; exercise &#34; in a place where those words did not appear, although they occurred in other portions of the measure. In omitting the words &#34; General Officer Commanding &#34; in one clause, the word &#34; the &#34; was not also omitted, and an amendment in the Senate has put that matter right. Those are the whole of the amendments made by the Senate, and to enable me to take steps to put the scheme in operation at the earliest date, I ask honorable members to deal with them to-night.

If the Bill be taken into Committee it may be resumed at that stage next session. That, I think, is a reasonable suggestion, because, as I say, there is not the slightest prospect of finishing the Bill this session.

                    <para>- It seems to me that the honorable member for Ballarat desires to do a thing which he did on several occasions in the State Parliament. He wishes to deliver a splendid specimen of oratory, after which other honorable members are not to have a chance to reply. I remember an occasion when he did that in connexion with the religious education question. I took exception to it, insisted on my right to speak, moved an amendment, and pressed the matter to a division. If the Prime Minister will assure us that we shall have fair play all round I shall have no objection to offer, but I do object to one honorable member being given special opportunities at the expense of others. </para>

                    <para>- Some days ago I raised an objection to the course which it was proposed to take in reference to Preferential Trade. The Prime Minister has no right to expect us to attend at half -past 10 in the morning after a long sitting, even to hear a brilliant oration from the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. No doubt it is very pleasant to hear him, and it is quite fair that the Prime Minister should have time in which to prepare a reply. But the question is a very important one, and if there is not to be a general discussion I am prepared to let the Prime Minister and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat have their say, and then to have a division. It is, however, merely wasting time for one honorable member to talk for . four or five hours unless we are to come to a decision. I object to it. When the Prime Minister moves the adjournment of the debate tomorrow, I would advise those honorable members who have anything to say on the subject to insist upon a division or upon the debate proceeding. Under the circumstances, it would be wise for every honorable member who has anything to say to sharpen his little tomahawk in readiness for what will happen. I object to private members&#39; business being put on one side in order that special favours may be shown to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. Why are rights conceded to him which are denied to others? </para>

                        <para>- I should like to point out that I am not asking private members to give up their time. 1 am simply arranging for the course of business in Government time. I promised the honorable and learned member for Ballarat to give him an opportunity to bring on this question, and I am simply carrying out the promise which I made. It is well known that I made it, and I am sure that no honorable member would ask me to break my word. If I can assist any other honorable member I will, as. far as I can consistently with the policy and programme of the recess party. But I desire honorably to discharge my obligations, and I hope that honorable members will re-, collect that that is the object of this motion.. </para>
