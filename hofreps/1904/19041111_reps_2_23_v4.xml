                        <para>- It is stated in a press paragraph this morning that the Prime Minister contemplates giving the Agents-General discretionary power in reference to some of the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. If that be so, will the right honorable gentleman tell the House what are the provisions with respect to which he intends to give this discretionary power, and let us know what the discretion will really amount to, before he does any-? thing further in the matter ? </para>

                                <para>- It is impossible to obtain accurate information, because, if the law prohibits such persons from coming here their knowledge of the fact would prevent most of them from applying for admission. I do not, however, agree that all persons of the classes named would be excluded under the provisions of the Act, even though they came here under contract. All I can promise to do is to cause inquiries to be made with a view to ascertaining what information we have in the Department as to persons having been prevented by the Act from coming to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I rise &#39;to make a personal explanation. During Wednesday&#39;s sitting, while we were discussing the Estimates, the Chairman of Committees ordered me to discontinue my speech, on the ground that I had been guilty of tedious repetition and continued irrelevance. I have since referred, not only to the report which is to be embodied <inline font-style="italic">m&#39; Hansard,</inline> but to the gentlemen who reported my remarks, and I find that there was no justification for that action. I repeated myself only when my speech was interrupted by a call for a quorum, and then, just as in writing a letter one repeats a word or two to show the connexion of the various pages, I repeated a sentence or two to preserve the continuity of my speech. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Standing Orders, the business transacted in Committee is not known to the House until it is reported. But I imagine that the course usually followed whenever an honorable member claims the indulgence of the House in order to make a personal explanation will be followed in this instance ; and that he will be permitted, in his endeavour to clear himself from any imputation that he may conceive to rest upon him, to refer to anything that may have occurred in Committee or in the House. The course of referring in the House to the proceedings in Committee is not a desirable one, but generally speaking the fullest liberty should be permitted to an honorable member who desires, as a matter of privilege or personal explanation, to relate the circumstances under which a certain course was taken with regard to him. It will not be in order for the honorable member for Gwydir to reflect upon the Chairman, but he will be at perfect liberty to explain the circumstances under which a certain course was taken in Committee. </para>

                            <para>- I do not .for a moment desire to reflect upon the Chairman. My sole object is to safeguard other honorable members from &#39;being placed in the same position that I was owing to misapprehension. There is no precedent for the action that was taken with regard to me, and I feel that it is my duty, as the first honorable member who was taken to task for tedious repetition, to state distinctly that I was not guilty of tedious repetition, or of any conduct that warranted the action of the Chairman. </para>

                            <para>- There have been occasions upon which Ministers have tendered such advice, and upon which it has not been accepted. But in such cases, the last thing a Ministry would think of doing would be t&#39;o make a statement to the House. The mere fact of such advice -being given terminates the connexion of the Ministry with the House, because if it be accepted, the House goes, and if it is not, the Ministry goes. The matter is not, in any case, one for this House to discuss. I would state further that I draw a sharp distinction between conduct tending to the disorganization of this House, which is indulged in between three or four members, and conduct which has the formal sanction of the whole of the members of the Opposition. If the whole of the members of the Opposition desire .to reduce this House to a state of impotency, which will make its further continuance useless, and an offence, all I can say is that they have many methods of showing that desire, and that &#39;the moment it is shown, I think that certain questions of serious import will arise which may in the end affect this House very closely. I would, however, be the last person whilst this House is proceeding, as I believe it is as a whole, with an honest desire to transact public business, and to make its existence useful to the public, and whilst&#34; the conduct which tends to disorganization and disintegration has not the full sanction of the Opposition) to make any such statement as that suggested. Some members of the Opposition have publicly repudiated this attempt at disorganization,, and in fairness to the Opposition, I decline to take conduct such as occurred a night or two ago as a proof that they accept responsibility for the obstruction or desire to disorganize the public business. Under these circumstances; the most painful contingency - the extreme contingency - to which the honorable and learned member&#39;s question refers, has not yet come within the sphere of even my private cogitations. I can assure the thirty-six gentlemen sitting on the other side of the House that when they show me in unmistakable terms, or by their conduct, that they are determined to bring about a dissolution at once, my own impression is that that event would not be very far off. </para>

                                <para>- No. The Minister having submitted his defence reorganization scheme, it naturally follows that a very large part of the debate upon the first day that the Defence Estimates are under consideration will have reference to that scheme. Unfortunately, this consecration of military banners is to take place next Monday. I trust that the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Defence, will take action to stop the proceedings in connexion with that ceremonial. Regarding the Minister&#39;s statement that I only gave him notice of my intention to move the adjournment of the House at 28 minutes to11o&#39;clock- </para>

Seeing that the Estimates of his Department are to be discussed to-day, he should have been fully prepared, and, therefore, his statement that this matter should be debated entirely upon the Defence Estimates falls to the ground. I do not desire to do anything which is contrary to the wishes of the honorable and learned gentleman, because I must admit that in this matter he has given me all the information for which I have asked.

                                <para>- I would respectfully submit that my motion covers more than the immediate expenditure contemplated in connexion with the consecration of military banners. But concerning that expenditure, I would point out that you are assuming, sir, that that particular matter will be discussed to-day. I submit that it is extremely unlikely that that will be so. The item is a long way down upon the Defence Estimates, and, consequently, it is improbable that it will be reached to-day. As the ceremonial to which I have referred will take place on Monday next, I would ask you to reconsider the matter very carefully before ruling finally that I cannot proceed with my motion. </para>

                                <para>- I should like to ask your ruling, sir, upon a fresh point of order, and in doing so I wish it to be understood that I have no desire to embarrass the Chair in any way. I think, however, that it is well that we should have this, matter cleared up for our future guidance. I desire to know whether the very fact that a certain number of honorable members have supported the motion of the honorable and learned member for Corio is not practically an affirmation that this matter is one of urgent public importance, and under such circumstances ought it not to take precedence of all other business ? </para>

                                <para>- The fact that five honorable members rose in their places to support the motion of the honorable and learned member for Corio is conclusive evidence of its urgency. In the face of that fact I should not be justified in ruling that the business is not urgent, and could not therefore be brought forward. Our Standing Orders have to be read together, and in view of the standing order which declares that no question which anticipates any other question on the notice-paper shall be brought forward, I cannot&#39; permit the discussion of this matter. It anticipates not only a question on the notice-paper for a particular day, but one which is to come up for consideration immediately we go into Committee. </para>

                    <para>I take this action in order that the Committee may have an opportunity to express its dissatisfaction with the proposal of the Minister to hold a denominational and sectarian service in connexion wth the Royal Review and consecration of banners to take place on Monday next. I have at the outset to thank the leader of the Opposition - who naturally desires on the first item to discuss the question of the re-organization of the Defence Forces - for giving way to me. It is most unfortunate that the Minister was permitted a few days ago to drag a red herring across the track by making a statement as to the proposed reorganization of the Forces, when he could have done so on the motion for the second reading of the Bill to carry out the Government proposals. </para>

                            <para>- I hold very definite views upon this question, but shall reserve my remarks until the Bill which has already been circulated is before the House on the motion for the second reading. That will be the proper time to discuss the whole matter. I ask honorable members to support this amendment on the ground that in doing so they will merely carry out the traditions of the Committee. When the Estimates were before us in 1902 a proposal was made to strike out an item of &#163;200 to provide for the expenses of a religious service in the Exhibition-building in connexion with the coronation, and the Ministry allowed the item to be struck out without calling for a division. The service in question was a denominational one, but the Committee very properly decided to strike out the item on the ground that as every tax payer had to pay equally for the services of the Commonwealth, it was unfair that certain persons in the community who did not agree with this service should be called upon to contribute to the cost of carrying it out. The Minister seems to take up the position that the service to be held on Monday next will not be a denominational one, simply because a number of denominations will be represented at the ceremony. </para>

                            <para>- It will be seen from the quotations from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that the Minister does not remember what he did say, and that he objects to the banners being consecrated by any particular denomination, but not to their being consecrated by particular denominations. I wish the Committee to take notice of the form of prayer, and to inquire as to its source. The first part of the prayer is taken from the Communion Service in the Book of Common Prayer; the second is from the Evening Prayer in the Book of Common Prayer; the third is from the Collect for the fifth Sunday after Trinity, from the Book of Common Prayer; and the last is an original composition prepared by the Minister, or some one acting for him. I intend to read a part of the prayer, since it led to endless sectarian strife in England. If there&#39; is one part of the Book of Common Prayer which it would be unfortunate to adopt for this purpose it is that to which I am about to refer. It led to 2,000 clergymen leaving the Church of England on St. Bartholomew&#39;s Day, 1662, because they did not believe in the King&#39;s supremacy over the Church of England, and in the Divine right of the King to rule churches. They thought the State should confine itself to State matters, and leave the Church to look after religion. They objected to the Crown&#39;s authority over spiritual affairs. It is admitted by historians that some of the most learned, most devoted, and most spiritual members of the church at the time left it rather than submit to a portion of the prayer which the Minister has selected for use. The prayer reads - </para>

I, in common with some thousands of others, will have to attend this service, and many men who are not members of the Church of England cannot accept this prayer if it means that the King has a right to govern any church. Many denominations object to it. In the printed programme of the service, as issued by the Minister, the name of His Majesty appears very properly in large capitals; but it is noteworthy that the words &#34;Holy Spirit&#34; are printed with a small &#34;h&#34; and&#39; small &#34;s.&#34; </para>

                        <para>The prayer will be taken into consideration by all the chaplains who are to take part in the ceremony before it is finally adopted, in order that care may be exercised to see that no expression remains in it to which any denomination might take exception. When this has been done I shall have no objection to a copy of the prayer being laid on the table of the library, in order that it may be perused by those honorable members who desire to read it. </para>

                    <para class="block">We have an example, in the history of the Victorian Bible in State Schools League, of the effect of attempts of this kind to scrutinize and to water-down religious opinions and beliefs. Nearly all the denominations were at first represented in that league, but very soon the representatives of a denomination whose adherents number one-fourth of the population left it. Then the Unitarian representative left it. Then the Jewish Rabbi, and finally the Congregational representative left it, and it was discovered that a collection of Biblical extracts which would suit all denominations would be regarded as having no religious value at all, because with many people, when a matter loses its denominational flavour, it becomes non-religious. This subject has already been raised by some of the denominations. I have received a letter from the Rev. A. Rivett, of Albury, dated 7 th November, who stated that he brought the matter up before the Congregational Union of Australasia. I am informed that a denomination whose adherents number one-fourth of the population will refuse to be represented by their chaplain at the ceremony to take place on Monday next, because a chaplain who represents another denomination has been chosen to be the principal chaplain on the occasion. So that the ceremony is certain to cause offence, and the Committee should support me in my attempt to prevent denominational differences from spreading any further. The Minister said that he would refer this matter to the chaplains of the Department. I asked him if he would allow the proposed prayer to be read by representatives of denominations who are not represented in the Chaplains Department of the Defence Forces; but the Minister said that he would confine the matter strictly to denominations who had representatives. </para>

                        <para>I do not propose to invite any denomination to be officially represented at the consecration 0 f the banners, except those which have chaplains in the Forces. 1 find b.y reference to the Military List, published on the 1st February, 1904, that there are no Roman Catholic chaplains in Queensland. South Australia, and Tasmania; no Presbyterian chaplains in South Australia, and none in Western Australia ; while there are no Independent, Baptist, Unitarian, or Jewish chaplains in any of the States. At the ceremony on Monday next the adherents of denominations not represented by chaplains will number 1,545,000, or one-third of the total population of the Commonwealth. I admit that the proceedings will be countenanced by the representatives of a majority of the population, but I lay it down as a proposition which the Committee should affirm, that where matters of religion are concerned, not one penny of public money should be spent on any proceedings in which a minority cannot take part. The Minister has said that he did not know of colours ever having been presented to a Victorian regiment. </para>

That was because the State at the time had not representative government, and was administered by an autocrat. The Minister has asked what objection there can be to the colours under which our troops have to fight being consecrated with prayer. I would remind honorable members, however, that, nowadays, regimental colours are never carried on the field of battle. Some of the regiments taking part in the South African war possess colours which have been borne in previous fights extending back over a period of centuries ; but nowadays such colours are always left behind at the home station. Therefore, when the Minister spoke of the troops fighting under the colours, he said what was not correct. </para>

I wish to know under what section of the King&#39;s Regulations these proceedings are authorized? In the first place, the King&#39;s Regulations apply only to authorized denominations. I understand that some Methodist chaplains have of late been appointed, but, when the King&#39;s Regulations were issued, the only authorized denominations in England were Presbyterian, Church of England, and Roman Catholic, all representative of State churches.

                            <para>- At any rate, arrangements are to be made for officers to kneel to the person who is to present the colours. That arrangement has received the approval of the Minister. When I spoke to some members of the Committee they expressed a very strong objection to the consecration of the colours, but did not think it was worth while taking any notice of the proposed arrangements. If this is to be the only case of its kind, I do not know that any serious notice need be taken of it, but if we consent to spend &#163;66s.6d. upon this ceremony, and recognise any one denominational service at the expense of the general taxpayer, we shall initiate a bad practice. I trust that honorable members will agree with me in saying that so far as this matter is concerned, the consciences and convictions of those who do not approve of the form which the ceremony is to take shall be recognised. </para>

If any man desires to leave the parade-ground whilst the ceremony is going on, he should be permitted to do so. I asked the Minister whether any of the troops would, according to the terms of the King&#39;s Regulations, be permitted to leave the ground if they so desired. The Minister said nothing whatever would be done to infringe the spirit or letter of the King&#39;s Regulations. I am informed, however, that no troops will be allowed to absent themselves from the parade. The men will be compelled to be present. This is one of the day parades of the year, and will count in respect of a man&#39;s efficiency and pay. If a soldier does not attend upon this occasion he will not be ranked as efficient. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to say only a word or two with reference to the remarks of the honorable and learned member. I do not propose to repeat all the answers I have given to the numerous questions the honorable and learned member has put to me. The fact is that a form of prayer is to be used, and that the leading part in the ceremony of consecration is to be taken by the senior chaplain of the Commonwealth Forces of Australia, who happens to be the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mort,</inline> of Sydney, a member of the Anglican communion. Chaplains representative of each of the denominations having chaplains in Victoria are also to take part. The denominations having chaplains in other States are also represented in the Victorian forces, namely, Church of England, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Roman Catholic. A chaplain of each of these denominations, in addition to the senior chaplain of the Forces, has been requested to attend. This matter arose on the 12th of October, when a paragraph appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> stating that the consecration was to take place in the Anglican Cathedral, Melbourne. That was the first intimation I had, and I immediately had the extract cut out and .sent to the General Officer Commanding, with the following minute: - &#39; </para>

                    <para>The Minister would he glad to be informed what colours are referred to in the above extract from the &#34;Argus&#34;; whether the information therein given is correct; and, if so, whether such procedure is proposed, in view of the fact that there is no established Church in Australia. Any such proposals should, the Minister thinks, be submitted for his consideration before being adopted. </para>

That is, the senior chaplain is to lead,&#39; and the other chaplains representative of each of the denominations which have chaplains in the forces have been asked to be present.. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see any distinction in this case. The chaplains have been requested to take part in the service. What the exact words of the communication were I do not know, because I did not send it. At any rate, they have been requested to join in the service, and I do not think that any of them will refuse to do so. The chaplains are to meet and arrange with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mort,</inline> the senior chaplain, as to how they will divide the duty of repeating the prayers. Of course, from a military point of view, seniority depends on seniority of commission, and the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mort</inline> is senior, because he has been longest connected with the Forces as chaplain. I do not propose to discuss the prayers that are to be offered. The honorable and, learned member for Corio says that they are extracted from the Anglican Book&#39; of Common Prayer. I do not profess to know. I am not an Anglican, but I belong to the Presbyterian Church, about which the honorable member for Kennedy seems so much-concerned. At any rate, I do not know that any non -Anglican susceptibilities have so far been offended in the least degree by the form of the proposed prayers. I confess that I regret that the honorable and learned member has considered it necessary, in the performance of his duty to the public as a member of this House, to act as he has done. </para>

                            <para>- That is true, but, judging from the conduct of honorable members upon some occasions immediately after the prayer has been offered, I think it would be a very good thing if we abandoned our present&#39; practice. The course that it is proposed to adopt in connexion with the consecration of the banners may prove to be the thin end of the wedge for the recognition of a State Church. Of course these evils grow from small beginnings. It is just possible that years hence, when no honorable member of this House will have anything to do with political life, the matter to which I refer may assume a very much larger shape. </para>

To my mind it is likely to prove the thin end of the wedge, and to be quoted in future as a precedent in the direction of the establishment of a State Church. My object in addressing these remarks to the Committee is to place upon record the fact that some protest was made against the proposal of the Government I hope that the service which will be held on Monday next will not be regarded as a precedent. </para>

I say that, as an intelligent body of men, we ought to abolish them. I do not contend for a moment that prayer for His Majesty the King is not good. </para>

                            <para>- I do. I think that all persons belonging to the aristocracy require prayer and everything else upon which they can lay their hands. If Ave dip into history, Ave shall find that the savages of every age had their so-called &#34; medicine men,&#34; \vhom they used to call in to bless the bludgeons and spears Avith which &#39;they went forth to slay their enemies. In America the Geronimo and tiger-cat Apache Indian chiefs never went out to kill their adversaries without first having their weapons blessed by their medicine men. It is about time that we abolished such nonsense. Before General Kuropatkin left Moscow the divine petroleum was showered upon his head, but the Japanese have burnt it off. I believe in prayer, but I believe in prayer according to the injunction in the Scriptures, which says &#34; Pray in your I closets.&#34; The hypocrites pray in the &#34;open 1 market,&#34; whereas genuine Christians pray in their closets. I am surprised that a progressive Ministry in an enlightened ag,e should propose to sanction such a violation of sacred religion. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to point out that, with the exception of the Permanent Forces, no member of the Defence Force need attend the parade upon Monday next. It is quite true that the men can earn a certain maximum pay, but during the year there are more than sufficient parades held to permit of their earning that maximum. They have to attend a certain number of parades - less than the maximum number - in order to qualify themselves as &#34;-efficient,&#34; and to avoid being fined. The result is that no member of the Forces attends all parades. I repeat that no member of the Citizen Forces need attend this parade. Upon Monday next the country troops will not hold a&#39; parade at all - even in their own localities. Attendance at the approaching review, except in regard to the Permanent Force, is entirely voluntary, and I will undertake to say &#34;that any member of that force who has conscientious objections to listening to the prayers which are to be offered upon that occasion need not listen to them. </para>

                    <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CROUCH</inline>(Corio).- As the Minister is aware, many men take advantage of the parade upon the King&#39;s Birthday to assist in qualifying as &#34;efficient.&#34; There is nothing else to occupy their time upon that day. During the year every member of the Defence Force is compelled to attend three whole-day parades, fifteen half-days, and twenty-four night drills, in order to qualify as &#34;efficient.&#34; The Minister&#39;s statement that members of the Citizen Force need not attend simply means that those who do not will be required to forego their liberty upon some other day in order to put in the requisite number of parades. The Minister has also declared that any member of the Permanent Forces who entertains conscientious objections to attending the proposed religious service need not be present. I venture to say that any individual who dared to absent himself from that service would be a &#34;marked&#34; man, and would speedily have his discharge applied for. It is only by protesting against this sort of thing that we can hope to effect any reform in the Forces. I shall either be obliged to hand over the command of my company, on Monday next, to somebody else, or to listen to a service to which, because of the susceptibilities of others, I entertain grave objection. </para>

                            <para>- I am not apologizing, but I wish to point out that with me this is a matter of earnest conviction. Of course the proposed service will not shock the sensibilities of those who believe in a State church, but I am descended from a race which fought against that. I have no wish to obtrude my own denomination into this matter, but, as an Independent, I refuse to even seem to recognise any connexion between the State and the Church. I believe that we, as a State, should adhere to strict secularism. Why should a Jew be called upon to attend this service? There are Jews who are respected members of this House, and, in passing, I may say that I was proud to hear the way in which one of these honorable gentlemen was cheered when he rose a few days ago to protest against an attack which had been made upon him on the ground of his race and religion. Why should a Jew who is a member of our Defence Forces, and who must attend the Review in order to be efficient, be compelled to listen to a prayer to which he objects? It is a scandal that he should be compelled to do so. </para>

All that I ask is that if a member of the Forces desires to stay away, he shall be allowed to do so. I am satisfied&#39; that the Committee has a sufficient sense of fairness to decide that a man&#39;s religious convictions shall be respected, and that any member of the Defence Forces who desires to stay away on the occasion of the Review shall be allowed to do so. Members of the Militia Forces will not be compelled to attend, but the Minister should say to those who will have to do so that they need not take part in the religious portion of the ceremony if they have con.scient ious objections. Some of the Permanent Forces will probably be kept at fatigue duty and other distasteful work if they state that they have conscientious scruples in connexion with this ceremony, and I say that it is an insult to the House and to the religious beliefs of a large section of the community, that the proposed service should take place. I trust that the Committee will not consent to it. </para>

                        <para>- I feel just as strongly as does the honorable and learned member for Corio that no man&#39;s conscientious convictions should be interfered with in any way. If there were one word in the proposed prayer that was tantamount to such an interference, I should say at once that the Minister had done wrong in consenting to it. I. am a dissenter, and do not recognise any State church ; but I cannot conceive of anything in the words of the prayer intended to be used which amounts to a recognition of a State church, or that could possibly be offensive to any one. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind. Surely no one would object to pray that God&#39;s blessing might rest upon the King. I am a preacher in the denomination to which I belong, and, notwithstanding that I arn against a State church in every shape and form, I would use this prayer, rightly or wrongly, in any pulpit I might occupy. If I were Minister of Defence, the service probably would not take place. I do not intend to raise any objection to it, but if I did, my objection would be not to the form of the prayer, but to the consecration of the banners. I should oppose the holding of any religious service in connexion with their consecration. I cannot see the consistency of having prayer associated with the consecration of banners which may float over the heads of men when they go forth to kill their fellow beings. If the honorable and learned member had objected to the proposal on that broad ground, there might have been something in his opposition to it; but we should stultify ourselves if we supported the amendment merely on the lines on which it has been submitted. If the objection had been raised on other lines- </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the views expressed by the honorable member for New England, as to the wording of the prayer, and do not propose to take any exception to it. I have not carefully studied the prayer; but, after all, the objection taken to the wording is only a minor matter. What we have to consider are the important principles underlying the whole proposal, and I think that the Committee is under an obligation to the honorable and1 learned member for Corio for bringing those principles prominently before us. In this new land we have rid ourselves of the old shackles of denominationalism - of a State Church, and a State system of religion - but in this instance we are to have a revival of the old system. </para>

                            <para>- I object not to the wording of the prayer, but to the methods to be adopted in carrying out the ceremony. The honorable and learned member for Corio asked us&#39; to object to the ceremony, not merely because of the wording of the prayer, but because of the broad1 general principle which is involved. It is from that standpoint that I view the question, apart altogether from the technicalities associated with the utterance of a few words of prayer by the representative of some religious denomination. </para>

I endeavour to cultivate the Christian spirit, because I have a profound belief in those verities; but the proposed ceremony will practically require on the part of those who join in it the recognition of a particular church, or a particular form of religion, and will tend to bring the grand and noble aims of the Prince of Peace into ridicule. It is for that reason that I protest against it, and shall support the amendment. I shall support the honorable and learned member, in protesting not against the mere words to be used in the prayer, but against the principle involved in the introduction of a system that must bring the grand and noble religion of Jesus Christ into ridicule, and make it but a mere travesty. </para>

                        <para>- I did not intend to take part in the discussion of the proposed consecration ceremony, but as some honorable members appear to take a different view from that held by the soldiers as to what is meant by serving under the colours, I think it is necessary to briefly deal with the question. Let me relate to the Committee a little incident which took place in South Africa at the time of the Zulu war, in order to show how highly the troops value their colours. Just before the battle of Isandula, the two battalions of the 24th Regiment met in South Africa for the first time since the Peninsular War, and they celebrated the occasion by setting apart a special d&#39;ay for the trooping of their colours. The sentiments which were expressed at that ceremony are so firmly imprinted on my memory that I shall never forget&#34; them. It was a regular gala day for the two battalions. Shortly afterwards the battle of Isandula took place, and while General Thesiger, afterwards Lord Chelmsford, was away with part of the two battalions, the remainder, with the colours, remained in camp. If honorable members had witnessed the anxiety which the men betrayed for the safety of their colours, they would not have anything to say against the consecration which is to take place on Monday next. A banner, after all, is only a bit of silk - sometimes a fragment little better than a rag - but the whole history of a regiment is sometimes contained in it ; and in this case the history of the 24th Regiment was bound up in the little bit of silk which was the subject of such deep anxiety. Honorable members may, perhaps, remember the story of Lieutenants Melville and Coghill, who,; believing the colours to be in danger, tore them from the poles, and wrapped them round their bodies like a cummer-bund. They swam through rivers, they dropped down bluffs, but eventually, in their anxiety to get away, and so save the honour of &#39;.he regiment, they were shot. The first thing that was asked when we came up with the relieving force was, what had become of the colours? Attempts were made to ascertain their whereabouts, and. if honorable members had seen the anxiety expressed by both officers and men about their loss they would not oppose the proposed consecration. The regiment with which I served, the Royal Artillery, had no colours with them, because their colours are kept either at London or Woolwich, I forget which. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know, because&#39; it is twenty-three or twenty-four years since I left the service. Some days after, Lieutenants Melville and Coghill were found with the colours wrapped round them, and their bodies were brought into camp at Helpmakaar, on the Natal side of the Tugela. It seemed to me that the saving of the colours was the only thing that kept the regiment together. The colours are symbolic of the unity of a regiment. The names of the engagements in which it has taken part during its whole existence are inscribed on them, and the trooping of the colours once a year is a great day. Those who have seen the trooping of the colours of the&#39; different regiments of Guards at St. James&#39; in London know that it is a sight always to be remembered. The proposed consecration service at Albert Park will be a similar proceeding, to which I see ho objection at all. If the Government think fit to have these banners consecrated, all I have to say is, let them be consecrated. If I were a member of the Forces, and had any religious scruple about being present at a ceremony of this kind, I would stay away. The Minister said that any one who objects to it&#39; may stay away, so that I do not know what objection there can be to the course proposed. The honorable &#34;and learned member for Corio has told us that men staying away because of religious scruples, or because they object to the ceremony, will have to do fatigue duty. I know that when I served in the ranks my desire was always to get to church, in order to avoid fatigue duty. </para>

                            <para>- I understood the honorable and learned member to say that it made the King the head of the Church, though I could not understand his objection. Similar objection might be taken to the prayer with which our proceedings are opened, but, of course, any honorable member who objects to it can stay away while it is being read. The honorable member for Canobolas has told us that there is a great principle involved. I thought that there was a great principle underlying the proposed religious service at the Exhibition Building, and I was not prepared to vote&#163;200 for it, because I am opposed to anything like the recognition of a State church ; but I should like to know from the honorable and learned member for Corio what denomination takes exception to the particular form of prayer which is to be adopted at Albert Park. Every one of us, in one way or another, when he prays, asks for the blessing of the Almighty, and that is all that is asked for in this instance. 1 do not cavil at the wording of the petition. With regard to the sentiment created by proceedings of this kind, I say that honorable members ought to serve in the Forces if they wish to know the value of sentiment. The colours of a regiment are only a little bit of bunting, but the feeling I had when I saw the flag flying over Rorke&#39;s Drift, when we came up to its relief, was such as I have never experienced before or since. If those who follow the banners which are to be consecrated on Monday next have the same feelings it will be a good thing for them. Take away sentiment, and what have we left? Nothing at all. </para>

I think that it is a good thing to consecrate the banners, though I do not care whether it is done by a Church of England clergyman, a Presbyterian, or one of some other denomination. If the ceremony creates in others the sentiment which was aroused in my own breast, it will be a good thing for them. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corio is, strictly speaking, to reduce the proposed vote by &#163;1, whatever his reasons for moving it may be. I have time and again in this Chamber opposed to the utmost of my ability the reduction of the Defence Estimates, and I take this opportunity to do so again. There has been a great deal of discussion upon the particular matter referred toby the honorable and learned member for Corio, but I wish rather to give reasons why I think that the provision made for the defence of Australia is too small as it is, and why, in consequence, we should not support the honorable and learned member&#39;s amendment. </para>

                            <para>- The dispositions made for the defence of the Commonwealth presuppose an invasion or an attempt by a foreign power to take territory from us, with a view to establishing a colony or naval base in Australia. I do not think, however, that that assumption is a tenable one. I hold that the most likely form of attack would be a raid on our commerce or on one of our chief ports. Australia is too distant from other parts of the world for any important power to contemplate the invasion or seizure of our territory. But we are bringing into existence to meet such a remote contingency a field force, the organization of which seems to have already been practically perfected. Let me give one or two reasons for my opinion that an invasion of Australia will in all probability never take place. The only country which in modern times has carried on a campaign similar to that which would be necessary for the subjugation of Australia, or the seizure of any of our territory, is Great Britain; but, in spite of her enormous mercantile marine, and the great wealth which she possesses, she found the subjugation of a small people in South Africa an almost impossible task. With the exception of the United States, with which I hope we shall never have any difference, there is no power in the world capable of effecting a serious landing on our coasts. Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the fact that an enemy could&#39; not seriously consider the invasion of Australia until after England had permanently lost command of the seas. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the fleets of England may temporarily in time of war lose command of the seas, though I hope that that will never come about. It is also more than probable that long distance cruisers will occasionally be able to evade the British Fleets engaged in blockading the ports of our enemies. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and might happen again. In time of war the duty of the English fleets would be to, as far as possible, blockade the ports of the enemy ; but single cruisers might now and again succeed in slipping through the cordon of British warships, and afterwards try to damage the mercantile marine of Great Britain. And then, with a view to prevent food supplies from reaching that country, they might raid distant ports of the Empire. As it would be virtually impossible, owing to the proximity of the cruisers co-operating with the English Fleets, for such cruisers to attack vessels bringing England&#39;s food supplies near the English coasts, that is, at their point of arrival, they would go further afield and seek to intercept them at their point of departure. And, consequently, I hold that the forms of attack which we have most to fear are such raiding of our ports, and such interference with our shipping, as might be made by a powerful commerce-destroying vessel of the enemy. The protection of our ports may seem of small moment to people living in the country, but as the four chief coastal cities of Australia contain one-third of the population of the Commonwealth, while, with the exception of a few detached lines in Queensland, all our railway systems branch out from them ; as, in short, they are our chief centres of external and internal distribution, their protection is a matter of the utmost importance. A cruiser of heavy tonnage and&#39; fair armament, such as the Russian vessel, <inline font-style="italic">Gromoboi,</inline> which recently visited these waters, would be able to so terrorize our merchant marine as to make it take refuge in these ports, and to intimidate our people to the extent of seriously interfering with the whole business of the country. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. I think I shall be able to show that that will not take very long - that the fact to which the Minister has referred will make it essential to the cruiser to deliver an immediate attack against our shipping and the bases of our shipping. And I will endeavour to show that our ports are not in a position to repel a sudden raid of this nature. Several suggestions have been made with a view to insuring the more effective protection of our ports: The&#39; head of trie late Government suggested that torpedo-boat destroyers should be obtained. The natural objection I have to such a proposal is that the formation of a separate fleet for Australia would not be best calculated to promote the well-being of the Commonwealth, or of the Empire of which we form an important part. Torpedo-boats are most effective for the purposes of attack; and can develop their best qualities only during night attacks and whilst manoeuvring in smooth waters. An enemy&#39;s ship would, however, make an attack under the conditions most favorable for her purpose, and would certainly not at night attack a port defended by torpedo-boats. The second essential for the effective manoeuvring of a torpedo squadron is smooth water - a condition which seldom obtains along our coasts. Therefore, I think we may, for the present, dismiss the suggestion that we should obtain torpedo-boat destroyers. </para>

                            <para>- Submarines, owing to their slowness, are useful more for the purpose of &#39; attacking than for defending ports. A large number of submarine boats are being constructed by France, and also by England, with a view to attack each other&#39;s ports in the channel. A submarine is too slow to attack a moving ship with any certainty. She can direct her movements so as to deliver an attack at a fixed point and in a given time. If, however, an enemy&#39;s cruiser were off our shores, her commander would not insert an advertisement in the newspapers intimating that she would be at a given place at a certain time. I do not think, therefore, that for defence we can place much reliance upon submarines. Our harbor defences must, since neither torpedo craft nor submarines are adapted to our requirements, take the form usually adopted, namely, that of a system of minefields, protected by quick-firing batteries, which are themselves protected by heavy guns of position ; this latter to keep the enemy&#39;s ships beyond striking distance of our mine-field protection armament. With these mine-fields we should be in a different position from that occupied by the Russians at Port Arthur, who largely used floating mines. Floating mines have an enormous moral effect - and, therefore, are most demoralizingly effective - upon an enemy. Our object, however, would be not only to prevent an enemy&#39;s cruisers from coming into our ports, but to enable our own ships to navigate our coasts and harbors with per- &#39; feet safety after the enemy had been driven from our shores. They would, of course, for some considerable time afterwards be exposed to great danger if floating mines were used for the purposes of defence, and for that reason we have to put on one side any idea of adopting them. I hope that very shortly the great powers will arrive at an understanding precluding belligerents from sowing the sea with floating mines. Ordinary mines, such as are used for harbor defences, are intended to prevent an enemy&#39;s ships from rushing past the forts. We have recently had illustrations of the fact that modern ships of war can stand a tremendous amount of battering. One battleship recently arrived at Chifu with such a large number of holes in her that they represented a considerable portion of her superficial area. And an &#39;ordinary armoured&#39; cruiser could undoubtedly rush past any forts we have in Australia. Any mine-fields designed to prevent war ships from executing such a manoeuvre, must be protected by quick-firing artillery of comparatively light calibre. The batteries containing these guns must in every case be protected by heavier guns, capable of preventing a cruiser from approaching within close range. According to May, warships have so &#39;preponderating an armament that if they were able to approach within 600 yards - which is about the range at which they could effectively work all their guns - of a battery of light guns, they would soon be able to put it out of action. Therefore, it is necessary that we should have heavier guns mounted in commanding positions, to make the enemy keep at a respectful distance. We have not in Australia any such heavy guns as are mounted on fortresses in other parts of the world; and I do not think that we require guns of excessively large calibre, my whole argument being based upon the supposition that an attack by an armoured cruiser, not by a fleet or battleships, is what we have most to fear. The defences of Sydney are in a far better position than those of Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly it requires more protection, and for reasons other than that mentioned by the honorable member. If is the naval base for the British Squadron in these seas ; and, although I quite understand that the Imperial authorities undertake the protection of their bases, we cannot ignore the fact that Sydney is specially liable to attack on account &#39; of its being the head-quarters, and of containing the war munitions of the Admiralty in Australia. For this special reason special measures must be taken to insure the safety of Australian interests in and about that port. Well, sir, I have shown the necessity for two forms of batteries - quick-firing batteries for the protection of the mine-fields, and batteries of heavier guns for the protection of the lighter armaments; but, of course, it is of no use to have defences - and we have already spent a large sum upon defence works - unless we have the men to man the guns. We find that before Federation, the States which looked after their own defences had, as a whole, much stronger forces available for immediate use in their forts, than the Commonwealth possesses at the present time. One of the strong reasons advanced in favour of Federation was that our common defences could be made much more efficient than would be possible under the States&#39; Administrations. That promise has been carried out so far as the field forces are concerned; but I regret to say that, there are not now so many gunners available to work our guns at a moment&#39;s notice as there were prior to Federation. </para>

                            <para>- But there is a small cadre force which is used for field artillery instructional purposes. I find that upon the date of its transfer to the Federation, the Permanent Artillery numbered 1,220 of all ranks. Upon these Estimates provision is made for only 755. Furthermore, I find that the Estimates show a decrease of ^140 in the Engineers&#39; vote, which covers the submarine mining engineers. The curious feature in connexion with this decrease is that, whereas the amounts it will have to disburse are less, yet the Accounts and Pay Branch gets more for doing it; consequently, it is not economy in the public estate which has brought about the small reduction in the Engineers&#39; vote. The necessity to keep an adequate permanent force is a matter which has agitated the mind of the chief military adviser to the Government ever since he has been in Australia. The General Officer Commanding, in his report of this year, says - </para>

                        <para>I pointed out last year that the reduction of the Royal Australian Artillery to the existing establishment laid down by the Minister for the Estimates of 1903-4 &#34; can only be viewed with the most serious apprehension, as the numbers are quite inadequate for the duties required of them. The effective land defence of the naval positions on the one side, and of the commercial centres on the other, is most seriously compromised. </para>
                        <para class="block">My point is that the effective land defence of our naval positions, and of our commercial centres, is seriously endangered by maintaining this force at its present insufficient strength. That is the opinion of the principal military adviser to the Government - a gentleman whose counsel upon this matter has been repeatedly disregarded, although the first duty of this Parliament is to safeguard the lives and property of the people intrusted to its charge.

That is a large proportionate increase, but I hope that, in view of the unqualified statement of the General Officer Commanding, this Committee will see its way at an early date to sanction it. I think that a gentleman who entertains such a high regard for the responsibilities of his position as does the present Minister of Defence, will shortly realize that our ports and shipping should be safeguarded from attack, and to this end will carry out this very strong recommendation of the General Officer Commanding to increase the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the force in question. </para>

                            <para>- I am extremely glad to know that the Minister has been so prompt to deal with the matter. It augurs well for the Department that we have a man of his energy at its head:. I also desire briefly to refer to the mine-fields which are required to prevent a sudden rush past our forts. Although the number of mines seems to be sufficient for the purpose, I find that in Victoria they cannot be laid down in less than three weeks. </para>

                            <para>- I . think that my statement is absolutely incontrovertible. It is tolerably well known that the mine-fields, which are available for the protection of Port Phillip, can only be laid down by the present force of submarine miners in three weeks. The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of that force could hardly be augmented in time of danger, because the laying of mines is a very delicate business. In my judgment, the submarine mining vote for Victoria should be very considerably increased. What is the use of possessing mines if, in case of emergency, they cannot be laid down? </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish&#39; to carry on a dialogue with the right honorable member, but I do think that a man who wants to spend four millions on such a project, should not be adverse to spending a few thousands to secure the safety from an extreme danger of a third of our population. I have shown, I think, that the artillery force, as it stands at present, is much less than the General Officer Commanding thinks is adequate, and less than I imagine every man who considers the question will believe is necessary. I have shown that the submarine mining force - in Victoria, at all events - is in a precariously inefficient state. </para>

                            <para>- All the submarine miners of Australia are not retained in Sydney. Quite properly, the detachments are held where they are required. It becomes necessary, at a moment&#39;s notice, to put down mines if there is an alarm, and an enemy&#39;s ship would not courteously wait outside Port Phillip while we sent for men from Sydney to put down the mines at this port. The idea is ridiculous. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the Permanent Forces and the Militia. Even if the submarine miners of the Permanent and Militia Forces were called on, it would be impossible to get the mines laid at Port Phillip Heads within three weeks. There is one other point I wish to make before concluding. We were told, prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth, that one of the results of Federation would be improved defence for the respective Colonies. Now, New South Wales was at that time the best defended Colony. I think I have clearly shown to the Committee that I do not desire exclusive defence for New South Wales; but I must say that the people of that State entered Federation on the understanding, among others, that, by doing so, they would be better defended. And without doubt they have in that fact a sound argument for the contention that the defence of their State should not. at any rate, be diminished. </para>

                            <para>- No, I am talking of the defences which we ourselves control - not of the naval defence of Australia under the Naval Agreement. I have nothing whatever to say with regard to the Naval Subsidy. That subsidy would bring the total expenditure up to &#163;800,000, so that the right honorable member is correct ; but I have not been dealing with that part of the defence of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The Estimates show that the actual expenditure of the Commonwealth for the year 1901-2 was &#163;611,761, while the actual expenditure in New South Wales was y?2&#39;o9,278. The Commonwealth expenditure in 1902-3 was rightly increased to &#163;710,000, but the expenditure in New South Wales was decreased to &#163;173,000, or &#163;36,000 less than it was just prior to Federation. These figures are, of course, exclusive of the Naval Subsidy. In 1903-4 the Commonwealth actual expenditure on defence was less than for .the year 1902-3, there being only &#163;519,000, while the actual expenditure in New South Wales was only &#163;153,000. The Defence expenditure in New South Wales has been consistently decreased. The Estimates now before us provide for- a total expenditure of &#163;^592.000 - New South Wales&#39; share being &#163;171,000. I hope every penny of it will be spent. </para>

                            <para>- It does not materially decrease the executive expenditure in New South Wales. It has not much to do with it. The Commonwealth decided that New South Wales had an over sufficiency of permanent artillery. That may or may not be correct; but, in my opinion - and I have given reasons for my view - it is absolutely incorrect. Whatever may have prompted that contention, I hold that in view of the representations that were made to the people of New South Wales prior to Federation, she should not have her Defence vote decreased for the benefit of the rest of Australia. We do not mind paying an increased vote in which all the people of Australia should share alike ; but I hold that New South Wales should not be made to suffer simply because she had the prescience to insure that the defences of her principal city were in an efficient and adequate state. </para>

                            <para>- There is the difference between the present Estimates and the actual expenditure for last year. I am commending the Minister for the increase, and I repeat that I hope every penny will be spent. I am quite convinced that the Minister holds the same view as myself. Ministers always think that they do not get enough for their Departments, but the Minister of Defence especially is justified in holding that view. I do not wish to detain the Committee, and should have been infinitely better pleased had this dialogue with my right honorable friend not been so long ; but I wish lt) emphasize the fact that we are preparing our defences on a system which is not best calculated to meet the clanger we have most to fear. We are told that Switzerland is the prototype of Australia. I do not know if the Minister in making that statement meant that it was the prototype of Australia for administrative or for executive purposes ; but I hold that we should take no example from that country when we are considering our general policy of defence. In the first place, Switzerland is protected by the European understanding as to the inviolability of its territory. </para>

For that reason Switzerland has nothing to fear, provided that the parties to the treaty respect it. But they have a citizen soldiery in a very high state of efficiency, and I hope that in time we shall have our field forces and citizen soldiery in the same efficient state. In the meantime, however, we are neglecting a danger to which we in Australia are peculiarly exposed, and which does not exist in the case of Switzerland. The population of the four principal cities in that country numbers only about 430,000 souls, and only one is in any &#39;way possible of attack. I refer to the city of Bale. Geneva, although close to the frontier, is surrounded by mountains, and would be difficult of attack. We all know that Switzerland is a country with impassable rivers and mountains - the most impossible country to attack that it is possible to conceive - and her citizen forces are, consequently, quite adequate for its defence. In Australia, however, we have four ports, containing a third of the population of the Commonwealth., which are so vulnerable that they are liable to immediate attack by a raiding cruiser, and such an attack one of extreme danger. </para>

I point out this danger, and hope that when the next Estimates come forward the Defence vote will be very largely increased. I trust that the Estimates of the Department now before us will not be reduced, and that every penny voted will be spent- - and well spent - in the defence of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I very largely indorse the views which have been expressed by the honorable member for Wentworth in regard to the insufficiency of the Estimates to cover the cost of effective defence. The Defence Estimates form an item in the Budget which may be regarded as one of the most important that we could be called upon to consider. National defence ought to be a question of obtaining security, and above ail considerations of expense. Before dealing with that aspect of the question, however, I should like to refer to the discussion which took place this morning in regard to the proposed consecration of banners. I have no desire to go into the question of the advisableness or otherwise of holding the ceremony. That is a matter upon which honorable members and the public may, perhaps, be allowed to hold different opinions ; but I do not think there is any great principle underlying it, such as was suggested by the honorable member for Canobolas. So far as I could gather from the remarks of the honorable and learned member for Corio, his principal contention was that the form of prayer was in some respects likely to be unacceptable - I shall not say objectionable - to certain sections of the Military Forces. I cannot understand what is the great objection. If there be a likelihood of the form of prayer chosen proving distasteful to some persons, a way out of the difficulty, if time will allow, would be to get a number of clergymen of all denominations concerned to meet together, and agree to a form. </para>

                            <para>- I have been interrupted to a slight extent, but I only wish to suggest an easy way out of what I do hot admit to be a real difficulty. This is not a party matter; it does not concern one party more than another ; so that I think honorable members might accept my remarks in the spirit in which they are made, as a friendly suggestion to get rid . of what some seem to think a difficulty, though it does not present itself to me in that light. Coming now to the question of defence generally, I think that the plea for spending more money on defence than it is now proposed to spend has been justified by the arguments used by the honorable member for Wentworth in support of his contentions. If honorable members will refer to the second annual report of the General Officer Commanding, they will see that we have a very serious question to face. There can be no higher authority on this subject, nor one whose recommendations are worthy of greater consideration, than the General Officer Commanding. </para>

                        <para>The work of re-organization and reconstruction of the whole of the pre-existing Military Forces of Australia has now been carried through the initial stages, and a new Commonwealth Military system has thus been brought into actual operation. The energies of all concerned must now be concentrated on the solidification of the system which has been accepted. It is reasonable to look forward with the utmost confidence to the result, if only the. whole of the officers and men concerned set themselves as loyally and with equal determination to solidifying the structure as they have to bringing it into being. </para>

                    <para>This expenditure will provide a Field Force complete in all its details, and fit for active operations of 13,831 men and sixty guns upon a peace footing, and of 27,753 men and eighty-four guns upon a war footing. It will further provide a Garrison Force of 11,752 men and twenty-six guns, exclusive of the armament of the fixed Defences, with behind them an important auxiliary force of approximately 29,000 riflemen furnished by the Rifle Clubs. The troops thus provided, as already shown in the Minute of Defence, dated 7th April, 1902, are the least number which would afford reasonable security against invasion, and which would suffice for the present protection of Australian interests. </para>
                    <para>The principle in view in thus laying down the above minimum numbers for the Military Forces of the Commonwealth is that a hostile invasion of Australia, with intention to effect permanent territorial occupation, would never be attempted with a less force than from 20,000 to 50,000 well equipped, well trained, and well organized troops. It is obvious, therefore, that a force at least equal that proposed is required to insure any reasonable hope of success. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order. I understand that the honorable and learned member for Corio has moved to amend subdivision 1 of division 41, by reducing the salary of the Secretary to the Defence Department by &#163;1, his object being to protest against the expenditure of public money for denominational purposes. I contend that any general debate upon the Defence Estimates is out of order. I am not aware that there is any understanding that such a debate should be permitted at the present time. If the whole division were before the Committee, and the amendment of a specific item had not been moved, the honorable member for Lang would be in order, but an amendment having been moved concentrating the attention of the Committee on a certain item, he is precluded from discussing generally the administration of the Defence Department until the amendment has been disposed of. To fortify my opinion I refer you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom,</inline> to standing order 173, which provides that discussion shall be confined to the clause or amendment before the Committee. </para>

If the amendment were construed strictly, in the manner desired by the honorable member for Coolgardie, the discussion would be confined to the reasons for the reduction of the item by&#163;1. I think that the honorable and learned member for Corio is following the ordinary precedent, but that in doing so, he cannot confine honorable members to the particular issue which he has himself raised. </para>

                        <para>It may be as well to state at once that a force of the requisite strength organized and capable of taking the field does not at present exist in Australia, and that there are at present no local means of equipping such a force. The organisation is incomplete ; the departments necessary for a mobile Army have yet to be created ; and there are neither sufficient guns, arms, equipment, nor ammunition available. It will therefore be seen that the construction of a trans-continental railway would, under existing circumstances, confer no satisfactory advantage upon Australia in its present condition of military unpreparedness. </para>

The victories of the Japanese arms within the last four months have astounded the whole civilized world by their brilliancy and by their astonishing rapidity. The future and far-reaching results of the war have yet to be felt, but it is safe to predict that the opening up of China will follow as a result which, together with the opening of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, will materially alter the existing political and commercial situation in the Pacific. </para>

                    <para class="block">In view of the alarming nature of this report - and I take it that it is not unnecessarily alarming, because doubtless it has been drawn up after very careful consideration - it behoves us, as the guardians of the interests of the Commonwealth, to secure ourselves against the dangers referred to. I should like to quote from a leading article which appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of Monday last, which bears upon one or two of the statements contained in the report Of the General Officer Commanding as to foreign, powers establishing themselves in the Pacific. The fact that naval bases are being established by these powers is mentioned as an additional argument in support of the necessity for our keeping ourselves in a continual state of preparedness for the purposes of defence. The article from which I am about to quote refers particularly to the fact that the master of the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Ysabel</inline> had been refused trading rights in the Marshall group. The writer says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>German steamers are permitted to trade with British-owned islands in the Pacific on payment of a licence fee of &#163;100 per annum, which must also be paid by each British-owned steamer engaged in the trade. But the German reply to this neighbourly treatment by Great Britain is to levy a prohibitive rate against the British steamer entering a German island group, and to charge vessels flying the Union Jack more than fifty times as much for the privilege of trading with a German possession as Britain charges a vessel flying the German flag for the privilege of entering a British-owned harbor in the South Seas. The incident is significant as a presage: of what may be expected to follow when the feverish struggle for trade, which has already brought the European Powers into dangerous juxtaposition in Asia, is extended, as seems inevitable, to the island groups that lie as it were at the backdoor of Australia. The insatiable craving for fresh markets, which shall be the exclusive property of the exploiter, has already led to a terrible war in Eastern Asia, and now the greedy monopolist is at work also in the South Seas. </para>
                        <para>Australian commercial predominance must inevitably be followed by political predominance in all these islands. It is impossible that the trade with an island group should be in the hands of the subjects of one Power, while the political control should be in the hands of another Power. &#34; The future of Germany,&#34; observed the Kaiser, in demanding funds for a huge programme of naval construction, 11 is on the water.&#34; Germany, needs a big fleet to support her in enforcing this policy of grabbing trade by any and every means from those who already possess it. That is obvious. </para>

                        <para>The German colonies in Togoland, the Cameroons, South-west Africa, East Africa, and Kiauchau are little more than military settlements. And there is no reason to suppose that the destiny of the German colonies in the Pacific islands will be any different. That is an additional reason why the latest manifestation in the Marshall Islands of what Bismarck called the &#34; <inline font-style="italic">furor</inline><inline font-style="italic">Teutonicus&#34;</inline> is to be viewed with apprehension by Australia. Such an unscrupulous effort to secure a trading monopoly contains a significant warning. Commercial expansion connotes political expansion. And the political expansion of Germany in the Pacific means the creation, not of peaceful trading colonies under the German flag, but of military settlements and bases that must in the future be a source of grave anxiety to the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

I have here a statement which will perhaps open the eyes of honorable members still, more to the gravity of the situation as&#34; it may possibly affect our future trading interests.

                        <para>Extensive works are being carried out at Simpson&#39;s harbor, in Blancho Bay, and at Matufi, in German New Guinea. A wharf, 1,000 feet in length, is being built, together with spacious warehouses, at a cost of about&#163;40,000. The wharf will be larger than any in Australia, and accommodation will be sufficient for a city with a population of 100,000. So far, however, there are no inhabitants at the Bay, and practically no trade is done there. The work is ostensibly being carried out for the accommodation of the island steamers belonging to the Norddeutscher Lloyd Co., which call there at intervals of six weeks. The great bulk of the trade of . New Britain, however, is transacted at Herbertshohe, ten miles distant. Eventually the facts began to dawn upon observing men that Germany had no base in this part of the world, and the conclusion arrived at, and now generally held by those interested in island affairs, is that these works are being carried out by the Norddeutscher Lloyd on behalf of the Imperial authorities, who throughout appear to have taken an active part in all arrangements. The spot is described as an ideal site for a naval coaling base, for the storage of quickfirers and ammunition, and for the equipment of German mail steamers as cruisers in the event of war. Simpson&#39;s harbor is situated on a kind of peninsula commanded by highlands of volcanic origin, which could be rendered almost impregnable by the mounting of a few guns. In the opinion of an Englishman acquainted with New Britain, there is no question as to the use to which the works are to be put. </para>

                    <para>I have quoted that telegram, not with the idea of awakening antagonism to foreign Powers, because I recognise that they have a perfect right to provide for the protection of their own commerce, and to establish naval bases so that they may be prepared to take aggressive measures should they be rendered necessary. But whilst commending, their foresight and enterprise in establishing bases within striking distance of Australia, it would be little short of criminal upon our part if we did not adopt effective measures to protect our commerce and our shores. I have no wish to prolong this discussion more than is absolutely necessary for my purpose. I feel strongly upon the matter of Australian defence, because I realize what it means if we neglect the opportunity of adopting reasonable precautions whilst yet there is time. I realize that there may come a period when it will become imperative for us to take active measures for our defence, and I do not wish Australia to be found in a condition of unpreparedness. If we rush into expenditure at a time of emergency the chances are that it will not prove nearly so effective as it would if we incurred that expenditure under normal conditions, and with a full recognition of the possibilities of the future. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the honorable and learned member for Corio, and those who think with him upon the question of the consecration of the military banners, are anxious to obtain a division upon the proposed amendment this afternoon. Of course, the Government will always welcome that expedition of business which is indicated by a division, and therefore I ask honorable members who wish to address themselves to the Defence Estimates generally to allow a vote to be taken upon the matter to which I have referred. Such a division will not affect the general debate upon the Defence Estimates. </para>

                        <para>- If this division be passed the opportunity of a general debate, according to the established practice of the Committee, on the whole of the Estimates of the Department, will end. There is no desire on the part of the Government to unduly curtail a general debate on a big spending Department like that of Defence, but I presume that the honorable member or some one else is ready to continue the debate until we reach the usual hour of adjournment. It was known yesterday that these Estimates would be considered to-day. The honorable member will have a further opportunity to discuss the re-organization question when the second reading of the amending Defence Bill is moved. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. PAGE</inline>(Maranoa). - I desired to comment at some length on the Estimates of this Department, but as I have a very bad cold I am placed at a disadvantage. In the first place, I wish to call the attention of the Committee to the amount on the Estimates for Queensland. Every member of the Ministry must be aware of the parlous condition of the finances of that State, and if the Defence Estimates relating to Queensland can be cut down without impairing the efficiency of the forces I think that they should. 1 shall be happy to point out any case in which I consider that the Estimates may be reduced in the interests of that State. The Estimates of the military expenditure in Queensland show an increase of .&#163;16,730 on that for 1903-4, and at the present juncture that is a matter of some moment to the Treasurer of Queensland. The difficulty is only in relation to the present year, and if we could make a reduction I should be satisfied twelve months hence to vote the full amount. I am satisfied that efficiency can be maintained this year with a reduced vote. It will be remembered that when last year&#39;s Estimates were before us certain reductions were promised, more particularly in regard to the General Head-Quarters Staff in Melbourne. I am sorry that that reduction has not been made. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and in the District Head-Quarters Staff. There is also an increase in the naval vote as compared with that passed last year. At the very time when Queensland can least afford increased expenditure in this Department an increased vote is proposed. I recognise, however, that the increase in. the naval vote of that State amounts to only .&#163;2.129, ai,d that the people are receiving good value for their money with respect to the cadets and the militia. We have also to bear in mind that one of the gun-boats has been put into commission since last year. I should like to know whether the item, &#34;General Officer Commanding, including all allowances, except travelling, .&#163;1,250,&#34; represents the pay of the officer up to the end of the year. </para>

                        <para>- There are two. The Assistant Adjutant-General for Engineer Services does not appear in the Estimates for this year, and if the honorable member turns to the vote for the Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, he will see that the pay is to continue only during the absence of the Deputy Adjutant-General. As there are other changes coming into operation, we do not propose to send that officer away at once. Two or three weeks will elapse before the new scheme comes into force. </para>

                        <para>- If we send an officer to act as military attache&#34; to a foreign army, in order to gain information that may be of service to our forces, I think we should not treat him in a niggardly way. He has to mix with other officers, and keep up the same style as they do, and I certainly think that &#163;300 would not go far towards paying his expenses. Every one knows that in travelling in a foreign country, many unforeseen expenses are incurred. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make a few remarks in regard to the consecration of banners which is to take place at Albert Park on Monday next. My opinion is that it is an absurdity to bless these banners in any manner ; but if they are&#39; to be blessed, every religion to be found in the nation of which they are to be taken as symbolic should be represented. I should be glad to know that a conference of representatives of the various religions of Australia would be called to formulate a prayer and a form of service for the occasion. I speak now upon the subject from a different point of view from that from which I would have spoken prior to the division, because the Committee must be regarded as having affirmed the desirability of holding a consecration service, though I desire to lodge my protest against the holding of that ceremony, unless every Australian religion is represented at it. I have taken the trouble to go through the <inline font-style="italic">Military Forces List,</inline> to find out how the denominations are represented in our Forces by chaplains, and I have discovered that, although we have no State religion in Australia, certain denominations have a far larger proportion of chaplains of high rank than have others. Honorable members will accept my statement that I, as the son of an English mother, revere the religion of that mother. If she chose to give up the Church of England for Roman Catholicism, I have the greatest respect for her religion, and whatever remarks I may make to-day are not made with a desire to point the finger at any religion. In Victoria we have recently had what is known as Hospital Sunday, and when I say that the Presbyterians collected the largest amount for our charities. I pay them my meed of respect and praise for a splendid &#39;effort. But how has that denomination been treated in the matter of its representation by chaplains in out Defence Forces? I protest that it has not been treated fairly. I have culled from our <inline font-style="italic">Military Forces &#39; List,</inline> issued in September, some particulars on this subject, to which honorable members may find it advantageous to refer later on when they appear in the columns of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Chaplains, like members of the profession to which I belong, when they join the Army, are given the privileges and titles of officers of various ranks. Now, I find that in New South Wales there are twenty-six chaplains of whom one ranks as colonel, one as lieutenant-colonel, two as majors, and twenty-two as captains. The State coming next in importance, having regard to population - because when I speak of the value or importance of a State, I have regard only to the human beings living upon it. The earth, with all its richness, is of value only for the human units which it contains. In Victoria there are twenty-nine chaplains, or three more than in New South Wales, but not one of them ranks as colonel or lieutenant-colonel, though there are twenty-two majors, and seven captains. In the February issue of the list from which I have .taken these figures, four of the majors enjoy the relative rank of lieutenant-colonel, whatever that means. But this privilege appears to have been taken from them. I do not think that it has been done during the tenure of office of the present Minister, but I direct his attention to the matter. I am sure that these gentlemen have done nothing to warrant their reduction in rank. </para>

                            <para>- The note &#34; with relative rank of lieutenant-colonel &#34; was in February, 1904, appended to the names of the Rev. Henry John Wilkinson, the Rev. Joseph Hay, the Rev. Richard George Burke, and the Rev. James Kennedy - two of them clergymen of the Church of England, one a Roman Catholic, and one a Presbyterian. That privilege seems to have been taken away from them. </para>

                            <para>- The service of God can take place anywhere - within these walls, within the walls of a church, or within the walls of a hovel - though I think that, the clergy can find as much to do in the service of their Master in Australia as on a field of carnage. Queensland, as well as New South Wales, has despatched contingents abroad, but, nevertheless, possesses no chaplain who is a colonel, though it has one lieutenant-colonel and ten captains. South Australia has neither colonels, lieutenant-colonels, nor majors, although her democratic legislation can pretty well vie with that of the other States, and goes far beyond that of Victoria. There are only three chaplains in that State, and they hold the rank of captain. In Western Australia there are seventeen chaplains, of whom one is a lieutenant-colonel, and sixteen are captains. In little Tasmania, they have seven chaplains, all captains. Since Victoria is so well represented in the Ministry by the honorable and learned member for Corinella and the honorable member for Gippsland, and possesses twenty-nine chaplains, some of them should rank as colonels or lieutenant-colonels. I have also ascertained how the various religions are represented in our Defence Force by the chaplains. I find that every religion is not so represented. The Republic of France recognises every religion, by contributing equally to all; but, although we recognise all religions as equal, we do not contribute to their support out of State funds. But in our Defence Forces the old ignominy of favouring certain religions exists. In New South Wales the Church of England - to which I allude with all reverence, and which has covered England with splendid temples - has one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, one major, and seven captains. The Presbyterian Church, to which I have paid my meed of praise for its splendid efforts on Hospital Sunday, has one major and four captains. The Roman Catholic Church has three captains, and the Methodist Church six captains. So that only the Church of England is represented by colonels and lieutenant-colonels. In Victoria, the Church of England is represented by seventeen majors and three captains; the Presbyterians by four majors and one captain ; the Roman Catholics by one captain ; and the Wesleyans by one major and two captains. I pay my meed of praise to the governing authorities of Victoria, because, although they have not given Victorian chaplains any of the higher ranks, they have brought about a fairer division and a larger representation than any other State possesses. In Queensland the Church of England is represented by nine captains, and the Presbyterian by one lieutenant-colonel, while the Wesleyans have one captain ; the other denominations being unrepresented. In South Australia, the Church of England has two captains, and the Methodists one captain. In Western Australia, the Church of England has one lieutenant-colonel and eight captains; the Roman Catholic Church one captain; the </para>

                    <para class="block">Wesleyans five captains, and the Methodists two captains. In Tasmania, the Church of England has four captains, the Presbyterians two, and the Wesleyans one. Honorable members will see that only five religious bodies have been mentioned - the Church of England, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Wesleyan, and Independent. I have not the slightest doubt that the representatives of all these denominations will pray with equal earnestness, but it is not desirable that any preference should be shown for any particular denomination. Would it not be better to invite the representatives of all Christian religions to formulate a prayer to their Master? If the consecration of an inanimate object, such as the flag, is to have any effect, surely a prayer in which all the Churches were joined would constitute a stronger appeal than one offered by representatives of only a few of the Christian churches. It has been the practice of every European nation to invoke blessings on its flag. Every nation prays for victory, and for carnage. Honorable members will perhaps permit me to present to their minds the scene portrayed in one picture in the celebrated Wiertz collection at Brussels. There we have a splendid portrayal of the man of the future - at the end of the present century - holding in the hollow of his giant hand the baubles which have led to the desecration of all that is most high and noble on the earth, which have led to pillage, slaughter, and murder. As he looks upon the flags and baubles, and instruments of warfare, he marvels at the results they have brought about, and which are depicted in the background. We. want no blood-stained flag. Our object should be to keep our flag white and unstained, one that has never known warfare, either between ourselves and our foreign foes, or bloody internecine struggles such as have taken place in other countries. </para>

                            <para>- There is one flag upon which no belligerent fires. That is the Red Cross. The nations of Europe paid Switzerland a great honour when they adopted her flag, reversing the colours only, as the badge of mercy and succour upon the battle-field. The people of Switzerland have always used their best efforts in the interests of peace, and it was highly appropriate that their flag should be adopted by the nations of Europe. When we see the colours of France, we can scarcely fail to think of the memorable words of Carlisle, in which he relates that Barbaroux sent a message to Marseilles, asking that there might be sent to him 600 men who were willing to die. His call was responded to, the men marched upon Paris with the tricolour floating over them, and we know of the carnage and misery that followed in their wake. Our Union Jack is only a little more than 100 years old. It is the emblem of a union that was brought about by the corruption of Lord Castlereagh, who ended his ignominious life by killing himself with his own hand. It would have been better for humanity if he had died in the cradle. Our Union Jack, which, as I have said, is scarcely more than a century old, has been steeped in blood. Would that it had not been, or that it could be purified. Then there is the Old Glory of the United States of America, which, until recently, had remained unsullied. Unfortunately, the United States were not content to adopt a purely defensive attitude, but carried their flag beyond their own borders. Loving that nation as I do, I regret that it would not accept the offer made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carnegie</inline> of&#163;4,000,000 to induce it to abandon the Philippines. If the United States had continued true to the sentiments with which the Old Glory had been previously associated, their flag would have stood in a higher position today than perhaps that of any other nation. The Christian flag of Russia has been blessed and prayed for by perhaps 120,000,000 of people, and the flag of Japan has been prayed for by the Pagans and Christians of that country. Surely if the God of the Christians, is mightier than the gods of the Pagans, victory should have been assured to the Russians, rather than to the Japanese. I protest against the proposed consecration of banners, unless every religion is represented. The honorable member who preceded me spoke about  Colonel Hoad,  and I should like to know whether that officer was recalled by the Minister, or came back of his own volition. </para>

                            <para>- If Colonel Hoad came back without orders, he should not have done so. He should have remained at the front where he could obtain the information best calculated to qualify him for the high position to which he will doubtless attain in our military forces. If his reason for returning was that he feared chat he would lose his chance of advancement, he has cast a slur upon honorable members of this House, and upon , the Defence authorities. The time spent by him in learning something that would be of use to us would naturally be recorded in his favour. If it is not too late, I hope that Colonel Hoad will be sent back, so that he may enlarge his knowledge. I trust that a clear statement will be made upon this question. If the Russo-Japanese war has demonstrated one fact more than another, it is that coal is almost equal in value to powder and shot, and I should like to know if provision is being made for the defence of the coal mines along the coast of New South Wales. I am sorry to say that the Victorian coal mines are not protected. As I understand that honorable members desire to adjourn at the usual hour, I shall conclude my remarks for the present, and resume next week. </para>

                            <para>- I have not with me the papers relating to Colonel Hoad&#39;s case, because I did not expect the matter to be referred to to-day. When Colonel Hoad was sent away, a minute was written to the effect that the probable duration of his absence would be about six months - the anticipation being that the winter in Manchuria would greatly interfere with military operations. Colonel Hoad has been away since the 30th March, or about seven months. He was not recalled by this Government, nor, so far as I am aware, by the previous Government. He has not yet waited upon me since his return, and consequently I am unable to give any further information at present. Of course, I shall naturally ask him for an official report. In the meantime, I certainly do not draw any inference against him . </para>
