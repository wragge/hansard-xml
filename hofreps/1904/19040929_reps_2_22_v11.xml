                    <para>- I am sorry to have to add to the list of honorable members who claim that they have been misrepresented, but in view of the statements made by the honorable member for Hume yesterday, I think that honorable members will see that I have some substantial reason for giving a personal explanation to this House. There are two matters to which I wish to refer, and I shall do so as briefly as possible. One is the statement of the honorable member as to the manner of keeping accounts in New South Wales while I was Premier of that State, and the other is the honorable member's imputation of bribery. I shall deal with the accounts first. I thought, after the correspondence which was put before honorable members, signed by every member of the Committee appointed by the honorable member for Hume, that we should hear no more of these imputations, but instead of that being so, the honorable member has repeated them.. He also made some reference to a visit of one of the three accountants appointed at my instigation to my private residence, as if some sinister underhand proceeding was involved in that occurrence. The fact is that I am not like the honorable member} I am a busy man. I am a man who has some private affairs to attend 'to when I am not in office. One of the leading accountants in Sydney - one of the three who were appointed in the way I am about to mention to the House - visited me under the! following circumstances: - When the honorable member for Hume appointed his Committee, I protested against the appointment of one of its three members on the ground that a few months before he had been a candidate for Parliament at the general elections of 1898 in opposition to me, and had accepted the views of the honorable member for Hume in regard to my financial administration as Treasurer of the State. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the honorable and learned member will keep quiet. If he has not a shred of care for reputation himself he might have some respect for the reputation of others. Under these circumstances, I refused to put myself in the hands of the Committee appointed by the honorable member for Hume, But what was the next step that I took? I asked the two institutions of accountants in Sydney to select two of their best men, without reference to me at all, and the two thus chosen were to select a third. One institution of accountants nominated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowes,</inline> a leading accountant in Sydney, and a London chartered accountant ; and the other institution nominated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davis,</inline> another leading accountant in Sydney. Those two accountants nominated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Teece., whose name is known throughout the length and breadth of Australia as the general manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the largest financial institution in the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> began his work with the other gentlemen whom I have named, when his directors withdrew him from the position, on the ground that it was a political matter, and they thought that their general manager should not be entangled in it. Then the other two accountants, who had been selected in the manner I have described, selected, as a third, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vane,</inline> of the well-known firm of Miles and Vane, accountants in Sydney. All three were selected absolutely without the exercise of a choice by me in any shape or form. But, as the matter was one outside the ordinary run of accountants' work, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davis</inline> waited on me to ascertain what the scope of the inquiry was to be, so that they might be able to form some idea as to the length of time for which they were to be taken away from their ordinary business. That was the private interview to which the honorable member for Hume has referred. </para>

As I would not go before the tribunal appointed by the honorable member for Hume, I felt that I owed it to the public to have an independent inquiry, and at my personal expense I appointed the gentlemen whom I have named, who were selected entirely by others. My written instructions to them were to take the accounts of the Treasurer and the Auditor-General, and, when there was a difference between the Treasurer's accounts and those of the Auditor-General to follow the Auditor-General's accounts, and not my accounts. </para>

                    <para>- No. I asked the honorable member for Hume, when' he was formulating his questions to his own Committee, to allow me to put some questions to them, but he would not do so. I then asked the honorable member, when the report of the three accountants nominated at any instance, was presented to me, to allow it to go into the journals of the Parliament of New South Wales, as the report of his own Committee had done, but he refused that, too. Fortunately I have some chance now of having my side of the case placed on the records of the New South Wales Parliament. But I wish to go further. The three accountants had each separate sets of the accounts of the Treasurer, and of the Auditor-General, placed before them, with instructions to follow the Auditor-General's accounts in any case of doubt. Each of them conducted an independent investigation, and they met and agreed upon a joint report which showed - what? That my statement of the balance which I left to the honorable member for Hume on the 1st July, 1899, namely, ^147,000, was ^110,000 under the mark - that, instead of overstating the accounts, amounts had been advanced to public officers during my last financial year which had to be returned under the Treasurership of the honorable member. . These three accountants pointed out that I had understated my balance, to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> 10,000. The honorable member for Hume accepted my balance, and put it -in his own accounts as correct. </para>

                    <para>- I will now leave that matter, and come to the more serious statement of the honorable gentleman, which imputed corruption to me in the administration of the office of Premier of New South Wales. I suppose we have not come to a state of things in this House when such charges may be made against a man without some seriousness being attached to the imputation under which he is made to lie. I suppose that on this matter, considering the nature of the statement which has gone on the permanent records of Parliament, I can claim1- the generous indulgence of every: member of the House. I would like, with reference to it, to say this : <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who was at the time a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, and had been for years a member of my own party, was going to the mother country on other business, and asked me to authorize him to make inquiries on behalf of the Government of New South Wales as to the old-age pensions system, in connexion with which he had been prominent from the first. I gave him the commission, but like a prudent Minister, I stated in it that he was to do the work entirely without remuneration. Those were the terms on which I appointed him. I expected to receive a report such as any one of us might give after a visit to the mother country  -  a document containing forty or fifty pages. I did not dream of the length to which his report would go. The honorable gentleman came back, and was ill for a long time. Finally, he set to work, and presented to me a report containing 515 pages. </para>

                    <para>- I intended to put a sum on the Additional Estimates for the year 1899, but as we had no Additional Estimates that year, the matter was allowed to stand over until the following session. We prorogued in December, and the payment was made to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> at a time when Parliament: was not sitting, and would not sit for six months. Not a penny was paid to him when Parliament was sitting, and I had no intention of paying him anything until Parliament had voted the money. But the honorable gentleman had suffered a number of misfortunes; his health, for instance, had broken down, and he came to me. and asked me to pay the actual expenses which  he had been out of pocket for a considerable time, in anticipation of the grant of Parliament. The amount which I paid to him did not comprise one penny for his personal labour in this gigantic work. It was merely a reimbursement of the money he had actually spent in producing it. I paid it in the full belief that Parliament would recompense him for his gigantic labours in a national cause. It was not a matter of helping rich corporations, but of providing old-age pensions for the poor of Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> s work had a great deal to do with the ease with which that system was established in New South Wales. I now come to a more serious matter than that. The honorable gentleman spoke as if there had been a Committee sitting upon my conduct in connexion with that matter. </para>

The Committee was appointed to inquire into the question whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> had' entered into any contract, and whether by receiving payment from the Government he had forfeited his seat as a member of the Legislature, and it did not report upon my conduct in any shape or form. I admit that it is constitutionally dangerous to make payments to members of Parliament, and no one grants more freely than I do that since Parliament did' not approve of my conduct it had a perfect right to censure me for believing that it would approve, and for thus falling into an error. I have never grumbled about that. Will honorable members believe that the honorable gentleman who made this imputation against me, and his whole party, when I challenged them in the face of the House and the country as to whether their Statements amounted to an imputation upon my personal integrity gave me an assurance that they did not? </para>

                    <para>- I shall read from the records of Parliament in justification of what I have said. When the motion of censure was tabled, the member for HastingsMacleay, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, made use of observations in a daily newspaper interview which seemed to me to suggest some imputation of improper conduct on my part. I immediately challenged him. I came before the House upon a question of privilege, and took up this position : "If this is a mere censure upon me for making a mistake as a Minister, I am satisfied to abide by the decision of the House ; but 'df it is an imputation upon my personal character, if it is a charge of corruption against me, I claim the right to have a judicial investigation. I do not want my character to be the sport of a party censure vote." Honorable members will see the difference between the two things. If any of my honorable friends had his personal character impugned, would he be content to have it dragged into the mire of a censure debate? Would he not claim the right which belongs to the meanest criminal in the land to have a fair and impartial trial? I knew what use might be made of such statements. I shall read from the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> On the 5th of September, 1899, page 1136, I called attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton's</inline> words, and said this- </para>

            <para>That was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fegan,</inline> who pointed the honorable member's general motion, with some words I will read.

            <para>That was .a perfectly legitimate ground for censuring any Government, and I did not object to anything of that kind, but when the honorable member for Hastings-Mac - leay said something which seemed to me to amount to a charge affecting my personal reputation, I got up in the House and made these remarks - </para>

                    <para>- I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> was the leader of the Opposition at that time. At any rate, he had led it previously, if he was not actually in that position upon the occasion referred to. I have stated plainly what happened in the case, and the right honorable gentleman has not quoted one word from me in refutation of what I stated. My impression stands good to-day as it stood then. The right honorable gentleman has omitted to refer to the question that was asked of him by the  Chairman  of the Committee, recorded at page 1044 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I do not know what Committee that was, but I believe it was connected with the question of old-age pensions. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild</inline> was connected with it. At that particular time, when the question was asked, it was! intended to move a vote of censure against the Premier if he said he was going to pay <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neild.</inline> When the Government accounts came' out I could not discover how the payment had been made, although I had heard whispers regarding it, and I had to go to the Auditor-General, in order to find out under what heading it had been made. Parliament was not sitting, and, unquestionably, such a payment should not have been made. Not one word has been said by the right honorable gentleman to cause me to vary my original statement. If I had been proved to be wrong I should have been perfectly ready to withdraw what I said. But I know what happened, and I know that I am right. The right "honorable gentleman has stated that I appointed all the members of the Committee of Public Accounts. Technically I. did so, but two of the members were selected at the instigation of the right honorable gentleman, who mentioned their names across the table in the Legislative </para>

I do not. think there is any necessity to say more. I should not have dealt with this matter had it riot been brought up by the right honorable gentleman himself with a view, if possible, to destroy the effect of the Committee's, report, which stands, and always will stand, as a record against his financial administration. " When the right honorable gentleman says that I accepted a balance of his in my financial operations as Treasurer, it must be remembered that when I assumed office I was compelled to accept the accounts as they were. The balance left by the right honorable gentleman was ^100,000 odd. </para>

                    <para>- It is to be deeply regretted that certain honorable members will continuously and persistently endeavour to introduce into this House ancient squabbles in a State Parliament. I believe, however, that every reasonable man here deprecates any efforts of that kind, and I rejoice to notice that, at any rate, the Labour Opposition, to their credit, are no party to those disgraceful attempts. Resuming the thread of my address, which was interrupted last night, I desire to draw attention to a remark made by the honorable and learned member for West Sydney in the course of his speech. That honorable and learned member complained that the Labour Party had been " butchered " - had not received fair play. In reply, I am justified in saying that if there was any ' ' butchery ' ' it was self-inflicted. As to the treatment which the Labour Ministry received during their term of office - which extended from 27th April to 17th August, or nearly four months - I may say, from my knowledge of the inner life of the party to which I belong, and of those with whom I was associated while sitting in Opposition, that we did all we could to secure fair play for Ministers. I was not aware of any underhanded attempt to displace the Government ; on the contrary, it was generally thought that a little Ministerial innings would do them good - that no harm would result. It was thought that whilst in office the Labour Party were practically " on the chain " - that they had given securities for good behaviour, and that they would emerge from office better and abler men, probably more appreciative of a Minister's difficulties and responsibilities. There was a general consensus of opinion, so far as my knowledge goes, that they should have a fair trial, which, I believe, they got. The Government went on with their measures, and challenged the verdict of the House upon a certain clause in the Arbitration Bill, with the result that they were fairly and honorably beaten. </para>

                        <para>- That is the complaint I heard made last night. But surely the House is not to be so impotent and so recreant to its trust that, if a Ministry objects to the introduction of a clause into a Bill, it is to surrender its powers and prerogatives. In this case the House viewed the Bill with generous fairness, and with a desire to see it passed into law. There was no wish whatever to emasculate the measure ; on the contrary, there was a desire to have workable legislation, and I believe that as a result of our deliberations the Bill is one which we can recommend to the electors of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- We shall see about that later on. During the exhaustive debates on the Bill a flood of light, of which we previously had not the advantage, was cast upon its provisions ; the debate, indeed, amounted to a revelation to many of us. I admit that, with reference to the clause enabling the Court to give preference to unionists, I, for one, like the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, when the Bill was first introduced, acquiesced in it without a murmur. We thought that the power thus given would only be used on rare occasions, such as when a strike or dispute occurred regarding the employment of unionists or non-unionists. We regarded the clause' as an incident in the Bill, and not as one involving its very spirit and essence. But as the debate went on, our eyes were opened, and it dawned on the House that this apparently harmless provision, intended to be a mere incident, was being utilized in New South Wales, and would be utilized under the Bill, as a great transforming agent - that the clause would convert a judicial tribunal, for the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> settlement of industrial disputes, into a great electioneering agency. I am sure that that was not the intention of the original framers of the Bill when they inserted this harmless provision. It only shows how a clause, which maybe well meant in its inception, may, in the course of experience and manipulation, be transformed into an instrument for a. purpose not originally intended or contemplated. </para>

                        <para>- There can be no doubt that the division on that clause of the Bill established in this House a line of cleavage and demarcation which remains at the. present moment unobliterated. That division is responsible for a change of Government, and for our presence on the Ministerial benches this afternoon. There can be no doubt that this provision about preference to unionists, originally an incident, has been converted into the essence of the whole struggle. Take the honorable members on this side who belong to the Liberal Protectionist Party. We were all strongly in favour of the Bill as originally launched for compulsory arbitration in matters of industrial dispute. </para>

These boards have made determinations in thirty-eight industries, and the awards have been enforced by the Government without reference to the question of preference to unionists. </para>

                        <para>- They will obey these awards without the intervention of any Court or trades union council. I may say that they have done it in Victoria, and it is therefore not necessary that we should create these huge trades union organizations, and intrust them with Ministerial powers to coerce workmen- I believe that most of the democratic organs of public opinion in Australia have arrived at the conclusion that compulsory preference to unionists, as developed in the Bill, and as advocated by the Labour Party, is a menace to personal liberty, and a danger to those whom it is intended to .benefit. In this connexion, I should like to quote one or two passages from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, which has always been the advocate of the working classes in this State. It has advocated the passing of factory laws, and the due administration of those laws. </para>

                    <para>The proposed wholesale dismissal of men and women from their employment by order of an Arbitration Court is becoming more distasteful to members of the Federal Parliament the more its moral and industrial consequences are inquired into. Preference to unionists must mean the dismissal of non-unionists ; and this must take place on a very extensive scale if the principle of preference is to be applied in anything like the way proposed by the Watson Government. </para>

                <para>Extreme State Socialists, who are concerned in the working of the Political Labour Councils, are acting quite logically in setting great store by the preference clause. A Trades Hall Council, sitting in judgment to determine who was to be thrust out of employment in favour of its nominees, would be almost an exact counterpart of the Socialistic rulers whom such theorists as Marx and Lasalle would have installed in absolute control of the universal State industry. But the more this kind of scheme is realised in actual life, or in proposals which have been advocated in the arena of practical politics, the less it commends itself to common-sense people who retain their ordinary notions of justice and humanity. </para>

Nothing could be imagined more repugnant to the spirit of British liberty and toleration than to permit any kind of labour organization to use a Court of law as the instrument for offering to those who differ from it the alternative of joining or being dismissed. . . The more formidable and insidious attack on all outside the unions will have the effect of alienating the sympathies of many thousands of electors. There are a very large number of men who are compelled to vary their employment, and who cannot possibly belong to a union for each class of work which they must take up. </para>

                        <para>- As I have said before, the division on the amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member for Corinella was one which established a line of cleavage in this House, and led to the resignation of the late Ministry. As a matter of personal opinion, I do not think that it was necessary that the late Ministry should have resigned on account of the result of that division, especially in view of the statement made by the late Prime Minister himself, that this preference provision was only intended to be brought into action where the majority in any trade or industry required it, and that it was merely giving legal effect and expression to the practice of the New South Wales Court. If that be so, it merely expressed in writing, in the form of an Act of Parliament, what the late Prime Minister himself desired, and intended should be done. If that be so - and I accept the honorable gentleman's honest assurances at the table that it was so - then why all the uproar ? Why all this fuss because of the insertion of an amendment which was merely intended to give' effect to the desires and intentions of the framers of the Bill? The amendment was merely intended to give effect to the desire that the principle of preference should be applied only where the majority of those engaged in any trade or industry desired it. It should not be forgotten that the clause after all was not introduced for the protection of minorities. It was introduced for the protection of majorities. That was the essence of the clause. It was introduced to prevent any small union which might be scratched up for the purpose of raising a dispute and bringing a case before the Court of Arbitration, being able to snatch a preference behind the backs of the majority of the workers in a trade. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members will remember that the amendment was carried by the substantial majority of five, after the lapse of a considerable time, during which honorable members on the Government side at the time had an opportunity to reconsider the matter. The Government asked the House to reverse its decision. Honorable members who had voted for it were invited, forsooth, to reverse their previous votes on a clause1 which was suddenly regarded as one of immense vitality and importance. So far as I am concerned, having thoroughly understood and considered it, and having spoken on it, I could not plead ignorance of its effect. The honorable member for Riverina has complained that he was taken by surprise, and desired time for further consideration; but I could offer no such plea as that. I do not think that the honorable member for Bourke pleaded ignorance. </para>

                        <para>- Then I beg the honorable member's pardon, because I understood that he had done so. While some honorable members may justifiably plead ignorance, or misapprehension, or inadvertence, as a reason for reversing their vote, those who understood what they were doing had no reason for reversing it. The members of the Watson Administration voluntarily staked their existence upon the chance of procuring a reversal of that vote. I believe1 that they thought that the vote would be reversed, but they miscalculated the material upon which they were operating. They thought that if they could not obtain a reversal of the vote, they would be granted a dissolution, and that the resignation of office would not be necessary. The Governor-General upset their calculations on that point. But, having resigned office upon that vital question, why is it that they are so anxious to get back again? Because the same situation will be reproduced, the same vote will have to be taken, and the same or a similar crisis will eventuate, if they again take office. In my opinion, they were practically out-generalled. If they had shown better generalship, they would have allowed the decision of the Committee to stand, and left the development of the matter to the ordinary course of debate in the other Chamber, and afterwards of messages between the two Houses. Instead of doing so, they asked us to rescind our votes, and to give up a provision which a large number of us were determined to fight for in this House, and, if necessary, in the country. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. I have already pointed out that it was not to kill the Bill. In the Victorian factory legislation there is no such thing as compulsory preference to unionists, and the absence of such a provision has not killed that legislation. The honorable member for Yarra is a powerful advocate of the settlement of industrial disputes in Victoria by means of the Wages Board system. He knows what an immense amount of good has been done by those boards without the granting of preference to unionists. That fact, coupled with the arguments which I have already given, is sufficient to show that the qualification of a provision giving preference to unionists would not kill the Arbitration Bill. But such a qualification may do this : It may . prevent organizations registered for the settlement of industrial disputes from being converted into political organizations. Indeed, the only object of preference was to bring that about. It was desired that the unions should be clothed with a certain amount of power and patronage in connexion with industrial disputes, so that they might be used as the outposts of the Labour Party. I think that I have now said enough on the subject of preference to unionists, though, as it was the main issue which caused the crisis, I think it is as well to accentuate the fact. But I would ask honorable members why are we requested to make a .change of Government at the present time? The Liberal Protectionists were divided as the result of a division on the clause, a large number of them voting for the Bill as it stood, and a still larger number voting for the Bill as amended by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. His amendment having been agreed to, and the Ministry having resigned in consequence, it became the duty of those who voted for it to take the constitutional and parliamentary responsibility for their votes. We could not shirk that responsibility. The Labour Ministry resigned, and a new Ministry had to be formed to carry on the Government. Those who were responsible for the vote which displaced the Watson Administration were bound to see that arrangements were made to carry on the Government of the country, and we should have been recreant to our duty if we had failed to do so. Consequently, we had to cross the floor of the Chamber, and the line of cleavage between -the two parties in this House at the present time was caused by the division to which I have referred. We are kept apart by that division, and we shall have to remain apart pending the settlement of the question. If we do not remain here, we must be identified or associated with it for the purpose of maintaining, and fighting for the principle upon which we are divided. I do not see how we can escape the responsibilities of the situation, whatever its consequences may be. The Ministry was formed as the result of that division, and those of us who sit on this side of the Chamber feel that we are bound, as men of honour, to maintain it, so long as it is able to carry on the Government of the country in a manner consistent with our views, our policy, and our programme. There may not be the same amount of individuality in. the Ministerial organization that there would be if the Ministry were not of a composite character. It is neither a straight-out free-trade, nor a straight-out protectionist Administration, and its programme is limited by the composition of its members. I believe that the work which it .will be capable of performing will be of a non-contentious character, but none the less necessary for the welfare of the Commonwealth. It will have to carry out, if it be successful in maintaining its position, a considerable amount of work of a non-contentious character which the late Ministry undertook to perform. One of the grounds of attack which 'has been suggested from the Opposition corner is that it should be turned out in order that we may have a protectionist revival ; but I do not see that there is any reasonable prospect of a protectionist revival, even if the Ministry is dislodged. The vast majority of honorable members were returned to '.support a fiscal peace during the present Parliament. That was the policy laid down at Ballarat by the honorable and learned gentleman who represents that place* and I, in common with a large number of my protectionist friends, went to the country in advocacy of it. I informed my constituents that we had had so long a battle over free-trade and protection, that I was getting pretty sick of it,, and would like a rest. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we have all declared that there should be no more tinkering with the Tariff during the present Parliament, so that trade and commerce may be allowed a short respite and freedom of action, instead of being hampered and harassed by constant threats of changes. I told my supporters at Bendigo that I should be no party to any tinkering with the Tariff during the present Parliament, and I believe that that was the view taken by protectionist candidates generally at the last elections. </para>

There was nothing to sever or divide our party before that. I was in the country, and never came down between the time that the vote was carried against the Watson Ministry and the reassembling of Parliament. I had no invitation to attend any meeting to consider an alliance with the Labour Party, and the leader of our party was not invited. What had he done that he should have been left out of consideration? </para>

The last time that we met in caucus as a party was when" we passed' the resolution affirming that we should preserve the unity and identity of our party. And 'if it was intended to change the constitution of our party, why were we not all invited to attend the meeting convened to consider the question? </para>

The meeting was exclusive from the first because I find that those honorable members present at the meeting, which was held on the 17 th August, and reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 1 8th August, were the honorable and learned member for Indi, the honorable member for Bourke, the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs, the honorable member for Bass, the honorable member for Moreton, and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports.

                        <para>- The fact that three of our party had agreed to accept office under the leadership of the Prime Minister did not in any way deprive us of our rights and privileges as members of the Protectionist Party. Those honorable members took office on their own responsibility, and in the exercise of their deliberate judgment and discretion, as they had a perfect right to do. Their action did not dismember our party, and did not release us from our obligations to the leader who was appointed by us. I think there should be something like loyalty to a leader, so long as he remains in his position. If he betrays his trust, if he does not lead the party aright, there is a way of applying a remedy, but to go behind <inline font-weight="bold">Ms back</inline> and to call a hole-and-corner meeting is to display disloyalty of the most contemptible character. </para>

I have not yet named any honorable member within the meaning of the Standing Orders, although I have mentioned the names of some honorable members. If honorable members do not make a more dignified use of the liberties which they enjoy, I shall have to adopt the extreme course of naming them, and I need scarcely inform them that that procedure would be followed by suspension for such term as the House might direct. I hope I shall not be called upon to proceed to any such extreme. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware that my leader said anything of the kind. It is quite possible for us to work together with another party for one purpose, and remain united as a party for another purpose. We might work together, say, to keep in a Labour Ministry or a Reid Ministry for the time being, if we thought fit, without impairing the integrity of the party. The Labour Party, when supporting the Barton Administration, did not destroy themselves as a party. A political organization or political party does not necessarily destroy itself by giving support to a Ministry for, the time being. We could have maintained our homogeneity without an alliance. In my opinion the true destiny of the party was' to avoid entangling alliances. What has become of the Protectionist Party ? </para>

                        <para>- How can that be so ? Three members of the Ministry accepted office for the purpose of carrying on what was regarded as a Government evolved out of the necessities of the situation, but that does not destroy their position as members of the Liberal Party, or as Protectionists. They may be called upon by irresistible circumstances, and the drift of events, to retire from their present positions at any time, and we expect that they will be loyal to their old friends and colleagues, and come back to the Liberal Party to which they belong- </para>

                        <para>- No, I knew long ago that the Labour Party would have nothing to do with any persons except those who would sign their pledge. And quite right, too; let the Labour Party stick to their colours and their platform, But let us also stand by our colours and principles. The Labour Party have, in my opinion, shown a considerable amount of cleverness and astuteness in these negotiations, the result of which is that our Liberal-Protectionist friends have sold themselves to the Labour Party for a mess of pottage. They will have to support the Labour Party " through thick and thin." They will have to support this motion, and any other proposal the Labour Party may make, under the penalty that if they do not go the " whole hog," out they go. </para>

                        <para>- It is rather a melancholy spectacle and I regret it. I do not know whether it is too late for our Liberal-Protectionist friends to retrace their steps. They have elected to join this alliance, not as a mere temporary combination for a special purpose, but, I believe, for a period extending over two Parliaments. They are tied hand and foot to the Labour Party; and what do they get in return? Will they get protection to native industries? They cannot get that during this Parliament, according to the declaration of the leader of the Opposition. Will they get preferential trade? They cannot get that, unless the leader of the Opposition, breaks his pledges and understanding with the party to which he belongs. I do not see what the Liberal Protectionists are to gain except revenge. That apparently, is at the root of the combination - revenge ' and resentment seem to be the basic principles on which the alliance is founded, irrespective of) the political situation, irrespective of the necessity for carrying on the King's Government and maintaining that fiscal peace and industrial progress for which we all have worked, in which we are all interested, and which the country expects. The House ought to determine to deal with the Arbitration Bill during this session. No political changes ought to be encouraged by any party in the House which may lead to the defeat or loss of that Bill, about which there has been so much contention and fighting. It is inevitable that the Bill will be lost if the changes now being agitated for are brought about. The Labour Party, who desire , to have this Bill placed- on the statute-book, ought to subordinate any resentment which they feel through their defeat, and exercise a certain amount of self-restraint and self-abnegation in order to assist the House in making this Bill law. It would be a great mistake to bring about a change which might result in the loss of the Bill. And if the Labour Party are in earnest - if they do not want merely to see the Bill dangling before our eyes indefinitely - they ought to assist the Ministry in passing it. </para>

                        <para>- Then I invite the Labour Party not to bring about a change which may result in its defeat. It is plain that the Labour Party are in a position to exercise an influence which might, and no doubt would, lead to the successful accomplishment of this measure. I am not going to take up time in discussing the abstract question of Socialism ; there are more burning questions claiming our notice and attention. But I should like to give a word of advice to the Prime Minister. I am prepared to extend to the Ministry at the present moment, and under present circumstances, much indulgence for the apparent meagreness of their programme. That meagreness is the inevitable result of the present circumstances. But I think that, should the Government be able to pilot the vessel through the present storm, and get anchored in the safe haven of recess, we shall be entitled, when the House meets next year, to demand from them a workable progressive programme. </para>

I am sure the Prime Minister will not hesitate, as far as may be reasonable and necessary, to bring into play the power, authority, and force of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament for the promotion of trade, commerce, and industry. In the July number of the <inline font-style="italic">Independent Review</inline> there is an interesting article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sidney</inline> Webb, the well-known Socialist; and I desire to quote a passage, which expresses the views of myself, and, I believe, a number of other honorable members as to the differentiation between what may be regarded as the functions of individualism and the functions of the State1. The passage is as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- I consider that this dictum of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb,</inline> who is a well-known writer, affords us a true definition of the distinction between the collective regulation and the socialization of industries. The collective regulation of industries is something we can all justify, so far as it may be necessary, for the protection of the weak against the strong - for the protection of those who cannot alter their surroundings or environment. On the other hand, where the individual can exercise his powers, resources, and faculties without intervention, we ought, of course, to allow him to do so. </para>

                            points not only to the New Zealand Act, but to the Victorian Factories Act, as models at which the democracy of the mother country should aim. I did not wish to take up any more time on that branch of the question. But, to sum up my position ; in the present state of public affairs, I consider that I and my friend's around me here, who belong to the Liberal-Protectionist Party, are not only justified in our present attitude, but are bound to judge this Ministry not merely by its name, or its personnel, but by its measures, as they are severally submitted. I believe that at the present juncture of affairs, there is no probability of any more workable combination being called into existence, and that it is our duty, as far as we possibly can, to avoid any further violent and revolutionary changes. I consider that, in view of the way in which the Commonwealth has been drifting of late, with so many changes, we are undoubtedly in a position of imminent danger, and' that there is a risk of the people losing faith and confidence in and respect for our Federal institutions, if things go on much longer as they are doing.

Liberal Party which he helped to break; up, because unless that be done then we on this side of the House feel bound to support this Government so long as the period of fiscal peace endures, and so long as they are prepared to respect the traditions of the past laws and administration of the Commonwealth, and bring in measures to meet varying emergencies as they arise. On these grounds, sir, I intend to vote against the motion of want-of-confidence. </para>

                    <para>- Like the honorable and learned member who has just resumed his seat, I deprecate the frequent intrusion of so many personalities into our debates. I wish, sir, that there was a standing order framed, which would prevent honorable members from referring to anything that has transpired outside Parliament, or since the Commonwealth was established. The last speaker touched upon one matter with which I desire to deal at once, because it affects not only myself, but others who have been named. I refer to his statements with respect to the alliance, the alleged issue of some circulars calling a meeting of the Liberal Protectionists, and his remarks in connexion with the negotiations between the members of the Liberal-Protectionist Party sitting on this side of the House, and the Labour Party. There were no circulars issued by any honorable member sitting on this side of the House to any honorable member sitting on this or the other side. The only intimation given to honorable members was one which was conveyed in the press, and it was made, not as a result of any secret negotiation or anything of that kind, but by the general concurrence in the first place of all those Liberal-Protectionists who are now sitting on this side. </para>

                        <para>- No. I wish to be very particular as to the dates, because a good deal hinges upon them. Let me remind the honorable and learned member and others that the Government was defeated on the 1 2th August, that the composition of the new Ministry was not known on the 1 6th August, but that it was known on the evening of the 17th August. There was no meeting called for or held on the 1 6th August. No intimation, either oral or otherwise, was given to any honorable member of a meeting on the 16th August. But an oral intimation to some honorable members who could be seen was given of a meeting on the 17th August, and a press intimation was given to everybody for the same date. </para>

There is no truth in that statement; no circulars have been issued. No one in particular has been invited to that meeting. All who were opposed to the present Administration will be welcomed," and, speaking in a jocular fashion, I added, " We expect you- to be there." </para>

Nothing is further from the fact. On the afternoon of the 1 6th inst. I walked down Collins-street with the honorable and learned member for Indi, the honorable member for Coolgardie, and I think the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. In the street we happened to meet the honorable member for Bland and the honorable member for Boothby, and we told them of the meeting we proposed to hold the. next day. The honorable member for Bland said, " It was my intention, on behalf of my party, to have invited all those of your party who voted with me to meet us next week. I find, however, that I shall not be able to be present in Melbourne next week. Can you meet us to-morrow evening?" Speaking for myself I said, " Yes, I could," and the others said the same thing. And on that invitation the honorable members who had voted with the Government in the fatal division, were invited to meet in conference the members of the Labour Party on the evening of the 17 th August. </para>

These are the initial facts in respect to the formation of the alliance. On the evening of the 17 th August we knew which members had joined a free-trade Prime Minister, and we were quite justified, I think, at that stage in beginning to make negotiations for an alliance. </para>

                        <para>- But there were compelling circumstances, political and otherwise, as I shall prove later on, which prevented me from going to that side of the House. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, I think, must admit that the statements he has made have been based upon wrong information. The facts, as I have given them, should be sufficient to warrant the honorable and learned member in withdrawing his statements. When the negotiations had been going on for some time, and were almost quite completed, the1 honorable and learned member for Bendigo did not take up the attitude which he now assumes, because he said, "How is it that in your negotiations you have left no open door for other members of the Liberal-Protectionist Party to join you if they wish." I said, " When the terms of agreement are published, you will find that there is a special clause which will permit any member of the Liberal-Protectionist Party, no matter on which side of the House he sits, to join the alliance if he pleases." </para>

                        <para>- So much for that portion of the honorable and learned member's address. May I be permitted now to refer to another matter about which he said a great deal, and on which other honorable members have also spoken. I refer to the famous " McCay amendment," and preference to unionists. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has been endeavouring very skilfully to draw an analogy between the Victorian Factories Act and the Wages Boards under that Act, and the proposals of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. There is no real analogy between them. When the honorable and learned member says that preference to unionists means the dismissal of non-unionists, he ought to know that under the Victorian Factories Act the very reverse has been the case, and that as a matter of fact, employers and others have taken advantage of the Wages Boards to dismiss unionists. In the district which I represent, there is a very large number of persons connected with the brick, tile, and pottery industry. In order to secure the advantages of the Factories Act, they found it necessary to form a union. Is the honorable and learned member for Bendigo aware that it is impossible for employes to secure the advantages of the Victorian Factories Act, unless they form organizations ? That is a condition necessary under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and it is also a condition necessary under the Victorian Factories Act. When they formed their union, some of the men who had been active in its formation immediately became, to use their own term, " spotted men." I know that one man who had taken an active part in the formation of the union, was immediately dismissed from his employment, and he has never since been able to secure employment in any one of the yards. In another instance an employer conducting one of the yards dismissed every man in his employ who had joined the union. There is not a member of the union in his yard to-day, and he will not allow members of the union to be employed there. These facts are indisputable. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo cannot deny them, because they car: be proved up to the hilt. I say that so far from preference to unionists meaning the dismissal of non-unionists, under our Victorian Factories Act, the reverse has been the case, and unionists have suffered. Had it not been for the man to whom I have referred, and those associated with him, the brick, pottery, and tile-makers of Brunswick and other districts would not to-day be enjoying the advantages of shorter hours and better pay, than they previously received. The men who took action in forming the unions have been penalized by being dismissed from their employment, whilst those who did not join the unions are now reaping the advantages of the Act. Is that fair? Surely those who take all the risks in getting advantages for the men are entitled to get some of the advantages for themselves which others, without risk or effort, enjoy. I also wish to say, in connexion with this matter, that the honorable and learned member for Bendigo was most unfair when he said that it would be the endeavour of the Labour Party and those associated with them to turn the unions of Australia into active political agents. No such thing could happen under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as it left the hands of the late Administration, and the honorable and learned member knows it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not now dealing with! the honorable member for Maranoa. but with a far more responsible man. The honorable member for Bland gladly accepted the proposal that there should be no political significance or character attached to these organizations, and he inserted' the provision in the Bill. How, then can honorable members opposite, like the. honorable and learned member for Bendigo, say that it is the intention of honorable members on this side to turn the organization into active political agencies ? It could not be done, and it was never intended that it should be done. It is all rubbish and moonshine to say that that is what was proposed. </para>

                        <para>- We have now a Government in power which professes to have been brought into existence to do three things - to restore responsible government, to institute majority rule, and to bring about the restoration of public confidence. From what I know of the history of coalitions in the State of Victoria, I am not disposed to believe that a coalition is very conducive to the restoration of responsible government. A coalition is the very negation of responsible government. It means, in the words of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, that the Government is necessarily limited by its composite character, lt is a sort of limited liability government. When the two opposing elements in the Government desire to do any one thing - apart, from the programme put before us. which is entirely non-contentious - as a matter of course they have difficulties in coming to any agreement, and the result is a certain amount of stagnation and delay. </para>

                        <para>- They were very good at proposing Royal Commissions before they became a Government. If honorable members will look at the policy put before us. they will see that what I. have just said is proved conclusively. Every item included in it is purely non-contentious. All matters of real importance to the country are carefully set aside. Why? Because I suppose the Government have not yet been able to agree upon them. Take such matters, for instance, as the great question of preferential trade. </para>

                        <para>- The late Prime Minister will be able to answer the honorable member for himself when he replies to the debate. The Government have three principal planks in their programme. They propose to oppose Socialism. That is plank No. 1. They propose to fight unionism and the Labour Party - that is plank No. 2. And plank No. 3, and the most important of them all, is their proposal to get into recess. If they mean to oppose Socialism, do they intend to repeal some of the measures which honorable members who now hold the fate of the Ministry in their hands, helped to put upon the statute-book ? Do they propose to repeal" some of those socialistic measures which were placed on the statute-book by honorable members like thf honorable and learned member for Bendigo, and which the members of the free-trade section of the coalition opposite have in past speeches condemned everywhere in Australia? I think' not. ,Are they in their offices only to prevent legislation? Are they there to sit still and do nothing? Is that what is meant by responsible government ; or are they going at some time to agree upon a policy and let us know what it is by putting it before the public? I take it that the people of this country will not be satisfied with a mere stand-still or sit-still Ministry. They will not be satisfied with the mere statement of opposition to Socialism or the prevention of' legislation. What the country wants is that something should be done, and! done quickly. </para>

That was done, not so much because the right honorable gentleman desired to institute majority rule, but because he wished to give a sop to the protectionist element in Australia, in order to make the protectionists believe that by giving half the representation of his Cabinet to that party, protection in Australia would be safe. If majority rule is to be instituted, the protectionists should alone be represented in the Cabinet. They number two-thirds of the members of this House, and they are in a greater majority in the country. What nonsense it is for honorable members to speak about majority rule, when the fate of the Ministry really lies in the hands of any one honorable member sitting behind it. That has been openly boasted by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo to-day, and by other honorable members repeatedly during the time the Ministry has been in existence. Let me turn now to another matter about which something has been said, and that is the restoration of public confidence. What did the Prime Minister say about this business ?

He is going to restore public confidence by declaring fiscal peace, while industries are being strangled wholesale, and men are out of employment and are leaving these shores ! The way to restore public confidence would be to find employment for our people, and to retain our population. Victoria has lost during the last two years, because of the improper nature of the Commonwealth Tariff, 30,000 persons, of whom 24,000 were adults. If the Prime Minister and his Government wish to restore public confidence, they must bring back these persons, and others besides, and they can do so only by declaring the fiscal truce off, and by giving adequate protection to the industries concerned. </para>

                        <para>- No. If <inline font-style="italic">"I</inline> had known them, I should not have advocated fiscal peace. Since then, however, the Government Statist has given us trie figures which I have quoted. Those who have left Victoria were men connected with industries which could, and should be protected - agricultural implement makers, engineers, boilermakers, and others of kindred trades. Will public confidence be restored if the fiscal truce is allowed to continue, and if we fail to grant bonuses for the production of iron ? I do not wish to anticipate any debate which may take place on the latter subject, but the development of our great natural deposits of iron ore would give work to a large number of people, and would supply a great quantity of raw product to those engaged in engineering and other works. The subject is therefore one which should have the attention of any Government, and I more particularly of a Government which claims to be desirous of restoring public confidence. </para>

                        <para>- It is in the programme of the alliance, and will be one of the first measures dealt with if we get into power. Do honorable members think that the proper way to restore public confidence is to repeal, as the Prime Minister has threatened to do as soon as he gets a majority, the provisions of the Immigration Restriction and the Post and Telegraph Acts, which prohibit the importation of coloured and contract labour into this country? If the provision which prohibits the importation of persons under contract is repealed, such persons will be brought here at reduced wages, and the conditions of our working classes will be even worse than they are at present. The Prime Minister, however, says that he is in favour of repealing that provision. He is also opposed to the provisions which we passed for the maintenance of a White Australia, and says that he will repeal them whenever he gets the opportunity. I do not think that such declarations are likely to restore public confidence ; but, no doubt, when the democracy of this country speaks on the subject, it will pronounce its verdict in no uncertain tories. </para>

                        <para>- Some men have advocated a number of things in order to get into Parliament, but their subsequent performances have not fulfilled their promises. The Prime Minister does not believe in giving preference' to Australian-made goods in connexion with tenders for Government supplies, or Government contracts. A policy, of that kind will do a great deal to prevent the restoration of public confidence. The proper way to restore public confidence is to begin to use our own products and manufactures, so as to encourage and find employment for our own people. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth declared at the last elections that it had no confidence in the Prime Minister, and I am satisfied that when it pronounces judgment again that verdict will be repeated. I have already made some reference to the question of preference to unionists, but I wish to say a little more respecting the matter. Some time ago the Prime Minister said that the Ministry were individualists, whereas those on this side of the Chamber - he was referring more particularly to the Labour Party - were for equal opportunities " with the postscript added, 1 provided you are a unionist.' " The right honorable gentleman, when he made that statement, surely forgot that he is a member of one of the biggest unions in Australia, to which that postscript certainly applies. The Lawyers' Union is the most restrictive on earth. It suits the right honorable gentleman to declare himself an individualist, in order to tickle the ears of the groundlings ; but it does not suit him to be an individualist in matters connected with the profession of the law. He is not in favour of a minimum wage, but he is in favour of a minimum fee, I suppose. Personally I do not see much difference between a salary or a fee, and wages or remuneration. My point is that a man who prates about being an individualist and against Socialism is a member of the strongest and. most conservative union in Australia, and perhaps in the world. Let me say here that I am exactly the same kind of Socialist as is the right honorable gentleman. I go no further than he iri my Socialism, and I. do not know that any member of the alliance goes any further.

In a new country like this, with its broad acres, splendid soil, magnificent climate, all sparsely settled, it ought not to be difficult to obtain a remedy.

I extend my Socialism to all classes, I do not confine it to the agricultural classed ; and I not only give them my sympathy, but I back it up by voting for arbitration and factory legislation, and whatever else will do them good. Two or three others on the Ministerial side of the Chamber will perhaps be astonished to find that they favour certain sorts of Socialism of which I approve. The honorable member for. Flinders, for example", favours the establishment of an agricultural bureau, grants to farmers, and other Government action of that kind, and&gt; so do I. The honorable and learned member for Wannon holds similar views, and also' supports the insertion in our mail contracts of clauses to provide for the cheaper and better carriage of fruit, dairy produce, and other commodities from Australia to the markets of the world. I go as far as do both honorable members in connexion with those matters. But when the, Ministry as a whole say that their chief business is to combat Socialism, it is surely interesting to recollect what they individually have done in the nature of socialistic action. When the Prime Minister wishes to pose as a democrat, ' arid the friend of the toiling masses, he relies on the fact that he was responsible for . the imposition of a tax upon the unimproved value of land in New South Wales. But when he wishes to frighten the electors of Australia, he says that the proposal to institute a Commonwealth tax on land values to provide for a Commonwealth old-age pensions system is Socialism, and something which must be fought to the very death. Then the Minister of Trade and Customs - the other head of the Ministry - who says thai the one danger to Australia is Socialism, was, when in office in Victoria, most active in the furtherance of socialistic schemes. It is to the honorable member for Gippsland that we owe the institution in Victoria of workmen's homes. It was he who established the first village settlement in Victoria. That is the Best kind of Socialism that could obtain anywhere. And yet he now tells us that those who are in favour of that policy are a menace and a danger to the' State, and ought not to be countenanced for a moment. To him also we have to give the credit of having placed under the Victorian Factories Act more trades and occupations than have all the other Premiers put together. It was he who said, in effect, " These people are labouring under an injustice; I will see that that injustice is removed." And he removed it by inducing the Victorian Parliament to pass resolutions which had the effect of placing a great number of industries under the Victorian. Factories Act. Yet he now says that Socialism, as advocated by honorable members on this side of the House, should be combated. Then the Treasurer, who, although he has not said anything, no doubt indorses the sentiments of the Minister of Trade and Customs, did a very fine thing for Victoria, and caused his name to be blessed in many homes when h"e instituted the Cr6dit Foncier system. The proposals of the leader of the Opposition to interfere with the banks has been very seriously condemned, and yet the Treasurer amalgamated the Savings Bank and the Post Office Savings Bank, and placed their funds at the disposal of our farmers. But for his action many a man who is on the land to-day would have been a ruined outcast, and many farms which now remain in the hands of small proprietors might have passed into the hands of wealthy capitalists. When Ministers talk against Socialism they should recollect what has been done by themselves in times past. Then the Postmaster- 8 n </para>
                <para class="block">General, who is a most active opponent of Socialism, made a novel socialistic experiment when he imported a number of prize bulls into New South Wales in order to assist the farmers of that State. The only complaint [ have heard in that connexion has been caused by the fact that the bulls have not produced any stock. This prating of the dangers of Socialism is so much rubbish. All honorable members know that the Socialism of Australia is not the Socialism of Europe. Turning to one or two personal matters, I wish to say that it is very improper for a responsible Minister to impute motives to honorable members. The Prime Minister is wont to refer to some honorable members on this side of the Chamber as having entered into an alliance with the Labour Party with the object of securing some personal gain. That is a most improper remark to make. Speaking in Sydney, he said - </para>

                <para class="block">I desire to say that before entering into this alliance 1 knew well that I should probably not be able to secure - I did not seek any such thing - immunity from opposition on the part of the Political Labour Council in the district I represent. As a matter of fact, I have had to fight labour candidates on three occasions, and each time I have been returned by an increasing majority. I knew before I entered the alliance that the same kind of opposition would probably have to be fought again, and I was solely influenced by my own political views and my desire to represent the opinions of my constituents. Therefore, when the Prime Minister seeks to make honorable members believe that I was actuated by some paltry considerations of personal gain, he is speaking without the slightest justification. Before entering the existing alliance, I wrote to all the members of my committee - some hundreds of ladies and gentlemen - and invited them to attend a public meeting at Brunswick. I placed' before them the coalition proposals as agreed to by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and the Prime Minister, and I also submitted to them the proposals for an alliance made about the same time by the leader of the Labour Party. I told them that I did not think it right to accept the proposals of the right honorable member for East Sydney and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. I added that I desired to obtain an expression of their opinion with regard to both the proposals. I said scarcely anything else. There was a long discussion, and eventually the following resolutions were carried.: - </para>

                </quote>
                <para>I had, therefore, some warrant for joining the alliance quite apart from my own individual feelings. As to the second proposal, all the meeting had to say was this - </para>

The honorable member for Perth, during his speech in this debate, referred to statements which I was reported to have made concerning the Labour Party. I wish to put that matter right. He stated that I was reported to have said - </para>

                <para>It was so stated in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and I do not blame the honorable member for having been misled. I should not have made any reference to the matter but for the fact that an inaccurate report has been placed on record, and I think that its refutation should have equal publicity. Honorable members know that I was opposed at the last election by a labour candidate, that the fight was a very severe one, and that neither of us. spared the other. Among other things I had to answer statements contained in pamphlets', such as one I have here, entitled, " Hume Cook's double shuffle on the White Australia Question." In that pamphlet my opponent, sought to show that I was a black Australian. Among those who assisted my opponent were some persons connected with the Trades Hall Council, "and certain events occurred which seemed to afford me a chance of getting back at my opponents. The Trades Hall had been asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fleming</inline> for the use of some portion of their building, for the purpose of holding a meeting to commemorate the death of some anarchists. The Trades Hall Council, in perfect friendliness, but hardly knowing what they were doing, granted the use of the hall, and as a result a small bill was issued, which read as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">The meeting was to be held on Wednesday, nth November, some time prior to the day of the election, and certain speakers were announced, including one of the gentlemen to whom I have referred as having been very active in opposing me. When I obtained possession of that bill I . called a meeting, which was principally for ladies, and which was very largely attended. I read the bill to the meeting, and then said, " I want to ask you what anarchy means ?" Then I gave the best definition I could, quoting <inline font-style="italic">Webster,</inline> according to whom anarchy means " absence of civil government." Proceeding with my remarks, I said, " What would eventuate if we had in Victoria an absence of civil government? The police, the law courts, and the Judiciary would be swept away, men and women would be free to follow their own sweet will, and the results would be such that we scarcely dare contemplate them. I am not an anarchist," I said, " and I am not supported by any anarchists. If we have anarchy in this country, " I added, "it would be worse than letting loose some of the wild beasts from the Zoological Gardens." I went on to say, " If anarchy means the absence of civil government, it means that every person is free to do as he. or she likes, and unfortunately, we know that there are a number of men and women, though probably <inline font-style="italic">more</inline> men than women, who, if they could give free rein to their passions, would be worse than wild beasts." I spoke only of anarchists. I made no reference whatever to the Labour Party in this connexion. The proof of my statement lies in the particular pamphlet to which I have referred, and in another circumstance. The Trades Hall Council, and its associated political party, at a later stage gave the greatest justification to my remarks, and by their action did themselves honour. As soon as the pamphlet was issued, the Trades Hall Council saw that a mistake had been made. A special meeting was held on the 4th April, when a report was presented on the subject, and, in order to justify their position before the world, the council expelled from their ranks the man who was an anarchist and the cause of the meeting. The honorable and learned member for Wannon, the honorable member for Perth, and others who have misquoted me, will in future be able to state the facts. </para>

                        <para>- How are we to have prosperity for those on the land unless there be preferential trade? The Australian market has been "wiped out" by the Tariff, and unless greater opportunities are afforded in this direction, our farmers will be ruined. And unless we get a market in the mother country on preferential terms, the condition in Australia generally will be even worse. The Ministry sit still, and wait for the mother country, but we on this side are prepared to do something now. There are now no markets - let us get markets. The right honorable member fort Swan talks about land settlement, and finding employment for the people; but how can either of these objects be achieved unless there be preferential trade ? The honorable and learned member for Wannon, who poses as one of the friends of the farmer, and describes those on this side of the House as the farmer's enemies, said, when speaking on this subject at Koroit, that there was a very large trade done between Australia and Germany, and that " it would be a pity to interfere with it." I am not concerned about building up a trade with Germany, but only about building up a trade with our own kith and kin. It would appear as though the honorable and learned member took an oath of allegiance to the German Emperor, and not to the King of England. Are those the farmers' friends who want to support German trade - to build up German manufactures and continental industries, instead of the manufactures and industries of their own country ? </para>

The real friends of the farmer are those who are going to give him prosperity - those who are prepared to do something for preferential trade, and not those who sit on the Treasury benches waiting for the mother country to move. </para>

                        <para>- We desire to send our wheat, wool, wine, oil, and other products to Great Britain, and admit, on preferential terms mutually advantageous, commodities not manufactured, or likely to be manufactured, in Australia, but manufactured in England by British workmen. I am prepared to repeal some duties altogether. Does that surprise the honorable member for Robertson? I am prepared to repeal the duty on such articles as cotton goods, tin plates, pig-iron, and raw material generally, not manufactured or produced in Australia. I am prepared to give the British people an absolute preference in the free admission of goods which are not manufactured here at present, and to reduce other duties. </para>

He said that if the truce were not extended over the next general election the members of the Liberal-Protectionist Party could be made use of by the free-traders until some time prior to the next general election, and then dropped. And when the honorable and .learned member for Ballarat was asked for an explanation of this matter he said, " That is quite true. This proposal as to submission before the 1st May, 1906, means that we are to get six months' notice of any proposed abolition of the truce, so that we, too, can prepare our weapons: of warfare, and carry on the fight in a proper manner." </para>

                        <para>- I shall show the honorable member how it was proposed to cripple us, and how the protectionists who have joined the free-traders on the other side are under worse conditions than were offered to us. The free-traders propose to cripple us by organizing during the whole period oi the truce. Although we had been asked to agree to a truce, which in any case was to last until the 1st May!, 1.906, the free-traders in Sydney and elsewhere were not respecting the truce, but were organizing, doing their level best to get literature circulated, branches formed, and candidates in evidence, and intending to try to sweep the polls as far as our party was concerned. That has not been denied, because the leaders of this movement were the present Postmaster-General and the honorable member for Lang. </para>

Under these circumstances, we on this side were more than justified' in entering into an alliance ito prevent ;the (success of this Ministry and their supporters at the polls, and to avert the downfall of the Protectionist Party.

                <para class="block">I want to see how they will come right in the end. Can the Minister say how they will? In view of the fact that even the first proposals have been repudiated, or are not being acted upon, can he go out and fight other members of the Ministry at the elections? I think not. Will those honorable members who sit behind the Ministry be in a position to fight the men with whom they have be'en allied here? I think not. The probabilities are that the Ministers will have to support the Ministerial policy or resign, just as their supporters will have to support the Ministerial policy, or go alone. By that time they will be tied to the Ministry; they will have betrayed their constituents," and they will be unable to fight for the Liberal-Protectionist Party. The coalition does not give them what was proposed by the agreement submitted in May last. It leaves them subservient to the domination of a free-trade majority on that side, whilst we have a protectionist majority on this side: We are told that the real protectionists are on the other side, but I say that the numbers are on this side. The real dominating party on the other side are free-traders. Of thirty-eight members on that side, twenty-five are ' free-traders and* thirteen are protectionists; while of thirty-six members on this side, only nine are freetraders, and twenty-seven are protectionists. Where, then, ds the Protectionist Party in this House ? Surely it is to be found on this side. </para>

                        <para>- They are trapped all right. They cannot fight on the protectionist side any more, dominated as they are by a free-trade Prime Minister and a free-trade majority. Some members of the Ministry will find that they cannot fight on our side when the real contest takes place. </para>

                        <para>- We have been told that we have no right to raise it, because there was a Tariff peace, and that I, amongst other honorable members, fought for that. I admit at once, without any hesitation, that when the last election took place I spoke against the raising of the Tariff issue during the present Parliament. I do not deny that, but what I say is that since the election took place facts and figures have come to the knowledge of protectionist members which compel us to raise the issue. </para>

                        <para>- We determined the peace, and, being the victors in the fight, we had a right, as I have previously asserted, if the terms did not suit us, to raise the issue again. I have raised it. I do not deny that in so doing my attitude may appear, though it really is not, inconsistent with my platform pledge. The platform pledge I made was to support the industries of Australia against foreign competition. I thought at the time that the best way in which to do that was to maintain the existing Tariff, but I now say frankly that the existing Tariff does not meet the case. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> is quite true that 1 promised to support the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. In connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, 1 told the electors that I was in favour of the inclusion of the railway servants in the Bill ; but I also told them then that I considered the fate of the Government, as it was a Protectionist Government, was of more importance than the inclusion of the railway servants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. 1 told them frankly that they must not expect me to vote for the inclusion of the railway servants if it meant the defeat of the Deakin Government. I have kept my promise. I voted with the Deakin Government, and helped to maintain it in power, and I am sorry that it ever went out of power. When the Minister of Defence twits me with not supporting the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, he surely forgets that. I have already said that the truce which has been proclaimed by the present Prime Minister was proclaimed by the right honorable gentleman himself, and not by any one else. I have shown that that truce could have been declared off, practically at any time, on giving six months' notice; but in any case, in May of 1906. I now wish to show that there are other reasons which compel us to speak of this matter, and I have a case in point. The free-trade importers of this country have, on many occasions, acted unfairly in their endeavour to destroy our manufacturing industries. I have in my hand a letter written to a firm of tanners in New South. Wales, by the Fred. Alderson Company, Limited, of Bulletin-lane, Macquarie Place, Sydney. It is so remarkable a letter, that I think it deserves to be placed on the records. It reads as follows - </para>

                <para class="block">Here is some proof of the necessity for raising this issue, when ' a firm declares, practically in print, thai: they are reducing the price of their goods - for a time only - in order to stamp out local competition. And they think the matter so urgent that the goods ought to be cabled for in order to break up the opposition of the local manufacturing firms. I have said before, and I now repeat, that that kind of competition had the effect of reducing the number of men employed in making this particular class of machinery by 50 per cent. There will be no one left in the industry if these tactics are to be resorted to, and more men will be le'aving the country, in addition to the 30,000 who, it is said, have already left it. </para>

                        <para>- The subject was the then leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister, and his free-trade supporters. Some of the democratic followers who jeer at that statement, like the honorable member for Flinders, and the honorable member for Kooyong, and who are now supporting the Reid-McLean Ministry, went around prior to the institution of womanhood suffrage condemning it in every way. It is true that they are now hustling around forming national leagues for women, and telling them at every meeting that the Labour and Socialist Party is the anarchist party. Only a night or two ago, in the presence of the honorable and learned member for Wannon, who did not contradict the statement, the chairman at one of these meetings said that the Socialist and Labour Party were also the anarchist party. </para>

There are some other democratic supporters of the Government like the honorable and learned member for Wannon, who is against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, lock, stock, and barrel; the ' honorable member for Kooyong, who did not believe in women's suffrage, but who is now a chief organizer of national councils for women; and the honorable member for Flinders, who does not believe in Socialism, but does believe in its application to agricultural societies and things of that sort. Some other supporters of the Government outside this House have made a number of democratic statements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> for instance, is one of the brilliant democratic followers of the present Ministry. Speaking on 19th August at a meeting' held in the Caulfield Town Hall to a branch of the Australian National Women's League - they are all addressing the ladies in these times, though they did not help them to get a vote - the honorable and learned senator said - </para>

                    <para>A fight between class and class is coming, and it would be suicidal folly if organization was not pushed on. It was going to be all classes against the Labour Party. Unless organization was proceeded with the result would be disastrous. Members should see that all they could influence were on the rolls, and second, that they all voted. It would be necessary at election time to combine with such associations as the Reform League or Employers' Federation in the selection of candidates, otherwise two sound anti-Socialists would be put up against one labour nominee. </para>

                <para>We, on behalf of the Executive and Parliamentary Council of the above Federation, again bring under your notice the position of our reserve and fighting fund. It was anticipated that this fund - which is utilized for electioneering purposes - might easily be made up to £20,000, but is at present very much short of that amount. </para>
                <para>At this stage in the history of the Commonwealth, we need not remind you of the absolute necessity for a live, active body, supported by liberal funds, to combat the Labour-Socialistic Party in the forthcoming elections. </para>
                <para>The Trades Hall people are not hampered by any want of funds, every unionist must contribute, besides which they have a lien on the salary of every member elected. </para>
                <para>We are not taking up the alarmist's position when we say that the question is, whether you will now contribute your portion towards helping on our good work or stand the risk of losing all? </para>
                <para>You have only to carefully read the speeches of the Labour-Socialistic nominees, together with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Mann, to see what lies in the background once they become permanently dominant in the Commonwealth politics. </para>
                <para>We would also point out that any donations to this fund- to be of use to the Federation in the present elections - must be forwarded at once. </para>
                <para>The secretary would be pleased to see you at any time, and make clear the large volume of efficient work now being done by this Federation, both in Victoria and all parts of the Commonwealth, in combating Socialism. </para>

                <para class="block">That letter was issued to quite a number of persons, and came into my hands quite properly. The Employers' Federation are not only endeavouring to combat Socialism, but they are trying to get people to subscribe to their funds' by saying that the Labour Party will take from them all that they have. There was never a bigger libel published. The letter was issued just prior to the last general elections ; but the same persons are to-day requesting subscriptions for funds for the same purpose, and are sending out their paid organizer to various part's of Victoria to combat the views of the Labour Party as they did before. I believe that he is starting on a new trip to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. I entered' Parliament before the Labour Party, as now constituted, came into existence, and I have held a seat in Parliament for over ten years. Whenever I have been opposed by Labour candidates, I have beaten them by constantly increasing majorities; but, as a matter of fact, I have not yet nominated against a Labour candidate. The men who supported me at the last election were the Liberal-Protectionists of Bourke, while those who supported the Labour candidates were those who believed in the platform of the Labour Party. The man who was supported by the Employers' Federation and the Reform League was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grundy,</inline> the conservative candidate, and I beat him by over 4,000 votes. In these circumstances, we are quite justified in saying that we have no confidence in the Government, first, because they have declared a truce in which we do not believe, and which we cannot support, because it will do injury to the interests of Australia. We do not believe in them, because their boast, that they will restore public confidence, is a phrase which means nothing, especially in view of the fact that at the time when they should be doing something, thousands of persons are leaving these shores, because the Tariff is operating in such a way that trade is being taken from our industries, and they cannot give employment. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that there have been losses of population from Victoria for a long period. They were due, in the first instance, to the great banking crisis. At that time 75 per cent. of the banking institutions of Australia closed their doors; but we are carrying on to-day without any repudiation, which is a grand thing to be able to say. Probably no other country would have done what Australia has done in this matter. The second reason why population left Victoria was that the bank smashes were followed by a succession of bad seasons. Had it not been for the development of the Western Australian gold-fields, this country would no doubt have lost even more heavily than it has done. But whereas in the two years prior to the imposition of the Federal Tariff, Victoria lost only 9,000 persons, in the two succeeding years she lost 30,000 persons; and while the Commonwealth as a whole gained in population in the first period, it has lost about 6,000 persons, of whom 4,000 were adults, in the second period. The operation of the Tariff is responsible for this loss of population. The next reason why we have no confidence in the present Administration is that it is the result of a coalition, and the history of coalitions in Victoria has been so disastrous that we do not wish to repeat it. </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that I expect opposition from some of the branch leagues in my electorate; but I shall not be opposed by those with whom I am allied, and I. shall have their support if I ask for it. Then we are opposed to the Government because; while they profess to be the friends of the farmers, the artisans, and the producers generally, they are content to leave untouched such questions as the granting of bonuses for the production of iron and preferential trade. I cannot and will not support a combination which does that. I am opposed to the Government also because it is supported, both in this House and outside, not by a brilliant democratic following, but by an unscrupulous conservative following. I do not use my own terms and phrases in so describing it. The character of its backers outside is to. me the best of reasons for not supporting the Government. In the next place, the man whom I honour above all others in the political life in this country, and whose lead I should be content to follow if he were a free man, is not a member of the coalition, but is giving such support to it as leaves him free to act against it whenever he thinks fit to do so. When he chooses to again lead the party with which I am associated - and it must be remembered that the Labour Party were willing to accept him as their leader - he will be in the position in which all the Liberal Protectionists and democrats wish to see him. In the meantime, his position and attitude give the keynote to my position and attitude. If he cannot join the Ministry, I cannot support it. Lastly, I feel that the protectionists who have agreed to follow the right honorable member for East Sydney have been so betrayed and trapped that they will never be able to join our party again. As the result, we have been compelled to enter into an alliance with the Labour Party, and have, in the full light of day, put forward a programme which we believe represents the democratic thought and feeling of this continent. For that programme we will fight, and by it we will stand or fall. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Bourke, in the course of his remarks, indicated that he anticipated that I would make things warm for him. I have no such intention. The honorable member, during the last fortnight, has been so depressed, and has looked so miserable, probably as the result of the prickings of a guilty conscience, that I do not find it in my heart to lay the lash very heavily upon him. He said that he had abandoned the Turner Government because it had written off . £2,500,000 from the liabilities of the water trusts. What was actually written off was £700,000 from the irrigation trusts, £180,000 from various town waterworks, and £160,000 odd from local government bodies, making a total of something over £1,000,000 of capital, together with arrears of interest, amounting to a little over £500,000. Thus the remissions aggregated only about £1,500,000, instead of £2,500,000 mentioned by the honorable member. After speaking most eulogistically of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, he stated that if that honorable gentleman came back as the leader of a great Liberal Party, he would be glad enough to fall into line, and again accept him as a leader. I always thought that one's manliness was shown, not by coming back to a leader at the height of his success, but in standing by him when he was obliged temporarily to take a place in the background. The loyalty of such an individual as the honorable member for Bourke is not of very much value, and I do not know that we need discuss it, because from what has occurred during the last few days, it is not likely that after the next general election he will' have another chance of following either the honorable and learned member for Indi, or the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. It is charged against the present Government that their programme is a very small one. If the Ministry had brought down an elaborate programme, they would have been most furiously attacked for deluding the people, by holding out anticipations that could never be realized; and, therefore, the Prime Minister has shown his wisdom by bringing down a programme containing only a few items. The Government may succeed in carrying out a short programme, provided that the present crisis is overcome, and after that I think the best thing we could have would be a period of political rest, during which we could settle down and review our position. During this debate, one very important question has been almost lost sight of. I refer to the feelings with which the public must regard the position into which this Parliament has drifted. We are wrangling here over matters of comparatively small importance, and are thrusting into the background those great considerations for which the people were induced to federate. When we remember the aspirations of the people, and the hopes in which they were led to indulge, and consider the miserable pass to which we have been reduced, we have every reason to feel ashamed and humiliated. When we went to the country at the ..last election, we were able to present a record of good work - of stupendous work which had been accomplished during the three years preceding. That work was necessarily of a foundation character,' and was, perhaps, of little direct interest to the public. Still it was important, and it was well and solidly performed. It was realized at the last election that most of our foundation work had been accomplished, and . the late Government set before the people a programme of practical legislation, calculated to secure the advancement oof the people, the settlement of the land, the completion of arrangements for the utilization of our water resources, and the initiation of a generally progressive policy for the encouragement of industry and enterprise in every possible way. What has been the result ? We have been here since 2nd March, and we stand today absolutely discredited, owing to the small quantity of work we have been able to do. Every one of the State Parliaments is able to show a better record. The Victorian Parliament particularly, with its schemes of land settlement and water conservation, is putting us to utter shame. Apart from the expenditure in connexion with the transferred Departments, we have spent upon Federation up to the present over ^1,000,000. Exclusive of Ministers' salaries and one or two other items which it might not be fair to charge, the expenditure upon the Legislature last session amounted to ,£162,000. We sat for 101 days, and ' therefore every sitting cost the country over £1,600. What have we done during the present session? No Parliament ever had a more miserable record. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind that provision is an absolute sham, a delusion, and a snare. It is a sham, because honorable members know in their hearts that the High Court will hold that the provision is unconstitutional. They know, further, that none of the States will submit to be governed by such a provision, and that even if the High Court sustains our action they will appeal to the Privy Council. - To those who are expecting that the provision will confer some benefit upon them, it is an absolute delusion, because it is holding out hopes that cannot possibly be realized. It is a snare, because it represents some of the bird-lime which, as the Premier of Western Australia has said, has been used by the Labour Party in order to catch supporters, and to further their cause. The theory of the Arbitration Bill is splendid, and if a measure could be framed upon sound and impartial lines, it would no doubt accomplish a great deal of good. The experience gained in New South Wales and New Zealand is not, however, at all conclusive that such a measure as that which has been recently before us would operate in the best interests of the community. The New Zealand Act has been criticised by impartial persons, including <inline font-weight="bold">Dr, Clarke,</inline> who was sent out specially from America to inquire into its working, and who wrote an adverse report upon it. In New Zealand extreme doubt is entertained whether the measure will prove beneficial.

                    <para>New Zealand, for the next few years, will be an object-lesson to political economists. She is making experiments for the whole world, but, in the main, I am convinced she is doing it in a blind way. The enormous increase of the export trade, which has nothing to do with arbitration awards, has given her prosperity, and, therefore, the ability to bear the burden of social experiments. Industrial arbitration has affected every class, every phase of life. An award in one trade increases the cost of living in all the others. There is a perpetual enhancement of values. A dragon has been let loose in the land, because it was thought to be harmless, but he is gaining strength, and will devour the people unless they manage to chain him. Who is going to chain him? Not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> who thinks it is right that he should roam at large and for ever. It was not foreseen that an artificial value placed on labour would result in artificial values being placed on everything else. </para>

Carried to its logical issue as it has been, it has bred trusts in all directions. But for the fact that these trusts are the direct outcome of the fixing of payment for labour by law, the trade unionists would to-day be carrying on a vehement agitation against them. They dare not raise an outcry, because they know that investigation might suggest remedies of which they could not approve. </para>

The last census gave a total of 234,346 male and female wage earners. The 27,000 unionists claim preference under the awards, and, at the same time, their awards result in the whole population paying higher prices. </para>

                <para class="block">We hear a good deal about protection and the new protection. No doubt both are very good, but, like all good things, they can be carried to extremes. In all likelihood, a third kind of protection will spring into existence. This will contemplate, first of all, protection to the manufacturing interests; secondly, protection to the employes ; and, thirdly, protection to the consumers. The regulation of all these matters upon a fair and. equitable basis wil tax the very best energies and the genius of those who have to deal with economic and fiscal questions. They will have to see that the great bulk of the people who do not share in the direct benefits of the protective system are not oppressed too harshly.

                        <para>- The whole circumstances show that the party deliberately pursued a course which could have no other result than the ejectment of the then Government; and for them to say that they did not want office is much the same as a highwayman, who holds a pistol to your head, saying that he does not want your purse. If it were not correct that the Labour Party wanted office, why were there those paeans of exultation throughout Australia, and in other parts of the world? Why was there that miserable whining and crying when they were defeated - such whining and crying as I have never seen in this Chamber during my twenty years of parliamentary life? If the Labour Party were so keen about the success of the Arbitration Bill - if the measure was so immediately necessary - why did they not take action when last year the Government laid the Bill aside rather than accept the clause proposed? It was because the foundations were not completed; there was important work yet to be done, and they waited, cuckoo-like, until the nest was ready. I do not blame the Labour Party for taking office. I have nothing to say against them as a party, and if the people desire Labour rule, I shall cheerfully acquiesce and help such a Government all I can. But I detest the hypocritical affectation of indifference which they assume when they declare that they did not want office. It has been repeated over and over again by men who know better, that the Labour Government did not receive fair play. The honorable and learned member for Indi said that that Government did not receive fair play, either during their term of office or when they were defeated. "In what does unfair play consist ? Unfair play consists in misrepresentation of the party, in delaying business, in stone-walling measures, in not making a House in order that measures may be considered, in refusing to give pairs, and in generally blocking business. What were the facts? The whole of the time the Labour Government were in office not one attempt was made to deal with them unfairly. There' was scarcely a day during which the Labour Party were in office, when, if the Opposition had desired, they could not have walked out of the Chamber and caused a count-out. It is notorious that nearly the whole of the time that Government, were in office the Government benches were almost empty, five or six being the largest attendance, except at the opening of the sitting. During the whole of their term a House had to be kept by the Opposition; and yet we are told that the Government did not receive fair play. It is utterly absurd to make such a charge. </para>

On the day the House was counted out I was present, and I ' saw that there were only twenty-three honorable members' within the Chamber. We had to wait two or three minutes for one or two honorable members to come in, and immediately it was known there had been a House, some ten or a dozen labour members appeared. I observed at the time that it looked as though the Labour Party desired to have a count-out. </para>

On the advent qf that Ministry, the Protectionist Party Held a meeting, and it was decided, after considerable discussion, that there should be no attempt to unseat them. The first business at the first meeting of the Protectionist Party was the election of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat as leader; and that fact requires to be borne in mind during the remarks' I intend to make. The party not only selected the honorable and learned member as leader, but commissioned him to endeavour to make arrangements to bring about majority rule in the House. At a meeting held subsequently the honorable and learned member reported that the Labour Party would enter into no coalition or alliance. </para>

In connexion with that resolution, it has always been supposed that the present Prime Minister showed an eager grasping for office.

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member for Ballarat submitted to the meeting the agreement that had been arrived at between the present Prime Minister and himself. The little difference between the party on this :side of the House and the Opposition is shown in the extraordinary fact that the policy of the Watson Government, which was issued at that same time, was almost absolutely word for word the same as that arrived at in the agreement referred to. When the Government and honorable members on this side are taunted with being conservative and retrogressive - with having all the worst elements in the Commonwealth on their side - I hold up the two programmes, and point to the fact that, with the exception of one small item, they are identical, word for word. If that is the programme which the Watson Government desired to' see carried into effect, and in the carrying out of which we were prepared to assist in Opposition, where is the necessity for the motion now before the House? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member desires to be funny, but he is successful only in a very small way. The three-legged glue pot is an implement used in a very honest occupation, and it is only one of some fifty or sixty other articles which I endeavoured to have placed on the free list when the Tariff was before us. Those articles included all hollow ware, such as pots and pans. I do not know what there is for honorable members to laugh at in these remarks; my only wish is to give an explanation of how the phrase " three-legged glue pot " continues to be thrown at me by people who have no sense. As I said before, the party resolved to hold together. What did that mean? It meant that we were to hold together under the honorable and learned member for Ballarat as our leader. Who broke that party up? Did not the honorable and learned member for Indi, the honorable member for Bourke, and the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs choose to pursue a course of their own in connexion with the Arbitration Bill ? Every now and then they came to the assistance of the Government, without consulting their party or the leader they had agreed to follow. </para>

                        <para>- During the last seven months what evidence was shown by the then Government of a desire to push on with business? Was not the reproach hurled against them night after night by the honorable member for Kennedy, that they were not pushing on with the business, and were adjourning the House too early? Did he not say that he for one was tired of coming from a far distant State, and hanging about here doing next to nothing? That was his charge against the late Ministry, and it was a true one. Their whole object was to allow things to drift until the Budget was delivered, and then to go into recess. It has been said that they received no fair play. As regards the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, there were only four points of difference between the two sides. The first was in regard to the inclusion of the State servants. That proposal was carried with certain modifications. The second was in reference to the proposal that an industrial organization should not be permitted to apply its funds to political purposes, or require its members to' do anything of a political character, which the Government accepted on the motion of the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs. The third was in regard to the inclusion of farm servants, and the fourth related to the question of preference, on which, finally, the break-up occurred. I believe that if the then Prime Minister had been allowed to have his own way, he would have accepted the Bill, with preference as it was, because it was a liberal measure. But the unions which he said last Sunday night dominated the party, would not accept that position. </para>

                        <para>- What I believe is that the question of political power was a much greater one with the unions than the question of preference. Yet we found the Watson Government, after losing nearly twelve months in discussing its provisions, refusing to accept the measure, or to assist in passing it on to the Senate, simply on the ground that it did not provide for preference to unionists. Were they really in earnest? Did they really desire to have the great principle for which they have fought so long enacted ? My opinion is that, now the facts as to the working of the law in New South Wales and New Zealand are known, they will wait a very long time before they get a better or more liberal Bill than the one before the Senate. We now have a Government under the leadership of the right honorable member for East Sydney. Of course, we should have preferred to have a Government led by a member of our party. Our first duty, however, is not to ourselves, but to the country. It is said that the free-traders have used harsh terms towards some of us in the past. That statement is quite correct. Life is too short for one to remember the harsh things which are said in the heat of political struggles, and they are unworthy men who, because a politician had said hard things about them at one time, would refuse to support him when he was doing that which was right, no matter what position he held. The honorable members who chose to break away from the Protectionist Party called a meeting in some mysterious and extraordinary way - by the aid of " spooks," or something else, because no one was told to attend, and no circular was sent out. Those honorable members, who just happened to be there, I suppose, called a meeting, but they carefully refrained from notifying the other members of the party, although it had been agreed that all should stand together under their leader. </para>

He will have quite enough difficulty to explain his own position, which I think is a very humiliating one. Why was no notice of that meeting sent out? If there had been a full meeting of the party there would have been a majority of fourteen against a minority of nine, and the latter would not have been able to carry the resolutions which have been quoted today. They were very careful not to consult the leader and other members of the party, because they knew that the little game which .they were trying to work would not come off if they did. </para>

                        <para>- I do not blame honorable members for what they did, because they were simply following the first law of nature, which is self-preservation. I quite recognised how very difficult was the position of honorable members who resided in crowded cities, and I did not blame them for seeking to make their own positions secure. I do blame them, however, for running to the press at once, and charging honorable members in this House with being traitors1 and seceders- with having gone back on their principles. </para>

                        <para>- I shall tell the honorable member directly. These honorable members raised the cry, "Protection is in danger." It was, as the honorable member for Gippsland has said, a sudden discovery. The cry was raised when the Labour Government was thought to be in danger, and it was first raised at the Trades Hall. From private conversations with honorable members on the other side, I know that they - deprecated dlt cry when it was first raised. They said that they did not see any chance of getting better duties Tor their industries than they then had. If the cry_was a real one, it was laughable, but Hit was only a stalking-horse it was) contemptible, and that is what I think it was. They have held up the Prime Minister as a great bogy-man, who was going to destroy all the industries of Australia. If we have an unruly horse what do we do with him ? We couple him in with a horse upon which we can depend. When we have the Prime Minister coupled in between the honorable member for Gippsland and the right honorable member for Balaclava, there is not much fear of protection being in danger. As a matter of fact, the advantage of this coalition is all with the protectionists, because they are absolutely certain that any advantages which they have obtained will not be interfered with," at any rate for some years to come. </para>

                        <para>- In this discussion, and in this demand for higher duties, we seem to forget that Victoria is only one of six States, and that we cannot move faster than they will allow us to do. The pace of a team is regulated by the pace of the slowest horse in it. If the other States do not desire an. alteration of the Tariff - and so far there has been no such desire expressed by any other State- it will be very difficult for us to move by ourselves. Some honorable members who come here to represent Victoria seem to forget that they are Federalists. They appear to imagine that they are in a State Parliament, and can do whatever they think Victoria requires and demands: </para>

Because the leaders of the party and all its members knew that if we had gone to the country with a cry for higher duties, we should have been beaten. If we had raised that cry, we should have had in power to-day a freetrade Government, which could have torn up the Tariff, and framed one to their own liking. </para>

                <para>Mr.McCOLL. - After the protectionist debates' on the Tariff, and after commerce and business had been kept in a perfect state of turmoil for such a long time, people were heartily sick of Tariff discussions and alterations, and. if we had gone to the country on a policy of higher duties we should not have come back with a majority. Therefore, I say that the proposal for a fiscal peace was the wisest policy that could have been adopted at the time in the interests of protection. </para>

                        <para>- This was part of the price which Victoria had to pay for Federation in the same way that every other State had to give up something because of it. The present agitation, as I have said before, was first of all started by the Trades Hall. But when we were battling here for these duties, and trying to get 5 or 7½ per cent. more of protection on various items, did the Trades Hall give us any assistance? Not the least. We secured the duties which are in force now, simply because of the magnificent fighting done by the right honorable members for Adelaide and Balaclava. </para>

                        <para>- The duty agreed to on agricultural machinery is only 2½ per cent. less than it was under the Victorian Tariff. It was 15 per cent. in the Victorian Tariff, and it is 12½ per cent. now. The difference of <inline font-style="italic">2½</inline> per cent. could not make any very great difference to the manufacturers of agricultural machinery. If 12½ per cent. protection is of no use to them, then 15 per cent. must have been of very little good, and it should be remembered that before Federation no attempt was ever made in the State Parliament of Victoria to raise the duty above 15 per cent. </para>

If the Trades Hall Council desire protection, why do they not engage that gentleman to use his great powers of eloquence in preaching the doctrine of protection, not in this State, but in the other States. Why do not protectionists, instead of making speeches here about the virtues of protection, start a crusade in the other States, and try to convert the people of those States to the doctrine, as the present Prime Minister tried to convert the people of Victoria to free-trade?

The Tariff, as it finally emerged, was at least a protectionist one of its kind, and what it lost in effectiveness as the builder up of national industries, the Federation was compensated in giving a wider market to manufacturers. It was a great and arduous work, done conscientiously in the main ; and the business of the electors in the coming election will be to see that, for a course of at least three years, it is not interfered with. This cannot be too vigorously insisted upon. </para>

The other night the honorable and learned member interjected, " When did I promise to support fiscal peace?" If that is the attitude the honorable and learned member is taking, it is a mean attitude. It is the attitude of the soldier who is told to carry out a certain line of campaign, but who has another one in his pocket, which, when he is away from his leader, he intends to pursue on his own account. This very question was raised by the Prime Minister of the day in Tasmania. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of. December nth, 1903 - </para>

You are entitled to judge each side by its own policy. You must look to the leader of a side, and take its pronouncement as his pronouncement alone ; to that which he pledges himself he pledges his party. In this Tariff issue the Opposition leader pledges his party to fiscal war - to re-open the fiscal Tariff, to tear up the present Tariff, to strike off all protection what ever, and reintroduce commercial anxiety and unrest. That is the policy of the Opposition, and of . those who say they will support it. Every elector who objects to it must vote for the Ministerial candidate. </para>

This is the honorable member who is going now to get people higher duties, in order to protect their manufactures. He is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 13th November last year, to have said - </para>

                    <para>He would not, in any circumstances, be a party to disturbing the fiscal peace now reached. The Labour Party had been able to knock out a few of the taxes which pressed heavily on the people, and in this way had reduced the revenue by a large amount. The proof of the prudence of their cutting down the Tariff as proposed was found in the fact that, on examination, the Tariff, as adopted, would now appear t«» average about 15 per cent, all round. As it stood, it was a reasonable Tariff, and should be allowed to stand undisturbed. </para>

                <para class="block">He took credit to the Labour Party for having reduced duties, and for the fact that, although the duty on tobacco and spirits was 200 or 300 per cent., the average rate throughout the Tariff was only 15 per cent. Will the honorable member now eat his words, and vote for duties high enough to satisfy those who desire the re-opening of the Tariff? Even the right honorable member for Adelaide, when he went to Geelong to support the candidature of the honorable and learned member for Corio, said that the Tariff should not be re-opened during the book-keeping period for any reason whatever. Hd said that it had been a hard battle, and I am afraid that we shall not have a champion like him again. God help protection if those who are now trying to increase duties have to fight its battles. It is to the Labour Party that we owe the loss of many duties. I admit that several of them voted with the protectionists, and that without their assistance we could not have carried some of the duties in the Tariff. We did not expect the freetraders to vote with us, but we looked to those who claim to represent labour of every kind to help us in saving industries which had been established under protection, in order to prevent the men employed in them from being turned out into the streets, and their wives and children from being brought to want. It was a great disappointment when members of the Labour Party turned against us. The industries which are now crying out are chiefly the1 agricultural implement manufacturers, the makers of mining machinery, and those connected with the glassware, furniture, and brushmaking trades. But amongst those who voted against a higher duty on agricultural implements were the honorable members for Wide Bay, Perth, Maranoa, Kennedy, Barrier, and Coolgardie, and the honorable and learned member for West Sydney. </para>

I know that we shall get a Tariff Commission from the present Government. Australia has adopted the policy of protection, and if it can be shown that any industry is languishing for want of an extra duty of 5, 7½, or even 10 per cent., I believe that even the free-traders will be prepared to listen to fair representations on the subject, and will at least give as much as we should get from honorable members opposite. </para>

                        <para>- I shall have something to say about the honorable and learned member by-and-by. When the Prime Minister was Premier of New South Wales, and altered the Tariff there, it was urged that certain industries would be ruined if he took off all the duties, and therefore he consented to give them a certain amount of protection. To show that he is not so bad as he has been painted, let me quote the following passage from a speech delivered by him in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales in 1892, or, 1893: - </para>

                    <para>It would now be impossible to carry out a freetrade policy in Victoria. The vested interests were so great, and the number of human beings dependent upon them were so numerous, that any man with humane feelings would have the greatest difficulty in altering the system. </para>

                <para class="block">I believe that if on inquiry it is shown that a reduction of duties would prove disastrous to any industry, or that a moderate increase of duties would have the. reverse effect, we shall get as much from the right honorable gentleman as from the honorable member for Bland, who boasted to his constituents that the Labour Party had reduced the Tariff to an all-round rate of 15 per cent. The Tariff will be saved by a period of fiscal peace, and not by re-opening it at the present time. Those who live in the metropolis, and come always into contact with the same people, hear only one side of the case. I have travelled throughout the country, and I know that the feeling generally is that the Tariff should not be re-opened. I am convinced that if we appeal to the country now for increased duties, we shall not have a chance of getting them. We must give time for the operation of the Tariff to be seen. What we in Victoria consider low duties are considered high duties in New South Wales, and while here we have a clamour for an increase in the duties, the protectionists in New South Wales are asking for fiscal peace, and are supporting the coalition. They say, "Let time develop things. Let us get our factories started, our money invested, and our men employed, and, when vested interests have been created, make an effort to secure higher duties, if necessary. To act now is to act prematurely, and will jeopardize what we have gained." As was anticipated by the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the loss of trade in some directions, owing to the operation of the Tariff has been compensated by the increase of our trade with the other States. The imports into Victoria from the other States of Australian goods - produce and manufactures of all descriptions - were valued at £7,380,000 in 1890, and tell to £5&gt;737&gt;000 in *9°°&gt; t0 £5,591,000 in 190.1, and to £4,766,000 in 1902, while last year they were £4,839,000, or nearly £3,000,000 less than four years previously. Our exports to the other States in 1899 were £3,097,000; in 1900, £3,433&gt;00°i 111(1 in 1901, £3,649,000.; while in 1902, after the Tariff came into operation, they jumped up to £6,120,000; and last year amounted to £6,093,000, or just double what they were four years previously. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing now only with Victoria, and I am showing that the demand for a re-opening of the Tariff is somewhat unreasonable at the present time. The other States are in the same position in regard to protection as Victoria was in twenty or twenty-five years ago. Protection had to develop here, and it must be allowed to develop there ; but its leaven will work from month to month, as industries are started, and. by-and-by we shall obtain more reasonable duties if we do not interfere with the- Tariff at the present time. I do not know what protectionists will gain from this alliance with the Labour Party. The Minister of Trade and Customs plainly stated the case the other night, and I need not amplify his remarks. Every man is perfectly free under the alliance, and it is not likely that men like the honorable member for Maranoa, and the honorable member for Kennedy, will turn their backs upon their pledges, and upon the votes they have given in the past. What will the members of the alliance gain personally? Some of them joined it from an instinct of self-preservation ; but they will very soon find the ground cut from under their feet. Some of the strong members of the seceding Liberal Party, like the honorable member for Indi, who considers that he is impregnable, may be left untouched. But wherever the Labour Party can gain a seat it will be seized upon, and the honorable member who now represents that constituency will be torn down as if by- wolves. </para>

In order to indicate the. amount of reliance that is to be placed upon labour 'alliances, I desire to direct attention to what is now passing in Queensland. I may say that if I were to take up; the same position as that adopted by honorable members who have allied themselves with the Labour Party, I should sign the pledge straight away, and become a good honest labour man. I should not be a Laodicean, neither hot nor cold. We do not, however, find honorable members signing, the pledge, because if they did, they would lose caste in the circles in which they move. They are content to make use of the Labour Party for their own ends, but they will never join it, because they conceive it would involve a loss of prestige. </para>

I think, at this late hour, it is our duty to frankly acknowledge the justice of their claim to recognition, and, in this connexion, I would direct the attention of the Ministry to the thousands of cattle and sheep now passing over the border, in anticipation of the imposition of an increased stock tax. </para>

Is his harrow free? Is his chaff cutter free? Is the very twine with which he ties up his produce free? Certainly not. This shows that the farmer has much to gain, and that there is much that he ought to gain, before he is placed on a level with his more fortunate brother in the town. And the miner, how is he on a level with the worker in the town ? He has a weight around his neck. We are told that the miners patriotically stood by protection in the past.

                        <para>-Returning to events in Queensland, I wish to show honorable members how the Labour Party treat their allies. At the recent election in that State, the Labour Party agreed to contest the seats, together with the members of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morgan's</inline> party. They entered into an alliance somewhat similar to that which has been brought : about in this House. The result of the elections was that some 35 labour men and 21 of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morgan's</inline> followers were elected. After the election one honorable member died, and the candidate who had been third on the poll again offered himself for the seat. His candidature was not indorsed by the Government, who put forward the brother of the honorable member for Darling Downs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Groom, and indorsed his candidature. One would have thought that under the alliance with the Labour Party, the leader of the Government would have had the right to select his own nominee. But the Labour Party said at once, "You have no right to indorse <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom's</inline> nomination without consulting us, and we object to what you have done." They are now running a man of their own against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom.</inline></para>

I am only telling my friends of the alliance what they may anticipate if the same tactics are pursued in connexion with the Commonwealth elections. The <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> in its last issue - I think it is the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> - says that under the alliance the Labour Party have a right to run their own man for the seat in question, and that if they can gain two or three more seats, they will have an absolute majority in the House, and will be able to shift the Government and take office themselves. I am not blaming them, but I am pointing out the kind of treatment which our friends of the alliance may expect to receive. </para>

                        <para>- The members of the alliance have transferred their allegiance from the honorable and learned member for Ballarat to the honorable and learned member for Indi without the slightest justification. ' As has been stated by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, there was no reason why they should not have continued to sit under their old leader, and have exercised absolute control upon this side of the House. As a matter df fact, the members under the leadership of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat exercise a controlling influence now, because the free-traders have given way to a 'far greater extent than we have. Whilst those honorable members who have entered into an alliance with the Labour Party had a perfect right to do as they liked, there was no reason why they should rush at once into an attack upon members who chose to take their seats on this side of the Chamber. Instead of acknowledging that there might have been a legitimate difference of opinion, they took the first opportunity to blackguard honorable members on this side, to characterize them as traitors, and to charge them with having surrendered their principles, and having cast protection to the winds. Then the honorable and learned member for Indi said, " However, the door is open if you choose to return." I, for one, do not intend to return, because I would sooner leave parliamentary life altogether than follow the honorable and learned member. I was a Ministerial colleague of his some years ago. </para>

                <para>Parliament and retain my self-respect. There was no need for honorable members opposite to give interviews to the press, and to make charges against us. That was not the way in which they could expect to obtain our assistance. They said that the party could not tolerate any such conduct. What do we care for the party? We are responsible to our constituents. I have been a parliamentary representative for my district for twenty years, and have never suffered a defeat ; and it- is to my constituents, and not to any association in town, or any newspaper that I am responsible. I desire to enter my strongest protest in a matter, which, however, may not quite concern the question we are now discussing. I was sorry to see that last. Sunday evening the ex-Prime Minister attended a party political meeting. I do not profess to be a strict Sabbatarian, but I am old-fashioned enough to trust that in this country an endeavour will be made to keep the Sunday free from business of the kind. There is a disposition growing up every week to more and more use Sunday for the discussion of political and other secular matters. </para>

                        <para>- I am one who believes in respecting the Sabbath day ; and this is the place in which to denounce such conduct. Never in the history of Victoria have I known a Member of Parliament to hold a party political meeting on the Sabbath. Time and again efforts have been made to commence Sunday newspapers in Victoria ; but such enterprises have never been permitted by the State Government. Those who will suffer in the long run from the introduction of secular business on the Sabbath, will be the working classes. In Bendigo the miners have a rule that no man shall work on the Sabbath, unless it be absolutely necessary. If once public meetings become <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> rule on Sundays, candidates will be asked to deliver addresses, and we shall arrive at a perfect Parisian Sunday, such as I hope we shall never see. </para>

                        <para>- The Government are not here for an eternity. One of the greatest drawbacks to the success of Federation has been the unfederal spirit shown between New South Wales and Victoria. That spirit we all deplore; and I believe that the continuance in office of this Government for a time will have a good effect in mollifying, and perhaps removing, that feeling. To bring about a proper understanding between those two great States, which represent the great majority of the people of Australia, I would give up a good deal. Now that we have the chance to get those States into line we may settle the question of differential rates, and also the question of the utilization of the Murray waters. If we can only get those two States to act in harmony we shall place Federation on a stronger and firmer basis than we can otherwise expect. </para>

                        <para>- The small States are protected in the Senate. Is it wise at the present time to force on this motion, which will probably result in a dissolution? As the honorable member for Maranoa said the other night, frankly and honestly, if there were a secret ballot taken there would be no dissolution. I should not care if a dissolution would settle matters, and return a majority on either side. I should not mind which. I have no objection to a Labour Government, who, I am sure, would not act unwisely. If the Labour Party have a majority, let them take office, but I am afraid that a dissolution will only mean that, after an appeal to the country, we shall come back practically as we are at the present time, and shall go drifting in the same fashion, with no good result to Australia. There is another matter we ought to consider. The last election took place in the middle of the harvest, and if there be a dissolution, that experience will be repeated. It is not just to country constituents, who are engaged on the soil, that they should be compelled to leave their work when every moment is precious. This may not matter to honorable members who know nothing of country needs or the precariousness of the returns from the soil; but it is not fair to country people to force a dissolution at this juncture. I was surprised at honorable members representing country districts - such as the honorable and learned member for Corio, and the honorable and learned member for Indi - pursuing a course which they know must be detrimental to the great majority of their constituents. I hope that the motion will not be carried, but that we shall dispose of the remaining business, and get into recess. That would be good for all parties, and for the country generally. We could then meet and sit for six or seven months, and, with a determination to get out of the slough, bend all our energies to business, and in an endeavour to realize the aspirations of four or five years ago, make the Commonwealth what it ought to be. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say one or two words by way of personal explanation. I must apologize to the House if it is thought for a moment that anything I say may give the honorable member for Echuca more prominence than he otherwise would have. But the honorable member referred to two matters. One was the action I took publicly some years ago. I can only say that I happened - it was an accident, I suppose - to be a colleague of the honorable member in a certain Government. I found it my duty to take a certain course, and to put the ordinary law in motion in a very influential direction. The honorable member resisted that action. In the end I had to sever my connexion with the Government. I placed myself in the hands of my constituents, and was returned unopposed, and at the first available opportunity the honorable member and his colleagues were swept out of office. Immediately after that I had the honour to receive a portfolio in the next Government, formed by the present right honorable member for Balaclava; and I held office then for some years. On another occasion I took part in a general election, which* swept the honorable member for Echuca and his colleagues once more from office, and I again joined a Government, headed by the present right honorable member for Balaclava, retaining my position until I resigned to come to this Parliament. The best credential I can have is the double indorsement of the people of Victoria. I am not afraid to pit my public character against that of the honorable member. Then the honorable member has taken on himself to represent </para>

The Victorian Parliament was then discussing the Budget of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Graham</inline> Berry, and the opinion I expressed in the speech was that a prohibitive Tariff was being introduced. I took care time after time in that speech to point out that it was not a battle between protection and free-trade, but that, in my opinion, it was' an advance to prohibition. I did not say that once or twice, but several times, and the honorable member must have seen the report. On page 2071, I said - </para>

                    <para>We are marching steadily on to absolute prohibition. Therefore, I think it is a question, not of free-trade or protection, because no one has attempted to storm the fortress in this citadel of protection in the southern hemisphere. No one has approached the question from that point of view, but it has been raised by those who wish to advance to prohibition; and, looking at the question fairly and squarely in the face, it is not a question in which free-trade is involved at all. </para>

                <para>Can it be denied that" when we have prohibition we create a monopoly? I object to the foreign trader having a monopoly here. One of the chief reasons for introducing protection was that it would prevent such a monopoly ; that it would protect the people of this country against the foreign trader, who can ask what price he likes. But if we shut out the foreign trader absolutely, do we not create a monopoly at home ? Are we to oppress the great bulk of the people, the great body of consumers in the country- the farmers, and the miners, and the general population - by placing on their necks a monopoly ? There is not the slightest doubt that prohibition is another way of spelling monopoly. </para>

We are told that the Minister of Trade and Customs is the equal in all things with the Prime Minister, but looking at the former, and also at the right honorable member for Balaclava, and others who have been associated with the Protectionist movement, we may see that they are not very comfortable.

I shall support this motion, because I do not think that the Administration is calculated to advance the interests of the Commonwealth. I support the motion, not because I differ with the Prime Minister or those who are associated with him, but because I have seen in their acts of administration a tendency which I think will be inimical to the best interests of the Commonwealth. What did I notice in the press the other day with regard to the Minister of Trade and Customs? For twenty years we have been fighting for a White Australia. No part of the Commonwealth has fought harder for the policy than has Queensland. But when a deputation waited upon the . Minister of Trade and Customs about the Chinamen, he said, "Send them to Queensland; but of course you will have to ask the permission of Queensland." </para>

                        <para>- It is true that I told the Minister that I was going to mention this matter. Although he told the deputation that the consent of the Queensland Government would have to be obtained, still it could be seen that his leaning was to get rid of the Chinamen in Little Bourke- street and Adelaide by sending them up to Queensland. Now, that State will not receive any Chinamen. We intend to have a White Australia. That is one reason why I think that the Administration doe's not possess the confidence of the House and of the Commonwealth. If there is one idea which is permeating the minds of Australians to-day, it is that we should have a White Australia. In the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, apart from what I have said, there is I think very great danger. When the subject was being considered here, I sat on the other side of the House. I did not go as far as some of my honorable friends on this side would have liked me to go. They wished to draw the colour line, but that, I thought, was going a little too far. I voted for the application of an educational test, and the exclusion of those who might come here under the contract system. But what do we find now ? We find that all sorts of loopholes are being made, so that black, yellow, brown, tan, or any other colour can enter if they come in with a passport. Who is going to sign the document, or who knows anything about it? Those who have lived in Queensland, and seen Japanese, instead of nurse girls, wheeling perambulators through the streets, as I have in Townsville, will know what this change means. From time to time in Little Bourke-street a Chinese riot takes place, and the desire is to shunt them into Queensland. We do not want them there at all. We have Chinese quarters, Japanese quarters, Hindoo quarters, and kanaka quarters. We know what the evil is, and we want a White Australia." That is one reason why I think that the administration of the Act should not be allowed to remain any longer in the hands of this Government than can possibly be helped. I was elected as a follower of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and I was proud to follow him. It has' been said in this debate that the Labour Party was anxious for office. What are the facts of the case? When the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was defeated on a test question, which, I think, ought not to have been selected, what did he advise the Governor-General to do? Did he advise His Excellency to dissolve the House ? No. Did he advise His Excellency to send for the right honorable member for East Sydney? No. He advised Hi's Excellency to send for the honorable member for Bland, and his advice was accepted. Does that look as if the Labour </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Party was seeking to jump into power? Office was forced upon the Labour Party. When the honorable member for Bland was called upon to form an Administration, would he not have been recreant to his policy and his profession had he not accepted the commission? What sort of fair play did he receive here? On the other side of the House we see free-traders and protectionists combined - for what purpose? - not to forward the fiscal issue, not to develop the- industries of the Commonwealth, but simply to " down " the Labour Party. The result of this combination is to drive men into the arms of the Labour Party. It has had that effect upon me. The Government are not deserving of our confidence, because they are leaving what, I think, is a most important question in the hands of a private member. What do they intend to do with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill? Do they propose to do anything? The Minister for Trade and Customs is, I know, in sympathy with the development of Australian industries, but he is in ba'd company now. The honorable member for Hume, or another private member, is to be allowed to take charge of this measure; and the Government shelter themselves behind the fact that the question of State ownership was referred to the States Governments some time ago. The States Governments of six, or eight, or twelve months ago are not the States Governments of to-day. In nearly all the States there has been a big change. In New South Wales there has been a change. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but still there has been a change.. In Queensland we have had a change for the better, and I am not sure now whether, if an inquiry were addressed to the Government, the Premier would not say, "Yes, we shall take the matter in hand." In that Slate there is plenty of ore, flux, and coal ; it contains all the requisites for carrying on the iron industry. In Tasmania and Western Australia there has also been a change of Government. Let the question be again referred to the States Governments of to-day, and let us ascertain what they think. If they do not wish to take up the industry, let it be carried on by private enterprise ; but let us have the industry established at any cost. If the States will not take it up, let us give the bonus to private persons. It is too big a thing to allow to go without some .effort. :Much as I should like to see the industry nationalized or municipalized, I desire first to see it established, whether under private enterprise or State control. With regard to the Agent-General, I should like to say that I think there has been a good deal ot sense in what has been said about the present Government pandering rather too much to the States Governments. I had thought that this being the Australian Parliament, instead of our having to go to the States, the States would come to us- When in common with many honorable members of this House, and many perhaps more able men who are not members of the House, 1 advocated the Federation of the Australian States, I told the people that it would mean the abolition of the Agents-General of the whole of the States, and that there would be one Australian representative for the whole Commonwealth. Why has not this proposal been carried out ? The present Government say, " We must ask the State* first." <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Horace</inline> Tozer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taverner,</inline> and others must be asked before we can appoint our Agent-General, or General Agent, which is the name by which I would prefer to call the officer. I think there has been too much of the frills of ambassadorship, the wearing of the cut-away at evening entertainments, rather than looking after the disposal of Australian produce in the European markets. What we require instead of the Agents-General, is one General Agent, who will really represent Australia in London, and who will seek to place Australian products not only on British markets, but on the markets of Europe. We require a really good commercial agent, and such a man and his staff could be secured for about one-third of ' what ' the States are now paying for their six Agents-General. What are" those officials doing ? They are merely attending Mansion House banquets, and banquets at the Hotel Cecil. What we want is a General Agent who will place himself in communication with the authorities of the principal cities of Europe, and let them know what products Australia has to sell them. The sooner we get a Commonwealth High Commissioner or Agent and abolish the present States' Agents-General, the better it will be for Australia. We can get from America an illustration of what mav be done in this direction. If honorable members go into any of the leading capitals in Australia, they will find sample's of the leading products of the United States. In Philadelphia they have an institution which they call the Philadelphia Commercial Museum. I am in communication with it regularly, and any one visiting the institution will be able to see the hats worn in Albury, at Bourke, and at Camooweal, on the western border of Queensland, and a statement of the prices paid there for them, what they -can be made for, and where they are sent.- Why cannot Australia establish something of that kind ? While we have! a foreign trade Ministry, as we have now - and in spite of the fact that we have professed protectionists in the persons of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister of Defence, it cannot be denied that we have a Free-trade Government, who will give preference to the produce of other countries rather than our own - we cannot hope to develop the industries of our own country. I wish to say a word or two to my free-trade friends of the Labour Party. There is one thing I never could understand. We are going for a White Australia. We say that we are going for such conditions of labour that white men will be able1 to live in the Commonwealth in a civilized way; that they will be able to work eight hours a day, and will get eight shillings a day. </para>

                        <para>- I know that when I announced myself as a candidate at the last election, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was very anxious that I should pledge myself for fiscal peace. I said that I would not agree to it, and did no believe in it. When my constituents asked me to support the Deakin Government, I said, " I cannot support them. If I could, I should not be here." I considered that the Deakin Government was inconsistent in preaching at the same time fiscal peace and preferential trade. I could not possibly see how the two things could work together. </para>

                        <para>- I do. I know very well that we shall have shortly to go before our constituents. I do not see anything else for it. In my simplicity, when I came from my electorate. I thought I knew the position of affairs at the time. The Labour Party was simply dominating the Deakin Government, and I told my constituents that I should endeavour to divide the House into two distinct parties. I said that if the Labour Party was strong enough, it should rule, and it it was not, I should endeavour to form a coalition that would carry on responsible government in this country. I quite agreed with the honorable and learned member for Ballarat that it was impossible to carry on government under three heads. My aim since I came into the House has been to carry out the resolution I formed, and I was very pleased to find that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat adopted the same view, and made up his mind that the existing condition of affairs could not possibly last. I was delighted to see the honorable and learned gentleman making the stand that he did in opposition to the inclusion of State public servants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable and learned member for Ballarat took the right course, in staking the life of his Ministry on that particular question, because he considered that, to include States public servants in the Bill, would be to interfere with States rights, and that we had no right to deal with such a question at all. I believe that the Labour Party exhibited great indiscretion in turning out the Deakin Ministry. Our honorable friends opposite talk about protection, and suggest that the present Tariff is ruining the industries of the country. If they think that, why did they not assist to keep the Deakin Government in power? </para>

                        <para>- What has protection done for the farmer? The honorable and learned member for Indi has explained that the farmers have gained nothing at all by protection. They have to depend upon the home market for the sale of their produce - butter, wool, wine, and everything else. No amount of protection can help the farmers by increasing the price of their productions. </para>

                        <para>- I am a protectionist, so far as it may be possible to raise the price of farm produce by preferential trade, or in other ways ; but I shall not stand by and allow taxes to be imposed on farming implements and tools, and on all the articles used by the farmers, merely for the benefit of those who live in the cities, which' is what is now proposed. Our friends who have joined the alliance wish to re-open the Tariff, and one of the duties which they wish to increase is that on agricultural' machinery. To increase that duty would not assist the farmers. We have heard a great deal of talk about putting men on the land. I wish that some of those who are so fond of using the phrase, had to make their living off the land. They would then know, as I know, with what difficulties and troubles the farmers have to contend. The only way in which Parliament can help the farmers is by enabling them to raise and transport their produce as cheaply as possible to the Home markets. To speak of helping them by imposing a land tax, or by increasing the duties on agricultural machinery, is absurd. Those proposals are made only for the benefit of the artisans in the towns. I am afraid that when I go before my electors - which will not be very long, I suppose. - I shall have a poor account to give to them of what this Parliament has done. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing to mention. We have heard a great deal about raising the masses, and I am one of those who have been put down as an anti-Socialist. But we all have our own ideas about Socialism, and I think that my Socialism will advance the interests of the people of the Commonwealth much more than that of the honorable members opposite would do. I have been sorry to sit here night after night listening to the recriminations of former members of the New South Wales Parliament. We had to-night a little of that sort of thing on the part of former members of the Victorian Parliament; but I am pleased to say that it does not often occur amongst them. It is not the fault of the Prime Minister that what I deplore happens so often. The honorable member for Hume is very much to blame for it. While the charges made by the ex-Minister of External Affairs against the Prime Minister, which were utterly false and untrue- </para>

                        <para>- Then I will say that they were incorrect, and their incorrectness was proved to the satisfaction of the House. We are not doing our duty to our constituents in allowing such conduct in this Assembly. It was most undignified and unfair for the honorable and learned member for West Sydney to act as he did. He endeavoured to put upon the Prime Minister acts for which he himself was responsible, in order to lower him in the eyes of the community. I wish now to say a few words to show why I cannot support the Socialist or Labour Party. It is impossible for any member representing a country constituency to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that those districts are pleased with the representation which they have obtained. If I supported the legislation which the Labour Party have proposed, and are proposing, I could not hope for the support of my constituents. I told my electors that I was opposed to such legislation as the provision of the Post and Telegraph Act which prohibits the employment of lascars on mail steamers, the result of which has been that, up to the present time, our English mail contracts have not been renewed. It may be asked, how does that affect the farmers ? Every one knows that the farmers depend largely on the mail steamers for the conveyance of perishable produce to the old country ; but the Labour Party, out of mere sentiment - because the lascars do not interfere in any way with the state of the labour market here, and their removal from the mail steamers would not benefit a single working man in the Commonwealth - supported legislation which seriously interferes with the shipping companies which have developed the carrying trade for perishable produce to the old country. The way to assist the farmers is to provide for the carriage of their produce to the Home markets at as cheap rates as possible. Another reason why I cannot support the Labour Party is that they propose to bring all farm servants under the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Speaking as a farmer, and knowing what I am talking about, I say that if that proposal were carried into effect the dairy farmers and others in the country who now employ labour would be unable to continue to make a living, and the country would be used merely for grazing. </para>

                        <para>- The men had had their wages raised over and over again, but the directors had to make a stand when the miners asked for higher wages than they could afford to pay, and consequently shut them out, so that the strike was an. utter failure. Similarly the farmers cannot pay higher wages than the profits of their industry will allow. If honorable members can show me that the price of farm produce can be raised sufficiently to allow us to give our employes eight hours a day, and to pay double wages, I shall be very glad. The honorable member for Bourke has had a great deal to say about the emigration of young farmers from the country. That has happened because the remuneration to be obtained from farming pursuits is not sufficient to induce them to stay in the country. </para>

                        <para>- No; there is plenty of land available everywhere; but the State, by fixing minimum rates of wage for employments in the city, is responsible for the drifting of many young men from the country to Melbourne. Young fellows will not work for ten or twelve hours a day on a farm for £1 a week and their keep it they can get 7 s. or 8s. a day in Melbourne. I would not do it myself. </para>

                        <para>- No; but they are higher than the farmers can afford to pay. At the same time, I am sure that those in the employ of the farmers are better off than those who are engaged in city industries. I have passed scores of men through my employment who have saved money out of £1 a week and their keep, and, having made a fair start, are now doing well. It must be remembered that the farmer has to compete in outside markets against the competition of the world, and it is the prices reigning in those markets which govern his operations. When I was before my constituents, I advocated preferential trade, but the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> ingored that fact altogether, and classed me as a rabid free-trader and a crusted conservative. I was never a conservative in my life, and the fact that honorable members seem to regard me in that light shows that they are guided by the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The members of the Labour Party are the greatest conservatives here, because they think of nothing else but the interests of the few people who have joined the trade unions, and would legislate on their behalf to the detriment of every other class of the community. I do not wish to say anything against the Labour Party, because I admire them. I think, however, that their short tenure of office has altogether spoiled them. When I came into this House I had not the slightest idea that the Labour Party would ever obtain possession of the Treasury bench, and I would commend to them the advice of the honorable member for Perth, that they should stick to their own platform, and keep clear of all alliances with liberals, or other classes of politicians, by whatever name they may call themselves. I believe that at the next election, the Labour Party will come back stronger than they are at present, and I hope they will gain their accession of numbers at (he expense of the liberal members of the alliance. </para>

                        <para>- So I am. I am independent to vote as my conscience may dictate. I announced at the time of my election that I should vote against the Deakin Government, but it happened that the very first time I was called upon to vote in this House, I supported the Deakin Government upon the question of excluding public servants from the scope of the Conciliation, and Arbitration Bill. Therefore, I showed that I was perfectly free to cast an independent vote. It is nauseating to listen to the taunts of honorable members opposite that the protectionists who are supporting the Government have sunk their policy. That is simply nonsense. We know perfectly well that the arrangement entered into will be faithfully kept by both sides, and that no attempt will be made by either to gain a point over the other. The coalition was brought about in order to extricate us from a difficulty, and to relieve us from the condition of muddle into which we had drifted. The scheme would have worked out successfully if the whole of the members of the Protectionist Party had remained true to their leader. Then there would have been no difficulty whatever, and we should not have had an election staring us in the face. We cannot go before our constituents at the present time with any great satisfaction, because our record of work is a miserable one. Moreover, we shall be putting the country to no end of expense, and shall be retarding business, which should be pushed forward for the benefit of the Commonwealth. If the whole of the protectionists had stood firm to their leader, and had allowed the business of the country to be proceeded with, there is no doubt that legislation would have been passed which would have done credit to the Commonwealth, and conferred benefit upon the whole community. It is rather amusing to hear honorable members sitting in the Government corner called 'conservatives. We are told by honorable members opposite that we never vote for anything that is calculated to advance the best interests of the community. I may tell them that if I had my way I would advance the interests of the working man to a far greater extent than would the members of the Labour Party. Do honorable members opposite suppose for a moment that they will assist the working classes by taking £8,000,000 out of the banks ? They should know perfectly well that capita) and labour must work together amicably if we are to make any substantial advancement in the Commonwealth. Progress is impossible if the hand of labour is to be always on the throat of capital. The more capital we can attract here the more labour will be employed, and the sooner honorable members opposite realize that fact the better. Some people imagine that they have nothing to do but to attend their union meetings and pass resolutions asking for eight hours a day and higher pay. They do not consider where the money is to come from, or whether the industry that will be affected can stand the extra strain which they propose to impose upon it. In Western Australia recently Tom Mann proposed that the working day should be reduced to six hours, because there was not enough work for every one whilst those who were in employment worked eight hours a day. I do not suppose that he intended to reduce the rates of pay accordingly. </para>

                        <para>- I do not claim to be a liberal of the same stamp as honorable members who sit in the .Opposition corner. Their liberality seems to commence and end with their endeavours to secure seats upon the Treasury bench. If they had the 8 o welfare of the Commonwealth at heart, they would stick to their own leader. We should then have stable responsible government. I hope that when those honorable members go to their constituents, they will be classed as Socialists. The issue at the next election will be between Socialism and anti-Socialism, and I have very little doubt that those honorable members who have deserted their leader will be relegated to their proper place. </para>

                    <para>- It is said that a discussion in Parliament very rarely leads to a change of opinion, but I am prepared to admit that this discussion has tended to change my ideas upon one matter, although not upon the main issue. I have in the past been opposed to any standing order that would have the effect of limiting the duration of speeches in Parliament, but after having listened to many of the speeches that have been delivered during this debate, I would readily support any rule that would have the effect of limiting the time which any one honorable member would be permitted to occupy in addressing the House. For a number of years I was associated with the Labour Party of New South Wales, and attended the caucus regularly. Some five or six years ago I took part in a caucus meeting, and gave my vote somewhat reluctantly - although it seemed to me that I was acting in the best interests of the country - because I knew that its probable effect would be to hurl from office the right honorable gentleman who now occupies the position of Prime Minister. </para>

The reason why I support the vote of censure is that I have absolutely lost political confidence in the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- In this particular case I shall vote with extreme pleasure, for the reason that I have stated. It has been said by some one that words were given to' us to conceal our thoughts, and I think that phrase might be appropriately applied to the case of the Prime Minister. For many years he has been thundering on the. platforms, and telling people that free-trade was a great thing for the country. He said so with such frequency, that he almost induced me to believe in the truth of his statements. Again and again he has told us that he was in favour of freetrade, and, not only so, but that protection, as embodied in the present Tariff, was a burden and oppression on the people. Yet we find him sitting on the Treasury bench, side by side with protectionist colleagues, after having entered upon a truce, and agreed that for a certain time the protectionist burden should be permitted to rest upon the shoulders of the people. </para>

But if this Parliament lives out its term, the Prime Minister must abandon that idea for at least two years. There are two reasons - though there may be more - which may actuate the Prime Minister in abandoning free-trade. One reason may be simply gluttony for office, and another may be that he believes the Labour Party, which is supposed to be, and is, so far as I know, the Socialist Party- </para>

                        <para>- As I was saying, the other reason which actuates the Prime Minister may be that he regards the Labour Party and Socialism as politically the curse of. the country, and that, however bad protection may be, he honestly believes our policy to be worse. Under such circumstances, the right honorable gentleman would be quite right in sitting on the Treasury benches associated with protectionists. But I ask whether he is sincere when he denounces the Labour Party, with its caucus and organization. For five years the right honorable gentleman, as Premier of New South Wales, was associated with the Labour Party. For the first four years it might have been possible, though difficult, for him to carry on the business of the Government without the assistance of that:party, but for the last twelve months of that period it would have been impossible for him to do without their support. During all that time the right honorable gentleman never said a single word against the Labour Party or its methods. If he had fought the Labour Party then, in his determination to be Premier, I could have admired him. To-day, thinking that the Labour Party, with its caucus and Socialism, might stand in his way to the Treasury bench, the right honorable gentleman denounces us. The Labour Party in a State is much more powerful for Socialism than the Labour Party in the Commonwealth. Personally, the members of the  federal Labour Party may be, and, I believe they are, socialistic; but, unfortunately, we are " cribbed, cabined, and confined " in our policy by the terms of the Constitution. In a State, on the other hand, there is much more room for socialistic effort. In 1894, in New South Wales, there was, as the honorable member for Parramatta has pointed out, a split in the Labour Party, just as there may be a difference between the Conservative-Protectionists and the Liberal-Protectionists. The dispute was at the time, called, I believe, a difference between the " solids " and the " liquids " in the Labour Party. </para>

                    <para>I want to say this. There are some constituencies in this country which are called labour constituencies; where labour predominates, and labour elects its men. In such cases - and you will find a good many - where the labour man has stood loyally to the Government - mind you, they knew what it meant; they knew that in sticking to us it meant a dissolution soon. If they had given in to the blandishments, and they were many, of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, and gone against us, the position of this Government to-day would not be so strong as it is. It is only common fairness and justice to make this announcement to the country, and I say that, in labour electorates, where there is a protectionist against a labour man who stood loyally to us, let the free-traders of those electorates show their recognition of his loyalty by voting for the labour candidate. </para>

If any other honorable member holds different opinions it is for him to express them when he has an opportunity to speak, and not to force other views on. the honorable member addressing the Chair I hope honorable members will refrain from interjections, which seem to have no other purpose than to force on the honorable member addressing the House, views which he does not wish to adopt. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. The four men who were nominated were Messrs. Buzacott, Hephir, Estell, and Wilson, and they were the first members of the labour political machine nominated to the Legislative Council. I am not blaming the right honorable gentleman but merely pointing out that although he now denounces our methods, he was prepared to strengthen our organization when to do so meant the Premiership of New South Wales. I go further and say that it was no coincidence that these four men happened to be members of the labour political machine, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> took rood care to find out that that was the fact. </para>

                        <para>- If the right honorable member for East Sydney really believed that we were so dangerous as he said, why did he try to strengthen our hands in the State Parliament? He says to-day that men ought not to be members' of a caucus. But will any representative of New South Wales deny that if we had told the right honorable gentleman after the election of 1898. that two members of the caucus must be in the Cabinet within twenty-four hours of that announcement, two members from the steerage would not have been sitting at the same mahogany with the right honorable gentleman, even though it would have meant that he would have to take a sulphur bath after coming into such close contact with the great unwashed ? The Prime Minister is reported to have said in Melbourne quite lately that although the Labour Party in New South Wales had him in the hollow of their hand for five years, yet they got practically nothing out of him. and the result was that he got the protectionist members of the caucus to support him. and give him free-trade. He also said that we got more out of the honorable member for Hume in two years than we could have got from him in 200years. </para>

                        <para>-I do not Question my honorable friend's word but I think that he may be mistaken in this matter. Now. what was given to the Labour Party by the honorable member for Hume? An Old-age Pensions Act, an Arbitration Act, an Adult Suffrage Act, an Early Closing Act. a Navigation Act, and a Miners' Relief Act. Am I to support a Prime Minister who practically says that in 200 years he would not have given us those measures? Am I to be blamed for not supporting a Prime Minister who said publicly in Melbourne that he would have to be in office 200 years before he would give us what the honorable member for Hume gave us in New South Wales in two years ? </para>

I may be fooled by a man once, and it may be my fault. If I am fooled by the same man a second time, that is my look out, and I am a fool. I have lost confidence in the Prime Minister, and by no vote of mine shall he be given an opportunity of fooling us again. </para>

                        <para>- During this debate, and for some time previously the Ministerialists have been trying to taunt the members of the Labour Party with being Socialists. I rather glory in the fact of being a Socialist. I do not think that it will come in my time, but I hope that the day will come when all machinery - all that which tends to produce wealth and distribute it -will be in the hands of the community for the sake of the community. </para>

                        <para>- With me Socialism means that I object to the present state of civilization, which allows a great many to be poor in order that a few may be rich. I object to a system which allows a large number to live in slums in order that a few may live in marble palaces. I object to a system which gives the benefits of education to a few, whilst the overwhelming majority of children have to leave school at a very early age before they have learned the mere rudiments. I do not believe that any luxury or dainty should go into anybody's home until every man, every woman, every child in the community has at least the bare necessaries oflife. </para>

                        <para>- If, for instance, the establishment of old-age' pensions would be the means of bringing happiness into homes, and I believe it would, surely no one could object to its advocacy on a Sunday afternoon or evening. And what is the difference between that and the advocacy of the machine by which it is intended to bring about old-age pensions? There were many people a great many years ago who seemed to find fault with Christ because He attempted on a Sunday to. heal a withered hand. It seems to me that there are some people to-day who with unctuous rectitude, are objecting that other persons should on a Sunday attempt to save withered lives and a blasted civilization. I suppose that no one would object to any of us going on a Sunday with a dole of charity to some one who was starving, and if that be so I cannot see any very great wrong in trying even on a Sunday, to do something which will bring justice to the people, and do away with any need for doles of charity. I am very glad that the Prime Minister is present, because I should like to read an extract from a speech which he made some time ago. The leader of the Opposition advocated the appointment of a High Commissioner, and said that it mattered not whether the States were favorable to such a proposal. He was in favour of the appointment and he thought we should compel the States to do away with their Agents-General. During this debate the honorable member for Gippsland has said that it is not the action of a statesman to point a pistol at the heads of the States, and that the leader of the Opposition is not a statesman, because he advocated the appointment of a High Commissioner in' the manner in which' he did. When the present Prime Minister undertook to explain the Commonwealth Bill in the Sydney Town Hall, the right honorable gentleman delivered the finest political speech I ever heard in my life. He dealt with the Braddon blot, and the financial aspect of the question, and he said - </para>

When the question of establishing old-age pensions has been referred to by honorable members, I have sometimes interjected that we should have a Federal land tax.

                        <para>- There is one thing on which I can congratulate the Prime Minister, and that is upon the formation of his Cabinet. 1 opposed the Commonwealth Bill on both occasions when it was submitted to the people, but not because I was an anti-federalist. I believed in Federation, but I was not in favour of the constitution, of the Senate as proposed, nor am I strongly in favour of it now. I did not, however, believe in imaginary boundaries and that kind of thing. </para>

I believe that the present Prime Minister has acted wisely in picking out the best men of his party to form his Cabinet rather than selecting men from the different States. Other leaders of Federal Governments have selected men from the different States to form their Cabinets. That may have been very necessary in the beginning of Federation. </para>

But I think it is a good thing to break it down as soon as possible, because 1 am still in favour of party government, and in favour of placing on the Treasury bench the best men of the party, irrespective of the constituencies or localities from which they come. I take it that that is what the present Prime Minister has done. </para>

                        <para>- I was not thinking so much about the honorable member for Wilmot as about my dear old friend the right honorable member for Swan. I think that the Prime Minister has been wise, and I congratulate the right honorable gentleman upon picking his best men. We used to think a good deal of the right honorable member for Swan. We used to have an idea that the right honorable gentleman was a great organizer and administrator, and that he was a power. But I suppose that the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he, and looking at the honorable member for Macquarie we are forced to the conclusion that, the Prime Minister having picked his best men, the honorable member for Macquarie is a more able administrator and a better man in every possible way than the right honorable member for Swan. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps not. I congratulate the present Prime Minister upon excluding the right honorable member for Swan from his Cabinet, and putting in his valet, the honorable member for Macquarie. I am not voting against this Government because they have too much or too little policy. Without being greatly troubled' as to what their policy is, 1 am against the Ministry. The right honorable member for East Sydney has himself laid down that line of reasoning. From the time the Labour Party came into power the right honorable gentleman said that it was not so much the policy of the Government to which he objected, but what they were likely to do in the future if allowed to remain in office. The honorable member for Gippsland has stated practically the same thing. That honorable gentleman is not troubled so much about the milk-and-water policy of the Labour Party, as by the fear that they might become tigers if they remained in office. The same reasoning may be applied to the present Ministry, and whether they have or have not disclosed their policy I am against them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think I said a word about it. The only policy on which the present Government are solid is the Trade ' Marks Bill. Some time ago the Prime Minister addressed a meeting in the Protestant Hall, in Sydney. Just after the honorable and learned member for Ballarat had been made Prime Minister, the right honorable gentleman used words about him to this effect : " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> is a most amiable gentleman; he is an orator who can string words together fairly fluently, though there is not much in them after they have been strung together. Still, what has he done that he should be made Prime Minister?" </para>

In the position I have the honour to hold in the Labour Party, I must say the right honorable gentleman has stated publicly here what is absolutely true. There never was any arrangement made by the Labour Party with the Prime Minister. At no time was there even a tacit arrangement in regard to what kind of legislation he should bring in, or what he should do for us. 1 give the honorable gentleman this meed of praise, because I think he deserves it, and in order to justify myself and my party in having supported him for the last five years. I only hope that the successors of the present Government will be able to give the same amount of satisfaction to the people who sent us into Parliament as the present Government have done. </para>
