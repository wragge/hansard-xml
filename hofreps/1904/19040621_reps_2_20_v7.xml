                        <para>The question of the composition of the Commission has received a good deal of consideration at the hands of the Government. We desired at first to appoint a small Commission, ' excluding members of Parliament ; but, having reviewed the names of those who seemed to be available, it was felt that it would be impossible with a small Commission to obtain the representation of each of the six States which we think necessary, since all the States have an interest, though some to a larger extent than others, in the conduct of navigation and the laws which govern it. Therefore we have felt constrained to fall back upon the services of members of Parliament. I have not heard complaints as to the possible partiality of the Commission. Yesterday I was waited upon, first, by a deputation representing the Chambers of Commerce, and, afterwards, by a deputation representing the Employers' Union of Australia, in regard to the proposed Commission, but no member of either body made any complaint as to the likelihood of partiality being shown by those whose names have been suggested. I was asked if the Government could not see their way to add the names of some persons who are not members of the Parliament, in order to give a fuller representation of the commercial md shipping interests affected. We considered the matter in Cabinet last evening, and after looking at every phase of it, came to the conclusion that the Commission as outlined by the Minister of Trade and Customs will be sufficiently representative of all the interests concerned, and that, therefore, there is no need to add fresh names. As honorable members are aware, there are in the list of those whom we propose appointing at the next Executive the names of two gentlemen both closely associated with ordinary commercial transactions, one having a special knowledge of shipping matters, and the other representing a country producing district, while several others are associated with the shipping interest. Having considered the matter from all points of view, we think that we have secured such a Commission as will command confidence outside in its impartiality, and will have sufficient knowledge of details to be able to collect evidence upon which to found a report for the information of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>The view of the Government is expressed by the fact that I have given notice of my intention to move the insertion of those provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. In our opinion, the matter is one of policy, and not a proper one to remit for the consideration' of the members of the proposed Royal Commission; but apart from those provisions which relate to the conditions under which foreign-owned vessels, or other vessels not owned in Australia, shall be allowed to enter our coastal trade, there are debatable matters affecting the carrying on of maritime ventures generally which are of sufficient importance to necessitate the appointment of a Commission of inquiry. There will remain for the investigation of the Commission the whole question as to the proper safeguarding of the lives of passengers and crews who travel on vessels carrying passengers) the arrangements for life saving, and details of that character, together with important matters, such as bills of lading, affecting more particularly the commercial community. As the honorable member for Kooyong may remember, during the discussion of the matter by the Chamber of Commerce, a very important speech was made by a gentleman who, although he occupied a long time in pointing out the deficiencies of the Navigation Bill, did not once touch upon the question just referred to. Consequently in his view, at any rate, there is need for the inquiry we propose. </para>

The honorable member for Fremantle, for instance, would certainly be a move suitable representative than the senator of that State who is to be appointed, but .who is a miner. </para>

As a senator, he represents not merely the mining interests, but all interests in Western Australia, so that I think that, no sound objection can be taken to his appointment on the ground that . he will not represent the , shipping interests.

I wish to know, therefore, whether, if it could be shown before the Commission that a ring of InterState shippers exists whose object is to unduly raise Inter-State freights, the fact would not affect the policy of the Government.

                        <para>I do not. The question of how far the Arbitration Court may go in applying the power we propose to give to it is a matter for its consideration. We propose, as a matter of policy, to emphatically -and unmistakably empower it to apply to foreign-going vessels which seek to trade upon our coast conditions similar to those imposed upon Australian vessels, if it deems it advisable to do so, and we do not think that that can be done without the insertion of the proposed new clauses. If we lay down conditions under which local ship-owners shall work, the Court will have power to extend them to foreign competitors who seek to enter the field. </para>

                <para class="block">When the Constitution Bill was before the people, it was not believed that in the course of two or three years the Federal Parliament would be availing itself of this provision to legislate in the way now proposed. The people regarded it from a national stand-point. They could view it only in that way for the reason that most of the States had already passed legislation dealing with conciliation and arbitration, and that all matters not expressly handed over to the Federal Parliament were to remain under the control of the States Legislatures. It was felt, however, that strikes or disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State might possibly occur, and that it was therefore necessary to give the Federal Parliament this power. They knew what had happened in the United States and other unions where States had not been sufficiently powerful or perhaps sufficiently loyal to deal with disputes between employers and ' employes, and it was felt that on rare occasions there might be reasonable opportunity for the exercise of this power by the Commonwealth. But in what way is this Constitutional provision now regarded? I appeal to the Prime Minister to say whether it has not been made clear by almost every speech made by Honorable members opposite, as well as by the apprehensions expressed by honorable members on this side of the House, that the object of the Government is to bring the control of almost every industry in Australia under the Federal Parliament. We are agreed as to the necessity to provide for the application of a common rule, because it would be practically impossible for a Federal Arbitration Act to work effectively in the absence of such a principle ; but the power is a dangerous one. I would ask honorable members representing the distant States to consider for a moment how the principle of the common rule is likely to affect their constituents. Every speech made by honorable members opposite points to the desire on the part of the Government that there shall be uniformity of control in- regard to all industries, and that that control shall be exercised by the Federal Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- Uniformity as far as will be permissible, having regard to local conditions. Instead of dealing with this question in abroad way, so that the Court would be called upon to deal only with disputes so far-reaching in their effects that they could not possibly be dealt with by a State Arbitration Court, it is proposed to give the Court power to deal with such questions as the way in which a man shall work at Marble Bar, hop-picking in Tasmania, or rearing calves in Gippsland. All these matters have been referred to during the debate as being of vital importance. It was never intended by the framers of the Constitution, nor was it believed by the people when they approved of the Bill, that such matters should be dealt with by the Federal Court, and I trust that honorable members will make the provision in regard to the common rule as wide as possible. I have already directed the special attention of the Committee to this matter, and I trust that when clause 46 is recommitted, it will be dealt with drastically. We all must realize the serious consequences that would follow the placing of the intelligence, industry, and vigour of the country in shackles; the Government doubtless do not desire that such shall be the effect of the Bill. Honorable members- opposite recognise as fully as I do the wisdom of preserving, as far as possible, to the persons concerned, all the inducements and rewards of enterprise and industry. But what do the Government propose ? We are to have a common rule applying probably to Western Australia and Tasmania, and honorable, members from the first -named State, as well as those others who represent the workers in the outlying portions of the Commonwealth, should beware of the pitfall before them. The whole labour movement is apparently under the control of labour organizations, which, while giving fair consideration to questions closely identified with city workers, overlook the work which men have to perform in rural districts. The specific troubles and necessities of these workers have never received the special consideration of the labour movement as we know it. Workers in outlying districts are, however, represented here, and, although I have that interest in labour which every honorable member must possess, because without labour we can do nothing, I feel convinced that, if we employ the ' word 1 ' industry 1 ' in its broadest sense, so as to cover outlying portions of the Continent, we shall have a serious awakening. I will offer a simple example. Take the two States of Western Australia and Tasmania. Let us imagine three above-ground miners in the State of Tasmania discussing the question of wages and working conditions. The following is what may happen : - I will suppose that the three miners are named Smith, Robinson, and Conroy. In Tasmania the wages of an above-ground miner are <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 16s. a week. Suppose that Smith is satisfied with those conditions. He works eight hours a day, has plenty of time to go to meetings and to vote 1 he party ticket at election times, has opportunities to smoke, and is generally quite comfortable. But Conroy and Robinson, though ho better workmen than is Smith, are strong individualists, and desire to devote their strength and ability to the purposes for which they were given to them - for the good of their country and the betterment of their own- condition. Robinson says that he understands that the wages paid to a miner in Western Australia are <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> per week. Therefore, while Smith resolves to slay- where he is, Conroy and Robinson determine to go to Western Australia. Accordingly, they go. After a lapse of two or three years, a letter comes to the little township in Tasmania where Smith is still residing. The letter is from Robinson, who, amongst other things, tells him that wages are still <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> per week where he is working ; but he also describes the dreadful conditions under which men have to work in some parts of that State. Probably some honorable members are familiar with the conditions that, prevail in Western Australia. The right honorable member for Swan knows all about them, because he created the State, I understand ! Some distance away from the ocean, even the eucalyptus dies out. and then there is nothing but the great Western Australian deserts stretching eastwards. Conroy and Robinson, according to the letter of the latter, went out into the desert, carrying their swags. Eventually, Conroy dies at a soak - a large granite outcrop surrounded bv sand. The water which collects on this granite outcrop sinks into the sand alongside and there is generally water to be found there under all circumstances. Conroy expires bv the side of a soak very far from the beautiful streams of Tasmania; and as this brave individualist is dying, his imagination brings back to him visions of the bosky dells and rivulets, and the cool southern winds that blew upon him in his native State. He dies. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and there is no appeal against it. Western Australia is littered by the bones of brave pioneers. The great gold-fields of that State were not discovered by- men who believed that patriotism is limited by faith in a union, or that the only thing worth considering in a country is what the Government will do for a man. Smith, learning that Robinson is earning <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> a week, says to himself, " This man is doing exactly the same kind of work as I am doing, and is getting <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> a week for it, while I am getting only 16s. I shall have to look into this matter.." But he forgets that all through tha letter Robinson speaks about the dust-storms and the hot air of Western Australia. The dust-storms in some parts of that State are so severe that it is impossible to tell a unionist from a non-unionist 50 yards away ! We will suppose that Smith, being dissatisfied at this difference in wage, asks an official to work up a dispute. Here we come to the point. We have in Australia one man working for <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 1 6s. a week, and another man doing similar work for <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> a week. </para>

                        <para>- No, I am informed that at Kimberley, and at times at Coolgardie, wages go up to <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> a week. I am taking the statistics furnished to me by the statist. Evidently some factor has to be taken into consideration when there are such differences between wages. What is that factor? Do, honorable members think that the Judge of the Arbitration Court will take into account the question of temperature? Will he consider whether a miner perspires in Tasmania, or lathers in Western Australia? Will he consider whether the heat of the sun is greater at one place than at another? I have heard honorable members say that the Judge will consider only what is a living wage in one part of Australia, as compared with what is a living wage in another part. I believe that this is all the difference in conditions which any Judge can consider. </para>

                        <para>- They cannot enter into consideration, because one man may like a hot place, whilst another may prefer a cold place. I believe I have heard the Prime Minister state that his idea in reference to varying circumstances and conditions is that the question of the living wage in the various places where men are employed should be considered. Beyond that it is impossible to go. I will, by means of a few figures, show what will happen, find would ask honorable members who represent country districts to remember that it is not possible to ascertain the cost of articles in all portions of a State. It is sufficient to ascertain the cost in the capital city. If we add on railway freight, we shall find approximately what is the cost of articles at any place in that State. For instance, in the' case of Tasmania, we can take the cost of articles at Launceston and Hobart, and by adding the cost of freight to any part of the island, ascertain fairly well what would be the cost of those articles at those places. In the case of Western Australia, take the cost at Perth, . and by a similar calculation ascertain what is likely to be the cost at Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Southern Cross, or Bulong. </para>

                        <para>- The truth in broad principles is at all times essential, but it is not always essential to go into details; in other words, the point is not worth arguing. But to come back to the contrasted wages of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 1 6s. and <inline font-style="italic">£4.</inline> I instance beef, mutton, bacon, and butter, in order to be absolutely fair, having regard to the fact that the difference in the price of these articles will be as great as a difference can be ; tea, calico, and articles of that kind would not, by reason of the freight, be subject to the same variation in price. I find that in Perth the 2 -lb. loaf is 3½d., whilst in Launceston and Hobart it is 3d. In Perth, beef is 7d. to 9d. per lb, as against 5d. per lb. in Launceston and Hobart. </para>

                        <para>- In Perth bacon is1s. to 1s. 2d., as against lod. in Tasmania. . In Perth butter is1s.1d. to1s. 8d.. a lb., as against is. in Tasmania. Honorable members will see that I instance perishable articles in order to give them the full benefit. If we investigate these figures we find that the difference amounts collectively to about 17 per cent. ; and a Judge sitting in an Arbitration Court would say to the man who was receiving <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 16s. per week - " You ought to be getting 7 s. per week more, or <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 3s." Here we have the case of a man who, having taken into full consideration the cost of living, works for <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 3 s. a week, while other men elsewhere receive for the same work,£4 per week. Obviously, what must happen? If there be a common rule, it is clear that the man who receives£4 a week must suffer a considerable reduction in wages. The Western Australian would suddenly discover . that his representatives, instead of fairly representing him, have absolutely sold him - I do not use the word harshly - to the organizations on the eastern seaboard. All men who are doing work in the outlying parts will find themselves within the iron grasp of the common rule, and wages in Western Australia and Northern Queensland must be forced down. </para>

                        <para>- Unless there was something behind democracy - a good deal more intelligence than we are accustomed to contemplate in some portions of this House - I should believe it. The country is not living on legislation and trades unions, hut on its resources - on what the people can do with those resources. Every other country in the world is stimulating industry and invigorating ability ; giving rewards to men who, with their lives in their hands, go exploring, either practically or in the field of science. In the Commonwealth we seek to bind the whole of the people down to one common rule. </para>

                        <para>- I have not altered my principles in the very least. I believe in arbitration; but the best course for us is to legislate wisely. Honorable members seem to wonder that we should be interested in seeing that men who work in the country receive full return for their labour'; but let us try to imagine the establishment of a common rule in England or Canada. Men go to the Klondyke for what they can get ; they throw into the scale their strength and match themselves against nature, with the result that some succeed and others fail. These are the men who make a country ; and it is just the same in South Africa and Western Australia. The men who developed Western Australia were far away from any common rule; the Government could do nothing for them, and there was no hope of the Government doing anything. The result in Western Australia is one in which we are all interested, seeing that there has been found the richest mile for gold in any country in the world. We hear a great deal about labour, but there is a greater and much rarer thing than labour, and that is ability. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member will find that a number of us who are in. favour of arbitration, .and believe that no arbitration is possible without a common rule, are on right lines when we argue that these matters ought to be left to the States. The inhabitants of the States are not savages. Before we entered this Parliament many of us were representatives in the States, and the men we have left behind may be as competent as we are. Let us- leave fo Western Australia or to Tasmania the wages which shall be paid to the men in those States. We have set out on the work of Federation with an evident desire to stick our lingers into everything, and honorable members representing .outlying places will find that the unions. of the eastern seaboard will dominate their constituents, and that the common rule will work out badly in country districts. When I visited Western Australia the right honorable member for Swan offered to do what he could in order to make my trip as- pleasant as possible. But-I did not go there for pleasure; I went to see the country and what sort of men were there. No man visiting Western Australia can fail to be struck with the types of vigorous manhood whom he meets - square-chinned, sinewy, able men, who have gone there, not for trades union purposes or for scenery, air, or exercise- </para>

                        <para>- I have heard before today of men asking for bread, and receiving a stone. The honorable member for the Barrier knows that when it is made clear to the Western Australian miners that the common rule is full of danger, the question will have to be reconsidered. If honorable members think that these men are so enamoured of the new democracy that they will accept anything that the, party decrees, I ask what happened in the case of the ships trading from Fremantle to Adelaide. It was found that when the principle interfered with comfort it was departed from; and no principle is worth consideration' unless it brings comfort or its equivalent to individuals. If we bring down the wages of men in outlying districts to the level of Tasmanian wages - to the level of men who travel, not on a camel pad, but by motor-car and cable-car - then God help the development of our country ! This is no idle matter. The de'struction of the incentive to people to go to outlying districts to work under great discomfort and trouble, and to hazard their health, and perhaps their lives, is a matter to be taken into grave consideration. The common rule should be made to press as lightly as possible. The States, to the authorities of which the conditions are known better than we can possibly know them, ought to manage these affairs, and only on rare occasions, when a quarrel does extend beyond the limits of one State, should the Federal Parliament interfere. As the honorable member for North Sydney said, a Bill of five clauses would have met all requirements; yet we have been making ourselves ridiculous for the last two or three months with a Bill, in the details of which nobody believes, and which nobody wants in this form, and which is pregnant with evil and disaster, especially to working men. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad that the amendment has been accepted by the Government. It does amount to some limitation of the rather too wide scope of the clause as it stands. At the same time, I think that the clause is a little ambiguous, and I should like to know what the Government think it means. With the1 amendment the clause would then provide that the common rule may be varied in its application to particular localities. </para>

                        <para>- The point I take is that there is a very wide and radical distinction between the application of a series of common rules, varying in their terms with the locality to which they are applied, and the extension to a specific area of the terms of the particular award. That is applying the identical terms of the award to a wider area than that which was originally interested in the dispute. What the Government say is that if a dispute comes " before the .Arbitration Court, the award can be applied as a common rule and varied throughout Australia. It may be an award with certain limitations in one district and with other limitations in other districts. In other words, it simply means that the moment-a Federal award is given the Court can at once legislate for the whole of Australia. Where should it stop from the general application of the award, if it is allowed by the clauses to vary it according to localities? Why apply it to one State and not to two States - to one part of a State and not to the whole of the State? </para>

                        <para>- It really does show that the object of the Bill is that the moment an award is made the common rule shall be applied right throughout Australia - that it may be varied to suit the peculiar circumstances of each locality ; but that there is on that award being made, a general rule applicable throughout Australia. In other words, we are to adjust the conditions of production and distribution at once on one award throughout Australia. That is a different thing altogether. What the Bill 'should do is to provide that wherever it was justified by similarity of local conditions the same award should apply, that instead of being applied, perhaps, to the State, it should be applied beyond the State, but that it should not be varied in terms. If we do what the Government ask us to do, it is far more likely that the provision will be declared to be a violation of the Constitution, because it introduces the principle of differentiation right off in a State dispute, and then clearly encroaches on the province of the States. I hope that honorable members, viewing the clause from this aspect, will consider whether a far wider modification should not be made. I think that some provision of this sort would do what is required - </para>

The honorable gentleman is imperilling the Bill by introducing what in all probability will be declared to be an unconstitutional provision. It is obtruding Federal legislation on what is clearly a State affair. Surely it is not contemplated that there may be three awards in a State one dealing with one part of the State, a second dealing with a second part of the State, and a third dealing with a third part of the State ? </para>

It may be that that is the only way in which to satisfactorily settle a dispute which has arisen, and which is sufficiently far-reaching in its character to come within the cognisance of the Court. In Australia we have had our largest strikes through the sympathetic action of people who were, not directly affected in the first instance. </para>

                        <para>- I was not on the Defence Committee, but I. was on the Trades and Labour Council, and I know that the difficulty was to keep men at work. There were some cases where I think men were unwisely brought out, but that is another question. In the Newcastle district the men were locked out by their employers, so that there the dispute was extended by agitators on the other side. What I wish to convey is that the most serious and far-reaching strikes are those which extend by reason of the sympathy evinced by people who are not primarily interested, but who are anxious for the first parties to win. To secure the settlement of a strike of that nature it is impossible to have one universal and unvarying award. It is impossible to get that kind of award 'to settle the dispute. Take the case of the shearing industry, leaving out of account the sympathetic strike of persons engaged in other industries. That would be an Inter- State dispute, possibly ; at any rate it would require the intervention of the Federal authority before it could be satisfactorily adjusted. It would be. an unwise thing to set a hard and fast award to govern the conditions of the shearing industry throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but supposing that in the first instance they had omitted to make certain persons parties to the dispute. There might be two or three kinds of employers whom,. inadvertently or otherwise, they had omitted to make parties to the dispute, and who, it might, be found afterwards, were not agreeable to be bound by it. Does the Committee intend to tie the hands of the Court in such a way that it must, in giving a decision on the common rule, extend a uniform practice to all those parties who were not bound in the first instance? That, I think, would be a most unwise principle to lay down. </para>

That, I think, is a reasonable thing to do.

                        <para>- We must, of course, lay down the lines upon which the Court shall act ; but it is quite sufficient in this clause to indicate to the Judge how he shall allot awards and apply the common rule. Honorable members appear to fear that the Judge will not exercise the common-sense, or display the ability, which is to be expected from a man of the qualifications of a Justice of the High Court, and that in the judgments of the Court reasonable regard will not be paid to the evidence brought before it. . Can any one believe that the Court will apply a common rule where the local conditions make its application unsuitable? The New South Wales Court has not done so. When the Northern Miners' Union secured an award in that Court in regard to certain matters in dispute, and the Court was asked to make the award a common rule, applicable to all the coal-mining districts in the State, it refused to do so. If a State Court will, in an instance like that, where the conditions are much more similar than they would be over the whole area of the Commonwealth, refuse to make its award a common rule, surely we can trust the Commonwealth Court to act similarly. The members of the Committee appear not to realize how the need for common rules has arisen under arbitration legislation. If they had studied the history of arbitration law in New Zealand, they would know that the want of a common rule there has caused endless litigation, so-called party conspirators or agitator's having been stimulated thereby to create disputes, merely to secure fees for their appearance before the Courts on behalf of the unions. </para>

                        <para>- The application of the common rule is affected by the amendment. In applying a common rule, regard must be had to local circumstances and conditions,' and, therefore, the amendment is material to its application. If the New Zealand Court had had the power to extend its awards, and make common rules where local conditions were similar, numerous applications for similar awards would have been rendered unnecessary. I do not say that the amendment materially alters the clause, but I see no need for it. The provisions with regard to limitation of area and. so forth are a sufficient direction to the Court to require it to be guided by local conditions in extending 'an award and making it a common rule. I think that the Prime Minister is unwise in accepting an unnecessary amendment. </para>

                    <para>- In my opinion the Prime Minister has acted very judiciously in adding one more to the finger-posts already in the Bill. The amendment will neither give the Court further power nor impose upon it further limitations ; but as an addition to the series of indications of the meaning of Parliament already inserted it can do no harm, and may serve a very useful purpose. I rose to remind honorable members that, while I shall vote for the amendment, I do not say with any confidence that it .will be found to be constitutional, or capable of being, applied. The Constitution gives the Court power to deal with disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, and as soon as there is concrete evidence that a dispute has so extended the Court will be able to deal with it. But if it be held that the. Court may go further than that, it will be inconvenient for it not to have power to make a common rule where it feels satisfied that it should do so. To deduce from the plain words of the Constitution, which empower the Court to deal with a dispute extending beyond any one State, the power to deal in anticipation, by the application of a common rule, with disputes that may arise in the four States not actually affected, implies a very long-drawn inference ; but at the same time I admit that it is desirable, in order to give coherence and completeness to a measure which we desire to make as perfect as possible, to provide for the application of common rules, upon the assumption that the Court will have power to exercise them. This is merely an endowment of power to the Court. If the Court decides that it can constitutionally make general or common rules, and apply them for the purposes of prevention to States to which disputes have not at the time extended, it will be for it to determine whether, and to what extent and under what conditions, it should exercise this power. Those who are opposed to the paragraph may content themselves with the fact that it merely conveys power to the Court. We are not able to dictate the exercise of that power; that will rest with the Court. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable and learned member has completely stated, what is running in my mind. The carrying into effect of many clauses of the Bill, for good or ill; will depend upon the interpretation placed upon them by the Court. We are all agreed that any award which is made should be made in such a form as not to injure others who are engaged in the occupation to which it is applied. But I. rise to again enter my protest against the effort which is being made to coerce the States.. The very verbiage of the paragraph shows that in drafting this measure it was contemplated that a common rule might apply to the whole Commonwealth.. It is, therefore, desirable, to introduce qualifications that will indicate to the Court that we do not wish the application of the principle to be strained to an extent that would operate disadvantageous!}' to the genera] interests of the people. It must be evident to honorable members opposite that if the application of this principle had an injurious effect on employers it would have an equally disadvantageous effect upon employes. I desire to strongly impress upon the Committee mv belief that this measure is intended to impose upon those States that have not yet passed' legislation in this direction a burden which they consider they should not, at present, be called upon to bear. </para>

                    <para>- I would direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that even if the paragraph were amended as proposed, an anomaly would remain. It will be remembered that when the honorable and learned member for Corinella was dealing with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> he asked that the words " and to specify, the organizations or persons to whom such penalties shall be paid " be omitted. His contention was that circumstances might vary, and that it would be inadvisable to specify in the award itself the persons who should receive the penalties for a breach of it. He considered it desirable to provide that, on a subsequent application, the Court, which would then have a full knowledge of the circumstances, should be able to direct to whom the penalties for a breach that had actually occurred, should be paid. Those words were omitted from the paragraph, and under it the Court, in making an award, will have power only to specify the maximum penalty for a breach of it. Under paragraph /, any practice, rule, or custom settled by an award may become a common rule, and the common rule will have a wider application than an award ; yet, in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> it is proposed to leave it to the Court to determine in making that common rule the persons to whom the penalties for a breach of it shall be paid. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. To remove the anomaly, it would be necessary to omit 1 all the words as to specifying the persons to whom the penalties shall be paid. It is desirable, however, that there should be power, as in the case of a breach of an award to specify the persons to whom these penalties shall be paid when a breach of the common rule has been committed. The Prime Minister -will recognise that the conditions governing the common rule are practically the same as those governing an award ; and that any individual injured by a breach of the common rule should be entitled to receive the penalty fixed in respect of it just as he would be in the case of a breach of an award. </para>

                        <para>- That is the point which I desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister. It would not be well for us to leave these matters to the Court to interpret. Throughout clause 46 we deal with an award and a common rule as if they were absolutely distinct. An award is something which is binding between the parties to the dispute, but a common rule may be declared to be. binding on persons who are not. We have been using a distinction in phraseology, whereas if an award includes both an award and common rule there need be no further declaration following paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline></para>

                    <para>- The Committee is indebted to the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs for having brought this matter forward. When paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> were before us last week we said that the Court, by its award, might fix the maximum penalties, but should not specify the destination of penalties. We omitted certain words to give effect to that decision; but paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> goes back to the system of which we disapproved, and allows the destination of penalties to be declared when the maximum is fixed, instead of when they are actually imposed. In order to bring this paragraph into harmony with the express desire of the Committee, it will be necessary for the Prime Minister to withdraw his amendment, and to move the excision of all the words relating to the destination of penalties. The principle is that the destination of penalties shall not be determined until the penalty has actually been imposed, and the circumstances are known. The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs has inquired whether the words ' ' common rule " and "award" relate to two different matters. This raises a very interesting speculation as to how far, in that event, the constitutionality of common rules is affected. If they are different, the fact affords, to my mind, a considerable argument against their constitutionality. If  common  rules  ,and  awards are one and . the same, however, that fact offers some argument, although not a very strong one in their favour. Leaving that matter out of consideration  for  the moment, and dealing with the two words separately, although the two matters may be capable of being included in the one term, I think that it would be necessary to insert certain words in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> corresponding with the provisions in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d.</inline></para>

It is well, on the whole, that there should be a distinction, because we wish to indicate to the Court that a common rule may be an extension of an award, but is not necessarily to be confused with an award itself. If we had no reference in the Bill to a common rule the Court might be doubtful whether it had the power to practically re-open an award and extend its scope; but by making some allusion to it we indicate that the Court is to be endowed with the power to extend an original award, with such alterations as it may consider desirable. I think the best course for me to pursue would be to withdraw the amendment, and to move the omission of the words - and to specify the organizations or persons to whom they shall be paid. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCAY</inline>(Corinella).- With regard to the distinction between a common rule and an award, I suggest to the Prime Minister that, as' a matter of drafting, a common rule, so called, whatever its limitations may be, is an extended award. Although I am no extravagant lover of the common rule, I think that the marked distinction made in the Bill between a common rule and an award, will suggest to the Court a very grave question as to the constitutionality of common rules. It will be rather a suggestion that Parliament looks upon a common rule as something distinct from an award. It will be suggested that the common rule is a pretended assumption of power, which we are not justified in making. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat has drawn attention to the question of the unconstitutionality of common rules, but if by drafting we suggest such a thing, we are giving almost a parliamentary indication that we regard the justification for the common rule as being founded upon an implied power rather than in an express provision of the Constitution. I may say, in passing, that the 'amendment of the Government is at least as drastic as any amendment of mine, and more drastic than the last one proposed by me. Consequently, I do not intend to object to it. But I suggest to the Prime Minister that it is of no use casting a doubt on his own legislation by endeavouring to draw this marked distinction between a common rule and an award. A common rule can only be justified as an accretion to an award. The more I think of it the more I doubt our power ; but it is an assumption of power which we ought to make in the interests of peace - with proper limitations. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not look upon the common rule as involving any greater infraction of the constitutional position, or any further extension of the constitutional power given to the Parliament, and, therefore, given to the Court, than the award itself. Because, after all, it is only a correction of any inadvertent error into which people may have fallen in not joining as parties in regard to any case. The common rule is an attempt made to apply the award to persons other than the original parties. If, under this legislation, or any legislation of any of the States, any of the individuals to whom it is sought to extend the common rule could have been parties in the first instance, the application of the common rule is virtually an extension of the award to them. </para>

I do not think this will carry us any further, so far as the interpretation of the Constitution is concerned, than, the award itself. I look upon it, however, as an amplification of an award," to admit of a more definite method being attempted than the breaking up of the original award.

I have no doubt that costs will be incurred ; and if parties very wrongly bring a case before the Court, why should they not be made liable for the whole of the costs ? It is not to be supposed that solicitors or agents will, by the operation of this paragraph, be excluded from acting. </para>

                        <para>- We shall not even be discouraging them. We may be encouraging the creation of a class of what may be called lay lawyers, who may become as proficient in this particular business as members of the legal profession. If men of that class prove themselves to be sufficiently efficient the demand for their services will extend, and- their fees will rise. Therefore, the paragraph will not prevent agents from acting for the parties. But it will make this difference - that if a solicitor or agent is employed, and costs are incurred,, while we make the party who is found to be in the wrong liable to- pay his own costs, we allow him to escape payment of costs- which have been incurred by the opposite party.' I do not see what is to be gained by that. It has to be remembered that this is to be a Federal Court. It will not be in the same position as a State Court. Cases .will be brought before it from distant parts of the Continent ; and that being so, the parties may have to be represented either by lawyers or agents, and costs will have to be incurred. </para>

                        <para>- Of course they would be taxed. Even if this were considered to be a desirable provision in a State Act, it is far from being desirable in a Federal Act. If one party think they can put another party, who are remotely situated, to a great deal of expense without having themselves to pay a considerable portion of the costs, there will be a great temptation to do so. This is not a matter that affects employers or employes particularly. It is not as though we could' say that costs shall not be incurred. There would be no possibility of carrying out such a provision. All that we can say is that costs shall not be allowed. There is one way in which costs are often run up unnecessarily, and that is in the matter of witnesses. In the case of the Federal Court, under some circumstances, witnesses' expenses will be a considerable item, because the Court will have to deal with cases affecting districts more or less distant in origin, or in respect to other areas affected. Since there must be representation of the parties, I. see no reason why reasonable costs should not be allowed. As- in an ordinary court case, the litigants would not, of course, get the whole of the expenses of their advocates, agents, or lawyers, but only such portion as might be taxed. Fbr these reasons- I suggest to the Prime Minister that he would gain nothing, but might lose something, by the provision as it stands. In any case, it is rather unfair that one who has imposed expense on another, quite unnecessarily, it may be, should escape the payment of costs. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot see the matter in exactly the same light as does the honorable member for North Sydney. What is attempted to' be set up, wherever these Courts have been projected, is a Court of equity and good conscience, and not a Court dependent on legal technicalities, or the mere detailed interpretation of the actual language of a Statute. Under the Federal Constitution there will, I admit, be occasional questions of jurisdiction which, of course, do not arise in a State Court <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> but the central idea at which we should aim is to . avoid the technical part of the law, and to prevent it being made part of a dispute. Once we- take it for granted that these costs may be allowed, a solicitor, counsel, or agent will be nearly always employed, and in almost every instance some attempt will be made to have costs granted. Without the counsel, . solicitor, or agent, (he Courtt, I admit, will have to depend on itself for an interpretation of the law ; there will be none of that assistance which, I dare say, is useful to a Court, as it may be to persons, in the wav of suggestions during the progress of a suit. But I think the balance of advantage lies with' there being no provision either for lawyers to be present in the Court, or for their costs to be allowed in regard to any particular case. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but at a later stage the Government will propose that lawyers shall be excluded from the Court unless both parties consent. Even if that provision be carried, it will not have the effect of excluding the opinion of solicitors or barristers being sought, or solicitors being engaged to work up a case. There is no prohibition of that kind; but a; the same time it would be unwise to grant costs to either party in respect of the employment of agent, solicitor, or counsel. In New South Wales there is no power to g-rant costs of the kind. Although legal gentlemen may appear in the New South Wales Court, there is no power to grant costs in respect of their appearance, or of . any work performed by them. ' Under the New Zealand Act the provision is exactly the same so far as costs are concerned. </para>

The honorable member for North Sydney said that in a Federal Court it would be impossible for parties at a distance to appear personally, and that they would have to be represented by an agent. The great probability is, however, that an employer in the back country of New South Wales or of Western Australia would be represented by an agent found for him by the employers Organization in Sydney or Melbourne, or wherever, a Court happened to sit. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that fact ; but in the great majority of cases such an employer would be represented in the way I have suggested. In other cases, it would be just as easy for an employer to appeal directly to the Court to view his circumstances, as it would be to get an agent. In any case, the trouble I see is that if once we allow the costs of agent, or solicitor, or counsel, to be given, we immediately encourage the stringing out of cases, and reliance on the technical points that' may not have, or should not have, any effect on the decision of the Court. That is the danger I fear ; and' I prefer, therefore, not to accept the suggestion of the honorable and learned member. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEAKIN</inline>(Ballarat).- Personally, I am against all these restrictions, because I believe they do not conduce to the ends of justice, or to satisfactory, decision. I do not think this particular proposal, as to costs, is of first importance. But I do think that the amendment excluding counsel, which the Government promise at a later stage, is a matter of importance, and, when we reach the proposal, shall be prepared to argue it. At this stage I do not wish to go into the question ; it is only necessary now to enter a preliminary protest. It is quite a mistake to assume that the value of a member of the legal profession in a Court of this kind is confined to his knowledge of the law. A man who has had practice in . the Courts, and possesses experience with witnesses and juries, has gained a fund of knowledge which may not be usually described as legal, and may be accompanied, as it often is, with a lax knowledge of the law. Many of the first advocates and ablest cross-examiners, who- are of great value in a Court on any question of fact, are not strong in their interpretation of . the law. It is this practical value of the legal profession which the Government propose to . throw aside. </para>

According to the amendment which is to be proposed, all lawyers are to be excluded, but agents are to be allowed to appear; and very serious injury may be done to either an employer or an employe who is not a member of an employers or trades union. I regard both employers' organizations and workman's organizations as exactly on the same footing. The agent may be the paid secretary of either organization, and, with all due deference to the legal members of the House, I can see that this agent, with the coaching he will get from the solicitor to the particular union, may, in 'this Court, be as good as a great many lawyers. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot discuss the question before us without considering its effects. I want to place the non-unionists and unionists on both sides on exactly the same footing; and we can see that if we get an employers' association on the one side against a non-union body of workers, the latter will be seriously handicapped by a decided disadvantage. A layman not specially trained would have to appear in Court as against the skilled secretary or agent of the other side, who, to all intents and purposes, is a lawyer so fax as this particular Bill is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; the clause before us deals with the costs which are to be allowed to the agent or to the solicitor. If we allow agents or solicitors to appear, whether on one side or the other, and one side brings a trivial case, and drives the other side into legal expenses, these ought to be paid by the party which loses the suit. Personally, I should like to exclude lawyers and agents altogether from this Court, and would be prepared to vote for a proposal to that effect. But if we do allow them to appear, I see no reason why, in the case of an employer or trades union trying to take advantage of, and work injustice by going behind, an award, costs should not be given. If the Court thinks that one side has been totally wrong in submitting a trivial case, that side ought to pay the expenses incurred by the other side, which has, as it were, been forced into Court. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KNOX</inline>(Kooyong). -The whole argument used from time to time by the Prime Minister has been " Trust the Judge." If he is prepared to trust the Judge in great matters affecting large industries, why is he not prepared in small matters of costs to trust to his discretion? This is another of the inconsistencies which run right through the measure. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCAY</inline>(Corinella).- This is not a matter on which any legal member need shrink from speaking, because he will get his costs anyhow, but it is a question of who shall pay them. I quite agree with the honorable member for Kooyong, that if the Court can be trusted in matters of infinitely greater moment, it can be trusted in the matter of costs. It does" seem a pity to prevent the winning party from being indemnified, at any rate, to some extent, if he has justifiably been engaging legal assistance. The Minister of External Affairs pointed out last week that one reason for allowing penalties to go to parties was that they might be recouped what they were actually out of pocket for legal expenses, and the Prime Minister hurled at the honorable and learned member for Wannon the taunt that members of the legal profession hid in a certain case divided up the sum of ^50, as to which, he said, the honorable and learned member seemed very anxious. If Ministers will apply that argument in this case, surely they will not say that it is unwarrantable to allow penalties to be imposed to reimburse the parties in respect of costs, and not to allow the Court to assess them as costs, but to compel it to assess them as penalties. Because the question is not whether lawyers are to have a hand in the matter, but as to who is to pay them. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a very important matter, but I think that the Government may find afterwards that in their anxiety to do good they have done an injury to people whom it might be desirable to benefit. The fact that a party has to pay the costs or some costs on the other side, if he loses, is a very wholesome deterrent to speculative or casual actions. When a client is told how much it will cost him if he loses, very often it checks an otherwise litigious spirit. The provision as it stands is rather an encouragement to unnecessary litigation than a hindrance of it. People .with a just cause need not fear the omission of the words. It is not a vital matter, but, on the whole, I think that expediency and wisdom suggest an amendment. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DUGALD</inline>THOMSON (North Sydney). - The Prime Minister has truly said that a similar provision is in. the Act of New South Wales; but, nevertheless, in almost all cases counsel appears for the parties in the State Court. That shows that the provision has not had the effect in- tended. If counsel is allowed to appear, then the party who is found responsible for unnecessarily bringing the case to Court should properly pay, whoever he may be. That seems only equitable. To my mind, a provision of the kind would deter people from bringing before the Court cases where there was very little prospect of getting a decision in their favour. It seems that in a new clause that will, be proposed at a later stage, the Ministry have decided to exclude counsel and agents. If counsel and agents are to be excluded by a later clause, I do not see much necessity for the provision before the Committee. I would suggest that the provision be omitted from this clause, and if the new clause be carried, inserted in that clause. Because it is contradictory to say in one clause that costs shall not be allowed to counsel, and to say in another clause that counsel shall not appear. </para>

                        <para>- That is the provision with which we are dealing. I am sure that the Minister will agree with me that, although a similar provision is in the State Act, counsel are largely employed by each side- in fact almost invariably. I think that the equitable method is to allow the Judge to award the costs, or a portion of them, against one of the parties. I would suggest to the Prime Minister that he should not insist on this provision, but should depend entirely on the later provision which he intends to introduce, and that if he is defeated, then he should allow the costs of solicitor or agent to go to the parties who might be named by the Judge. </para>

                    <para>- I have not before me a copy of the latest Act ot New Zealand, but I know that the Act of Western Australia, passed in 1900, provides that either party to the dispute may appear personally, or by agent, solicitor, or counsel, but that no costs shall in any case be allowed on account of any agent, solicitor, or counsel appearing for any party. That, it seems to me, would be a reasonable way out of this difficulty. I can well understand that we do not wish to have these cases made too expensive. At the same time, I do not see any real ground for denying to those who want the advantage of counsel at their own expense that benefit. What was said just now by an honorable .member appeals to me. Agents of labour organizations are up to every argument and move in regard to these Acts, and are really experts. Therefore, to prohibit the employment of legal assistance is to place an embargo on the other side, who are not always thinking of how to get the better of the employes. I believe in permitting the employment of a solicitor or counsel, and not allowing the Court to give any costs. It cannot be considered unfair to either side to say that legal assistance may be provided at their own expense. </para>

                    <para>. - There are certain arguments in favour of paying costs which seem to be worth considering'; but I think that they must be. set aside in consideration of those very much greater advantages which can be, and are now. obtained under a similar provision in the New South Wales and ' other Acts. I have no doubt that if lawyers are excluded from the Court, persons will spring up who will be .skilled more or less in this business, and capable of discussing matters likely to be brought before the Court. Supposing that a body of men residing at a long distance from the Court should desire to be represented by an agent. Money is a consideration to a small union of employes or employers. I would remind the right honorable member for Swan that perhaps this proposal will be as advantageous to employers as to employes, because very often a union is collectively very rich. ' An organization with which I am connected possesses .£3,000 or £4,000 - not a very large sum, but still ample to bear the costs of any litigation. An employer may be a man, and I believe in very many cases is a man, with perhaps only £100 or £200 at his back. If a union were to pile up the costs, multiply the number of witnesses, and thus, protract litigation, it could, of course, practically smash such a man. But the proposal cuts both ways. </para>

                        <para>- The President of the Court will be a gentleman educated in a certain environment, and blind to the imperfections of a legal system which regards costs as one of the first laws of nature. I do not mean to say that no regard is paid by the ordinary Courts to this question, or that it will not be fairly regarded by the Arbitration Court, but I fail to see that any one has suffered injustice under the New South Wales practice. Whenever a penalty has been imposed for a flagrant or deliberate breach of an award, the party injured has received such a proportion of it as practically to enable him to defray his expenses. If there were inspec-tors, half of the work of the unions would be done by them, but it would be impossible to appoint, under this Bill, inspectors who would have competent jurisdiction throughout the Commonwealth. Therefore, the various unions of employers and employes will have to look after these matters themselves, and where they are forced to prosecute they should not be put to unnecessary expense or trouble. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN</inline>(Angas). - I do not care very much whether the words do or do not remain in the clause. What I object to is the exclusion of lawyers or agents. I have, however, a' compromise to offer. In South Australia we have a Local Court procedure, as distinct from the Supreme Court procedure, and somewhat analogous to the District Court procedure in New South Wales. This provides a distinct limitation of costs. Where lawyers' fees in a Supreme Court action may run into hundreds of pounds, no costs are allowed under the Local Court procedure where the interest involved is less than £5, whereas, if it be more that ; £5, and not exceeding , £20, the costs allowed are only <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> ; <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> 2s. is allowed where the amount does not exceed £30 ; and so the costs increase, according to scale, until a maximum of about£17 is allowed. Moreover, there are no refreshers, except sometimes counsel's fees, no matter how long the proceedings may be dragged on. I can see the objection to allowing full Supreme Court costs in proceedings under this Bill. If that were done, and the case lasted a fortnight or three weeks, it would be very hard to compel the defeated party to pay all costs, since some of the parties concerned might n6t have been parties to the original dispute, but might have been made parties by order of the Court. Under the Bill as it stands, unless there were some proscription in the rules, imposing a limitation, full Supreme Court costs would be recoverable ; but I suggest that power should be given to make rules providing for a strict limitation of costs similar to' that which I have described. </para>

                    <para>- Whilst I would recognise the wisdom of including a provision of this kind in a State Arbitration Bill, I do not think that the arguments for the exclusion of counsel and solicitors from the Arbitration Court apply with the same force under a Federal Bill. . It must be remembered that the Court will deal with disputes removed far beyond the particular area in which they have arisen, and the distance of the place at which the Court sits may be so remote from the place of residence of the parties chiefly concerned as to make it almost impossible for them to attend in person. They must, therefore, secure representation, and the only way in which they can do so is by employing counsel or a solicitor or an agent. </para>

                    <para>- To disallow the charging of costs against either party will not prevent the employment of counsel ; but it has been suggested by the Minister of External Affairs that the secretaries of organizations might appear in place of lawyers. No doubt, if such persons were continually employed in the . Court, they would become even better versed in the provisions of the law, and in the procedure of the Court, than any barrister or solicitor who might be casually employed ; but, inasmuch as the organizations of employers do not generally have paid secretaries who devote the whole of their time to their work, it would place them at a disadvantage to have to be represented by their secretaries. Whatever we agree to should be fair to both sides. If we determine that counsel or solicitors shall not appear before the Court, the organizations of employers will be compelled to employ professional secretaries ; and I think that the result will be that the proceedings of the Court will be protracted quite as much as they now are. T do not think that it will shorten the proceedings to exclude counsel. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN</inline>(Angas). - I wish to make a suggestion to the Prime Minister. My attention has been called' to this paragraph as requiring the production of books, and, in some cases, perhaps permitting the secrets. of firms to be exposed. In reply to suggestions, I said that the permission to examine books could not well be confined to the President ; for I recognise that it would not be proper to allow one member of the Court to examine the books produced in a dispute, and to refuse to allow the other members to do so. A compromise might be effected bv providing that there shall be no scrutiny of books except in regard to matters actually relating to the case in dispute. As a rule, when books are produced in Court, they are open to scrutiny from end to end, and we can readily understand that unions, whether of employers or of employes, would naturally be anxious that their trade secrets should not be open to the scrutiny of every one. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that under those clauses provisions are made for penalties for improper disclosure of evidence ; but the penalty might not adequately cover the injury. The exposure of a trade secret might be far-reaching in its effect. I have no desire to move an amendment unless the Prime Minister can see his way clear to accept the spirit of my suggestion; but by way of further direction to the Court, I think it would be well to add at the end of the paragraph the words - for the purpose of reference to such of the entries or matters only as directly relate to the dispute. </para>

                        <para>- No. The production of the books must be for the purpose of reference to such entries or matters only as relate directly to the dispute. I am prepared, however, to omit the word " directly " if the Prime Minister desires it. That would give the Court a very wide power of investigation, while, at the same time, operating as a ban against the examination of books from end to end by any agitator. </para>

                <para>Mr.GLYNN. - But books brought before the Court may contain many entries other than those relating to the dispute. The rule is that when a book is put in as evidence, any part of it may be examined, lt is hard to determine what is relevant and what is not, and therefore books are often examined from end to end. Rules can be made to secure that books shall be examined only in regard to entries relating to the dispute in question, and when they come before the Court no other entries will be inspected ; but if my proposal were adopted it would make the Court all the more careful. </para>

                    <para>- Under this paragraph the Court might direct the attendance of witnesses whom neither party was prepared to call, and I desire to know whether in such cases it would have power to grant expenses. A witness might refuse to attend unless guaranteed his expenses, more particularly if it would be necessary for him to travel from a distant State in order to appear before the Court. I should like to have the assurance of the Prime Minister that the Court, in addition to having the power to summon witnesses, will also have power to allow them costs. . </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may rest assured that the Court would not be likely to compel a witness to attend before it without granting an allowance to cover his costs. That is the universal practice. If a man is not a voluntary witness care is taken to send him sufficient money to enable him to appear before the tribunal, and I do not think that the Arbitration Court is likely to depart from that practice. </para>

                        <para>- I am informed by our legal advisers that the retention of the words - though they were not intended to minimize the power of the Court in dealing with matters of this kind - might be construed to minimize it They might be construed as compelling the Court to insist that an application must come from an original party ; whereas under clause 47 the Court is given power to exercise any of its powers on its own action, as well as on the application of any of ' the parties. Therefore, to make the words completely in consonance with clause 47 it would be necessary to insert the words, " on its own motion," in clause 48. I think' it will be safer to strike out the words. I am afraid that their retention might have the effect of confining the Court in instances where it did not wish to be confined, and where the Court thought it ought to make an order on its own motion. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEAKIN</inline>(Ballarat).- On further considering the clause, I am not satisfied that what the Prime Minister has stated is the exact position. If it be thought necessary to protect the power of the Court to act on its own motion, there can be no objection to introducing words to that effect. But I do not see why the Court needs to be empowered tei act on its own motion in prescribing a minimum rate of wage, or remuneration, or in directing that preference shall be given to unionists. As I have followed the construction of this Bill, both those powers are, so to speak, the secondary consequences of previous applications to the Court, which are being dealt with by an award. I fail to see at the moment that the words proposed to be omitted weaken the power of the Court to exercise its other powers on its own motion. </para>

                        <para>- I think it was intended to cut them down in regard to these particular matters. Two main things and one subsidiary matter are dealt with by this clause. The minimum wage is of extreme importance, and the preference to be given to members of an organization is also extremely important. It appears to ha've been thought that the Court ought not to declare a preference to unionists, or to prescribe minimum rates, when no one asks for them. These were powers which were to be used by the Court as if an award was being varied or extended. A provision is made in the preceding clause that when orders or awards are to be varied and submissions are to be reopened, that is only to be done when some person who is affected or aggrieved has applied. As I have said, the provisions of this part of the Bill - the minimum wage and a preference to unionists - are most important, would require to be asked for by those affected, and would not be granted by the Court unless at the request of some person who desired them. Passing over its power to deal with the necessary matters which arise in the conduct of any case, the Court may, under clause 46, enjoin any person from committing a contravention of the Act. The Court does not need to be moved by , any one for that. It may declare that any practice, regulation, rule, or condition of employment shall be a common rule. There is nothing to prevent the Court doing that. It may direct within what limits the common rule is to apply, may dismiss any matter, make orders as to costs and expenses, and so on. Those are all matters largely of form, and they arise out of awards. There may be either common rules or specific awards, and the rest of the powers relate to the manner in which the Court may exercise them. </para>

                        <para>- There the Court has to have an application from the person or organization affected or aggrieved; but in clause 48 we are dealing, not with matters of form but of substance. They are all important matters. And in these cases an application should be made to the Court before an order is made. That is to say, an organization may bring a case before the Court. They may not ask for a minimum wage, or for preference for unionists. In the course of the case they may determine to ask for a minimum wage or for preference. Then the Court may grant it. But the clause says that if the parties do not ask for it, the Court is not, of its own motion, to inject it into the case That appears to me to be the plain meaning of the words. </para>

                <para class="block">The idea of this amendment is to leave it optional with the Court to prescribe a rate lower than the minimum, or to fix- a tribunal which will have power to prescribe a rate lower than the minimum. The clause, as drafted, seems unintentionally to make the prescription by the Court mandatory. I do not think that that was intended, because in some employments there has never been any question about permitting certain people to work under a fixed wage. For instance, in the case of shearers and seamen there is a minimum rate of wages, and it is never suggested that there should be an exception for those who cannot- earn the minimum. I propose to leave it to the discretion of the Court, and, if reason be shown, as it' might be shown in some classes of employment, the Court might make an order. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEAKIN</inline>(Ballarat).- This amendment raises a point which is worthy cf consideration. It makes an important change. The question is whether, whenever a minimum wage is fixed, there should be provision made to vary that minimum. It might or might not be varied at the instance of some person interested in those who are not able to earn the minimum wage. When the Bill was drafted, the view taken, with regard to this particular clause, was that to fix a minimum might often be desirable. It is a sort of common rule; a short cut to obtaining equality of treatment throughout a trade, and, as such, may be very valuable. But it was thought that this power, if it were to be used at all, might be undertaken by the Court, without that exhaustive investigation into all the details of employment in the business concerned, which would show whether it was or was not necessary to have provision made for a lower payment than that of the minimum wage, to those whose physical or mental qualities did not enable them to earn the minimum. </para>

                        <para>- But the view of my late honorable colleague and of the late Government was that the application of the minimum wage on a Federal scale to disputes in industries extending beyond the limits of a State implied such a large area, - and such a great variety of conditions, that it ought to be an essential condition that there should be attached to the fixing of ,a minimum wage, in every case, the establishment of a tribunal which could allow a lower rate to be paid to men who could not earn (hat minimum. The proposal of the Government, so far, is reasonable in itself, but it involves an important distinction. The amendment provides that the Court may, if it think fit, fix the minimum wage without any provision for .1 lower rate. Consequently, no matter what the circumstances are, no person could then be employed except at that minimum wage, from which there could be no deduction. That is a very important change, and, on the whole, I think we had better keep to the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The Registrar might be added as a third person. I recognise that the proposal of the Government is not unreasonable; but, at the same time, it makes a serious change. The late Government were of opinion that the minimum wage was so important that it ought to be included; but at the same time we thought that, when applied federally over great areas, there were so many varying conditions that unless the proceedings of the Court, in the first instance, were to be made exhaustive by an inquiry into the circumstances of all the cases where it could apply, the probability was that the Court would altogether refuse to fix the minimum wage. The provision was inserted as a condition, so that the Court might without elaborate information feel that it was perfectly safe in fixing a minimum wage, by also appointing a tribunal satisfactory to both parties. If there were cases which, in its then knowledge, the Court did not foresee, and which it could not investigate without prolonged inquiry and expense, a tribunal could be appointed, representative of both parties,' which would not be employed unless necessary. While the Prime Minister may suggest occupations in regard to which such a provision seems difficult, I do not know, unless he is prepared to define them in the Bill itself, whether the amendment might not be made the means of throwing the door open to the application of a minimum wage without exception in every trade. </para>

                        <para>- It is a condition precedent in every case where a minimum rate is fixed. The question is whether we ought to let the provision remain, or whether we ought to accept the proposal of the Government, which allows the Court to do as it likes. According to the amendment, the Court may, if it thinks fit, fix a minimum rate without the condition precedent ; and this raises a very important issue. </para>

                    <para>. - There would appear to be a danger in the clause as it appears in the Bill. Although the clause says that the Court may fix the minimum wage, it insists upon the Court appointing a tribunal to fix a lower rate; the appointment of this tribunal is an imperative task on the Court in all cases. Therefore, if the minimum wage be fixed at 8s." per day, a tribunal may follow which will fix a rate at 7s., 6s., or 5s., as individuals, or the class of individuals concerned, may seem to warrant. There would appear to be a sort of contradiction in terms, if it is to be imperative that this tribunal shall be appointed ; if the appointment is to be within the discretion of the Court, that is another matter. A minimum wage, so far as I understand, means a wage which is regarded as fair, on the whole, to be paid to the persons in a trade; and, under the amendment, if it appears that in that trade there are certain duties which can be performed by persons who are not able to earn, or ought not to be paid, the full amount, the Court may make certain arrangements in regard to such persons. Under the clause as it stands, it is imperative on the Court to appoint this tribunal. I will take as illustrations the trades mentioned by the Prime Minister. First of all, there are the shearers, for whom there is one rate of£1 fixed in New South Wales, a rate of 17s. <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> in Victoria, and, I believe, a rate of£1 in South Australia, </para>

                        <para>- Ordinary seamen receive a minimum rate, and so do A.B.'s; but the rate for the latter is higher than that for the former. These distinctions are made by law as well as by custom. Wharf labourers receive1s. or1s. 3d. an hour, as the case may be, and no distinction is made in the case of individuals. When the matter was discussed in New South Wales, arguments were brought forward in which the services of individual men were contrasted ; but in that State it has not been found desirable to fix a second rate. In certain callings, however, the case is different. For instance, the minimum rate for painters was fixed at 1s. or1s.1d. per hour, with a minimum of lod. per hour for those unable to do the best work. But the painting trade permits of such distinctions being drawn. A man who can grain, or do dadoes, or stencilling, is much more valuable than a man who can do only plain brush-work ; the trade itself seems to indicate grades of excellence. </para>

                        <para>- Practically that is so, and apart from piece-work, it is desirable in some trades to fix a second rate to provide for old men who otherwise would find no place at all. In shearing, each man has to do equal work, and, as in the case of the seamen, all are paid the same rate. Occasionally there may be an elderly man employed, but he is compelled to do the usual amount of work. The number of such persons in any occupation of the kind is infinitesimal, and to provide for them would be to lower, or to tend to lower, the average rate for the whole. Shearers, wharf labourers, and seamen represent the three principal industries ; but I do not deny for a moment that there are a number of trades, such as boot-making and tailoring, in which a second rate might with advantage be introduced. The amendment, however, ' covers all such cases. The amendment gives the Court power, if it think fit, to fix a lower rate, and it does this in a way for which the original clause does not provide. The amendment proposes that the Court may - . . . if it think fit, fix a lower rate (in the case of employees who are unable to earn the minimum rate so prescribed), or make provision for such a lower rate being fixed, in the manner and subject to the conditions specified in the award or order of the Court, or by some tribunal specified in the award or order. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen that there are .three ways by which such cases can be met under the amendment, as against the one way provided in the clause. The Court, according to the clause, may not fix the lower rate, but must appoint a tribunal to do so. Our experience is that in some cases it is best for the Court to fix the lower rate, while in other cases it is advisable to appoint a tribunal for that purpose. I should like to point out to the Committee two classes of cases, one in which it is desirable that the Court should . take action, and another in which it is desirable for a tribunal to be appointed. In the case of a trade which, as pointed out by the honorable member for Dalley, practically classifies itself, the Court may with safety fix the lower rate; as, for instance, in the painting trade, where a man who does a certain kind of work is paid is. an hour, while the man who does only plain brushwork is paid lod. But where there are occasional cases of old men, or men who cannot quite keep up to the pace, a tribunal is desirable, because it has to deal with individuals, and rare occurrences. </para>

I think the cases which have been cited as objections are much better met by the amendment than by the clause, the former giving, as I have already pointed out, three alternative ' methods, to be used as occasion may require. That is better than an imperative direction to take one course. </para>

                    <para>- In Victoria we have had a good deal of experience of this matter in connexion with the numerous Wages Boards which have been appointed. Notwithstanding the good those Boards have done, one thing became apparent as soon as we had experience of their work. That was the necessity for making provision for what in Victorian politics was colloquially termed " the old or slow worker." That was the point of attack on which those who disapprove Qf Wages Boards legislation continually launched their efforts. I do not care what the pay may be; it seems inevitable that, wherever the rate is time rate, and not piece-work rate, a provision of this kind must appear. The individual case is almost invariably the case that has to be considered, and not the case of a class ; the provision does not seem tome to be aimed at a class. The cases referred to by the Minister of External Affairs, in justification of the amendment as compared with the clause, seem to me such as could be met by a proper classification of work, and not of workmen,, in the award. </para>

                        <para>- If " remuneration ' ' bears that meaning, I cannot understand how piecework rate can be affected by that particular question. But if that be a sound objection, it is not met by the amendment. It should be met in another way, by making it clear, if necessary, that it applies to wages rates as contrasted with piece-work rates. It should be a compulsory accompaniment to the fixing of a minimum wage to have in existence some tribunal to deal with the cases of those who are not able to earn that rate. I do not think we should allow the charge to be made, with any appearance of justification, against any legislation of this kind that it means the extinction, as far as trade is concerned, of the old or slow worker. In his remarks the Minister of External Affairs almost said that it did, and ought to mean that. I was very much surprised to hear him speak in that way. Possibly he did not intend his words to convey' the full meaning which was conveyed to my mind, when he said that there were some trades in which the old and slow workers ought not to work, but ought to go out and make room for younger and more vigorous men. I do not agree with that spirit of legislation. Youth has quite enough advantages, and age quite enough disadvantages, without our accentuating them bv our legislation, if it can be possibly helped. So far as I am able to judge, the Bill is more wisely drafted in this respect than is the amendment. I believe in the principle of a minimum wage ; but there are very weighty and powerful arguments which can be adduced against it. </para>

We should proclaim, not only to the Court, but to all concerned in Australian industry, that while we empower the Court to prescribe a minimum rate of wage in proper cases, it is accompanied with the compulsory order that it shall always have in existence a tribunal to provide for the special cases. The amendment provides that the Court mav. if it think fit, fix a lower rate. The Minister of External Affairs talked of contradictions in terms in the Bill as it stands. But is there not a much bigger contradiction in terms in the amendment? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. At any rate there is a second alternative. In its award the Court cannot fix a lower rate for specific cases. That is the difference between the amendment and the Bill. The Bill says the Court has to appoint a tribunal which is to fix the lower rate when the case arises, but the amendment says that the Court is to fix a lower rate without, perhaps, having the circumstances of the individual cases before it. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the possibility. The Court is authorized to fix a lower rate than the minimum rate that is to apply in cases which are practically undefined, before it is aware of whether the circumstances will justify it or not. Is the Court to say that the- minimum rate is is., but that only iod. may be paid in the case of employe's who cannot earn the shilling. That makes the minimum rate iod., and not is. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill will not help them to apply. The Prime Minister means that the tribunal may be erected in industries in which no one will ever apply for permission to work at a lower rate. In that case the tribunal will certainly do no harm, if it does no good; but, by leaving the Bill as it stands, we make a public proclamation that we recognise that these cases may arise, and that wherever they arise the tribunal is available for them. It is not for the Court to say that, even although the course of business has been that these cases have not arisen up to the present, they will not arise. This is a kind of alteration which does no specific good, but gives a reason for dissatisfaction with the Bill, perhaps unjustifiably. It is an amendment which, at the very best, simply saves the creation of a tribunal occasionally when it is never going to act. There is no harm in having a tribunal which is never going to act. What do we lose in exchange for this problematical gain ? We lose a legislative declaration that we admit the cases of old and slow workers, and are determined to provide for them on all occasions when they can possibly arise. I would urge the Government to leave paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> as it stands. They have little to gain - it may not be that they have much to lose- but they have something to lose by taking away the compulsory character of the tribunal, because they give an opportunity to persons for saying that circumstances may arise in which, to almost quote the language of the Minister of External Affairs, these old and slow workers had better stay out of the industry, instead of trying to get work in it. </para>

                        <para>- I think if there is any indication of that fact it is in both provisions. But I do see the need of a provision such as both the clause and the amendment contain. One of the great difficulties about legislation such as we have had of late years - and some of it has been in some ways useful legislation - has been that the less fit have been going to the wall more and more every day. This legislation, however beneficial its objects may be, and even if in some cases its result is good, means that when the remuneration is fixed by law, only the man who can give a return for the remuneration will receive employment. </para>

                        <para>- It empowers the Court, if it thinks fit, to delegate that authority to some other body or tribunal, while the Bill itself simply says' that there shall be a tribunal in connexion with each trade. That tribunal, I suppose, would consist of persons interested in the trade - employers and employes - who would decide according to evidence brought before them, and who might give exemptions, such as is done under the Victorian system, to men to work for a lower wage. I do not like a multiplicity of tribunals, but I think it is better that the wages should be fixed by a tribunal which has been considering the trade from day to day, and is acquainted with new improvements and inventions, and is likely to keep its policy in line, and so provide against an inequality of decisions, rather than by a body, differently composed from time to time, and not following a certain line of decisions. I think that under these circumstances the provision in the Bill is better than' that in the amendment. Ministers even might see that. The option given to the Court is hardly ever likely to be exercised, but if we appoint some body to whom its powers are delegated, it is better that we should appoint a permanent body,, a body named for the purpose, though not necessarily paid, whose members would have the whole position of the trade before their eyes, and could, therefore, give much more equal and much fairer decisions than are to be expected from some occasional body to which the Court might choose to refer its decisions. I quite recognise, that the intention of the Prime Minister is a good one. He does not wish to have so many tribunals. </para>

                        <para>- The only object the Government had in proposing the amendment was to prevent the unnecessary duplication of tribunals. I do not consider that the clause, as it stands, can do harm, beyond providing conditions that are useless. The mere fact of compelling the Court to erect a tribunal in respect to a dispute arising, say, in connexion with the shipping industry, would do no injury to the parties concerned, because they simply would not take advantage of it, but it seems unwise to provide for the creation of bodies for which there will be no work, because of the conditions prevailing in the calling in connexion with which the dispute arises. </para>

                <para>One is contingent on the other, but I object to both, as they involve an infringement of the right of free choice on the part of either employers or employes, and they also involve a denial of the right of individual liberty. This is one of the most objectionable clauses in the Bill, because it distinctly attempts to set up one of the worst forms of class legislation, and to create an aristocracy of labour. I think it is sometimes a very good thing that workers of every description should band themselves together in organizations for the protection and advancement of their mutual interests. I have no objection to that, but I desire that perfect freedom of individual action on the part of every member of the community to take that course, if he or she thinks fit, shall be maintained. I object to anything in the nature of coercion or compulsion, and that is practically what these paragraphs amount to. I object entirely to the narrow interpretation of the term "labour" which seems to be generally accepted by the Labour Party as we find it constituted in the Federal Parliament. Notwithstanding all the professions of honorable members directly representing labour interests that they represent all classes of the community there is a tendency on their part to regard the term " labour " as applicable only to manual workers who are members of trades unions. The general purpose underlying this Bill is to endeavour, as far as is practicable, to induce both employers and employes to form some kind of recognised organizations. I do not object "to that, provided that freedom of action is the basic principle of our legislation. But when there is a disposition, such as is shown by this clause, to force people into certain lines of action, I think it right to point out that a tremendous amount of hostility is likely to be raised, not only against this clause, but against the Bill as a whole. Our honorable friends opposite would be just as anxious to avoid that as are the members of any other party represented in the Committee. I confess that I have no particular faith in the efficacy of legislation of this kind as a means of securing any permanent improvement in industrial conditions, but, having entered upon that legislation, we require to make it as perfect as we can, and we should try as far as possible to allay outside irritation. Unfortunately, .every attempt in this" direction is hailed by the Labour Party as hostility to the Bill. ' I may not have much faith in its efficacy ; <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am not hostile to it ; but I wish to give it a fair trial under the best conditions we can secure. Instead of the basic principle of this Bill, which should be conciliation, being kept in view all the time, there will be a disposition on the part of a great many people outside to look- upon the measure as designed to promote conflict rather than conciliation. I do not think it can be the desire of those who are anxious to see this measure in successful operation, that a feeling of this kind should be created outside. Yet it must be patent to anyone who will take the trouble to consider the matter even briefly, that a provision of this kind must necessarily at once raise a prejudice against the Bill in the minds of many people who might otherwise be favorably disposed towards it. They will very properly regard it as an attempt to legislate entirely in the interests of one class of workers occupying the position of a minority amongst the workers of the Commonwealth. On the one hand, there should be absolute freedom of choice to the employer to engage whomsoever he will, irrespective of whether the individual to be employed is a member of a union or not. On the other hand, there should be absolute freedom of choice to the employe' to accept service from any employer whether he is a member of a&gt; union or organization, or not. While I grant that facilities and reasonable inducements might very well be held out to both employers and employes, on the ground that it would be to their mutual interests to form organizations, I object to any attempt to force these people unwillingly, to become members of organizations, and! a preferential provision of this kind must have that effect. I should like to point out also that there is absolutely no necessity for such a provision. If the best employers, on the one hand, are the members of an organization, then the natural' tendency of those seeking employment will be to find it with those employers. If, on the other hand, employers find that the best employes are members of trades unions,' they will naturally give the preference to trades unionists, without any provision of this character in the Bill. They will do so for commercial reasons, because trades unionists will be the best men they can employ, and the men from whose work they can secure the best results. The natural tendency will be that all the best men will' endeavour to become members of these organizations. At present, as I have said,' trades unionists form but a small minority of the whole of the workers of the Commonwealth. I think that in New South-' Wales the total number of unionists is&gt; something under 67,000. No one will: contend for a moment that 67,000 persons represent anything like the whole, or even a very large proportion, of the total workers of that State. I have not the figures as to the actual number of workers in the Commonwealth; but it is certain that they cannot be estimated at less than ten times the number of those who are members of trades unions. This legislation, giving a preference to unionists, is therefore an attempt to exclude the great majority of the workers ot Australia. I am speaking on behalf of the workers of Australia who are not members of trades unions. Since they are undoubtedly in the majority, they should receive fair consideration, though I do not claim that they should receive more consideration than those who are members of unions. I believe in the principle of . equal liberty and justice ; and non-unionists, who constitute the vast majority of workers in Australia, have, at least, as much right to be considered as have members of unions. Neither this nor any other Legislature has any right to differentiate in a matter of this kind between one citizen and another. All persons, whether members of unions or not, should be equal in the eyes of the Legislature, and whatever arrangement may be made as between private individuals or organizations, there should be no attempt on the part of the Parliament to differentiate between one set of employes in an industry who are within the ranks of a union, and another set in the same industry consisting of men who are not. In support of my contention that the unionists are in a minority, I would call attention to some instructive figures compiled by the Victorian Actuary of Friendly Societies. They show that within the space of eleven years a great falling off took place in the membership and funds of unions in this State. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable member for his correction. The figures relate to registered trades unions, and it must be borne in mind that under this Bill unions will be registered. In 1890, there were seven registered unions in Victoria, having 139 branches, a membership of 49,600, and funds amounting to . £38,650. In 1901, eleven years later, there was the same number of registered unions, but the number of branches had fallen awav from 139 to. 36, a difference of 103 ; and the total member ship had fallen from 49,600 to 8,800, a difference of 40,800. </para>

                        <para>- No. They are registered trades unions. I do not say that these figures are accurate, but I give my authority for them, and quote them only by way of illustration. It will be for other honorable members to test them. It may be that some explanation can be given for the very large decrease which they show, and I shall be pleased to hear any explanation of the matter. The strongest registered union in Victoria is the Amalgamated Miners' Association - I presume that no one will say that that is a purely benefit or friendly society - and I find that while, approximately, the number of miners in Victoria is 30,000, there are only 8,276 in the union. Thus, if a preference is to be given to trades unionists, it will mean, in the case of the miners of Victoria, a preference to 8,276 as against 21,724. In view of the authority I have given for these figures, I presume that they may be accepted as correct, and that being so, they unmistakably prove that the majority of workers would derive no benefits from this Bill. They show, in fact, that we are asked to legislate in the interests of the minority. Members of the party, represented by the Ministry, have declaimed as loudly as any one against the injustice of minority representation, yet in this Bill they are proposing to legislate in the interests of the minority. I admit that the Bill was not drafted by the Government, but having adopted it, they are just as responsible for it as the original framers. The Bill was framed at a time when the Labour Party practically controlled the Ministry from the cross benches. </para>

                        <para>- I merely referred to it in reply to an interjection. I would draw attention to another matter which is patent to all, and to which Ave must not close our eyes. Whilst an attempt is being made in this Bill to give a preference to trades unionists, there is a disposition on the part of some unions to close their books against the enrolment of new members, and to make close corporations of trade societies. We must have regard to that fact. In view of the provision in this clause that a preference shall be given to unionists, an attempt is being made to limit the number of men who should be admitted into the ranks of the unions. This means that the great bulk of the workers will be deprived, under this Bill, of an opportunity to secure employment. What can be said of a Labour Government which aims at the practical exclusion of the great body of the workers from the benefits of a measure that is said to have been framed in the interests of the workers of all Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- It is a Bill which will create close corporations of unions of either employers or employes - a Bill, the benefits of which will extend to only a small section of the industrial workers of the Commonwealth. It would be little short of a criminal act against the great democracy of Australia if we passed it in its present form; and I for one shall most strenuously oppose every effort to do so. A circular issued by the secretary of the Federated Saw-mill and Timberyards Employes' Association to its members affords an interesting illustration, of the attempts that are being made to make close corporations of unions. ' I propose to read it in, order that honorable members may learn the underlying motive of this proposal.

                    <para>The matter of the refusal of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union to admit three waterside workers to membership was the subject of considerable interest when before the Arbitration Court to-day. The men refused admittance to the union were - then follow their names. </para>
                    <para>In an affidavit by the three workers, they severally said that they were willing to join the union, but were not able at the time to pay the entrance fee and annual subscription, which amounted to the sum of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per man. In February they together proceeded to the registered meeting-room of the union in St. Philip's Schoolroom, Church Hill, Sydney, having previously arranged with Charles Jackson, a financial member of the union, to propose their admission to membership, and arrange a seconder. They applied for admission, but were informed that they would not be able to join, and that the books were closed to the admission of any new members whatsoever. Holmes and Briggs attended several times at later meetings, to be told on each occasion that the books were closed. </para>
                    <para>The President of the Court pointed out that the Court had, of its own motion, asked the parlies to attend, in order to make any representation that they might wish. The condition of the award would require modifying to bring it into line with the conditions that had been laid down lately, and which allowed any person, provided he was sober, honest, and competent to be admitted to a union, on payment of a limited subscription and entrance fee, and without any method of election. He alluded to what he had said at the time the common award was made, and held that the action of the union had been autocratic and tyrannical in the extreme. </para>

                <para>Those are strong words, coming from the President of the Arbitration Court. I have quoted them as showing the tendency to make these unions close corporations, and to prove the necessity for this legislation guarding particularly against anything of that kind occurring. Later on I propose to submit an amendment by way of a new paragraph to clause 67, of which I gave notice some time ago, whereby any union which attempts to close its books wil 1 be excluded from the operation of the Bill.. That will cover an association on either side, because the same argument applies equally to employers and employes. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that. It is very necessary for us to safeguard the Bill, so that the interests of the great majority of the people will not be injuriously affected. I do not attribute to the Government for one moment a desire to make the unions close corporations, or to make this Bill apply only to certain sections of workers. But I am quite certain that the Bill in its present form, with these provisions included, will have those effects. I have always held that the term worker is very comprehensive, and embraces all those who are engaged either in mental or physical occupations. If this Bill is to be of any benefit at all it is necessary that the utmost facilities shall be provided for workers of every description, and for all kinds of employers to combine in some voluntary system of organization. But when we attempt coercive measures - and Bills of this description amount to coercion - we set up a form of obnoxious tyranny which invites the sternest and most hostile criticism from all sections' of the community who have any sense of right and justice. I appeal to the Government to consider this clause carefully. The omission of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> bv no means necessarily implies that preference will not be given to unionists, but will leave a free choice both to employers and employes either to give employment to those who are members of organizations, or to accept employment from members of organizations. It will not affect the general scope of the Bill, except in the one respect ; that it will abolish objectionable coercion whether it be intentional or otherwise. This coercive feature is one of the worst characteristics of the Bill, because it denies to a man the free choice of employment with any person for whom he wishes to work, or whom, in the case of an employer, he wishes to empiov. </para>

                        <para>- To provide against excluding persons. Practically the rules of unions have to be submitted to the Registrar, and to be of such a character as will permit of the entrance of any qualified person. It . is proposed in -clause 6,7 to insert a new paragraph, to provide that the registration of any organization may, under certain circumstances, be cancelled, and that the rules of a registered organization shall provide reasonable facilities for the admission of members. This provision, giving a preference to unionists, is of the very essence and nature of such a piece of legislation as this. First of all, let us consider the present position of unionists, and what this law proposes to do to them. As things exist to-day, a unionist may do any one of a number of things. He may decline to work with a non-unionist. This Bill takes that power from him. He may go on strike. This Bill takes that power from him. Henceforth he may neither go on strike nor decline to work with any person whom the award does not exclude. </para>

                        <para>- I say that he is prevented from going on strike. If the honorable and learned member thinks that question an answer to my assertion, I point out that the whole difference between unionism and individual effort is that a unionist does not go on strike by himself. If he did his action would have no effect. In addition to his going on strike, at the same time and by pre-arrangement ninety or 100 or 1,000 other persons refuse to work. We take away that right from them. They may no longer refuse to work in bodies. They previously had that right, and by means of that right they were frequently able to put themselves and their fellows in a better position. Sometimes, of course, they placed themselves in a worse position. Anyhow, they submitted everything to the arbitrament of the sword. Sometimes they were successful, and sometimes they were unsuccessful. But under this Bill they can no longer use this weapon. It is for the benefit of the public that it is taken from them. The public takes this sword from the hands of the unionist. It says - "You must not refuse to work with a non-unionist, and you must not go on strike." It also says to the employer, incidentally - "You must not lock out your men." The Bill takes away rights that certain people now have. The honorable member for Lang thinks that men are .parting with a portion of their liberty under this measure. He appears to agree with the unionists. of Great Britain and the unionists of America, who think that the surrender of the right to strike in return for such legislation is a mistake. But the unionists of Australia say that they are prepared to surrender that right in return for this Bill. </para>

The Court decided that the Act, which contained no specific words - no such clause as this - nevertheless gives power to the Court to give preference to unionists. Chief Justice Stout, in his judgment, said - . </para>

                </continue>
                <para>The industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1894, was passed to provide a means of settling labour disputes. . . . It is clear that all' disputes that may arise between employers and employes are not within the jurisdiction of the Court. The Court has jurisdiction over what is termed in the Act " "industrial-disputes.". . . . Individual employes - employes not belonging to any union or association - are excluded from the operations of the statute, and employers cannot bring before a board or the Court any dispute between them and their workmen if the workmen are not members of some union or association. If it be the case that there are several thousands of workmen who do not belong to any union or association, it will be seen that the statute has a limited application, for non-associated workmen have no status under this statute. . . . The question is, can the Court declare that non-associated workmen shall only be employed by employers if there are no workmen of equal ability and qualifications belonging to unions or associations - can the employers be compelled to give a preference to trades unionists " ? </para>
                <para>That was the point. Chief Justice Stout went on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Non-associated workmen have, as it has been said, no status in the Court of Arbitration. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Incidentally, here he decided that freedom of contract, as such, was absolutely ignored in the Bil] ; that this was a reversion to status, as opposed to contract, as undoubtedly it was. The Act concerns organizations, and neglects altogether persons outside organizations. This Bill provides for persons forming organizations; and I should like to point out that 100 persons may form an association. That is not very many over the whole of the Commonwealth. Chief Justice Stout went on - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In construing this Act, the aim of the statute cannot be ignored. It does not, as I have said, propose to provide a means of settling disputes . between the employers and non-associated workmen. . . . The Court has, in my opinion, power to give a preference to unionists, even though non-unionists are not heard by the Court, and not allowed to represent their case. The Court, as I have said, can control the privileges of employers, and can fix the status of workmen, or the class of persons that can be employed. Whether the Court can, or cannot, give a preference to workmen belonging to one union over workmen belonging to another union is not before us. If it were before us, I should think it was doubtful if such a power could be exercised by the Court. The learned Judge in the Court below pointed out that non-associated workmen could easily acquire the status of trades unionists. Five workmen, or five workwomen can form an industrial union. This Court has no control over the Court of Arbitration in matters within its jurisdiction. ..." Industrial matters," as defined in the statute, seem to me to include every kind of possible dispute that can arise between an employer and his workmen. AU contracts regarding labour are controlled, and may be modified or abrogated. The Court can. make the contract or agreement that is to exist between the workman and the employer. It abrogates the right of workmen and employers to make their own contracts. It, in effect, abolishes " contract!" and restores "status." The only way the Act can be rendered inoperative is by workmen not associating or not joining any union; for, as has been said, the statute cannot deal with unassociated workmen. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I shall not read the judgment at length, although it is very interesting. The three members of the Court unanimously upheld the judgment in almost similar terms; and it was then laid down clearly that, without this specific provision, the Court has power to give preference. It was incidentally held by the Judge of the Arbitration Court that he had power to give preference to one union Over another union. </para>

                        <para>- This was an appeal, and I do not know what was the cause of the dispute; it does not appear from the report of the case. Taylor and Oakley had been asked by a decision of the Court to give preference to certain unionists, and, declining to do so, they applied for a writ of prohibition, with the result I have described. </para>

                        <para>- This was not an industrial dispute. As I say. I do not know the cause of the original dispute, which, however, has nothing to do with the case. Inherent, then, in this class of legislation is the right to prefer unionists ; and if no preference is given, this Bill, instead of being a good thing for unionists, will be the worst in the world. It takes away the right to strike, and binds unionists hand and foot. Having taken the weapon of strikes away, we are asked to say to unionists - " You may go out and get a job, and if you are successful, well and good." It has been said that the unionists are in a minority in this country ; and, having deprived the compact minority of their weapons, we tell them to go and get work if they can, but that the majority will have a much better chance. Unionists according to my friend, are in a minority ; if they cannot strike, nor decline to work with the non-unionists, what earthly incentive will there be to join an association? Absolutely none, and since this Bill deals only with organizations, one of two things must follow from the achievement of such an object as the honorable member has in view. What union is going to Court to get an award if no benefit is to follow? If unionists are in a minority, what benefit can they get? And they are to get no preference. If an employer having been beaten in a case, is able to say, "Oh, very well, you got an award against me, but I will not employ any one of you ; that is the penalty for getting the award." unionists will decline to take advantage of such legislation, and it will become a dead letter. Unionists, as such, would, under those circumstances, be deprived of their right to strike, and would have no incentive to bring a case before the Court. The Court would say, "Very well, we give an award, but we do not give it to you; we give it to anybody the employer likes to employ, and do not even say that old employes must have the best right; we do not say that any one of 500 men employed by a firm must be preferred to any 500 strangers ; there is to be no preference of any kind." Injustice may be done just as readily by giving preference to men in one employ, and refusing to allow those men outside to have the same chance, as by giving a preference to non-unionists. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking about natural preference. An employer. I suppose, will always employ those who suit him best. The point is that we are erecting machinery for the purpose of doing certain things, and not one of those things can be taken advantage of unless organizations take advantage of them. If organizations see that there is no incentive to take advantage of the Act, because no benefit can be gained, the Act will become a dead letter. If a union can be penalized, what benefit will it gain by taking advantage of the law ? It would be infinitely better to incur all the penalties of the measure, or to leave the union and let the union go to ruin. If honorable members are bent on destroying unionism in the country, let them declare themselves to be enemies of trade unionism as such, and say that this Bill ought not to give any sort of benefit or preference to unionists - that is, not trades unionists, but industrial unionists. The Bill is based upon the .principle, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Stout pointed out in his judgment, of substituting for contracts between individual employers and employes, registered agreements between bodies of workmen and bodies of employers. It is now said that neither one nor the other ought to have a preference over unassociated men. If the preference, which is naturally in the Bill, is not destroyed but still inheres, all I have to say is that the striking out of the provision will be absolutely superfluous. In this measure we have over and over again inserted declaratory provisions, which by implication flow naturally, but nevertheless are rendered more certain and clear by being set down in so many words. That is often done in Bills, and has been done repeatedly in the Bill before us. In the New South Wales, New Zealand, and Western Australian Acts this provision is to be found. Since New Zealand, after an experience of five or six years, found that it was a desirable thing to put in that provision, that without preference the Act was but dry bones, and that until that judgment was given unionism was simply at a disadvantage, instead of at an advantage ; since, in all the Acts we have throughout Australia this provision is included, and since it is perfectly clear that the unionist, is denied under this measure the right to use the only weapon which is his, and by which he is able to get anything, we should at least confer on him those privileges which are contemplated, and one of them is that, other things being equal, he should have a preference over the non-unionist. How does that exclude the non-unionist? I utterly fail to see how it does. </para>

I would remind the honorable member for Wentworth that there is nothing improper in that, because it is contemplated by this Bill. I understand that he is against the Bill. But to those who believe in the spirit of the Bill, there is nothing improper in a man having an inducement tq join a union because it contemplates dealing with organizations. It will require an organization to put the measure in force. </para>

It is proposed by the amendment of the honorable member for Lang, to say to the organizations - "You are to have no sort of benefit. You are going to pay this penalty for putting the Act in force. As soon as you increase the wages of all the people in your trade, that moment you will kill your union." </para>

                        <para>- We have no control over the union rules so far as the internal government of the union is concerned, except that we can lay down conditions of labour. The Court may impose conditions which are opposed to union rules, and in that case the union rules would have to give way, but this is a matter in which we cannot interfere, as it regulates the internal constitution or the personnel of the union. We have no power in this case to allow the union to suspend the operation of its rules. It has nothing to do with anything now before us, or with the outside conditions of labour. It may be that, notwithstanding the rule, the executive may exercise a discretion, and say, " Notwithstanding our rules, we cannot see our way to accept any more members." That is my impression. I do not know that any one has a legal right to go to your union, and say, "Here are your rules; you must admit me." Therefore, it may be, the union might take the risk, and say, " We will close our books now for a month or six weeks." As a Court, we have no power to interfere in that particular matter on this application. </para>

                        <para>- The Court has been asked to make some suggestion with regard to giving the union a discretionary power in adding to its members. Speaking for myself, I think it would be a reasonable thing if the executive of the union did exercise some discretion over the admission of members to the union - that is, in the way of requiring any person who wishes to join the union to give some reasonable proof that he is a competent or efficient wharfman. Perhaps the union might make a rule with regard to this; and, if a question were to arise as to its validity, the Court could determine whether the rule was a reasonable one. The stevedores say that they cannot always get competent men. They have a reasonable ground for saying that if they are restricted to members of the union, the union should be in a position to provide them with a sufficient number of competent men. It seems to me that the union would, in some measure, enhance its reputation as a labouring body if it could give a reasonable assurance to those who sought labour from its ranks that any man who came from the union was efficient and fairly reliable. </para>

                    <para>I take it that the principal object is to prevent incompetent men from joining the union. If it were proposed to make a rule to say that on and after a certain date that there will be no more members admitted, that would exclude good men as well as bad. But, as I understand it, the intention is to exclude the undesirable men who are not physically fitted to do the work. </para>

                <para class="block">On the question of saying "We will not allow anybody to come in for a certain time," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cohen gives an opinion in reply to an application. I am not for a moment contending that under any circumstances a union ought not to exclude any but the incompetent. I should like to point out something which apparently is not to be found in that report, and that is - that although the Wharf Labourers' Union did exclude certain persons by closing its books, it included every one of the 11.000 labourers of the Federation of Waterside Workers throughout Australia, who, on a transfer card, could have come in, and the whole of the members of the Seamen's Union who are eligible to come in at any time. So that there was an ample supply of competent men ; and. further, I venture to say that, as regards the 3,500 members of the Wharf Labourers' Union, more or less, there is not work for more than 1,500, though I still say that they ought not to have closed their books. I have given,. I hope, sufficient reason to show that the union acted on the suggestion of the Judge. In my opinion, to take away from the unionists this right of preference is to take away from them that which this measure is designed to confer. At the same time, it will confer no privileges upon them. Having regard to what occurred in 1890, and it was in consequence of it that the provision relating to conciliation and arbitration was inserted in the Constitution, the man who can calmly contemplate the possibility of another such industrial conflict without a tremor, is indeed a stout-hearted citizen. But honorable members propose to take away the solitary motive for putting this measure when it becomes law into force. Every man can join a union if he likes. If a minority of the citizens of the Commonwealth are unionists how can they exclude the majority ? Each unionist can only do one man's work, and if he is not employed a non-unionist must be employed. Therefore, by the honorable member's reasoning, every non-unionist who is employed at the expense of the unionist does an injustice to the unionist by being employed. All we ask is that, all other things being equal, the unionists shall have a preference, and that entrance to a union shall be free, provided that competency can be shown. That condition ought to be insisted on. Unless employes are to be allowed to say, " We have men in our industrial union, and we will guarantee that they are competent men," what is the utility of having a union ? But competence, sobriety, and good character, which ought to distinguish citizens, whether unionists or non-unionists, ought to be a <inline font-style="italic">sine qua von</inline> of membership. That being the case, it is essential that we give preference to unionists. The Bill contemplates it, and it would be given without' any specific clause to that effect ; but, inasmuch as every other Act of the kind in Australia contains a similar provision in set terms, I see no reason why we should not adopt that now proposed. </para>

                    <para>- If I understand the arguments of the Minister of External Affairs correctly, he contends that the unionist is entitled to a monopoly of the labour market as the price of the privileges which he is asked to surrender under the Bill, those privileges being the right to refuse to work with a non-unionist, and the right to go out on strike. I am not aware; however, that the unionist has a monopoly of these privileges. The non-unionist may, if he chooses, refuse to work with a unionist, and, if he chooses, may go out on strike. He, too, is called upon to surrender both privileges under the Bill. I admit at once that, in my opinion, unionism has done a great deal for labour in Australia. Labour to-day owes to unionism a great many of the privileges which it enjoys, and, if my advice were asked by any working man as to whether he should or should not join a union, I would not hesitate to recommend him to join one if he could do so conveniently. But I regard this provision, which virtually compels all men to join unions, whether they do or do not think it wise to do so, as a serious infringement of the civil rights of the people, and unjust, oppressive, and tyrannical to the last degree. The people are asked to give up that which is dear to every free man, the right to exercise their free will in all matters affecting their individual interests exclusively. If this provision becomes law, it will shock a great many persons who still regard this Parliament as being what every Parliament should be, the guardian of the rights and privileges of the people. Parliament should be a body to which the weak, as well as the strong, may at all times look for justice. But what are we now asked to enact ? The provision virtually tells the people that if they are not prepared to join unions, even though they may have conscientious scruples against doing so, they must give up their present means of living, or leave the Commonwealth. What alternative has a man who is deprived of his means of living but to starve or leave the Commonwealth ? . If Parliament passes such a law, Australia will be a very good place to get away from, and certainly not a place for a free man to live in. Why should we compel a man in a matter of this kind to do that which he is not willing to do? </para>

                        <para>- We do not object to providing for all that in the Bill, but the honorable and learned gentleman asked what benefit the unionists will derive from the Bill if they are not given a preference over non-unionists. The benefit they will derive is this : If they are under-paid, or required to work unduly long hours, or labour under disabilities of any kind with which the Court will have power to deal, they may have their grievances redressed. Surely it is not just that, in addition, they should have a monopoly of the labour market, or that we should attempt to compel those who choose to remain outside unions, notwithstanding the disadvantages of that position, to become unionists. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed ' that we should induce them by taking away their means of living if they will- not otherwise do so. If a man, urged by this compulsion, joins a union the leaders of which are unduly aggressive, so that the union is mulcted in the maximum penalty of £1,000, will it be just to compel him to pay his share of the fine ? Or will Parliament come to his rescue, and pay the penalty? Not at all. It would be a glaring injustice to force any man into such a position. </para>

                        <para>- It is not necessary for me to labour this matter. My objection to the provision is a very strong one, and I have already stated it. I regard the provision as an infringement of the rights of the people. Parliament should not attempt to compel any section of the community in matters affecting their individual interests solely to do that which they are unwilling to do. This is one of the most unjust and tyrannical proposals which has yet been submitted to an Australian Parliament. </para>

                    <para>- I must thank the honorable member for Gippsland for his very honest admission of the benefits which unionism has given to the worker, as well as for the admission that - I was going to say with all his prejudices against unionism - he would yet advise the workers to become members of trades unions. Up to that point I am in agreement with him, but I wish that his acquaintance with unionism were practical rather than theoretical. If it were not merely a matter of theory we should have been spared his somewhat strong denunciation of this clause, which, he asserts, is. solely designed to compel non-unionists to become members of unions. That is not the object of the clause. I am prepared to hear the objections that have already been urged against the clause raised again and again before it has been finally passed, but they appear to me to rest more on a theoretical than a practical acquaintance with unions 'and their practices. We have had from the honorable member for Lang a. very pronounced statement in opposition to the provision, based entirely on the theoretical objection to interference with the liberty of the subject. He told us that if this clause became law it would restrict personal liberty. The answer to that statement is obvious. Every law we pass must be a restriction on personal liberty, and those who, like the honorable member, preach the doctrine of <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> seem to forget that they are voicing doctrines which were discredited half a century ago by the best thinkers of the age, and have, been discarded by every man who claims to be in touch with modern politico-economic thought. The . honorable member informed us also that an attempt was being made by compulsion - and I need hardly remind him that compulsion is the basis of all our laws - to secure benefits for unionists as against non-unionists. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block"> I emphatically deny that we are seeking to do anything of the kind. We are attempting by using the machinery of unions and by taking advantage of the efforts of unionists, to do something that will benefit not only unionists, but every person engaged in an industry. What is the use of saying that we are seeking to obtain some special benefit for a particular class, when we know that if this clause were passed it would apply to all persons, whether unionists or not. Those who have any knowledge of the matter will admit that in the States in which local Arbitration Acts are in operation, non-unionists have derived as much benefit from them as have unionists. If they are honest, they will also admit that non-unionists could not have secured the benefits of such legislation had not certain of their fellows organized themselves into unions, and made the passing of it possible. Objection was taken by the honorable member for Lang to a circular issued a few days ago by the Federated Sawmills and Timberyards' Association. The honorable member sought to make us believe that in view of the introduction of this Bill that association was bringing pressure to bear upon its members, as well as upon non-unionists engaged in the industry, to compel them to remain or to become members of the union. I fail to discover any connexion between the probable passing of this measure and the issue of that circular. As all who are familiar with the working of unions know, there are occasions when it is necessary for every_ union to use a whip of the kind referred to. Sometimes members' contributions fall into arrears ; sometimes men think that they have obtained billets for life, and no longer need the protection of a union - a mistake which they often prove to their cost - and these persons need a reminder of the benefits of unionism in order to bring them back to their old standard. So far as I can gather, the issue of this circular was intended to have that effect, and had no ulterior motive. The honorable member who quoted it did not seek to prove that there was any connexion between it and this Bill. We have also heard a good deal of an attempt on the part of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union to exclude certain persons from its ranks. I am as strongly opposed as is any one to any attempt on the part of a union to make itself a close corporation, and to exclude from its ranks those against whose competency nothing can be said. </para>

I have yet to be convinced that, even in the case of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union, there was not some objection that could be urged against the men who were excluded. Nothing to the contrary has yet been said, and it may transpire that the attempt to exclude the men in question was made after due inquiry, perhaps, by other unions. , Inquiries are often made by one union on behalf of another, and no objection is taken to the practice. , </para>

                        <para>- I do not admit that a union would put forward any financial objection. The union of which I am a member, for example, claims that membership shall be in the nature of a hall-mark - that it shall be some evidence of a man's qualifications as a tradesman. When a man is so provedly unskilled that he should not be allowed to join, we exclude him, not because we do not de-, sire him to become a unionist, but because his membership would lower the status of the union, and so injure all the members. No objection can be taken to the action of any union, and more particularly a union of craftsmen, that excludes men from membership on that ground. I assure those who have not a close acquaintance with unionism that there is no attempt to exclude men for the purpose of cornering a market. Even if unions were to resort to such a practice, they would simply imitate what is frequently done in commercial life. Workmen could not be blamed if they were sruilty of attempting to do in connexion with the labour market what is often done by importers and manufacturing and trading classes in respect to their businesses. ' Merchants and others attempt again and again to corner a market, and we know that they sometimes succeed. Some of them are ready to stoop to almost any practice to shut out competition, and yet we hear of no denunciation of the wickedness of such a system. As soon, however, as an attempt is made to exclude a man from a union, we have many honorable members holding up their hands in horror, and, regardless of what the reason may be, denouncing it as an effort on the part of unionists to establish close corporations, and to create an aristocracy or' labour. The Minister of Home Affairs has already referred to the case of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union. I would point out, however, that, apart from this Bill, they have at present the power to exclude persons from their ranks, and that this measure is really an attempt to provide a remedy. The clause, instead of having the effect suggested by the honorable member for Lang, would have the opposite result. We have an illustration in the very case he quoted. The union to which he referred sought, for some reason or other, to exclude certain men from its ranks, but the State Arbitration Court - a tribunal similar to that which we seek to provide for the whole Commonwealth - stepped in and said in effect - "You are now' seeking to do something' which, in our opinion, woul'd be unjust, and, therefore, we place a ban against your proposal." It will thus be seen that, even from the stand-point of those who object to the clause, the Bill would provide a remedy for the evil they suggest. It has been pointed out that one justification for the proposal to give the Court this power is that the unions, by accepting legislation of this kind, have given up the only weapon which they have hitherto been able to use in their own defence. I refer to the power to strike. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so sure of that. Speaking as a practical unionist, I doubt whether the benefits which unionists will receive from this measure, as well as from similar State laws, will wholly recoup them for the loss of the power to strike. There are many unions which today would prefer to resort to the old order of things - to stand in their own strength, and to fight their own battles, rather than to be made subject to a measure of this kind. Those who, like myself, take any prominent part in unions have found it difficult to persuade some of the unions that it is better that they should accept legislation of this kind than adhere to the old methods of industrial warfare. To those who are opposing this Bill I should like to say that we are not seeking, in advocating provisions of this kind, to do that which is likely to please our unions. We might be doing better from a personal point of view by championing the maintenance of 'the old condition of affairs. The unionists themselves are not enthusiastic in their demands for this legislation ; but they recognise, as we all do, that the old method of settling disputes by means of strikes re-acts, not. only upon themselves, but upon others who have no part in the dispute, and who are often innocent sufferers when industrial disputes occur. The action of a non-unionist, even under the present system, and in the absence of arbitration laws, frequently causes a good deal of bitterness and strife in our industrial life. ' We legislate for men as we find them, and we know from practical experience that there is a considerable number of persons, in all walks of life, prepared to take advantage of anything placed within their reach, no matter what it may have cost others, and who never subscribe a ' sixpence towards the cost of securing those benefits. Our unions have to bear the cost of their organization. The subscriptions are sometimes such as their members can ill afford. Then the passing of Conciliation and Arbitration Acts in some of the States has resulted in a painful surprise to the unions when they have discovered how much it costs to conduct a case. Frequently, as much as £200 or £300 of their funds have been swallowed up in bringing trivial disputes before the Court. This money comes out of the . pockets of men who, as a rule, earn small wages. When men make such sacrifices, not for their own benefit only, but for the common good, and after their money and energy have been sunk to avoid strife, or to settle disputes by more pacific means, it is somewhat mortifying to have others coming along who say - " We are going to - take all the benefit that you have been striving to attain, but we are not going to pay a sixpence towards the cost of securing it." It will be for the Court to say whether a preference shall be given to unionists. If the indirect result of giving a preference is to bring other men into the unions, does any honorable member say that they are being treated unjustly? I know that it is popular to get up and talk about " the liberty of the subject," but, as a matter of fact, we are always interfering with the liberty of the subject. Not only by means of the laws which we pass in Parliament, but in our social relations, very few of us, when it comes down to the last analysis of things, are allowed to do what we individually might wish to do. Even if the result of this legislation may be to compel men to rejoin unions, no great hardship will be done. In fact the balance of advantage will be altogether on the other side. Courts of Arbitration in Western Australia, New South Wales, and New Zealand have similar powers. If there were any abuse of those powers, I am sure we should have heard a great deal about it. But so far as I am aware there have been no serious complaints as to any of these Courts having stretched its powers in this direction. I speak subject to correction, but I do not know of any case in Western Australia where the Court has ordered a preference to be given to unionists. Indeed, the Court has rather inclined in the opposite direction. . Frequently there has been a feeling of soreness on the part of labour organizations when' they - have found that a mere handful of men outside their ranks have been allowed to ' flout them, and, while taking all the benefits which their efforts have secured, to remain outside the unions. There has been a good deal of bitterness that preference in these cases has not been given to unionists ; and it has been' demanded that the Western Australian Act shall be amended in the direction of giving the Court, not only power which can be exercised when it thinks fit, but a direction to say that under certain conditions preference shall be given to unionists. I do not know that Ave need advocate that here. Let us trust the Court. Our experience so far does not cause us to hesitate in that direction. We can trust the Court to exercise this power just as we trust the Court to exercise its judgment in reference to the common rule, and, in fact, in relation to every power that we shall confer upon it by passing this measure. I hope that the Committee will not be led aside by any theoretical objections to taking the facts as we find them in three States where similar legislation has been passed. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEAKIN</inline>(Ballarat).- I am unable to agree with that part of the argument of the Minister of External Affairs in which he pointed to this as a compensation to be granted to the employes for their surrender of the power to strike. As I understand this Bill, the compensatory sacrifice on the part of the employers is the power to lock out, and the surrender by them of that power balances the surrender by the employes of the power to strike. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that the employers would also disagree from an opposite stand-point. I am free to admit that the whole of this Bill exhibits, if it be carefully examined, a sort of vertebrate construction, in which every part on the one side is balanced by a similar part on the other. Employers and employes are treated with absolute equality, except in regard to this preference. Under this Bill there is a preference to employes, but not to employers, and I have yet to hear of any device by which it would be possible to grant the latter preference. It is the one thing in the Bill in which, so far as I can see, there is no balance by a concession on the other side. Honorable members, in the course of the discussion, have spoken continually of the preference to unionists. There is no power to give a preference to unionists under this Bill. There is a power to give preference to members of organizations, who in the case of employes will no doubt generally, if not always, be unionists. But it is not a condition precedent that a member of an organization should necessarily be a member of a union. The measure may be applied to those unionists who are members of organizations, or to those non-unionists who may choose to join organizations. </para>

                        <para>- It is used in a misleading side-note, but side-notes are not a part of an Act, and this one will no doubt be corrected later. The honorable member for Lang has called attention to one important set of considerations, which most of us have had in our minds, with regard to this matter of preference. The organizations, it is pointed out, might be constituted into close corporations, and, if so, the effect of the Bill would be to create monopolies. Against this there has been a very general sentiment which has been expressed on the other side of the chamber, as well as by honorable members on this side. Indeed, at an earlier hour this afternoon the Prime Minister supplied me with a draft suggestion of his for a new paragraph, to be introduced in clause 67, in order to meet this very difficulty. In this proposed new paragraph the Registrar is given power to cancel the registration of an organization on several grounds, so that it would cease to have any of the privileges and powers of an organization under this measure. The clause itself provides, as I think, and as he thinks, an ample remedy in this regard, but in order to make it perfectly plain that no advantage is intended to be taken, by the creation of these organizations, to permit of their being turned into industrial monopolies, the Prime Minister was prepared to propose a new provision which would give the power of cancelling an organization to the Registrar if the rules of the registered organization did not provide reasonable facilities for the admission of members. The Court would decide what were reasonable opportunities. It seems to me that if we went so far we ought to set out at length the various points on which the Court, as well as the Registrar, would require to be satisfied, and on which the Registrar would act if not satisfied. Finally, after an addition was made to the proposal by the honorable and learned member for Indi, I have here the complete provision, which I will venture to read to the Committee. The new proposal, which would be paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c1</inline> to clause 67, confers upon the Registrar the power to cancel the registration of any organization if its rules do not provide - </para>

                <para>It seems to me that these powers are already included in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 67, but this provision sets out in plain language what is the intention. It is that an organization under the Bill shall be an open corporation - open to every member who is reasonably able to prove his competence to enter it ; and that a means shall not be given of favouring one part of the organization against another. By extending the existing power conferred by the clause, we should remove the apprehensions of the honorable member foi Lang, and those who have been following the same line of argument. </para>

I have admitted that the proposal now before the Committee is one which, so far as I can see, is not counterbalanced by- any new privilege to the employers. But, with that exception, may I point . out to the critics of the clause that it is, as they are no doubt aware, optional ; that is to say, it is a new power, a special power, a novel power, and an important power, conferred upon the Court. But the power is to be exercised by the Court only in its judgment. In the Bill no clue whatever is furnished to the Court as to the grounds on which it is to exercise or refuse to exercise the power. The only indication to be found is in the one general provision that the Court is to decide according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case. It will take a good deal of consideration and some argument to find in that very general authorization any particular grounds on which the Court may feel called on to exercise this power. The Court has authority to give preference, and it will only give it when it feels called on to do so by considerations of equity, good conscience, and the substantial merits of the case. </para>

But, irrespective of that, in New Zealand and elsewhere preferences have been granted by the Courts after having examined the circumstances and satisfied themselves that the exercise of the power was necessary before there could be a settlement of a dispute. </para>

                        <para>- It would make the clause meaningless. In line 15 there are the words, "The Court by its award may," and then we come to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b; "</inline> direct that, as between members of organizations of employers or employes and other persons...... preference shall be given." If the Court " may " exercise its choice, and all it may say is that preference may be given, that would give the employer a power which he has now, and which he may or may not choose to exercise. My object in rising was to point out that probably by an amendment in clause 67 we can meet some of the objections which have been raised <inline font-style="italic">to this</inline> proposal. For the rest, it requires to be remembered that this is simply a power of the Court, which will be exercised when equity and good conscience demand. </para>

                        <para>- I am now replying to the honorable member for Gippsland, who said that this provision was an infringement of the rights of the people. The honorable member either believes in the Bill or opposes it ; but he and all others who voted for the introductory clauses, supported it as a measure for the prevention of locks-out and industrial disputes. When they voted for these earlier clauses they took away from the employer the right to lock out his men, and from the men the right to strike. That was an infringement of rights ; and that is my answer to the honorable member for Gippsland, who, after speaking rather kindly of trades unions, damned them very severely. The honorable member deprecated forcing men to join any organization, and on that declaration he may be taken to be opposed to the Bill, although at the earlier stages he led us to believe by his kindly references to trades unions, that he was in favour of the measure. The honorable member said that he always induced people to join trades unions, to which, in his opinion, labour owed a great deal ; so that, in any case, the clause only " forces " men into organizations from which, according to the honorable member, they have received much benefit. My experience of trades unions in New South Wales leads me to- the conclusion that they were never particularly favorable to legislation of this kind ; at any rate, that is so in the case of the more powerful trades unions. To hear some honorable members talk one would think that this was legislation presented by trades unions for the acceptance of Parliament. I have been associated with members of trades unions from childhood to manhood, and I say openly before the Committee and the country, that if I were a mechanic I should join a union, as my children will do if they follow industrial pursuits. Fears are expressed about free labourers being forced into trades unions ; but I may tell honorable members that trades unions have suffered more under legislation of this kind than perhaps many people are aware. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, which is the most powerful in the world, opposes arbitration in Great Britain and opposed it in New South Wales. It is not to the interests of such a union to have legislation of this kind, but in New South Wales the engineers, in the interests of the citizens of the Commonwealth, agreed to support a measure which had for its object the prevention of the evils of strikes. I know personally that there was the greatest struggle to get some of the powerful unions to take advantage of the Act in New South Wales. The Shipwrights' Union, which is not numerically the strongest in Australia, but is financially the most powerful, having the largest provident fund of any union, was absolutely opposed to compulsory conciliation and arbitration ; and it was only on the representation of the smaller unions that the members consented to come within the operation of the measure. Members of those' powerful unions say, openly, that their great surrender was that of the power to strike, and to refuse to work with non-unionists ; but that surrender made for industrial peace in the community. Honorable members who vote for no preference to unions, will, knowingly or unknowingly, give a death-blow to trades unionism in Australia ; and it is just as well that that should be said plainly. If the Government allow this provision to be struck out, they will strike the most deadly blow that trades unionism has received in Australia ; and I see no necessity to disguise the position. The Minister of External Affairs, in his present responsible position, was not prepared to speak so clearly as I have, but he hinted at the possible result. The time is past for hints. If this provision be struck out, no union of any power will desire to come within the operation of the Bill. Powerful unions surrender a lot in the common interests of the public ; and if they are to receive nothing in return, the result will be as I have stated. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat says that this Bill does not mean trades unionism ; but the very objects of the Bill, as set out in subclause 6 of clause 2 - for which honorable members who oppose this provision voted - is to " facilitate and encourage the organization of representative bodies of employers and employes," and " the submission of industrial disputes to the Court by organizations," and to permit representative bodies of employers and employes to be declared " organizations for the purposes of this Act." The very meaning of the Bill is that there shall be organizations of masters and of men. We are now told, at this late stage, that to give preference' to unions is wrong, harmful, oppressive, and tyrannical. Those are a few of the choice epithets which have been applied to this provision. If they intend to allow the free labourers to come in and receive the same treatment as the unionists, the Bill will be a mockery, because no man can conceive of an individual employe, or of a disintegrated number of employes, having a strike. In the past strikes have only been possible in those cases where there has been an organization. They have tried to obtain by force that which this measure proposes to enable organizations to obtain by peace. Honorable members practically say that the Bill proposes to keep out the free labourer; that he will not be able to obtain the benefits of the legislation unless he joins a union. I am glad that the Prime Minister has intimated that clause 67 will provide that a union shall not be a close corporation. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that question directly. Suppose that the Wharf Labourers' Union of New' South Wales - another powerful organization, which in the early stages disliked the idea of an Arbitration Act - did close its doors, and resorted to the practice which was adopted in 1892. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of wharf labourers in and around my electorate who would acknowledge that that would be absolutely wrong. In that year they foolishly put up the price of admission to <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> and limited their number. That would be manifestly unfair and unjust, and I can quite understand honorable members opposing such a thing, as I would. But the Prime Minister has intimated that he will provide in clause 67 for the doors of every union to be left wide open to labour. The only real necessity is that free labourers shall enter an organization, and that, for the benefits which it obtains for them, they shall give a helping hand in return. In reply to the recent interjection by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, I may say that for many years I have had a close acquaintance with trades unions, without belonging to them. As regards the Engineers', Shipwrights', Seamen's, and Wharf Labourers' Unions, I know the members of their executives pretty well. The majority of these men are not to be carried away by a sentiment. Most of those whom I know come from the hardy Scotch race, and in the conduct of their affairs they are just as careful of their freedom as we are of ours. It cannot be disputed that the benefits conferred by trades unions far transcend any abuses which can be cited by some persons. The conditions of employes - their rales of wages and hours of labour - have been raised to their present standard by the very efforts of trades unions, .and the free labourers who have been spoken of so kindly here to-night -are those who have benefited for years by the very efforts of organized labour. We are now told that the Bill proposes to shut out the free labourer and give a preference to the members of organizations. If trades unionists are prepared to surrender their interests and all the powers they possess to the control of a Court, in the common interest of the public, it is no great privilege to them to receive a preference as against .a free labourer. I cannot understand any believer in trades unionism opposing the proposal. A number of men do not belong to trades unions, not because they dislike . such organizations, but because they dislike to pay the entrance and subscription fees. I know hundreds of men who have enjoyed the benefits of trades unionism, who would refuse to subscribe to the funds of an organization which obtained from the Arbitration Court an award under which they must benefit. To destroy the principle of trades unionism would be to put back the clock 250 years. Even in England powerful trades unions, which were originally opposed to the idea of arbitration, every year are coming closer and closer to the principle. They are powerful in both numbers and funds, but they recognise that there are smaller organizations of labour, such as the Tailoresses' Union, which have not the same means to protect themselves. They are willing to make a sacrifice in the interests of the weaker unions. Is it fair to say that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is an infringement of the freedom of the . people, when it simply says that, other things being equal, a preference shall be given to the members of the organizations who have brought the matter before the Court? Surely the Committee does not desire that free labourers shall be placed on an equal basis with members of organizations ? The honorable and learned member for Ballarat prefers to describe these men as members of organizations ; but I do not like that euphonious term. An organization is a trades union. If any men organize for the purpose of trade, they form a trades union. They may not be called "trades unionists" under the Act, but to call them an organization does not make any difference to me. I cannot understand how honorable members, who have already voted in certain directions, can refuse ito support the Government on this clause. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KELLY</inline>(Wentworth). - It seems to me that the honorable member for Dalley rather confused the object of the Bill when he said that it was drawn up to encourage, trades unionism, instead of the procuring of industrial peace throughout the Common- wealth when a dispute extended beyond the boundary of any one State. I think that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat put his case very clearly when he differentiated between an organization constituted under the provisions of the Bill and a union, trade or otherwise, constituted in the old way.. There has been a good deal said about the natural right of trades unions to reap the principal benefits of this measure, since they will contribute a great deal to its administration. I do not know that- the arguments advanced in that regard have been particularly strong. We have been told that members of trades unions have surrendered the power to strike in order to come within the provisions of the Bill ; but we have not been told on what hope that surrender is based. . Every one knows that the chief inducement which was given to the trades unionists was that by coming within the provisions of the Bill rates of wages would be increased, hours of employment decreased, and conditions generally alleviated in a way that no power to strike could ever obtain. When we see how the surrender of the power to strike has been brought about, I think we cannot but feel that the trades unions have rather mistakenly made that surrender ; and it is quite possible that they may yet cry out for a reversion to the old order of things. We are also told that the employers have surrendered the power to lock out. I think it will be generally admitted that no such surrender has taken place. If one looks around the Commonwealth to-day he will hardly find one employer in ten who has surrendered that power. They are all crying out against its confiscation. </para>

                        <para>- I shall get down presently to the view of the public, who only want industrial peace. The power of the employer to lock out has not been surrendered, but has been taken away. If it can be taken away without infringing the liberty of people, I do not object. I am not objecting from the point of view of the employer so much as contending that the trades unionist has surrendered the power to strike under a complete misapprehension. Honorable members, who outside are inclined to uphold this principle as one which will better all the conditions of labour in a wonderful way, in this chamber simply refer to it as a means for the settlement of disputes, and for gaining what is euphemistically termed a " fair thing." I would heartily support the grant of a preference to the members of organizations, if they were so constituted to facilitate the easy working of the measure. I do not think that the organizations in New South Wales have been drawn up for that purpose. In that State the old unions have been the first to apply to the Court for registration. The old unions have not, until compelled in one or two isolated instances, surrendered their power to make rules and provisions relating to matters quite outside the Act. These organizations have had exclusive rules in a number of cases, one of which was settled only yesterday. If the Court could grant a constitution to a union, and an organization were formed on that plan, I would strongly support a proposal to grant a preference to the members of that body, because I am convinced that the bringing in of all men into these organizations would facilitate, in such circumstances, the working of the Act. But I hold that these unions have rules which may be and are obnoxious in a number of instances to men who do not wish to join their ranks. If we enact this preference we shall compel those men, at the peril of their livelihood, to join the organizations. It is all very well to urge that these men may go to the Court and say that they cannot conveniently belong to a union. But do honorable members believe that the average working man understands the. technicalities of an Act of Parliament? Do they believe that the average working man will know sufficient about the arbitration principle to realize that he can go to the Court and ask for an injunction against a union having certain rules? Can he, in the first place, afford to take such an action? I hold that this preference practically compels every non-unionist to join a union, on peril of his livelihood if he does not do so. A union, moreover, is, under this Bill, not necessarily an organization, having a uniform constitution. It may be an established trade union, whose rules may be obnoxious to him. </para>

                        <para>- In one case in New South Wales it was not discovered by the Registrar that such rules existed, although their existence was notorious to all persons connected with the union. The section of the New South Wales Act on which the members of the Machine Shearers' Union relied to protect their registration was that which requires men to belong to a union, if such union is one to which they can conveniently belong, or words to that effect ; but the union in question had to be formed, and a case contested in the Court, before the fact could be established. That instance strengthens my contention that an individual employe who is not a member of a union will have little opportunity to ventilate his grievances, and will have to take the consequences of joining a union whose rules may be obnoxious to him on principle. </para>

                        <para>- Not so far, perhaps, as it should. This is a vital principle, affecting the liberties of a great number of men who do not belong to the unions. But there is another phase of the amendment which I propose to place before honorable members. Anything that tends to encourage genuine trade unionism, anything that has for its object the gaining of fair terms for employes and the prevention of sweating, is an excellent thing ; but there is another form of unionism of much later growth than genuine trade unionism, which makes for industrial warfare, not for industrial peace, although the latter is the key-note of the Bill. This new unionism I term militant unionism. One of the few militant unions in New South Wales has since the institution of the State Arbitration Court furnished the most flagrant act of defiance to the principles of arbitration by practically striking, and refusing to submit its case to the Court. This militant unionism supplies the chief political support of my honorable friends on the Ministerial benches. The provision in the Bill is also in the New South Wales Act. </para>

                <para class="block">For all practical purposes the provisions are the same. Has the section which I have read made for industrial peace? Has it made for the consideration of the claims of non-unionists ? Certainly not. I will read a few of the awards made by the New South Wales Court. The first to which I shall refer is that given on the 24th December, 1903, in the case of the Hotel, Club, Restaurant, and Caterers' Employees Union against the Employers' Association of the same kind. That award provides that the claimant union shall keep an employment book, in which shall be entered the names and addresses of its members, and the classes of work for which they are qualified, and upon notification the secretary shall use every endeavour to supply the employers with servants. Honorable members will see that the patronage incidental to the providing of work is thereby given to the union secretary, who thus acquires by Statute an influence which he should in no way possess. Another award of much the same nature was given on the 20th February, 1903, in a dispute in which the Tailoresses' Union was concerned. It requires all employers who are in want of labour to apply in the first instance to the secretary of the Tailoresses' Union, but should the secretary not provide an employe, the employer may go elsewhere. </para>

I hope that when honorable members realize exactly how the preference section in the New South Wales Act has operated; when they remember that the first object of this Bill is industrial peace, while a subsidiary one is the encouragement of organizations - when they remember that a trades union is not necessarily an organization, and that the trades unions which have formed themselves into organizations in New South Wales have not conduced to industrial peace- they will join with those of us who think that trades unionism, as opposed to industrial organizations, should not be benefited by a preference of which it has not shown itself to be worthy, and recognise that it has been proved to be liable to abuse, even to the extent of the sacrifice of the individual and personal' liberty of the great mass of the employes. </para>

                    <para>- The question that we have to discuss is whether by law unionists should enjoy a preference. A good deal has been said in favour of the Government proposal, on the ground that unions have to defend all labour. I should certainly not have so much objection to it if the organizations were to be. kept entirely free from all. political matters. There can be no doubt, however, that these organizations are used for political purposes, and when we are passing a Bill that will authorize a Court to fix awards which will govern the men engaged in the great bulk of the industries of Australia, we should take care to provide that these organizations shall be free from any political taint. I recognise that the intention is that they shall. not have any political influence, but the awards given under the New South Wales Act have developed their political proclivities, and, to a large extent, placed them under the control of men who are fighting political battles. When the Australian Workers' Union applied for registration its application was opposed by the Machine Shearers' Union, and was refused on the ground that some of its rules were of a political character. It was proposed under the rules to punish a man who dared to vote against any man selected by the union. </para>

                        <para>- We are all aware of the pressure which is brought to bear on unionists, and that the intention is that these organizations shall be political unions. In the course of a discussion with the Acting Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for North Sydney, the suggestion was made that if we provided that every man employed in an industry should become a member of a union, and that the employer should collect his subscriptions and hand them to the registrar, who would thus have sole control of the unions, there would be no objection to the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I am not putting it forward as a brilliant suggestion, but as a proposal that was made in the course of a private conversation. We should surround these organizations with every safeguard! against the intrusion of political matters. The Minister of External Affairs said that under the Bill the unionist gave up his right to go on strike, and to refuse to work with non-unionists. That is a remarkable statement to make, in view of the fact that if this Bill were passed it would be unnecessary for a unionist to refuse to work with non-unionists, because no non-unionist would be able to work with a unionist ; a non-unionist would not be able to secure work until every unionist had been found employment. The very fact that under a New South Wales award an employer has to go to the Trades Hall to examine the list of unionists in order to find some one whom -he may employ suggests the exercise of political influence. It has been said that where two men are equally competent, and other things being equal, a unionist should be given the preference. The Judge will have to determine a man's competency. The Judge himself in one of his awards' stated that the Court has to decide whether a man is competent or not. How absurd it is that the Judge should have to state in Court - knowing- nothing about the men brought before him - whether a man is competent ! - Because a man happens to be a non-unionist, he would find himself probably put on one side by the Judge. </para>
