          <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. I was not present when the honorable member for Richmond spoke last week, and I have only just had an opportunity to read the report of his speech.

          <para>- I was not able to conclude my remarks on Friday last, but I intend to give an opportunity to honorable members opposite to come forward to-day in justification of their action in changing their attitude towards the policy of the Labour Party. It is to be regretted that the honorable member for Hume has given notice of a motion relating to preferential trade, because it curtails the scope of this debate. When the honorable member for Bland gave notice of his motion of want of confidence, it occurred to me that a very wide field had been opened for an attack upon the Government; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has ruled that, as the honorable member for Hume has placed on the business-paper notice of his intention to move a motion relating to preferential trade, no extensive reference can be made to the subject. </para>

          <para>- I am bound to administer the Standing Orders as they are, and they absolutely prohibit the anticipation of a debate upon a motion set down for a later day. As there is upon the business-paper a notice of motion in the name of the honorable member for Hume relating to preferential trade, I cannot permit the discussion on that subject now. I can allow, have so far allowed; and propose, if it be the will of the House, to continue to allow any necessary discussion of the attitude of the Government, of the Opposition, or of any section of the House in regard to preferential trade, though I must not, and shall not, permit any discussion of preferential trade in the abstract. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> is the correct one. The effect of the honorable member's notice is to prevent the discussion of proposals for preferential trade ; but, as the subject is mentioned in the programme of the alliance between the Labour Party and the Isaacs section of the protectionists, I presume a passing reference may be made to it by me. It is very clear that what the members of the alliance have in view in this regard is the establishment of higher protective duties than we have now. I have been interested in ascertaining to what extent the honorable and learned member for Indi would go in that direction ; but I am inclined to think that he would not go much further than this Parliament has already gone, because it is on record - and these remarks were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 13th September last - that he said some considerable time ago- </para>

            <para>- It. will be seen that the words which I am about to quote have a full sense in themselves. Although the honorable and learned member for Indi may have explained that the people of Victoria were heavily taxed at the time he made this speech, that does not affect the meaning of what he said. The people of the Commonwealth are heavily taxed at the present time. The remarks of the honorable and learned member showed that he is not the rabid protectionist which some honorable members opposite would have us to believe him to be, and that he knows the effect of high protective duties. He said - </para>

            <para>- A similar state of affairs exists in England. A great deal has been said there upon the subject of preferential trade, and it has been urged that, whilst Australia may be prepared to tax its own people, it must not impose further burdens upon the workers of Great Britain, nor should new industries be established in the Colonies. A cable message, published in this morning's newspapers informs us that - </para>

He would not do anything that would assist to provide employment for the operatives of Stepney or other places in England, where distress is unprecedented. Some of the advocates of protection say that we could give a preference to England by increasing our duties against the foreigner. What relief would that provide if the duties are already prohibitory ? </para><interjection>

            <para>- Yes, because we are quite free to alter the Tariff as we think fit. By giving Great Britain a preference in the way I have indicated we should assist the working classes of Australia by enabling them to obtain the goods they require at lower prices ; the cost of the raw material for manufactures would likewise be reduced, to better enable the colonial manufacturer to compete with imports. At Luton recently reference was made to the proposal to increase our Tariff, and in speaking to the producers of grain - Luton is an agricultural as well as a manufacturing district - the Honorable Joseph Chamberlain said that under the policy he advocated they would obtain higher prices for their products. He asked them, " Would you not come in under the umbrella " ? In other words, " Have you not sufficient intelligence to come in out of the wet?" The Duke of Bedford, a large landed proprietor, occupied the chair at the meeting. Honorable members may remember the remarks of John Bright with reference to the landed proprietors of Great Britain, who opposed the repeal of the Corn Laws, because they feared that' the dowries of their daughters would be affected by the lowering of their rents. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> appropriately asks the members of that class whether they have not sufficient intelligence to come in out of the wet, and embrace the monetary advantages offered. I am reminded of the agitation which took place in the forties, when every Liberal in Great Britain - I hear that the protectionists here call themselves Liberals - fought for the repeal' of the Corn Laws. The honorable member for Maranoa is evidently amused at the idea of a protectionist being called a Liberal. Earl Beaconsfield, the protectionist, was called a Conservative, and yet honorable members opposite claim to be Liberals. </para>

            <para>- I do not dispute the accuracy of the honorable member's statement, and therefore I appeal to him to extend no sympathy to an alliance which would take from the starving poor of England the only crust which they have an opportunity of getting After all, our output of grain is a mere bagatelle compared with the consumption which takes place in England. Although we appear to ignore it, it is a fact that the mother country produces one-half of the grain required for her own consumption. The principal part of the remainder is drawn from Canada. That country exports to England millions of quarters of grain annually, whereas we export only a small proportion of this import. A senator of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pulsford,</inline> in his book on <inline font-style="italic">Commerce and the Empire,</inline> shows very clearly what we should lose by giving effect to the alliance programme. We are an exporting country, and he has shown that our exports in wool, hides, sheepskins, wheat, tallow, and minerals, aggregate an annual value of £18,800,000. Of that volume of trade , £6,900,000 worth is re-exported from London, and of this sum £6,800,000 worth goes to the Continent, and we export from Australia to the Continent £10,200,000 worth of goods direct. I merely wish to make a few observations upon this aspect of the question, in order to show that, as the reexport trade from England to the Continent represents a value of £6,800,000, our trade with foreign countries is worth about £17,000,000. Yet the alliance proposes to increase the duties against the foreigner, so that he shall be unable to take this £17,000,000 worth of our staple products. How is the farmer and the miner in the country to progress, and our producers to thrive if we deprive them of the market of Europe which they at present possess? I have been impelled to address myself to this phase of the question by the remarks of the honorable member for </para>

        </continue><para class="block">Bourke, who dwelt upon the pernicious effect of trade with the foreigner. It seems to me that he did not know what he was talking about. If we wish to progress we must extend our markets. What is commerce!? Is not its very essence the exchange of goods for goods? If the foreigner takes ;£i 7,000,000 worth of our products, must we not accept ^17,000,000 worth of his goods in exchange? Otherwise, how shall we get paid for our products? The Labour Party claims to be in favour of education in order that the people may be better able to understand and to remedy existing conditions, but it seems to me1 that honorable members opposite are fooling themselves in favoring an alliance whose policy would certainly be destructive to the interests of Australia. Our landed property owners, small farmers, and producers, who number some thousands, would be most injuriously affected by the operation of such a policy, and the working classes would suffer more acutely than would any others. Do honorable members realize what a duty of 10 per cent, upon our trade with Great Britain means? Do we not import from that country goods in exchange for the products which we send there? Assuming that we annually export ^18,800,000 worth of staple products, have we not to accept goods of an equal value in return ? We receive from them articles from the secondary industries, whilst they accept our produce from the primary industries. </para><interjection>

            <para>- It is evident that they do not. The home trade of Great Britain in itself represents a value of something like ^900,000,000, and it is proposed to levy a duty upon her manufactures in order to find" employment for the people. " Will you not come in out of the wet?" asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain.</inline> That question was intended to apply to the manufacturers as well as to the landed property-owners. Ten per cent, upon ^900,000,000 represents ^90,000,000. Even assuming that only 5 per cent, of the duty was passed on to the consumers, that would mean that the working people of England would have to pay an additional ^45,000,000 annually, and the wage earners would- receive less of comforts by ^45,000,000 worth annually. Would not that money go into the pockets of the manufacturers? Consequently we can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamber</inline> lain saying, " Have you not sufficient intelligence to come in out of the wet?" Certainly they have been alert enough to do so in other parts, where they have contributed tens of thousands of pounds to prosecute the campaign which <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. Chamberlain</inline> has commenced. What does the alliance programme mean to the poor farmer? If the latter sends his products to England, and the price of manufactures is raised by 10 per cent., will he not receive 10 per cent, less in manufactures under the increased duty for our staple products, such as wheat and wool? Shall we not also get less for our minerals? Minerals , are the miners' wages. The more of the good things he can get for them, the higher will be the purchasing power of his wages. Instead of such a policy assisting the farmer and the miner, we shall be penalizing them as well as penalizing the unemployed of England. If the purchasing power of the people of the mother country is reduced by ^90,000,000 or ^45,000,000, will not manufactures be reduced to that extent in Great Britain? It seems to me that the whole, proposition is based upon a fallacy, or else honorable members opposite have not the best interests of the country at heart. If they thoroughly understood what they were talking about, they would have nothing more to do with the alliance. I believe that the Labour Party are liberal in instinct if not in method they would go to the full extent of monopolizing everything, and would divide the wealth of the community equally amongst the people. That ideal state of things is not likely to be realized in our time ; it belongs to the millennium. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Mann, who has devoted a great deal of attention to the labour movement, has taken upon himself to speak on behalf of the Labour Party in both the States and the Commonwealth Legislatures. He has clearly told them that he is not going to suffer any more vacillation on their part ; that they must come out and say boldly what they are. He declares that they are Socialists, and that they must stand and fight under the banner of Socialism, even if that banner be all red. </para>

It is a declaration that is not consistent with what he has said on the platform in other parts of Australia. Several honorable members opposite have declared themselves to be Socialists, but at the same time we find them allying themselves with the Isaacs section in the Opposition corner for the purpose of getting into power. As the honorable member for Perth has said, this would make it impossible for them to carryout their programme. It would mean that they would have to compromise. They must give the Opposition corner Party something and take something less than they desire for themselves. Therefore the honorable member for Perth says, " I will have none of this alliance." Yet he will not break away from the Labour Party. Notwithstanding the statement of the honorable member for Darling, who says that the members of the Labour Party can vote as they like upon a no-confidence motion the honorable member for Perth knows that it would be very unwise indeed for a labour man to break away from his party, however he might be convinced it was in the wrong.

          <para>The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has evidently seen some reference of mine to Socialism, and it is perfectly true that I believe there are some aspects of what is called Socialism which are absolutely worthy of approval. But I can draw a line, and the difference between the Socialism of honorable members opposite and the view I hold is shown when one of the best principles in the world- when the principle of using the national power for ends of national good - is pushed so far as to convert the whole nation into an army of civil servants. </para>

The Prime Minister has made a very clear statement of what he believes in. He says . that Socialism means - destroying the initiative, the ability, the prospects, the property, and the opportunities of human beings with their intellects - their varying degrees of mental strength. There are some public services, such as those performed by our post-offices, which, we are all agreed, should be a national concern. By the way, some people, including myself, used to look on State railways as another phase of Socialism, but, on closer inquiry, State railways are shown to be an absolute negation of Socialism. </para><para class="block">The right honorable gentleman has made his views upon the question very clear.

            <para>- Assassination is no part of Socialism, but it shows the extent to which these revolutionaries will go when they come forward, and declare that they were instrumental in having this Minister of State assassinated because he had persecuted some of the leaders of Socialism. There is a movement afoot to combat this agitation. It is very necessary that there should be an organization to cope with the evil, so that the people may know what they are voting for. I presume that the Labour Party will promote, rather than condemn, such an organization if they are really desirous of the people being conscious of the programme for which they are voting. The following resolution has been carried by on; of these bodies: - </para>

          <para>That, in the opinion of this meeting of delegates, it is desirable that each and all now assembled do unite with the Farmers', Propertyowners', and Producers' Association, thus forming a strong organization to oppose to the utmost all socialistic or aggressive legislation affecting country interests, and to uphold the rights of property-owners and producers of all kinds. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">The term " producers of all kinds " does not refer to the man of opulence, but to the farmer and the small settler. In New South Wales alone there are 110,000 small property-owners. The Labour Party would take the avocations of these men, and the fruits of their enterprise, and create a socialistic pool. They would throw these men on the resources of the State. According to their ideas, all persons should have the bare means of existence ; all men should be compelled to labour, but no man should have the incentive to provide for his family, because ultimately, when the socialistic policy is carried to its full length, the State will even take charge of the children and bring them up in an institution specially prepared for them. </para><interjection>

In all probability honorable members opposite know Karl Marx's work very well. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morris</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bax</inline> are gentlemen who have a reputation, and who are quoted by the leading men of Europe. Essays on this subject frequently contain quotations from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morris'</inline> writings. He is a prominent Socialist, and a man of great ability and keen insight, who speaks of the " socialistic movement militant," and the " socialistic movement triumphant." </para>

          <para>- After listening to the long tirade of the honorable member for Robertson, one would think that he has a socialistic bee in his bonnet, and that honorable members on this side of the Chamber, instead of being wishful to recognise their marriage tie, and to bring up their children properly, are desirous of running harems, leaving the maintenance of their children to the State. As a labour man, an Australian, and a Britisher, I say that nothing is more sacred to me than the marriage tie. I am sorry that I have not my wife with me now. The longer I lived with her, the! dearer she became to me. For the honorable member for Robertson to say that we do not believe in marriage is a gross libel upon the whole party. Before expressing my views on Socialism, however,' I wish to take to task the right honorable member for Swan, who took the trouble some' three weeks ago to read to the House the Federal labour platform. He said that he could see nothing wrong in it, but he' objected to the pledge by which we are bound. In explaining the' reason for that pledge, I ask honorable members to carry their minds back a few years. At one time men like the right honorable gentleman would visit the electorates of Western Queensland, and tell the people there that they would do almost anything for them if they were elected to Parliament. We took their advice, and elected them, and saw no more of them for three years. If we asked for anything to be done for the district, they would inform us that the matter was under consideration, and in many cases it is still under consideration. Then came the maritime strike, when those who displayed strong leanings towards unionism, or spoke in favour of unionistic principles, were dubbed faction fighters, gin-case orators, and labour agitators. But it was those men who did the pick and shovel work of the labour movement, and it is to their efforts in 1890 and 1891 that we owe our positions <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> these soft benches to-day. It is useless for honorable members to rave against the Labour Party, because we have come to stay. It does not matter whether there are three, four, or five parties in this House, the Labour Party is the only solid party in politics to-day. During the  1891  strike, in Queensland, Judge Harding, when sentencing the prisoners who were convicted as the result of what are known as the great conspiracy trials, at Rockhampton, asked, " Why do you take the law into your own hands? Why do you not seek redress through the ballotbox?" We took his advice, and immediately we began to return representatives direct from the ranks of labour. Every obstacle was placed in our way ; efforts were made to cram the rolls, in order to send representatives into Parliament who would be hostile to the aspirations of the workers. What has happened in the present case? An organization has sprung into existence to combat Socialism. We have had the same thing to contend against in Queensland for the past fourteen or fifteen years, and we have emerged from the struggle successfully, because, only a few weeks ago, half the members returned to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland were elected on the straight-out labour ticket. This is one of the straws which shows how the wind is blowing, and I am confident that when we secure a State franchise upon the basis of the Federal franchise, we shall return a majority of labour representatives to the Queensland Legislature. Several seats were lost at the last election by only a few votes. Now, I desire to say a few words with regard to the pledge which honorable members of the Labour Party in this House are required to sign. This pledge was drawn up at a conference of delegates of the whole of the district organizations, and reads as follows1: - </para>

            <para>- The fighting platform of the Federal Labour Party contains seven planks, and the right honorable member for Swan is in entire agreement with six of them. The first plank in the platform is "maintenance of a White Australia." The right honorable member believes in that. He also believes in the second plank - compulsory arbitration - because he introduced in Western Australia a Bill embodying that principle. From what I know of him I am sure that he would not have fathered such a measure unless he had believed that it was a good one. I have heard the right honorable member also state that he would vote in favour of old-age pensions - which constitutes the third plank in our platform - if he knew where to get the money necessary to provide for them. The nationalization of monopolies is the fourth plank in our platform, and that is the only one of which the right honorable gentleman does not approve. The fifth plank is " citizen defence force," and I am certain that the right honorable member believes in that, because times out of number he has told us so in this Chamber. The sixth plank is " restriction of public borrowing," and the right honorable gentleman is perfectly in accord with us upon that point, as he also is with regard to the seventh plank, having regard to the enactment of navigation laws. Thus he is prepared to go six miles with us, but refuses to accompany us over the seventh mile. </para>

            <para>- I did not quite catch the interjection of the honorable member for South Sydney, but I would point out that if we pledge ourselves as men, without taking an oath, we are just as much bound as is the right honorable member for Swan when he takes an oath as a Minister to the effect that he will not divulge Cabinet secrets. I hope that I have dealt sufficiently with the nature of the pledge signed by the members of the Labour Party in this House, and that we shall hear no more about signing away our liberties, or not daring to move one way or the other, except at the will of the caucus. Ever since I have been a member of the Labour Party I have exercised perfect freedom of speech and action upon every subject that has come up for discussion. I am sent here to represent my constituents, who have returned me by an overwhelming majority on two occasions. They . are quite satisfied with me, and so long as that is the case I do not care what any one else says or does. The right honorable member for Swan was left out of the present Cabinet, and no one was more sorry than I was. When the Prime Minister told the House that the two leading members of the Ministry were equal in all things, and that the best men had been selected by him, I wondered how it came to pass that the administrative abilities of the right honorable member for Swan were overlooked. He administered the affairs of Western Australia with credit to himself and to that State. Yet we find that the Postmaster-General is regarded as superior in administrative talent to the right honorable member. Reading between the lines, however, after perusing the files of some of the English newspapers, I have been, impelled to the conclusion that there was another reason for his exclusion from the Ministry. In the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Chronicle,</inline> of the 29th August last, I find the following cablegram : - </para>

            <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Chronicle</inline> of the 29th August of the present year. From another journal I learned that the right honorable member 'had actually written to some friends in London asking them to select a house for him there. Under these circumstances, I can readily understand why he was excluded from the Ministry. But, somehow or other, the plot failed. It did not come off, and consequently he is still a private member of this House. In his address the other evening, the honorable member for Melbourne read some extracts from the Western Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which made it appear that the right honorable member was in favour of lowering the age of consent in that State. I could not believe that he would be guilty of such conduct. </para>

As the honorable member for Melbourne was not permitted to proceed, it would not be fair to allow the honorable member for Maranoa to proceed. I must therefore ask him to confine his remarks to the question before the House. </para>

        <para>I think that comes with very bad grace from any newspaper, in view of the right honorable member's services to Western Australia. As far as I am concerned, I entertain nothing but friendly feelings towards him, and if we are called upon to vote for the selection of a High Commissioner, I shall willingly accord him my support. I consider that no man is better qualified for the office. I now wish to congratulate the Prime Minister upon his inclusion in the Ministry of a representative of Queensland. I am convinced that if it were not for the Labour Party, the machinations of the right honorable gentleman would result in the absorption of the smaller States. With the exception of Queensland, not one of those States is represented in the Government. It is all very well for him to declare that the most able men in the Ministry are representatives of Victoria and New South Wales. As far as the Queensland representative is concerned, I merely wish to observe that his acceptance of office, in the face of what the Prime Minister publicly said of him, is beneath contempt. At any rate, that is my feeling about the matter. As far as the coalition is concerned, I have nothing to say against it, but from my experience of coalitions in Queensland, I should say that they were generally rotten. Every word uttered by the honorable member for Brisbane, the other evening, in regard to the Queensland Coalition Government was perfectly true. There was nothing but corruption connected with that coalition from first to last. Singular as it may seem, that Government made use of exactly the same words as the Prime Minister has employed. He has declared that he lives to " down " Socialism. At various times, in the history of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Mcllwraith, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hugh</inline> Nelson, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Horace</inline> Tozer, and many other leading politicians, have laid themselves out, with money and organization, to "down" the Labour Party. But what is the position to-day? Even under the old franchise, which still obtains there, the Labour Party has been able to secure very nearly one-half of the representation in the Legislative Assembly. I am pleased that the Prime Minister has taken up his present position. He has occupied a "Yes-No" attitude towards the Labour Party for years. I look up to him as my leader in fiscalism, and I regard him as the staunchest and strongest free-trader in Australia to-day. But we have come to the parting of the ways. He has said that, altogether apart from fiscalism, he is opposed to the Labour Party. In passing, I may mention that the Political Labour League of Victoria has adopted a resolution disapproving of this alliance. By so doing it has allied itself with the Prime Minister, and little does it know it. As far as Queensland is concerned, that State will derive no benefit from the alliance. The only wail against the alliance comes from Victoria, notwithstanding that it was entered into upon the distinct understanding that it would benefit this State. Personally, I do not believe in alliances, or in coalitions. I claim that the Labour Party should stand or fall upon their own platform. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, the honorable member for Laanecoorie, and the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, have all informed the Government that they must not rely upon the stilt of anti-Socialism to keep them in power, because if they do it will prove to be a reed. My only fear of the present Prime Minister is prompted by his declaration of policy prior to the last general elections. At that time he affirmed that he would excise a certain section from the Postal Act. and alter the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act, in order to change the character of the legislation which was enacted by Parliament at the instance of the Barton and Deakin Governments. </para>

            <para>- Yes; the right honorable gentleman has declared that an arrangement was arrived at for a fiscal truce. But what did he say to the electors of Australia? He appealed to them to rally round the free-trade banner, and to fight till the death. Every free-trade candidate who went to the country at the last election did so with the idea of a fiscal revival fresh in his mind. I know that I did. I was not satisfied with the Tariff, and if the right honorable gentleman ,had tabled a motion adverse to the Deakin Government, I should have voted with him. In order to obtain possession of the Treasury benches, he has abandoned, not only his fiscal faith, but every other principle that he professes. By whose grace is he permitted to retain possession of those benches ? So far as he is concerned., it is not "Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> " - a phrase that the right, honorable gentleman coined - but "Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron.</inline> Will this suit you <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron"</inline> ? The honorable member for Wilmot entered this House, went up like a rocket, and came down like a stick. He has shot his bolt. He has told us that he holds the Ministry in the hollow of his hand, and that he can make six men happy and sixty-eight unhappy. Is it not a remarkable state of affairs that the right honorable member for East Sydney should be Prime Minister by the grace of one honorable member, and that honorable member half a lunatic? </para>

        <para class="block">I believe in endeavouring to leave the world a little better than I found it, if it be possible for me to do so, and every other member of the Labour Party' has the same object in view. I care not for that which may be said of us by such extremists as the honorable and learned member for Werriwa, and the honorable member for Robertson, who have so denounced us in this House. We go before the people, and the people know what we are. Let me give an illustration of this by quoting the remarks made by a resident of the district from which I come, when he was asked by my committee, whether he would vote for me. This gentleman is the holder of a selection of 60,000 acres, and when he was asked whether he would vote for me, he said, "Certainly. Why should I not vote for Jim Page. I have known him for thirty years as an honorable and honest fellow. He has got on in the world, and we want men of that kind to represent us." Another man came along and said to him, " Do you know what you are doing. You are voting not for Jim Page, but for Socialism." "Well," replied the selector, " God send Queensland a big dose of Socialism like that which Jim Page would give us." It is useless for honorable members to "blather" of" what the Labour Party would do. The people who know us, who have lived side by side with us, and are familiar with our daily lives know very well that we are not likely to go to the length of proposing any legislation calculated' to turn society upside down. We all know that it has taken hundreds and hundreds of years to build up the British Constitution, and it is idle for any one to imagine that the Labour Party could destroy it in twelve months. When the people review the history of Great Britain, and remember the stock from which we have sprung, they cannot possibly imagine that we 'are going to burst up the Empire in a solitary year. No sane man would believe such a thing, and such a suggestion is simply preposterous. The honorable member for Denison said in a patriarchal manner that he gave the Prime Minister every credit for his self-abnegation. That is more than the Prime Minister was prepared to do in the honorable member's own case. The right honorable gentleman said that the honorable member for Denison was a crooked friend, who deserved to lose his billet. The honorable member for Denison, who poses as a great Liberal said, in effect, the other day, " We Liberals looked' upon these labour men, when they came to Tasmania, as persons who desired to wreck the Constitution, and to turn society upside down We did not want any of them there, for the laws of the State were' already liberal." He proceeded to enumerate those laws which he had introduced into the State Legislature, and, in order to show what the Liberalism of the honorable member really is, I shall read an extract from the Electoral Bill which he introduced in the State Parliament, and succeeded in passing. </para>

I do not think I shall be our or order in dealing with the politics of the honorable member, seeing that he is a supporter of the Government. The honorable member says that the Labour Party are not Liberals, but form the Conservative element in the House. If, however, sir, you say that I must not deal with him, I am quite willing to pas's him by. </para>

I am quite satisfied with the liberalism of the honorable member for Denison - he takes it about with him in his carriage. We have only to look at the honorable gentleman to know that he is liberal - liberal to himself only, and not to the Commonwealth.

If a man is influenced by such a high ideal all I can say is he could not have a nobler one. The Free-trade Association of Victoria do not believe in coalition, but hold the opinion that the Free-trade Party should remain separate and distinct. They do not believe in a Ministry which is "equal in all things." How can the Government be " equal in all things " ? There is a divorce already impending. </para>

            <para>- Are they? If they are, it is only in name. As soon as ever they get a chance to do any good they " jump the hedge," and there is a "truce" at once. As a military man, my idea of a truce is a cessation of hostilities, not after a fight, but before a fight. The question of freetrade and protection was fought at the polls, and the free-traders to a man wanted the Tariff question re-opened. It is a new ethic in politics that the right honorable member for East Sydney here expounds. He said a few nights ago that he had given up the fight, because he had not a majority. In Great Britain, when a party is knocked out on one occasion, they do not cry, " Hold, enough ; we will have a truce." If ever there was a scramble for office in this or any other country, such a scramble was commenced palpably and earnestly by the right honorable member. He would sacrifice any body or any thing, so long as he could get to the Treasury benches. Fancy a man of the political calibre of the Prime Minister coming down to the House and practically trying to hoodwink his followers by telling them - " I have formed a Ministry; first of all, I tried the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, but he would not have anything to do with me. Then I tried the right honorable member for Balaclava, and he would not consent to form a Ministry with me. Then I tried the honorable member for Gippsland, and he did not mind taking on the job." The Prime Minister is merely Prime Minister in name. He has said in the House that the honorable member for Gippsland jb his better half. The protectionist half are undoubtedly the better half of the Government. The nominal Prime Minister has subordinated his free-trade principles to a scramble for office, and, as he said, to " down " the Labour Party. Speaking at Bowral, the right honorable member said, concerning the White Australia clause of the Post and Telegraph Act - </para>

Having all the privileges of the proverbial " funny man," he is a kind of pet throughout the Commonwealth, his only annoying habit being that of going to sleep, like the fat boy in Pickwick, on all possible occasions. He has a lofty scorn for ideals, and never had a policy. </para>

        <para class="block">As long as honorable members opposite are satisfied with a leader who is so described by an impartial journal, I am quite content that they should be led by him. But it is a peculiar thing that the Prime Minister has such a "set" on the Labour Party, considering his past relations with us. I will read what he said about the Labour Party in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> of the 23rd July, 1898.

          <para>So far as the Labour Party was concerned, although he was not a member of it, he regarded it as one of the greatest honours that had ever fallen to his lot in political life to know that the Labour Party found it consistent with their public principles to give him a loyal support. There were some gentlemen who sought the suffrages of the people, and who looked down upon other candidates because, forsooth, they "were only bricklayers or artisans, but speaking for himself he could say to that great meeting that he was proud of his connexion with the Labour Party. As an indication of his gratitude for the support of that party during the past four years, it would be noted that he had not allowed a single candidate to go into their electorates and wear his colours in opposition to them. </para>

The right honorable member for East Sydney was not referring to that honorable and learned member, because he knew he had him in his pocket, but to the men who represented men and women, not bricks and mortar, or cattle and sheep. The right honorable gentleman knew that he was speaking the truth then. What have we to gain?

What the right honorable gentleman cannot do by persuasion and cajolery he will try to achieve by funny tricks When T. say " funny tricks," I refer to those acrobatic performances to which the light honorable gentleman is so addicted. I desire further to say, before I leave this subject, that I have no personal bias against the Prime Minister. I look up to the right honorable gentleman as one of the leaders of men in Australian politics to-day. I was sorry, indeed, to hear it suggested that he was an unclean Prime Minister financially. If we consider the right honorable gentleman's record, and compare it with that of other Prime Ministers in Australia, we shall find that if he is not at the top, he is very near it. The right honorable gentleman loudly protested at Warragul and Kyneton that it was his intention to restore constitutional government, but if there ever was a travesty upon constitutional government, it was that which was enacted here the other night with such dramatic effect. To think that one man should hold the whole of the Commonwealth in the hollow of his hand, should delight in it, and tell this House that he was in that position, and that he could send us all to the country by his vote. That is the greatest travesty on constitutional government that I ever heard of, and I feel constrained to say that from this time out I shall advocate the Swiss system, in and out of Parliament, as far as I can. I find in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> an account of an interview with the honorable member for Wilmot.

        <para class="block">Honorable members have read a little yarn which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> about the honorable member meeting one of the press reporters outside, and asking him whether he could keep a secret. The honorable member is like all the rest of humankind, and he cannot keep a secret. It would have killed him if he had not told some one. We know that the honorable member was rushing in and out of the lavatory, and up and down the lobbies, with a wet towel round his head, and he had to tell some one his secret. He admits that just before he came into the! Chamber he did so. He is human, as are the rest of us. There was something gnawing at his vitals, and he had to confide in a newspaper reporter, above all men in the world. What have newspaper reporters to do with secrets ? They do not wish to have any secrets. It is their desire that the whole world should know what they know, and the honorable member for Wilmot went with his secret to the very man who he knew would tell his secret. The honorable member had subsequently to tell that he had done so; he could not keep even that secret. He has explained, according to the interview, that it was the action taken by the honorable and learned member for West Sydney that decided his vote. Every honorable member is aware that the honorable and learned member for West Sydney made his speech on the want of confidence motion on the first day on which it was debated, and the (honorable member for Wilmot threatened a dozen times that he would send us to the country, between that date and the day on which he spoke in the debate. The honorable member required some peg on which to hang his hat, but we know that the real reason for the decision to which the honorable member has come, is that his constituents were putting on the screw. It is all very well for the honorable member to say that we were! organized, and would sweep the poll. That is all "Mother Hubbard." It is all very well to tell people outside that kind of thing, but as old politicians we know that it is mere twaddle, and none of us believe! in it. The honorable member's excuse that it was the action of the honorable and learned member for West Sydney in connexion with the six potters case that decided him, is all " Monkey Soap " - " it won't wash clothes."

        <para class="block">That was very funny, and therefore his audience laughed. Our hale and hearty friend, the right honorable member for Swan, interjected - " You have returned the fire, too." What we are here for is to get the fire returned. What sort of a debate would this be if it were carried on by one side of the House. Let us have the fire returned by all means, and the hotter the better. The honorable gentleman went on to say - </para>

          <para>It was somewhat amusing to him, having spent nearly a quarter of a century in the place, when he remembered the work that had been done by the Legislature in Victoria - when he remembered the liberal franchise that had been conferred upon the people - to hear people, who were only the result of that work, who had come into operation only as a result of that liberal franchise, claiming to be its authors, and to be what were grandiloquently termed "advanced liberals." </para>

        <para class="block">If the honorable gentleman means that remark for the Labour Party, let me tell him in this House, where we have a chance of defending ourselves, not at a banquet of boodlers, where every word is applauded to the echo, as long as it is directed against the Labour Party, that he is making a great mistake. We are not advanced liberals, but extreme radicals, if that is any news to him. </para>

I recognise that if we, on this side, are to become the governing party, we cannot continue in haphazard fashion with regard to the fiscal question. I should like to see the Labour Party a free-trade party, and if they uphold the traditions of the Old Country, they will be the Liberal Party. Honorable members opposite, however, are, as the honorable member for Wilmot has said, liberal-conservative free-traders, or liberal-conservatives. They are just as divided as we are in regard to the fiscal question. If the Labour Party is to assume control of the Federation, it must adopt a fiscal policy, and, I hope, will adopt free-trade. If it adopts total prohibition, or total protection, I shall not be here; I am confident of that. But I am not such a hide-bound free-trader that if I saw industries languishing, which a little, or even a fair amount of protection would re vive, so that they would give employment to hundreds of thousands of men, I would vote to destroy them. </para>

            <para>- The only item in regard to which I went wrong was bananas, and I will tell honorable members how that came about. A protectionist member, the honorable member for starch - I mean the honorable member for Mernda - got up very late - I think at about 2 o'clock in the morning - and protested against the imposition of a duty on bananas, because it would put an end to a tri-weekly steamboat service which carried his products to Fiji. 1 thought that if he was ready to pit a tri-weekly service against the great State of Queensland, I would stick up for my State by voting for a duty on bananas. But what was the attitude of certain protectionists opposite in regard to the duty on glue pots ? We heard a great deal from the honorable member for Echuca, and others, about the industries of Victoria, but, according to their own showing, the manufacturers of this State, even after they have imported the iron, cannot manufacture a glue pot. The honorable member for Dalley satirized their contention by suggesting a duty of 5 per cent, for one leg, 10 per cent, for two legs, 15 per . cent, for three legs, and so on. His speech reads like part of a comic opera. Protectionist members opposite wished to put as high a duty as 30 per cent, on electrical machinery, which could not be manufactured here, and five minutes afterwards <inline font-style="italic">voted</inline> to admit glue pots free of duty. </para>

            <para>- I was not speaking about shutting out anything, but referred to the printing of the two reports side by side. I admit that the Victorian press is much fairer than that of Queensland. One honorable member remarked that the honorable and learned member for West Sydney craved for the support of the Sydney press, but I would tell him that the best advertisement the Labour Party get in Queensland is the opposition of the press. I do not want the newspapers to support me, because if they started praising me, the electors in my district would say, " Hullo ! What is up with Jim?" The platform of the Australian Women's National League contains three planks, two of which are " Purity of home life," and "Loyalty to the Throne." </para>

            <para>- I hope the day will never come when any labour man will find fault with those two planks. As I stated early in my speech, we have so much faith in the advantage of the marriage tie, and so much regard for the sanctity of home life, that: every member of the party is married. We believe in one! man one vote, one woman one vote, and one man one wife, and most of the members of our party have the best asset that any man can possess in the shape of a family. Although we are merely labourmen, we think as much of our wives and our children as do many people who are dressed in purple and fine linen. We believe in the marriage tie, and in the sanctity of the home, and every one of us is loyal, although opinions may differ amongst us as to the way in which our loyalty should be expressed. The third plank of the Australian Women's National League is "antiSocialism," and evidently the members of the association regard the labour members as monsters. I desire to tell honorable members a little story which I heard about three years ago. The honorable member for Denison was sitting in the gallery with some ladies, and one of them, a little more excited than the others, wanted to know where the labour men were. The honorable member pointed out several of them and then the lady asked, " Which is their </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Leader - which is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson?"</inline> The honorable member for Bland was sitting beside me, and turned round to speak to me. The lady then said, "Is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson?"</inline> The honorable member for Denison replied " Yes," and then she said, " Why, the labour men do not differ in any way from other members." I thought that very funny. We can behave ourselves as well as any other honorable members, and have done so, and we live as good and as clean lives as do other honorable members. I am proud to be called a labour man. Every member of our party pays his way, and does the best he can for his country, and I do not know that we could be better occupied. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Madden,</inline> the Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, prefaced his remarks by saying - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Although he was supposed, being Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, not to mix in party politics, he did not consider that he was in any way prevented from expressing his opinion on the objects of the National Women's League which dealt with Federal politics. </para>

        <para>That appears to me to be a particularly " cheeky " statement. The honorable member for Kooyong a few nights ago told us that the women would settle the difficulty now confronting us. No one tried harder than he did to prevent them from obtaining the franchise. Now, the members of the party to which he belongs are running after the women at all their tea-fights and bun-struggles in the hope that they may influence their votes. That is all that they are after. Good luck to them. The report proceeds - </para>

          <para>The vote must be carefully and fully organized, and while doing that the league might also organize for State politics, which were as important to us as Federal' politics were. While Socialists, anarchists, and those who wanted to wreck society were always organized. </para>

          <para>He was sorry to say that the people of the constitutional way of thinking were not so well organized as they ought to be. The world's great struggle was to contend with the wave of Socialism. The name " Socialism " was adopted because it was attractive, but really the system ought to be called anarchy. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Evidently he thinks that it is anarchy, because he can hear his own political death-knell sounding. He continues - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Once the Socialists took into their hands all lands, mines, machinery, and capital, and said, " We will administer them as we please," that was anarchy. A great deal of power had slipped out of our hands, and it must be regained with the assistance of the ladies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">When this class of politician is in trouble, to whom does he fly ? To the ladies. </para>
        <para>He urged the ladies present to join the league, and each become an advocate to stem the socialistic movement. </para>
        <para class="block">No doubt the people whom he was addressing believed every word that he uttered. But if the ladies wish to rope in the wives of the workers they must invite the labour representatives to address their meetings. They will then hear both sides of the question, and not merely that which has been presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and the right honorable member for Swan. One has merely to look at the names of those who attend these meetings to understand their character. </para>

The report in question is headed "Railway Coal Contracts," and " Disappointment in Gippsland," and reads as follows: - </para>
        <para>Korumburra, Monday. - A meeting was held in the Mechanics' Hall on Monday afternoon to consider the advisability of inducing the authorities to give more consideration to the Gippsland collieries in connexion with the railway coal contracts. Councillor G. W. Mitchell was voted to the chair, and there was a large attendance. The chairman stated that the Out trim Ho witt Company had been offered by the Railway Commissioners 10s. 4d. per ton for 30,000 tons of coal ; and the Coal Creek Company os. rod. per ton for 11,000 tons, the latter having offered to supply 25,000 tons at the old price - 12s. per ton. </para>
        <para class="block">In other words, they want 2s. 2d. per ton for their coal in excess of what the Government are prepared to give them. What do they call that ? The report continues - </para>

        <para>Outtrim, Monday. - Extreme disappointment is felt here at the result of the Railway Department coal tenders, and there is some probability that a public meeting will be convened, as in Korumburra, to offer a protest to the treatment meted out to the Victorian coal industry by the railway authorities. The opinion held locally is that the Railway Commissioners, instead of placing in a secondary position their consideration of the Victorian tenders should have dealt with them first, and should then have placed the residue of requirements in New South Wales hands. It is claimed that no coal supplied to the Victorian railways has been of equal quality to that now being turned out from the OuttrimHowitt colliery, and there is something akin to a feeling of bewilderment to know why this splendid fuel - leaving no ash, and burning with a strength and brightness that have been the subjects of favorable comments for months past - should have been discarded in favour of the product from Newcastle The position is an extremely serious one for the entire South Gippsland district, and, unless a sufficient quantity is soon assured to the local companies, the consequences must be disastrous, because the whole population of the district is, more or less, directly or indirectly, dependent on the profitable development of the pits. </para>

            <para>- I have. It is singular that, although honorable members opposite are so anxious to protect the non-unionist, and to forget the unionist, not one of them has made any reference to this case. In one column of this newspaper, we see a statement that certain men are anxious to secure the benefit of a little bit of Socialism, while in the next, it is said that the same men will have nothing to do with Socialism. What sort of a position is that to take up? These men must either be for or against Socialism. Their attitude savours too much of the " Yes-no-ism " of the Prime Minister. The honorable member for Bourke, in the early part of this session, and also in the last Parliament, submitted a motion in favour of the creation of a Federal Life Assurance Department, and I have a valuable piece of information on the subject to bring before him and the House generally. Under the Victorian Railways Act, the railway servants of the State are compelled to assure their lives, and, as the Department collects the premiums, the insurance companies have no difficulty whatever in obtaining them. I find that from the 1st February, 1884, until 18th September, 1903, no less a sum than . £295,058 10s. 2d. was paid by way of premiums by these employes. How much do honorable members think the insurance companies have paid in respect of the policies so issued? I think that the figures will constitute a staggerer, so far as some honorable members are concerned. During the period named, all that the companies paid away in respect of policies issued to the employes of the Department was £64,400, leaving a balance of £230,65s 10s. 2d. </para>

            <para>- To private enterprise. It was derived from Government servants, and in these circumstances, I fail to see why the Federal Government should not establish a State Department of Life Assurance. These figures speak volumes in favour of the establishment of such a Department, and I should advise the honorable member for Bourke to study them, as they furnish one of the best illustrations of the value of State Socialism, of which I have yet heard. A Federal Life Assurance Department is a little bit of State Socialism that we desire to bring about, and I do not suppose that even honorable members opposite would oppose a movement in that direction. The honorable member for Robertson went to a lot of trouble this afternoon to decry <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Mann. He told us of nearly everything that Tom Mann had said, but he did not tell us of the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Mann,</inline> or of all the little Manns. It was " Tom Mann, Tom Mann," from first to last. Tom Mann was in the honorable member's bonnet from the beginning to the end of his speech, and he unwittingly gave that gentleman the best advertisement that he could have given him. The anti-Socialists have organizers at work. The Prime Minister recently sat on the same platform with one of these organizers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> but I feel confident that he does not indorse all the views expressed by that gentleman. Honorable members opposite are much impressed with the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mann,</inline> but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> is their organizer. </para>

        <para class="block">That action by the magistrate gives <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sievwright</inline> a chance to provide for his father in his old age. This man, if he had a scrap of manhood in him, would, instead of going round the country preaching against the Government which provided old-age pensions by way of practical Socialism, be keeping his old father. The elder Sievwright occupied a high and honorable position in his profession, and I make that statement after full inquiry. Some honorable members may have seen an appeal for subscriptions for this aged and infirm solicitor, but what response there has been, I do not know. The point is that this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sievwright</inline> preaches against Socialism - he holds out his left hand for Socialism, and waves Socialism away with his right. It is such humbugs and men like the honorable member for Robertson who talk a lot of twaddle about taking away from those who have, and giving it to the " have-nots." That is not our ideal. Our ideal is to have a better and fairer organization of society. Our faith is strong that the time will surely come - and it will come the sooner for our efforts - when the dull grey clouds, under which millions of our countrymen are monotonously toiling, will break and vanish for ever in the sunshine of a new and nobler age. These are the aspirations of the great Labour Party. Whatever honorable members opposite may say, we are going on, and gathering force as we go. Our lives show - and the people of our electorates know - that we are not self-seekers. What have we to gain ? What have we to achieve ? We have a mission to perform ; and so long as I have a voice to raise, and so long as I have health and strength, I shall - Sunday, Saturday, or any other day - in season or out of season - preach the labour cause. </para>

          <para>- At this late stage of the debate I do not intend to occupy the House at any great length - three or four hours will serve for the remarks I have to make. First, I desire to extend my hearty congratulations to the leader of the Government on the position he has attained - on his efforts which have resulted in bringing together the whole of the Conservative sections of the House under his leadership. The right honorable gentleman deserves the congratulations of every man of progressive thought. We can readily understand the difficulties that had to be surmounted - the amount of energy and argument which would have to be gone through before the elements opposite could be welded into one compact body. There are, however, one or two honorable members opposite who have my deepest sympathy. There are members opposite who believe neither in the coalition which has been formed nor the policy adopted by the Prime Minister in bringing about that coalition. I know honorable members opposite who are opposed to the whole business - who do not believe that the Freetrade Party should have sunk one atom of their principles. To those men, I say, I extend my deepest sympathy, because I know the uncomfortable position they must be in. We may certainly say that in the history of Australia there has never been got together such a conglomeration as we now see on the Treasury benches. </para>

            <para>- There are about six sections there. There is the free-trade section, who still believe in the principles of free-trade, and who would adhere to them even supposing their present leader were to declare himself in favour of a Protectionist Tariff. Then there is the protectionist section who are prepared to maintain the principles of protection, no matter what happens. There is also a number of honorable members who do not care whether they are associated with free-traders or with protectionists, so long as they sit on the Ministerial benches. Fiscal policy does not trouble them. There is another section of honorable members who, we were led to believe, would be strong supporters of the Government, but who now say that they do not support the Government, excepting in a sort of backhanded fashion. They say, "We support you at present, but you must not rely too strongly upon us, because we may desire to leave you on any proposal which does not please us." </para>

            <para>- I will deal with that question presently. The Government are placed in a rather unenviable position. No Government that had any self-respect would consent to occupy such a position. They have gone through a peculiar series of events in which probably the Prime Minister was the prime mover, in order to get to the Treasury benches. What they have done was not creditable either to this House or the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has had one ambition since he has been in this Parliament. That has been to become the head of the Commonwealth Government. I do not blame him. It is a laudable ambition for any man to aspire to become Prime Minister of Australia. I cannot find fault with the right honorable gentleman for entertaining that desire. But I do find fault with his methods. They are not calculated to bring credit to the Commonwealth, or, to the position which the right honorable gentleman holds. What are the facts of the case? While he was leader of the Opposition the right honorable gentleman fought the Deakin Government, and never lost an opportunity to intrigue for the ousting of that Government. After a considerable amount of trouble and intrigue he was in a position to bring about their defeat, thus clearing the way, as he thought, to his occupancy of the Treasury benches. </para>

He never attempted in any way to lead his party to vote with him on that occasion. He merely said that, personally, he intended to vote in a certain direction. But he well knew that a number of his supporters were prepared to adopt any course to defeat the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, or bring about the downfall of the Deakin Government. Indeed, they stated that they voted against that Government, on the occasion to which I refer, for the purpose of wrecking them. </para>

We had an exhibition here the other night from an honorable member who took that course. After the present Prime Minister succeeded in wrecking the Deakin Government, the Watson Government came into power. In spite of all that has been said against that Government, honorable members cannot get over the fact that the honorable member for Bland was sent for by the Governor-General, not because of his own seeking, but on the recommendation of the' honorable and learned member for Ballarat, who was then retiring as Prime Minister. </para>

In the circumstances, according to constitutional practice, if the honorable and learned member for Ballarat did not feel justified in recommending the Governor-General to send for the right honorable member for East Sydney, he should have allowed His Excellency to take his own course. That is my view of the procedure, which the honorable and learned member for Ballarat should have adopted on that occasion. The honorable and learned member was so disgusted with the action of the present Prime Minister that he said, " No ; I will take the responsibility upon myself of advising the Governor-General to send for the honorable member for Bland." That was done, and what happened then? Did not the present Prime Minister go whining around the country because he had not been sent for? Did not the right honorable gentleman make statements to the effect that it was an unconstitutional proceeding on the part of the Governor-General to send for the honorable member for Bland, when he was himself the leader of the. Opposition? In the circumstances, it is idle for honorable members opposite to say that the right honorable member for East Sydney did not expect to be sent for when the Deakin Government was defeated. When the honorable member for Bland was sent for, and formed his Government, and when the right honorable member for East Sydney had finished whining about not having been sent for, on every occasion when he could secure the insertion of a few words in the press in the shape of an interview, he did so, and he set to work to find some method of defeating the new Government. On every conceivable occasion, through the press and even in this Chamber, the right honorable gentleman said that he was going to move a motion of want of confidence in the Watson Government. In order to try to force matters, he solemnly warned honorable members who were then sitting in the Opposition corner, that he proposed to move such a motion, and that if they were not prepared to vote with him on it he would not be a party to overthrowing the Government on any other pretext. From day to day we had paragraphs appearing in the different newspapers to the effect that it was expected that the motion of want-of-confidence would be moved by the right honorable member for East Sydney to-morrow or the next day, and so forth. That went on so long that it degenerated into a farce. All the talk and bluster of the right honorable gentleman ended in nothing, and he waited his opportunity and ousted the Watson Government on a side issue in connexion with clause 48 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. There has been a good deal of complaint urged against the right honorable gentleman and' honorable members opposite for having taken that course, but I am not one of those who have any complaint against them on that ground. I hold that honorable members opposite had a perfect right to take advantage of any weapon placed in their hands by the Standing Orders, to defeat the Watson Government. I do not blame them at all for their action in that connexion, but I hope they will not take umbrage if honorable members on. this side of the House should adopt the same tactics. I personally intend to do so. So far as I am concerned, I shall make what use I can of the Standing Orders, to prevent the present Government remaining where they are for one day longer than is absolutely necessary. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for D alley says that the Government may be in office for four years, but let me remind the honorable member that if the course I suggest had been adopted Ministers would have been defeated by eight votes on the first day they sat on the Treasury bench. Let me also tell the honorable member that, on the next day on which they met the House, if honorable members had accepted my advice, they would' have been defeated by four votes. We are able to discover the attendance which honorable members gave in this House. We know how many are always present, and there can be no doubt that we can defeat the present Government just whenever we think proper. </para>

            <para>- The only occasion on which honorable members opposite had the chance was that on which they succeeded, and I have said that I find no fault with them for taking advantage of it. I say, further, that they cannot find any fault with us if we adopt similar tactics to defeat the present Government, and I shall personally avail myself of every opportunity to do so. What was the first thing which the present Government did when they came into office? They tried to find all sorts of excuses and apologies for the haphazard combination which we now find on the other side. The right honorable gentleman told us that his desire was to bend his individual opinions to the national will. He said that the national will had ordained a fiscal truce, and that, so far as he was concerned, it should last during this Parliament. He went on to say that he told his constituents that he was prepared, if defeated at the last general election, to sink the fiscal issue. And yet he comes down and quotes the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and the honorable member for Bland, as having taken a similar course. I maintain that the right honorable gentleman, in the first place merely set up a truce, and that then he looked about for arguments with which to try to substantiate his position. But he never believed that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat had proclaimed a truce. He was of the opinion that; there was no such thing as a truce in existence. When he went to New South Wales he found that, among his own supporters, there was a very strong feeling against the re-opening of the Tariff: He did not know how to get out of the awkward position he was in. He had only one plank upon which he could fight, and that was the fiscal issue. He felt that with that issue taken away it was absolutely hopeless for him to make an appeal to the electors of his State. In doing that he made the excuse - not that he was desirous of sinking the fiscal issue - that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was re-opening the Tariff question, and that under these circumstances he and his party had no alternative but to fight on that issue. He did not believe that a fiscal truce was in existence, or that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, who was appealing to the country, really advocated it. What did the right honorable gentleman say when a meeting of the Freetrade Party was held for the express purpose of considering its policy? He went to some pains to point out the attitude which he was taking up, and finding that in New South Wales it would be a very bad policy to re-open the Tariff question, and that he had only one issue on which to fight, he is reported to have said - </para>

            <para>- The right honorable gentleman took up the position that because the Opposition advocated preferential trade it was re-opening the Tariff question, and that, therefore, as a revenue tariffist, as he then called himself - having abandoned the higher ideals of free-trade - he had no other course to follow than to fight on fiscal lines. No other conclusion can be drawn from his words. It does not become him to come down to the House and talk to us about a fiscal truce, when he himself did not believe that it existed. Practically he fought on those lines, and when he got here he was prepared to sacrifice principle as far as free-trade or any other trade was concerned, so long as he could get on to the Treasury bench, and he would not scruple to sacrifice any principle so long as he could stay there. I maintain that the fiscal truce has practically been " off." From time to time we have heard a good deal about honorable members on this side being shackled. I wish to point out that honorable members opposite are in a very unenviable position. When we refer to the document for the terms on which the coalition was formed, we find that it is distinctly stated that neither a Minister nor a Ministerial supporter is allowed, either on a public platform or in this House, to advocate the principles which he so dearly loves. It will be seen, therefore, that the shackles are on honorable members opposite. </para>

            <para>- That may be true. When the Labour Party comes down with a pledge, it acts very differently. There are certain fixed principles embodied in the platform of the Labour Party, and candidates are asked if they believe in those principles. If they do not believe in them, they do not sign the labour pledge, and do not become members of the Labour Party ; but if they do believe in them, they sign the pledge, and become members of the party. But what does the right honorable member and those associated with him do? They follow, meekly and humbly, leaders who make alliances, and lay down programmes for them, and by whom they are treated like a flock of sheep. </para>

            <para>- Chain-riveting is a fool to it. Under these circumstances, honorable gentlemen opposite should cease from talking about the shackles of honorable members on this side of the Chamber. I have at different times heard of individual members of Parliament wearing political shackles, but I have never before seen a whole body of men, such as the free-traders in this House, bound in the manner in which they are bound. But while I can understand the attitude of the honorable members for Dalley and South Sydney, who repudiate the statement that the fiscal issue has been sunk, I cannot understand the honorable member for Parramatta, that sturdy champion of democracy, who says, " Rather than be bound by the shackles of the Labour Party, and sign a pledge, I left them." Now, he is meekly wearing shackles which are a dozen times worse than those of the Labour Party. </para>

            <para>- Yes, there are. The leader of the Government has stated that he is not going to be dominated by the liberal section, or, to quote his own words, he has " declared emphatically against the domination of the Labour Party, and asserted that he would never prove the weak and willing tool of that corner, as the Barton Government did." Now the right honorable gentleman has associated with him in the Cabinet four honorable members who were in the Ministry which he denounced as the willing tool of the Labour Party. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable gentleman went about the country shrieking to the people, and telling them that all the legislation that had been passed in this Chamber had been introduced by the Government, acting at the dictation of the Labour Party. He said, further, that the Deakin Government were merely creatures of that party. As one who has attended every caucus meeting, I should be in a position to ' know if any pressure had been exerted upon the Deakin Government, and I challenge the Prime Minister to quote one case in support of his statement. I regret that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat is not here, because I desired to ask him if, at any time in the history of the Barton or Deakin Governments, they had passed legislation at the dictation of the Labour Party. The right honorable member for Swan has told us on several occasions that the Labour Party exercised pressure upon the Government of which he was a member, and I challenge him to mention one solitary case in point. I am heartily pleased to see the right honorable member for Adelaide enter the Chamber. I hope that he is very much improved in health, and I am sure that every honorable member will join me in giving him a most hearty welcome. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable gentleman practically repeats his original statement. He is continually repeating it, not only in this Chamber, but outside of it, and yet he cannot say that he knows of one case in point. I can only come to the conclusion that he is unable to quote one. I see that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat is now in his place, and I would ask him if he can call to mind one instance in which the Labour Party brought pressure to bear upon his Ministry, or upon the Barton Government, of which he was a member. </para>

            <para>- I am grateful to the honorable member for his honest and straightforward answer. I sought in vain for a similar reply from the right honorable member for Swan. I think that we are justified in coming to the conclusion that there is no foundation for the statement of the Prime Minister that the Barton and Deakin Governments were merely creatures and tools of the Labour Party. Apparently his object was to deceive the people, and to injure our party. What can we think of the members of the Deakin Party when we find them willing to sit behind the Prime Minister after he has denounced them as creatures and tools of the Labour Party and as political hypocrites, humbugs, and shufflers. The Prime Minister has stated that the Labour Party have violated every constitutional principle, and yet he has been guilty of a grave departure, from constitutional usage. When he was sent for by the Governor-General, presumably he gave His Excellency to understand that he was in a position to form a Government. When he came back and found that he was unable to do so, he farmed out half of his commission to some one else. Thereby he violated his trust. This great champion of liberty, this great political leader, approached the Protectionist Party. He wanted to be Prime Minister, and was prepared to give up all his political principles if he could only occupy office in that capacity for even a short time. He went, cap in hand, to his political opponents, and said, " If you join this Government with me I am prepared to allow you to allot four of the portfolios." The Labour Party have been spoken of as a political machine. </para>

            <para>- As the honorable member for Darwin reminds me, our machine is well oiled, in good working order, and thoroughly up-to-date. Our opponents on the other side of the House would use the same form of machine if they could. The great difference between us is that the Labour Party and their supporters are prepared to make any amount of self-sacrifice for the cause in which they believe, whilst honorable members opposite cannot obtain a vote unless they pay for it. They can scarcely induce a supporter to walk across' the road for them, without paying so much for the service rendered. Our adherents are prepared to assist us upon all occasions by personal sacrifice. Honorable members opposite talk about machine politics. Was not the protectionist organization, which supported the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, a machine to a greater or less extent? Was not the organization behind the Free-trade Party a machine? Did not the Federated Employers' Union, the various Chambers of Commerce, and a number of other organizations, band together, for the express purpose of breaking down the growing power of the Labour Party? But, although they have attempted that task time after time, the fact remains that their efforts have been unsuccessful. . I now come to the other cry, of which the Prime Minister has made so much. He has repeatedly spoken of minority rule. In addressing the farmers and other sections of the community, in various parts of Australia, he has informed them that the Commonwealth Parliament was practically dominated by a minority, and that the Labour Party believed in minority rule. I do not know exactly what he means by that, but since I have occupied a seat in this House - and that is from its very inception - I have never known a single measure, or a line, or a clause in any Bill to be passed without the assistance of a majority of honorable members. It is simply idle for the Government to urge that measures have been forced through Parliament by minority rule. If they intend to convey that there was a majority of honorable members in sympathy with our methods it merely goes to show that the Labour Party was the ruling power of the Commonwealth. What is the use of denying it? If that party could submit amendments which were adopted, it conclusively proves that it was the dominant power in this Chamber for the time being. Consequently there is very little in the talk about minority rule. The right honorable gentleman defends majority rule, upon the ground that it forms a part of the Constitution. It does nothing of the kind. He knows well enough that he himself voted against the very proposal which would have made majority rule paramount in this Parliament. At the Federal Convention he supported the granting of equal representation to the states in the Senate, which means that Tasmania, with 140,000 inhabitants, possesses the same voting power in that Chamber as does new South Wales, with a population of 1,300,000. Thus, when he had an opportunity of supporting the principle of majority rule, he declined to do so. Again, when in New South Wales he desired to impose a duty of 3d. per lb. upon tea, and the </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Labour Party said - " We shall give you a duty of only1d. per lb.," did he not say, " Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> or yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen,</inline> I will accept it." Likewise, when he was desirous of bestowing adult suffrage upon the people of that State, did he not refrain from doing so, upon the plea that two or three members of his Cabinet did not approve of it? That was minority rule with a vengeance. Evidently he is prepared to submit to minority rule when it suits his own purposes to do so. I would further point out that his Government and the members who support it are in a minority. Several honorable members, who occupy seats in the Ministerial corner, represent minorities, whilst honorable members opposite represent a minority of 20,000 votes, as compared with the votes ' polled by honorable members upon this side of the House. There is one matter, however, upon which I desire to congratulate the Prime Minister. He has at last declared his true position in the political life of Australia. For a long time he has posed as a democrat, and has been very successful in deluding the people that he is one. Now, however, he has assumed the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of a politician who intends to break up the party upon this side of the Chamber. Somewhat tardily he has informed us that his special mission in life is to destroy the Labour Party. He has made that the leading plank in his platform - the plank upon which he is prepared to go to the country. I congratulate him upon having assumed that position, and I congratulate honorable members opposite upon having found a leader who is prepared to take up the cudgels on behalf of the Employers' Federation and fight the growing influence of the Labour Party. He has declared - </para>

As far as I am aware, the only provision passed by this House, the constitutionality of which has been in any way questioned., has reference to the inclusion of railway servants within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Yet, what do we find? The leader of this national movement has swallowed that doubtful provision, and has forwarded the Bill containing it to the Senate. It is evident, therefore, that in order to remain upon the Treasury bench for a few days longer he is willing to sacrifice his convictions. </para>

Before putting such a proposal in their platform, it was incumbent on the Government to show that the principles of parliamentary government had been violated. I challenge any one to show one instance in which parliamentary government has been violated.

For years it never lost an opportunity either inside or outside Parliament to advocate that desirable reform, and the political freedom of the people of the Commonwealth was brought about practically as the result of its energy and vigour. While I freely acknowledge that we now have political freedom, I hold that we have not legal freedom for the people. On that point we may possibly differ from the right honorable gentleman. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister has also told the people that he is going to repeal this and that provision in various Acts of Parliament. He has said that he is prepared to repeal the section of the Post and Telegraph Act relating to the White Ocean policy, and also to repeal the contract labour provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. But what position does he now take up? He has practically abandoned his promises in regard to these matters. He has told us that for the time being, owing to the fact that he holds only a nominal power as the leader of the Government, he is prepared to abandon all the principles to which he pledged himself when seeking re-election on the hustings of New South Wales. He has told us that for the present he will pass by that which he considered to be one of the most important matters to be dealt with. He is equally emphatic in his condemnation of the contract sections in the Immigration Restriction Act. He stood in this House with a great show of indignation the other day, and declared that the honorable and learned member for West Sydney had been guilty of misrepresenting his position in regard to the case of the six potters. We have heard a great deal about the six patters, and now the incident of the six potters has to be discussed. When the honorable and learned member for West Sydney accused him of having violated his own pledges in regard to the contract sections of the Immigration Restriction Act, by his action in reference to the six potters, what did the Prime Minister do? He remained silent; but next day he came down to the House with a long departmental statement, and sought to vindicate his personal honour. There was no personal question involved. It was simply a matter of everyday politics, and I repeat that the Prime Minister is, equally as guilty as is any other man in regard to the case of the six potters. </para>

            <para>- When the right honorable gentleman assumed office he had the power to reject any proposal that was made, or anything that was being done, by his predecessors in office when they resigned. It is all rubbish for him to say that he had to respect everything done by his predecessors in office. A Ministry on taking office may either allow themselves to be bound by the actions of their predecessors, or refuse to recognise those actions. </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned member for West Sydney, as Minister of External Affairs, recommended the appointment of an administrator in New Guinea; and the present Prime Minister, when he took office, said that he approved of the action of his predecessor. But when the case of the six potters came before him, he did not express any such approval ; he merely accepted the whole of the responsibility for the act of his predecessor, and when the papers were shown to him, he said he would allow the case to proceed. The case had proceeded only sofar that the Collector of Customs had received instructions to take the necessary proceedings, and, before anything had actually been done, the present Prime Minister assumed office. Did the Prime Minister take any steps to reverse the decision which had been arrived at? Did he in any way try to prevent the law taking its course? No ; the right honorable gentleman allowed the case to proceed ; and I maintain that under the circumstances he practically took upon his shoulders the prosecution of the employers of those men, exactly the position taken up by the Barton Government in connexion with the six hatters. But when the Barton Government allowed the six hatters to enter Australia, what did the present Prime Minister do? He went about the country raving, almost in a state of frenzy, about an Act of Parliament which he practically said had been introduced by the Barton Government at the dictation of the Labour Party, and which he described as the shutting out of men of our own flesh and blood from the other end of the Empire. The free-trade newspapers and other capitalistic journals took the same attitude. It must be remembered, however, that the Barton Government did not prevent the hatters from entering Australia, but merely said that they must enter according to the laws of the Commonwealth, which must be maintained. The honorable and learned member for West Sydney, when Minister. of External Affairs, took exactly the same action that the Barton Government had taken - the law had to be administered, and he issued the necessary instructions. But the present Prime Minister is in an altogether different position. The right honorable gentleman denounced the Barton Government, and the section of the Act under which they had proceeded ; but what did Tie do when he came into office? He allowed the prosecution in the case of the potters to go on simply because he was at the head of a coalition Government, and dare not move hand or foot in a different direction. </para>

The proceedings could be withdrawn if the Prime Minister so desired, but he knows that if. he took any such action it would be a violation of the law; and, under the circumstances, he is prepared to allow matters to drift - not to administer the Department at all. The Prime Minister ought to be the last to adversely comment on the action of the late Minister of External Affairs. </para>

            <para>- There is another matter to which I desire to refer. The other night there was in this Chamber an exhibition which pained me very much as a representative - in fact I felt myself humiliated. An honorable member stood at the table, and, arrogating to himself great power, evinced an amount of conceit which, to my mind, verged on insanity. The honorable member stood there, and told us that he held the present Government in the " hollow of his hand." The Prime Minister talks about his personal honour, and yet he allows a statement of that kind to pass. I make these remarks for the reason that since the honorable member for Wilmot spoke, we have not heard a solitary word from the Prime Minister on the point. </para>

            <para>- No, the honorable member for Wilmot did not hold the Opposition in the "hollow of his hand." Had that honorable member decided to vote with the Opposition, there would have been an equal number on each side, and probably a dissolution would have followed. But that honorable member finished his remarks by telling us that he was going to vote with the Government, who would thereby have a majority, and be able to carry on the business of the country. Immediately after that announcement had been made, the other leader of the Government, the honorable member for Gippsland, went to a reporter outside and stated that now the Government had a majority they were going to carry on, and he expressed the hope that there would be no factious opposition. I do not know what the honorable member for Gippsland takes us for? Does he take us for a lot of children? As I have already stated, so far as I am personally concerned - and I think a number of other honorable members think with me - I shall take every advantage of the Standing Orders to force the Government to the. country if I possibly can. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Wilmot, in referring to the action of the Labour Party in voting for the inclusion of the railway employes and other public servants in the operation of the Arbitration Bill, described that action as practically the cause of the defeat of the Deakin Government. The honorable member accused the Labour Party of acting the part of Judas, who sold his master for twenty pieces of silver, and then went out and hanged himself. The honorable member informed us that, throughout his life and political career, he had always gone straight, and would continue to do so. but it appears to me that it was he who acted the part of a Judas, though he was afraid to politically hang himself. This honorable member, who is going to save the Government, points out in an interview reported in this morning's newspapers, that the reason why he intends to take that course is this : He, first of all, makes the dramatic statement that nothing but death would prevent his voting with the Government. Then he says - </para>

        <para class="block">Here was a clear statement that the honorable member intended to vote with the Opposition. Yet he makes a paltry excuse in reference to the six potters for voting with the Government. We can only come to the conclusion that after the honorable member had decided to vote with the Opposition a certain amount of pressure was brought to bear upon him to induce him to vote with the Government. It was threatened that a member of the Tasmanian Parliament would resign his seat and contest the electorate of Wilmot against the honorable member. Therefore, he changed his tune to save his political neck. </para>

            <para>- The position was totally different. If the honorable member for Wilmot had voted on this side, he would simply have done what he had already announced that he would do. It would have shown his courage had he voted to bring about an appeal to the country, so that the electors might say whether we were right or wrong. The statement which I have read is clear proof that the honorable member intended to vote with us. Consider the position of the Government. After the speech of the honorable member for Wilmot, the " better half " of the Government - the honorable member for Gippsland - announced that the Government intended to carry on with their majority of two. It is a very precarious majority. When the House goes into Committee, and the Chairman of Committees has to take the chair, the Government will lose 50 per cent, of their majority, because the honorable member for Laanecoorie will not then be able to assist them with his vote. </para>

Let honorable members listen to what the right honorable member for East Sydney said when he was at the height of his power and glory, with the Labour Party supporting him, in New South Wales. The right honorable gentleman was at that time prepared to submit to any pressure by the Labour Party, and to give them anything they asked. I direct the attention of honorable members to the statement which he made when he had the full strength of the Labour Party behind him. Some one had been taunting the right honorable gentleman's Government with being the mere tools of the Labour Party, and I find that he is reported, on page 37 of the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 17th August, 1898, to have said - </para>

            <para>- It is the right honorable gentleman at the head of the present Government who shed the tears when he was speaking on the Tariff. Honorable members will recollect the tears which were dropped on the table in this Chamber by the right honorable gentleman when he cried over the 30 per cent, duty sought to be imposed on children's boots. The right honorable gentleman referred to the poor little barefooted children who would have to run about the country in danger of the frost biting their foes. I have no doubt that if he thought it necessary to shed tears in order to secure his position on the Treasury bench, the right honorable gentleman would be prepared to do it in connexion with any of his measures. In the manifesto which he issued to the people of Australia, the right honorable gentleman did not in any way attempt to criticise the administration of the Watson Government. In that manifesto he practically admitted that everything that was desirable had been done by the late Government. </para>

            <para>- During the time they were in office they so administered the affairs of the Commonwealth that those who took office after them had to admit that there were no arrears of work, and that everything had been kept up-to-date. Not a finger could be pointed at their administration. And if anything could have been said against the administration of the Labour Government, full advantage would have been taken by the present Prime Minister of the opportunity to say it. </para>

            <para>- I must accept the honorable gentleman's word on this occasion. I shall be very much mistaken in the Prime Minister, if he carries on with the vote of the honorable member for Wilmot. He will not be the man I take him for if he does. And certainly he will have humiliated himself throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The right honorable gentleman has also taken it upon himself to break down the power of the Labour Party, but that is a bigger task than he realizes. The Labour Party did not come into existence on a feather pillow. It has been built up by an amount of hard work, which is without parallel in our political history. It has become so powerful that it is the greatest political party in the Commonwealth to-day. It has compelled the two former political parties to sink their life-long principles, and combine in order to break down its influence throughout the country. That is, I think, one of the highest compliments which have ever been paid to the Labour Party. </para>

            <para>- I offer the right honorable member my deepest sympathy. The Labour Party, I repeat, did not come into existence on a feather pillow. It is the result of many years of toil and hard work. The principles of the Labour Party are very dear to the people of Australia. The fact that in Queensland hundreds of men are prepared to ride a distance of 200 or 300 miles, and that some persons are willing to trudge a distance of 100 miles to record their votes, shows how deeply rooted are the principles of the Labour Party. </para>

            <para>- It is for them to say whether they are satisfied. The Labour Party is something more than a mere organization. It represents a deep-rooted sentiment which has grown up in the people, owing to the maladministration and iniquitous actions of other parties. The Labour Party did not spring into existence by a mere accident. It was forced into existence by the rottenness of the different parties in power. It has done very much to purify our political life, which, I regret exceedingly, is not yet as clean as it might be. Immediately we come along, we are accused of being Socialists. I do not deny that I am a Socialist. I declare that every member of the Labour Party is a Socialist. Any labour man who does not acknowledge that he is a Socialist knows very little about the labour movement, because it has been organized on socialistic lines. We know very well that we cannot bring the whole of our doctrines into force within twenty-four or forty -eight hours. We recognise that there are many obstacles which have to be cleared away before we can achieve that result. In the meantime, we have to fight reactionaries like the present Government. We all know the great difficulty of clearing away the obstacles before we can put our highest ideals into practice. What are those ideals? As the Prime Minister has said, we have our political freedom, and now we want our economic freedom. Until we get our economic freedom, the working classes will not be benefited' very much. </para>

            <para>- What are we aiming at? We contend that the means of production, distribution, and exchange, should be placed in the hands of the people, and used for the common good, and not for class purposes. The Labour Party is organized to accomplish that object. We have been accused of being a class party. I, for one, frankly acknowledge that we are a class party. What we are engaged in today is a class struggle - in other words, a struggle of the masses of the people against the classes. The fight is against those who represent vested interests, and' who are only 10 per cent, of the people, by the 90 per cent, who own nothing. It is with the 90 per cent, who own no wealth themselves, but who produce all the wealth, that we are fighting. All we ask is that labour shall get the full reward of its toil. It does not get that to-d'ay. It is fleeced and robbed by means of rents and profits of the greater portion of that which it produces. </para>

            <para>- If such legislation were proposed, the honorable and learned member, and other honorable members opposite, would offer the strongest' opposition to it. The Labour Party has been organized for the purpose of fighting for labour. We take up the cudgels against vested rights and vested interests. The Prime Minister, in agreeing to lead a party to break clown the ramifications and organizations of the Labour Party, undertook a great and a mighty work. I am, however, pleased that he has done so, because the greater and the more bitter we can make the struggle the faster will be our progress. The surest sign that we are progressing is the continual raving against the party of newspapers like the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus,,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> and the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline> I hope that the right honorable gentleman will make the fight as bitter as he can. I shall make it as bitter as I can. As we are going to have a battle, let us appeal to the country, and' let honorable members opposite take up the cry of anti- Socialism, while we take up the cry of Socialism. The last State elections in Queensland were fought on that issue, and the result was that the Labour Party swept the State, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the borders of Queensland. Since then, on a limited franchise, which is inferior to that of the Federal Parliament, we have won a by-election on the same cry. The last Federal elections, too, were fought in Queensland on that cry, when the supporters of the present Government had behind them the Federated Employers' Association, with its huge capital of ^10,000. In New South Wales that association is supposed to have had a capital of , £23,000, and in Victoria a capital of £20,000. </para>

            <para>- If they did not obtain these huge sums, they attempted to obtain them for the purpose of fighting the Labour Party. What was the result of the Federal elections jn Queensland in December last? The candidate opposed to us whose name stood highest upon the list polled 16,000 votes fewer than were obtained by our lowest candidate, while our leading man beat the man highest on the list by 22,000 or 23,000 votes. That shows the feeling of Queensland on the subject. A similar result has been obtained in Western Australia. Four out of the five representatives of Western Australia in this House were returned as Socialists, while the one individualist - the right honorable member for Swan - has not too certain a position at the present time. </para>

            <para>- The Labour Party regret that they did not oppose the right honorable gentleman. If they had done so, all the representatives of Western Australia in this House would be labour members. In South Australia, on the cry of Socialism <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> anti- Socialism, three labour members were returned to the Senate, while the labour representation of that State in this House was increased. In New South Wales, at the recent State elections the Labour Party increased its numbers by over 50 per cent, in spite of the opposition to its candidates. Similar results were obtained in Victoria at both the State and the Federal elections. The Labour Party is growing to such an extent that our opponents are becoming afraid. They see that their powers are slipping from them, and that they are likely to lose some of the privileges and advantages which they have so long held and wielded against the interests and progress, not only of the community, but of the individuals composing it. Naturally they make a noise. Since the Federal elections a by-election has been fought out in Victoria on the cry of Socialism <inline font-style="italic">verses</inline> anti-Socialism, and the Labour Party again won by the return of the honorable member for Melbourne. Considering the natural political genius of the right honorable member for East Sydney, he might have been expected to get a more tangible and forcible weapon with which to fight the Labour Party than an old gag which was used against us sixteen years ago with very poor results. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to know that the right honorable gentleman intends to fight the Labour Party. We, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> a party, should be extremely grateful to him for having at last come out in his true colours as the leader of the Conservative Party in Australia. </para>

Honorable members now repudiate his statement. The Prime Minister accused the members of the Deakin Government of being tools in the hands of the Labour Party. </para>

            <para>- We have had a great deal to say about him during that period, and the right honorable gentleman may have a good deal to say about him within the next three weeks. He is not out of the wood yet, and I ask the Prime Minister to remember that. We all know that the honorable member for Wilmot travelled around Tasmania announcing that he was anxious for a dissolution, and declaring that it was advisable to have a dissolution. But what is his position at the present time? The honorable member quoted an improvisation of a portion of Tennyson's <inline font-style="italic">Charge of the Light Brigade.</inline> I am sorry that he is not present, because I am quite sure that he is familiar with an old Jacobite song, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Hie March of the Cameron Men.</inline> In that song there is a line to the effect that a Cameron never can yield. Whenever I hear that line in the 'future, I shall be tempted to exclaim " Rats !" because I know a Cameron who capitulated at the first breath of criticism, and the very moment he realized that his own seat was in jeopardy. The honorable member for Wilmot has no more confidence in the Government than have honorable members upon this side of the House. I admit that he declares that he has no confidence in the Labour Party. After -.telling us 'that the one thing for the country was a dissolution, the honorable member, who has hitherto been regarded as a straight-goer, intends to vote for a Government in which he admittedly has no confidence. In August last, the Prime Minister declared war against the Labour Party, and I, for one, am prepared to take up the gage of battle. What does it mean ? It means war against the masses on the part of the right honorable gentleman and of every one of his supporters. It means war against humanity and upon the side of the privileged classes. I am not afraid to face the country with such a battle-cry. I do not fear the result, nor does any honorable member upon this side of the House. I hold in my hand a few statements which the Prime Minister has made from time to time in various parts of the country. At Kyneton, upon the 30th June, he said - </para>

          <para>The time has come when it devolves upon me to set myself right across the path of this Labour Party. Why?

        <para class="block">I ask him, where is the legislation to justify such a charge against members of the Labour Party? I venture to say that he cannot point to one Act of advantage to the country which did not receive the support of every honorable member upon this side of the House. As was pointed out by the honorable member for Maranoa, even the right honorable member for Swan is in agreement with six out of the seven planks of our platform. Where, then, is the evidence of an attempt on the part of the Labour Party to institute the ancient tyrannies? I wish to say that not one letter of our platform will be altered until we have first consulted our constituents. We have put that platform in black and white, and our strength is increasing for the reason that the people place reliance in us. They know that we do not go before the electors, as some honorable members who oppose the Labour Party have done, and after making all sorts of pledges, repudiate them as soon as we enter the walls of Parliament. The Prime Minister, I maintain, was simply mad with the Watson Administration, because they did not bring down a thunderbolt policy which would enable him to go rampaging all over the country talking of their revolutionary aims. He dare not take up our platform, discuss it plank by plank, and state his objections to it. Even the right honorable member for Swan will not do that, because the only plank to which he objects is that relating to the nationalization of monopolies. We are not likely to get very much from the present Prime Minister, according to a statement which he is reported to have made on the 31st August last. Upon that occasion he is credited with having said that the Labour Party had got as much out of the honorable member for Hume in twelve months as they would get out of him in 200 years. The right honorable member is fast approaching the allotted span, so 'hat we can almost reckon to a nicety how much we may expect from him. I desire to ask him if he repudiates that statement, because it has been said that he denies having made it. I should like the attention of the Prime Minister for a moment. </para>

I wonder whether he will be prepared to repudiate an article from his own pen, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews</inline> of 15th November, 1899. Let me read what he then said of the Labour Party. I think when I have concluded this quotation the House will be satisfied that the statement made by the honorable and learned member for West Sydney was not absolutely untrue, but absolutely correct. In this article the Prime Minister said - </para>

          <para>The transfer of their solid support from one side to the other meant a difference of thirty-eight votes. I can testify, with pleasure, to the singularly consistent support the party gave to the late Government from first to last. There was no sort of definite tie, or formal alliance. Our policy met with their approval, and they did not expect to further their political aspirations or part}' platform better by opposing us. From that point of view, there is no call for gratitude. They supported us simply because it seemed to be their duty so to do. The ground upon which I feel deeply grateful to the labour members, and especially to their able and high-minded leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S. McGowen, is this : having great power, they never sought to use it in an objectionable manner. The connexion was always, therefore, on both sides, an honorable one; and the absence of any attempt at pressure during my term of office is a fact which I have the greatest possible pleasure in recording. </para>

So far as I am concerned, it has never been sunk; and I shall have no hesitation in assisting those who desire to re-open the Tariff, and to help our industries. The members of the Government have thrown aside their fiscal principles for two years. On preferential trade they have no agreement whatever ; on the Manufactures Encouragement Bill no agreement whatever, and on the Trans-Australian railway line no agreement. Where are their principles? What is their policy? Their hope is to get into recess, so that they may concoct something that may pass for a policy. </para>

            <para>- Those are the sort of epithets which are levelled at men who are admitted to be just as good as honorable members behind the Government. We on this side have our faults like everybody else, but the Prime Minister accuses us of standing, not for the people, but for a class. I maintain that we on this side stand more for the people as a whole than does the Prime Minister, according to the principles which he has lately professed. It is very evident that, as compared with his opponents, the Prime Minister represents a very narrow section. We, on the other hand, are sent here by every section of the community to legislate for every section, and the statute-book is our record, showing, as it does, that the legislation supported by the Labour Party has been in the interests of the whole community. The Prime Minister has been going about the country poisoning the minds of the people in regard to the Labour caucus and Socialism. The fact is that honorable members opposite are afraid that the electors of the Commonwealth may ultimately come to know the true meaning of Socialism, and fear the result. At the Athenaeum Hall, Melbourne, the other day, the Prime Minister told the public that the Socialists desire to bring every. one to a dead level. The right honorable gentleman is reported to have said - </para>

            <para>- I shall tell honorable members what Socialism is. In South Australia we have a Chamber of Manufactures, composed of employers who are the bitter opponents of the Labour Party, of arbitration, and of Socialism. But the members of that Chamber of Manufactures take a subsidy of ^200 a year from the State Government, and occupy free premises. That is Socialism. The trades unions in South Australia occupy their own Trades Hall, for which they pay rent. Those who denounce Socialism are always the first to take advantage of Socialism. </para>

How was it that those whom he describes as our masters - the leagues outside - did not insist on our bringing in the " thunderbolt " policy which he would like to see? How was it the caucus did not insist on a different policy ? That only shows that the Prime Minister is going about the country misrepresenting the Labour Party on every occasion.

        <para>Is not that a proof that there has been a scramble for office on his part? The right honorable gentleman would allow the country to go to the dogs - all he cares for is office. He will not come here to take his share in the battle against a Government in which he has no confidence, but says he will attend to his private affairs. I have quoted the right honorable gentleman's own words - will he deny them? I am astounded that a gentleman with the reputation of the Prime Minister, should make such a sordid remark as he did at that particular meeting. I should like to say a word or two about the Prime Minister's followers. I find that the right honorable member for Swan, accompanied the Prime Minister to a meeting of the Women's National League, held in Melbourne on 29th August. The right honorable member for Swan objected to the Labour Party, because - it includes lawyers, doctors, and parsons, and other persons who have never done a day's work with their hands in their lives. </para>

          <para>That it had appropriated a trade-mark which belonged to every one. The term labour belonged to every person in Australia, rich or poor, that did some honest work. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>It did not matter how the Labour Party was constituted, these right honorable gentlemen had a ground of complaint against it. In the one case it was objected to because it includes too many classes of persons, and in the other case it was objected to because it does not embrace all classes. The Prime Minister took the opposite view to that of the right honorable member for Swan. The one said " Yes," and the other said " No " on that occasion. Which of the two is correct? ' I am rather astonished that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat should have come down from his high pedestal and misrepresented the Labour Party at Ballarat. He did so to a degree that would even shame a Turk. When he found that the Labour Party would not accept his invitation to walk into his parlour - the door of which he said he had left open - the moment he found we were not prepared to form an alliance with his Government, he denounced the Labour Party, its methods, and its machine. But he went to Ballarat to construct another machine to fight it. </para>

            <para>-The honorable gentleman does not know what he is talking about. Here is a statement made by the ex- Prime Minister, with whom the Labour Party was on most friendly terms. He had merely to ask the Honorable member for Bland a question with regard to our methods, our caucus, our platform, to get- any information he desired. He would have learnt that the truth was the very opposite from what he had stated. He should have recollected that while his Government was in office I made a statement in reply to an interview with the present Minister of Trade and Customs which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and explained precisely in his hearing, and in the hearing of the Minister of Defence, what was done at our caucus meetings. I stated that we do not vote on subjects outside our platform, and that such subjects are very seldom discussed. I put that point clearly, as can be seen from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Indeed, honorable members will recollect the stand which I took up in regard to the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs, which affected one plank in our platform. I had a free hand, as other members of the Labour Party had, and voted accordingly. The present Prime Minister, having some dirty work to do, refused to call for a division himself, but got the honorable and learned member for Werriwa to do so. No other member of his own party called with him, so there was no division. Had a division been taken, I and a number of other labour members would have voted on the opposite side from some of the other members of our party. </para>

        <para>Every party has its caucus, and I have not a word to say against them, but no caucus, except that of the Labour Party, seeks to compel the minority to vote against their convictions and good judgment. </para>
        <para class="block">I give that a flat contradiction, and I say that it is not honest political warfare. It is warfare in which no honorable member of this House should indulge, no matter on what side he sits. We should be fair to each other. If I had any doubt in regard to any of the organizations connected with honorable members opposite they would never find me going round the country misrepresenting them. I should first go to one of their leading members to know what the constitution, of their organization was. I think that is the least we had a right to expect from honorable members on ,the other side. I have not been surprised at the position which has been taken up by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. After hearing the honorable and learned gentleman, make his first address in this House this session, on the first occasion on which I spoke, I said that I had listened with intense interest to the exposition by the Prime Minister as the honorable and learned gentleman then was, of the new development of fiscal thought when he said that the gulf had become so narrow between the free-trader and protectionist that I almost expected to see the honorable and learne"d gentleman fall upon the neck of the right honorable member for East Sydney. He has done it. I was not so very far wrong. Any one who listened to that speech by the honorable and learned gentleman could see it was coming. They could see that there was to be a parting of the ways, when there would be a combination against the Labour Party, and when we could no longer run together with the party led by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. I have yet ringing in my ears the honorable and learned gentleman's denunciation of the extraordinary statements, or the extraordinary misstatements, of the right honorable member for East Sydney in regard to the <inline font-style="italic">Petriana</inline> sailors and the six hatters ; but to-day the honorable and learned gentleman, is prepared to take the present Prime Minister to his arms or to allow himself to be taken into the right honorable gentleman's arms. I refer now to the honorable member for Dalley, to show the conglomerate kind of Government we have, and the kind of supporters they "have. The honorable member for Dalley, who I may say voted for preference to unionists, voted the Watson Government out because the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill did not go far enough. Where is the honorable member to-day ? We find him accepting the Bill as it stands, without so much as one word of protest. Where are the principles of honorable members opposite? If this is an example of devotion to principle, I have no desire to see it followed on this side. I am very sorry that the honorable member for Laanecoorie is not present. I was charged by that honorable member with being a Sabbath breaker. I am very glad the honorable member made the charge. I suppose that most honorable members will admit being Sabbath breakers at times, though their Sabbath breaking does not take the form of delivering addresses from a public platform on a Sunday. The honorable member for Laanecoorie accused me of being a Sabbath breaker, because I went to the Trades Hall in Melbourne, and delivered an address there on a Sunday. I may tell honorable members that my text on that occasion was a quotation from an address delivered by the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rentoul</inline> from that very platform on a Sunday. </para>

            <para>- I did not do much lecturing in Scotland, but I have spoken on social and political questions in South Australia for the last twenty years. When I went over to that State some weeks ago, I received a telegram asking me to come down and explain the political situation to my constituents on a Sunday. I did so, and it must be clear that if the honorable member for Laanecoorie desired to injure me he has absolutely failed in his miserable attempt. However, the honorable member's remarks have caused a controversy in South Australia in regard to the words I used, and which I stand by, to the effect that tha churches were the sanctuaries of the sweater, the oppressor, and the Customs defrauder. Let me tell honorable members what the position is. In a letter which I wrote to the press I made a quotation from <inline font-style="italic">Great Thoughts,</inline> for 30th July, from an interview with the Rev. F. G. Selby, who is a prominent Wesleyan minister, and this is what he had to- say - </para>

          <para>I am bound to say that all the Evangelical churches are flat and inert. The churches will yet have to fight the cause of the working man. They must affirm the principle of a living wage, and get on better terms with the toiling masses through real practical sympathy. The reason of the massive indifference, of which so much is heard, is that there is a widespread grievance - a collective grievance - against the churches. The people are indifferent to the churches, and, in a great measure, because they imagine that the churches are indifferent to them. </para>

        <para class="block">Let me tell honorable members that in South Australia we have a Factories Act, which was passed by both of the State Houses some four years ago, and its operation has been suspended because the Legislative Council in that State has refused to pass the regulations framed' under it. An appeal was made by the Trades and Labour Council to every one of the church assemblies in the State for their help. We were promised that something should be done; resolutions of sympathy were passed, and what has been the result? After a lapse of two years, in some cases, we have had a public address from only one reverend gentleman, and' no practical help whatever. A commission is coming to Melbourne this very week to inquire into sweating, because they cannot get sufficient: evidence of it in South Australia to satisfy the State members of the Legislative Council ; although, as I stated in the letter to which I have referred, the leader of the Labour Party in that State and myself took certain clergymen to the homes of the sweated workers, and into the factories. These gentlemen ascertained the hours they had to work, what they paid for the material they used, and what they got for making it up. They said they were simply astounded by what we had to show them, but we got no help from them. Am I not right, then, in saying that the churches are on the side of the oppressors of the poor? I do not refer to individual clergymen, because I am glad to say here, as I have acknowledged from many a platform, that we have been given practical help by several clergymen, but not by any one church as a church. I have been a good churchman, and I am still a believer in, and know the power of, the churches ; but I say that the churches are on the side of the man who puts the biggest cheque into the collection-plate. I repeat that if it was the intention of the honorable member for Laanecoorie to injure me, the honorable member has miserably failed. I deny the charge of being a Sabbath-breaker because I delivered the address to which the honorable member referred. I am afraid that I may sometimes be guilty of Sabbath-breaking in taking recreation when I might bri attending a church, but I believe that most honorable members will plead guilty to Sabbath-breaking to that extent. The honorable member for Flinders, who, I see, has left the Chamber, in speaking the other night about the proposal to bring agricultural labourers under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, said that the reason he objected to the proposal was that they could not pay more wages than the industry could afford. Let me mention one or two things. In South Australia, there lately died a gentleman - the Hon. J. H. Angas - who left, no one knows how much. He must have left ?1,000,000, and he paid his servants very poor wages indeed. Did he pay them all that his industry could afford? I should like to have a tribunal which could look into such matters. We had another gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scarfe,</inline> who carried on a large ironmongery and other business. He paid very poor wages', but he left over ?500,000. I should like to know if that was all that his industry could afford. We had. in the other House, a gentleman - the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood - who, I find, left over?500,000. I do not know what wages he paid, but I suppose that if he had been asked in his life-time, he would have said that he could not afford to pay more. Then, the Hon. Robert Reid, who defrauded the Customs, left over ?100,000. </para>

            <para>- It was stated in the press that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> left over , ?100,000. I do not know what wages he paid, but from what I could learn from the Adelaide branch of his firm, they were not too high. I wonder if that was all that his industry could afford to pay. It is monstrous that men should be able to leave behind them such enormous sums, while their employes are, some of them, practically in beggary, without having a tribunal to see that they get justice. That is all we ask for in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. The honorable member for Flinders was wrong when he said that there was any proposal on the part of the Labour Party to insist upon an eight hours day for agricultural labourers. According to what I have read, in the fifteenth century an eight hours clay was pretty general, so that we should only be following an old precedent if we did establish an eight hours day for the Commonwealth. But we do not say that we desire to do anything of the kind. We merely say thai we wish to give power to a Court to declare that the conditions are such that the agricultural labourers need not work more than nine, or ten, or eleven hours a day, and for such wages as the industry can afford to pay. No industry should be asked to pay more than it can afford. The Prime Minister pretended to be in favour of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I remember reading, before I was a member of the House, what I thought was one of the most eloquent addresses which had ever been delivered on an industrial measure. In the course of that address the right honorable gentleman used these words - </para>

          <para>It reflects infinite credit upon the labour bodies of Australia that they are willing to intrust their liberty - aye, even their subsistence - to judicial decision. I cannot understand the position taken up by persons who are not closely identified with the labour bodies of Australia, and who find in this attitude of those bodies something to denounce as if it were unwholesome, as if it were selfish, as if it were endangering the stability of our industrial or political fabric. It is, in my opinion, one of the grandest displays of intelligence and a readiness to sacrifice the one weapon which labour has, that certainly has no parallel in any other part of the world. </para>

        <para class="block">They will not give up the little power they have to enable them to get fair conditions of work, when nothing is offered to them in return. When the honorable and learned member for Bendigo was accused of having assisted to emasculate the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, he said that they had made it a workable measure. It is so workable that the union of whose executive I have had the honour to be a member for a good many years, and which is one of the largest in Australia - for, taking the whole industry,' the Shearers' Union numbers between 20,000 and 24,000 - told me distinctly that they would not register under the Act. I know that many of them would rather go to g"aol than accept the terms which are sought to be thrust upon them under the measure as it stands. They would not register, nor would they be forced into registering. What is the use of offering them a mockery of a Bill like that? Do we not know as well as the opponents of labour what is a fair thing for a union ? The Prime Minister showed that he is an opponent of labour when he said that he had declared war against the Labour Party. This is one of the ways of declaring war. lt is a repetition of the old game which we have seen played in the State Parliaments. When our opponents dared not oppose an industrial measure, of which they knew the people were in favour, what did they do? Every time they emasculated the measure by inserting amendments which either made it worthless, or so costly that it could not be availed of. That ' is precisely the game which the Prime Minister wishes to play with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. But he will find that he is making an error. </para>

            <para>- I was rather too old to be caught in that way by the Prime Minister. Why did he not call out for a division? Because he thought that he was going to do something dishonorable. The opinion of the House was that it wanted only one vote to turn out the Watson Ministry, and that that vote would be mine. They thought it would be a shameless thing to do.

            <para>- In all probability one of their supporters would have come over to neutralize my vote. The Prime Minister would have been astonished with the result of the division, if he had had the courage to put his opinion to the test. I know that half-a-dozen labour members announced that they were going to vote with me. But in regard to the acceptance of the amendment by the Prime Minister, that does not make the Bill workable. He found out that he made a mistake. He had not foreseen the result of it at the time. Why should it be necessary to form another union to take advantage of the Act ? I am sure that the only Minister in the House at the present time will admit that without a union its provisions could not be availed of. The unions are in existence now, and I am sure that even the Postmaster-General will not deny that the unions are doing today nothing which is not absolutely legal and just, and which would not be upheld in any Court. Why should it be sought to take away any privilege that belongs to unions ? Talk about freedom ! Ministers do not want to give unions freedom to act as they think best. Every man is free to join an organization if he wishes; but what Ministers wish to do is to compel a union to cease to take political action. Why should they do that? Are they going to make ' bond-slaves of unionists? At the present time unionists have a right to take political action, and why should any difference be made as regards the future? This is only another evidence of their attempt to smash up the Labour Party. "Oh," they say, "the way to strike a most vital blow is to make the unions inefficient as regards political action." Here is a full proof of their intention. But I contend that they are not going to do it. What would be the result if they did? We know that the squatters have not been too scrupulous in the past. It has been proved in the Arbitration Court that the Machine Shearers' Union was a bogus affair, which the squatters supplied with funds, and it might happen, if the Arbitration Bill were passed into law as it stands, that while the Shearers' Union was expunging from its constitution the clauses under which it is now allowed to take political action, the pastoralists would induce 300 men to combine together, and ask the Court to fix 1 6s. per 100, instead of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per 100, as a fair rate of wage, and make it a common rule. The unions will not take advantage of the measure if the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corinella remains in it, and the Government may as well know the fact. The honorable and learned member, who has taken exception to my interjections - though I do not interject with the desire to interrupt speakers, but merely to obtain the elucidation of obscure points - has stated that an opportunity was given for the discussion of his amendment. Nothing of the kind. Every honorable member now on this side of the House took it for granted, when the present leader of the Opposition moved to postpone it, that the question would be discussed again in Committee. No doubt it might have been discussed on the motion to go into Committee, but if advantage had been taken of that opportunity to discuss it, it would still have been impossible to move any amendment to ascertain the feelings of 'honorable members in regard to any suggested alteration. The honorable and learned member said further that his amendment does precisely what the amendment which the honorable member for Bland was willing to accept would do. I challenge him to show how the views of a majority engaged in an industry could be ascertained. I have been returning officer of the South Australian Shearers' Union for some years, and I know how difficult it is to get a record of the votes of the members of that union. I do not know how the opinions of all the persons employed in the industry, some of whom are not unionists, could be obtained. Not only that, but a further difficulty arises by reason of the fact that a man may be a shearer to-day, and be working at another occupation a week later. It is all very well to say, " Leave the matter to the Judge." If I were to go before the Judge and say. " I believe that the members of the Shearers' Union represent a majority of the industry," the representative of the pastoralists would say, " Nothing of the sort." Whom should the Judge believe? He would, of course, ask me to bring evidence to prove my statement, and I could only reply that it was impossible to prove it, in which case he would say, "Very well, then, I cannot give you a preference." </para>

            <para>- I believe that it would. I am entirely with the honorable member there. The leader of the Opposition, in his anxiety to pass a Bill which would prevent great strikes from occurring in the near future, gave way as much as he could, and, in my opinion, and in that of many of the unions, he gave way too much. However, it is not too late to retrace our steps. If we do not retrace them, I hope that the Bill will be thrown into the waste-paper basket. The Prime Minister has told the House that if he were an artisan he would be one of the first to join a union, but would stop at making use of the powers of government and legislation to create distinctions by force between one man in a trade and his fellow workmen. Yet as a lawyer he uses all the machinery of government to prevent, not a non-unionist or a " black-leg," but a member of the legal union, from earning his bread in any Stale other than that in which he is enrolled. </para>

        <para class="block">Prime Minister would be one of our bitterest opponents. At any rate, the union to which he belongs does that which no union with which I have been connected has done. The statement about unionists preventing non-unionists from earning a living is absurd. There is work only for so many, and the unionists and non-unionists are doing that work now. If preference were given, not one man would be thrown out of work, nor would any additional man get work. Besides, the non-unionists are free to join unions if they care to do so. [ wish now to say a word about the Prime Ministers attitude in regard to the Immigration Restriction Act. This is what he has said in this Chamber - </para>

          <para>We do not want any use made of contract labour at strike time, nor do we want any frauds or impositions to be practised upon people in distant countries with regard to terms of labour and wages. </para>

        <para class="block">We have had some experience of that in South Australia. There, Parliament voted £36,000 tq establish a pipe-making industry under private control. No objection was raised then to the subsidizing of private enterprise. A number of men were brought out from Glasgow to make pipes, and were paid about £2 for a hard week's work. That was all that was given to them for the maintenance of their wives and families, and they were absolutely misled as to the conditions of labour here, the standard of rent, and the cost of living generally. The .Immigration Restriction Act prevents that kind of thing, yet the Prime Minister would alter it. It is not desirable to prevent the importation of contract labour merely during times of strikes. If six men come into the Common wen 1th, and take the places of six other men, those other men are without employment, or have to compete with persons engaged in some other occupation. A similar result happens if twelve or 1,200 men come into the Commonwealth, whether there is a strike or not. Honorable members can see that we are not likely to get much good legislation from the Prime Minister. At any rate, he has not told us what he would do to prevent what has happened in South Australia, and what has happened in regard to the six hatters, and to the six potters. Coming now to the question of fiscal peace, I say that every free-trader who agrees to it now, will break his election pledge, because they all promised to continue the fiscal war in this Parliament, and they had no mandate from their constituents to agree to fiscal peace. The honorable and learned member for Indi, as a protectionist, admits that he had no mandate from the people to preserve fiscal peace for two years. The free-traders came into this House pledged to re-open the Tariff question, and I ask why they are not doing it ? As a protectionist, I am quite willing to assist them to revise the Tariff ; but it seems to me that the Government are prepared to eat, drink, and be merry during recess, whilst our industries are being rushed to destruction on account of the unfair foreign competition to which they are subjected. What do the Government care ? If 500 or 600 men were to come from Ballarat, and say that they were out of work, and ask the Government what they would do for them, what would they be told? "We are very sorry that you and your wives and families are starving, but wc can do nothing for you, because we have entered into a pledge not to re-open the Tai iff question for two years." If a manufacturer represented that he had invested £10,000 or £20,000 in his business, and that he was being driven to ruin he would be answered in similar words. If the proprietor of a large business instructed his manager to pursue a certain line of policy for three years, and the manager saw, after a little time, that things were going' wrong, and at the same time saw he could devise means to bring about a change for the better, would he not disregard his instructions and apply the remedy ? We are here as managers for the electors of the Commonwealth, and, even supposing that we gave them a pledge not to re-open the Tariff question, is it not our duty to da what we conceive to be best in the general interest, and to admit that we gave the pledge under a misapprehension ? We were sent here to manage the affairs of the country to the best advantage, and to do all we can by legislation to bring about prosperity. If I had given a pledge to my constituents not to re-open the Tariff for a certain time, I should be prepared to break it, as I would be sacrificing no principle, to tell them that I had seen my error, and had applied the remedy, and ask their approval of what I had clone. What would be the position of honorable members who told the electors. " We saw the blunder that we had made, and recognised that our industries were being ruined, but we felt that we were I bound to stand by our pledge to you." I think that many of such honorable members would be replaced by men better capable of acting as business managers for the general community. I think that I have given a good many reasons for my want of confidence in the Government, and several of their supporters. It is not surprising that the words of Milton should apply to the Prime Minister - </para>

            <para>- That is not the case on this occasion. The honorable member was just as much afraid as was any other honorable member, or he would not have acted as he did with regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. A good deal has been said with regard to the expense which would be incurred if a dissolution took place. I would ask, how much money we are wasting, owing to the do nothing policy which is now being followed? The loss to the country will be three or four times as great as the amount mentioned if we go on much longer as we are now doing. Further than that, what will be the cost to our manufacturers and cur workmen ? The Prime Minister ought to be ashamed of himself if he carries on the Government without a majority. I contend that he has not a majority. The honorable member for Wilmot, who thinks that he has saved the situation, denounces the Government just as strongly as do members of the Labour Party. Then, again, the honorable and learned member for Parkes is rarely to be seen in his place. The Prime Minister will frequently find himself in a minority, and unless he can secure the support of honorable members on this side of the House, he will experience great difficulty in transacting the public business. The best and cheapest way out of the difficulty would be a dissolution. Honorable members on this side would have nothing to fear from an appeal to the country, because I I am quite sure that if the Prime Minister submits his policy to the electors, he will suffer a drubbing even more severe than that which was administered to him upon the last occasion. </para>
