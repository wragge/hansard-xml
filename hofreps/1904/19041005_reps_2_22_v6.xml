                            <para>-I should like at the outset, by way of exposition pf my own position, to allude to a number of the many circumstances which have led up to the present situation. &#39; It is rather remarkable that the fight in connexion with the Arbitration Bill has completely changed its ground. Before the last election it was thought that the great struggle in connexion with the Bill would be on the question of including public and railway servants&#39;; but that appears to have been lost sight of now. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking for myself, and will leave them to speak for themselves. There is one incident in connexion with that vote which is&#34; worth noting. The right honorable member for East Sydney, who was then leading the Opposition, did his best to bring about an. arrangement with the leader of the Labour Party to procure the defeat of the Government of the day. It is well known to every member of the House that, although he was professing to be with the Government on the question, he tried to bring about an alliance, or a coalition, or a conjunction, or whatever name he pleases to give it, with the Labour Party, against whom he is now fighting. </para>

                            <para>- When the Barton Government, in which the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was Attorney-General, threw the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill under the table, refusing to go further with it. My right honorable friend must know well that the Barton Government was trembling in the balance while he was trying to negotiate with the Labour Party, to use them as a lever to turn it out of office. However, the House went to the country, and I stated to my constituents that I had voted for the inclusion of the railway men in the Bill, and intended to do so again ; but, to my certain knowledge, I lost hundreds of votes by the further declaration that, if my action would be likely to put the Deakin Government out of office, and allow the leader of the Free-trade Party to take possession of the Treasury benches, I would not vote for the inclusion of the railway servants in the Bill. I took that stand, because I knew that the right honorable member was opposed to arbitration, and to the policy which has given us our industries. </para>

                            <para>- My course was rendered easier by the fact that the right honorable gentleman announced that he would vote with the Government on the question. That robbed the division of all party semblance, and made it improbable, if not impossible, that he should be sent for by the Governor-General. More than that, I knew - and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat will bear me out in this statement - that- it was the policy of the party with which I was allied, and&#34; of its leader, to sit in the Ministerial corner, and to be in the House what the Labour Party had hitherto been. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It was told to me, and to other honorable members, and to mutual friends outside. The understanding was that the party should sit in the Ministerial. Corner, and should be in the House what the Labour Party had hitherto been. The whole of its energies were to be directed towards regulating the policy of the Government, and, above all, to keeping the Free-trade Party off the Treasury benches. </para>

                            <para>- That suits my purpose quite as well. The object was to maintain our integrity as a party so that we might become masters of the situation in the House, and prevent the Free-trade Party which we had been fighting right up to that time from occupying the Treasury benches. That is where the first difficulty arose. The first caucus then took place, and the leader of the Protectionist Party was requested to interview the leader of the Labour Party and the leader of the Free-trade Party. </para>

                    <para>What happened then? The Watson Government was assailed on a proposal to recommit a vital clause in the Arbitration Bill. In my judgment, the action of the then Opposition was unwarranted, unparliamentary, and unfair. I may . be wrong, but that is the honest conclusion at which I have arrived. The Prime Minister was anxious to turn out the Watson Government. No honest attempt was made to arrive at a decision with regard to the clause in dispute; but the right honorable gentleman made use of his majority to prevent the Bill from being recommitted. I have no hesitation in saying that if the Bill had been recommitted a clause satisfactory to all parties would have been framed, and the Bill would have been placed upon our statute-book. </para>

                            <para>- Not personally. My course was clear and definite. The people of Victoria had no faith in the then leader of the Opposition as head of a Government, and my object was to do- my best to keep him off the Treasury benches. At that juncture there was a distinct understanding arrived at that it was inadvisable to enter into any coalition. It was clearly understood that no coalition could be agreed to unless the honorable and&#39; learned member for Ballarat was to become Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Then what is the combination opposite? Honorable members talk about a private understanding, and about something which has not yet been explained. Will they tell me what took place at the private meeting which was held between the present Prime Minister and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat when they were concealed in a cottage at Richmond, and had a watchman to guard them against intrusion, whilst they were conducting their negotiations? If there be any mystery at all, certainly it attaches to the coalition opposite, and not to the party with which I am associated. I now come to the next stage. So far as I am personally concerned, every one of my actions was full&#34; made known &#34;to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. Some honorable members, including the honorable member for Laanecoorie, have spoken of a project to form a new organization. I know nothing of any new organization, and I frankly believe that there was never any serious proposal to establish one. I told the honorable and learned member for Ballarat that I was not aware of any such project. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. All I know is that the gathering was open, fair, and) above board. The only announcement which I saw of the meeting was in the columns of the press, and every member of my party received the same announcement. Before that meeting was held, I acquainted the honorable and learned member for Ballarat with the fact that I purposed attending, and with my object in so doing. In the meantime, the Coalition was formed, and the Treasurer was nominated for the time being as the leader of the Protectionist Party. He handed his charge over to the honorable member for Gippsland, who in turn has handed it over to the leader of the Free-trade Party, the present Prime Minister. At the gathering te which I have already ref erred, we merely elected a chairman. We did not elect a leader or a secretary. We did nothing to shut out any member of the Liberal-Protectionist Party. A little later an invitation came from the present leader of the Opposition, to meet the members of his party in conference. We invited every member of the Protectionist Party to meet them in conference. </para>

My honorable friend, however, need not trouble himself to inquire into the matter, because he was not interested in any way. I have endeavoured&#39; to make it clear that we did nothing behind the back of our leader, that we did nothing to destroy, the Protectionist Party, tha&#39;t we left the door open, and that we entered into the present alliance at the request of the leader of the Labour Party. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I regretted&#34; it. That, however, was entirely his own business, and not mine. Having explained my personal position, I now come to the reasons which impel me to support this no-confidence  motion. In the first place, I am opposed to the Government because I object to the way in which they secured pos session of the Treasury benches. I have a lively recollection of the present Prime Minister,&#34; when sitting in opposition, pointing the finger of scorn at the honorable member for Bland, who was then leader of the Government, and saying - &#34;When the honorable member gets upon the Treasury benches by the votes of the people of the Commonwealth, he will have something, to be proud of.&#34; I repeat those words to him to-day. When he obtains possession of the Treasury benches by the votes of the electors of the Commonwealth, and not by intriguing and by shameful political demoralization that is a disgrace to those who are parties to it, he will have something to be proud of. </para>

                            <para>- I protest against the manner in which the right honorable gentleman secured possession of the Treasury benches. It is well known that had he tabled a direct no-confidence motion against the Watson Administration, he would have had not the faintest hope of carrying it. It is an open secret that a number of honorable members supported the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corinella, under shelter of which the present Prime Minister secured office, who would not have dared to vote in favour of a direct motion of no-confidence. As a matter of fact, some of these, gentlemen had actually gone to the then Prime Minister and assured him that so long as he conducted business upon the lines&#39; he was pursuing he would have their moral support, and would command their votes. Consequently, I repeat that had a direct no-confidence motion been tabled by the leader of the Free-trade Party he would not have secured office. </para>

                            <para>- There is absolutely no analogy between the two cases. The leader of the Labour Party did not seek for office ; he did not want it. He came into power because of the action of unprincipled wreckers upon the other side of the House, who, in order to displace the Deakin Government, voted for an amendment in which they did&#39; not believe. </para>

The present Prime Minister did not raise his little finger in order to prevent conduct which seems to me both inexplicable and politically immoral. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, in trying to explain his present position, wished to know what the contention was all about, and urged that the Victorian Factories Act and its system of Wages Boards was quite as efficacious as any Arbitration Act which we could put upon the statute-book. He said that there was no preference to unionists under the .Victorian Factories Act. </para>

                                <para>- It undoubtedly does. I say, with all respect to the honorable and learned member, that his remarks showed that he knew nothing whatever about the working of factories legislation in Victoria. It is a notorious fact that employes&#39; representatives upon three or four at least of the first Wages Boards were turned adrift, and that some of them are begging for work in the streets of Melbourne to-day. I could give their names. I have a list containing the names of no less than thirty -eight really good men and women, who were prominent as representatives of the employes on the Wages Boards, and who have been dismissed for some reason. Of course, they were not dismissed for being members of Wages Boards ; that cause was not assigned. But they have been dismissed. I contend that some such clause as the preference clause is necessary in order to protect such people, and to give them security that when they are doing the work of their fellow employes and of the country, the employers shall not make scapegoats of them and turn them adrift. It is notorious that four members of the Butchers&#39; Board - some of the best men in the trade - were dismissed by their employers. One or two have started in business for themselves after going through a period of difficulty and privation. Others are still out of employment, because they could not get work with other employers. Yet the honorable and learned member for Bendigo says that the Victorian Factories Act is effective. The facts show conclusively that the preference for unionists provision is needed. I am opposed to the Government also on account of their constitution. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that he was beaten, and has said that he is quite prepared to accept a truce and to carry it out honorably. But what did the right honorable gentleman say just before the last election? He said in a speech at Warrnambool, in regard to the Tariff - </para>

                            <para>There must be no ambiguity as to his position. The Government was unpopular, and thousands of protectionists would support him, only they were afraid of what he would do. They would put him into power if they could do it without danger to their cause, but he was not to be bought or bribed by their support from his allegiance to the cause to which he was pledged. </para>

Take the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bevan</inline> - who, by-the-by, has been lecturing this House in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to-day on account of the long speeches of honorable members, though the same venerable gentleman did not lecture prominent free-traders when they spoke for hours, and when they were doing their best to destroy Victorian industries. It is a remarkable thing that he should only now discover that long speeches are made in this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>I have no faith in coalitions. The working out of great principles is best done by means of the opposition of great parties. This is so, not only in politics, but also in the church. I can understand a man believing in protection, and there are logical arguments in favour of free-trade, but 1 cannot see any advantage in sinking a principle simply to secure a majority in the Federal Parliament with the view of re-adjusting the relationship of parties. I will not say such a course is immoral, but it tends to political immorality on the part of the followers of both parties. Perhaps a party is never so well off as when it is weak in Parliament but strong outside, and it behoves all free-traders outside Parliament to work hard in the interests of the cause. </para>

                                <para>- Without any reservations whatever at that time. I firmly believed when I addressed my constituents that, although the present Tariff was far from being a protectionist one from my point of view, and although it had already begun to injure a number of industries, fiscal peace was the best policy for the Protectionist Party, which was led at the time by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, to pursue. Why did we propose that policy? Because we believed it was the best in the interests of the industries. We did not announce that policy because we believed entirely in the existing Tariff, or because we believed it was a final settlement of the question, but because we thought that by adopting a policy of. fiscal peace we should be best serving the interests of the Commonwealth, best protecting its industries, and accepting the lesser of two evils. </para>

If I had thought that a policy of higher duties, which I consider right and necessary, would have been the safest in the interests of the Commonwealth, I should have fought for that policy, and I think that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat would in those circumstances have fought with me. The party adopted the policy which appeared at the time to be best. But what do we find? Not three months elapsed before an agitation was got up in connexion with our industries. I have been charged with introducing this matter into the House in order to help the Labour Party, and to injure the present Prime Minister. I am charged with doing this for purely party reasons. </para>

The Trades Hall Council were followed by the Chamber of Manufactures. They are distinctly separate from one another, and will not even meet in conference. They have positively refused to do so upon a question pertaining to their common good and future welfare. There can, therefore, be no suggestion of any coalition or mutual understanding on the part of those two two bodies in connexion with this matter. The fact that industries were being injured was forced upon the Chamber of Manufactures. They appointed a special committee, and the results of their inquiries, as set out in the daily organ of the Protectionist Party, have demonstrated that a number of industries were being injured, especially those in connexion with the iron trade, that there was stagnation, and that skilled workmen were leaving our shores. We are told that this is only a bogy, and that there is nothing in it. The honorable member for Grampians yesterday said that it was brought into the House for party purposes, and that there was nothing in it. He said that he knew very well that I voiced my own sentiments with respect to the effect of the Tariff upon our industries, that I was doing so for party purposes, and was solely responsible. </para>

The meeting was presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O.</inline> C. Beale, who is said to be against the Labour Party and against the re-opening of the Tariff, because he thinks that it is being sought in the interests of Socialism and the Socialistic Party.

                            <para>The manufacturers fully realized, when they entered the Commonwealth partnership, that they would have to make sacrifices, but annihilation was never entertained nor anticipated. Under the Victorian Tariff men were given every encouragement to establish manufacturing industries. The result of their enterprise and labour was reinvested in plant; their business and machinery were their children&#39;s sustenance and inheritance. Suddenly, by inconsistent Acts of Parliament, these honourable industries are, perhaps slowly (because of the dogged character of the men conducting them), but nevertheless surely condemned to death. Manufacturers are not wreckers ; they disclaim any intention to rip up the Tariff or dislocate trade. We want more trade, and it is felt that the many anomalies which have disclosed themselves in the operation of the Tariff might be at once investigated and adjusted. The country should go straight for preferential trade. It means preference for their produce by upwards of 50,000,000 of people in the northern hemisphere, who are existing under reverse seasons, which enables us to fill their demand in their close season. </para>

                        <para class="block">That shows conclusively that he was voicing the opinion which I had expressed here, not for the purpose of displacing or strengthening the Ministry, but for the purpose of trying to save those industries which in Victoria are languishing. What do honorable members opposite propose? They, too, propose that there shall be an inquiry. Of what character is it to be? They propose that the inquiry should not take place during this Parliament, for their leader, in an interview as late as Monday last, named a number qf honorable members on his side who are pledged to fiscal peace for the life of this Parliament, and said that no contrary step is to be taken. This is a matter of urgency. I contend that, did this House realize its duty, it would immediately afford relief to the engineering trade, if to no other. A committee appointed on the lines suggested in the programme of the allied parties could deal at once with the trades one by one, report to the House, and afford it- an opportunity of taking measures of relief at the earliest possible moment. If honorable members like to charge me with having broken my election pledges I am quite prepared to plead guilty, but I know that hundreds of men are out of work in this particular branch of trade. I know facts with which I was not acquainted when I addressed my constituents and advocated fiscal peace extending over a term of years. That is the present position. </para>

                                <para>- I do not believe there are. I was saying when I was interrupted that we went before the electors with our policy clearly understood, and believed it to be the best one. When I was head of the volunteer fire brigades we came to a mutual understanding that the plugs in a certain municipality should be entirely under the control of the brigade therein, and that the plugs in an adjoining municipality .should be under the control of the brigade there. A fire occurred in one of the municipalities, and the first brigade to arrive was the one which was prohibited by the mutual understanding from using the plugs in that municipality. What did they do? In order to faithfully observe that understanding, which <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> written, and not oral, they positively looked on at the plugs until a crowd of persons standing by took the hydrant, sank it, and got water playing on to the burning buildings. The position here is analogous. Our party came to an agreement which we believed was an honorable and fair one, but while we are trying to make out that it is more important to observe its letter than to help the industries, hundreds of men are walking the streets and the industries are being destroyed: That is the position at the present moment. And yet some men who call themselves protectionists are sheltering themselves against taking the first opportunity to relieve struggling and strangled industries by saying, &#34; Did we not agree to a truce, and was it not an understanding that we should not re-open the fiscal question during the present Parliament?&#34; It was an understanding that the plugs should be opened only under certain conditions, but a house was being destroyed, and had not the bystanders taken the matter into their own hands the complete destruction of the house would have been inevitable. And seeing that circumstances have changed, this House would be equally justified in taking in hand the fiscal question, notwithstanding the agreement, and affording immediate help and assistance. </para>

Did the honorable and learned member for Ballarat indicate that in the faintest degree ? Would the . Minister of Trade and Customs have dared to go to his constituency and advocate such a thing? Yet, he tells me that, because we are advocating fiscal peace, we must go to the country, and must face our constituents before we attempt to give relief. </para>

I am not ashamed&#39; of anything that has been done at No. 66 Bourke-street. If fiscal peace was the issue before the electors, and we, on this side, have violated our pledges, what is the position of my honorable friends opposite? Was the verdict of the constituencies asked in regard to a coalition between free-traders and protectionists? Was such a coalition ever dreamt of? Was it not condemned by protectionists and freetraders alike, through the length and breadth of Victoria? Has one resolution been passed in favour of it, or has one constituency given it a cheer? When the Minister of Defence went to his constituency, did not his best friends express the opinion that it was a matter of regret that, with his abilities, he was not filling a position in a Liberal instead of in a mongrel Government? </para>

It comes with exceeding bad grace from honorable members opposite, however, to taunt me with having broken my election pledges, because I am going for an extension of the policy with which I have been associated during my whole life- The honorable member for Gippsland says that I should consult my constituents; but they consult me every morning before I leave home, and at the place of business of which the honorable member for Parramatta has quoted the number. They are out of work, and are pleading that I should do something to remedy the present state of affairs. I shall be prepared to consult my constituents when I feel that I am in the slightest degree out of accord with their wishes and aspirations. But I am voicing the opinions of nine out of ten of them, and of nineteen out of twenty of the people of Victoria, when I say that it is the duty of this Parliament to take immediate steps to protect our industries. </para>

                                <para>- I come now to the attitude of the Government in regard to the Labour Party. I have been taunted with having said something at the last elections which should irrevocably and eternally keep me from working with- that party, though that taunt is a remarkable one to come from honorable gentlemen who have pointed the finger of scorn at the Labour Party for having opposed me while I was so much in accord with them and their programme. They have tried to make it appear that in entering into an alliance with the Labour Party, I am deserting my leader, and breaking away from my election pledges. My attitude towards the party was deliberately and clearly set out in an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews</inline> a month after the elections. </para>

                        <para class="block">Those sentences show that I was in &#39; touch with the platform and aspirations of the party. It was because I objected and refused to sign their retiring pledge that I was opposed at the elections, not because I was out of touch with their programme, or their politics generally. Then it has been asked, what have those on this side of the House done for the policy of protection, with which I am more closely associated? The honorable member for Echuca said that during the great Tariff struggle) the Trades Hall Council did nothing whatever; but had it not been for their influence with labour members, and their Conference with the Protectionist Association, the only effective duties in the Tariff - the boot and hat duties - would not have become law. The Trades Hall party secured the votes of a number of men who were avowed freetraders, by representing to them that these industries would be destroyed if lower duties were imposed, and it was protectionist votes that prevented even higher duties from being placed on those particular articles. Whatever the Labour Parties in the other States may have done, in Victoria that party is pledged to the hilt to protection, and the Trades Hall Council here has invariably supported men and measures connected with the protectionist policy. The same thing may be said of it at the present juncture. The honorable member for Flinders went so far as to say that every protectionist who at the next election declared himself to be in favour of higher duties would be branded as a Socialist. </para>

                                <para>- It is practically the same as the statement I made in the first instance. Then, the honorable member for Grampians concluded his speech yesterday by saying that it was the intention of his party to fight Socialists and Socialism. What did the honorable member mean ? Did he mean the Continental Socialism that abstracts all ideas of character, morality, and religion? Because, if so, I may tell the honorable member that every man in this House is determined to fight against it. I am quite sure that there is not the faintest fear of that kind of Socialism ever taking root in Victoria, because the working classes have too much &#34;sense to think of encouraging i&#39;t. There is. not a man on this side of the House who would not fight with all his strength against it. I am confident, however, that the fight that is now being waged is not against Socialism as it is known on the Continent, but against social reforms, factory legislation, and the emancipation of the workers on the lines of social evolution. It is not a fight against Socialism, but against the bogy which the Conservatives are parading before the people of Victoria. They are appealing to all the most selfish feelings of the classes, and asking them to rally round the present Government. The employers&#39; unions, the national leagues., the farmers&#39; leagues, and the freetrade associations are all uniting, to fight under the one flag. Against what? Against Socialism? Nothing of the kind. They are uniting to fight against that movement which is supported in Great Britain by such men as Professor Shuttleworth, the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, Canon Scott Holland, Bishop Gore, the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sprague,</inline> and others - a movement which finds advocates in Australia in such men as Bishop Mercer, of Tasmania, the Rev. Charles Strong, and other eminent men. These are the men against whom the Government and the forces behind them are fighting, and it is social reform that they are combating. Seated upon the &#39; Government benches are men who have opposed every proposal for the emancipation of the workers, men who voted to establish Chinese communities in the very heart of South Africa, and who would destroy the Empire, rather than allow men and women to be considered before material considerations. They represent those whose opinions are voiced in Great Britain by such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Chamberlain, who, when addressing a meeting of shareholders in connexion with a large manufacturing concern at Birmingham recently, is reported to have said- </para>

Is not tha: the sentiment that is being voiced by the men represented by honorable members opposite? Do they not belong to that school of thought in Victoria, and in Australia, that has always been opposed to progressive legislation? I repeat that&#39; this is not a . fight against Socialism, but an attempt to annihilate the Labour Party, to crush out all those forces that make for social reform and the amelioration of the condition of the masses. For those reasons I am opposed to the Government I am confident that the country will also prove hostile to it. The electors never sanctioned the present coalition. No suggestion of such a combination was breathed during the last election, and I am sure that when the next election takes place the decision of the people will be emphatically against the apparent policy of the present Government. </para>

                                <para>- I took advantage of the very first opportunity that presented itself after I had taken my seat in this corner, to clearly define my position. It is a pity that some honorable members opposite did not also take the House into their confidence in regard to their relationship with the respective leaders of the different parties, and . concerning their political prospects. On the 18th August last - a short time after the present Government had assumed&#39; office - in replying to the observations of some members of the Opposition, who had extended sympathy to me in my position, I am reported to have said - i have this comforting reflection : that as soon as there is any deviation from the programme laid down, or the policy which i am here to support, the gentlemen who constitute the present Cabinet know that they cannot hope for any allegiance of mine. </para>

                        <para class="block">Is there any evidence of a coalition there? None whatever. I went on to say that I was then just as free to follow my own convictions and fulfil my own pledges as I was during the tenure of office of the Watson Administration. Can honorable members say that upon any occasion I have swerved in the slightest degree from my expressed opinions? Those who declare that honorable members upon this side of the House are opposed to social reform, merely make bald statements for the purpose of giving them publicity, because they cannot substantiate them. This afternoon the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has told Australia what the greater number of people believed to be his exact position, although up till the present time they had had no public announcement of it. He has declared that he is part and parcel of the Labour Party. </para>

                                <para>- Practically he has said so. The interjection of the honorable member for Bourke reminds me of the analogy between his own case and that of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. What was their position upon the eve of the last general election ? What about the party which was after a percentage of the &#34; screw &#34; of the honorable member for Bourke ? What about the little clique that was going to dominate his constituency - that little coterie of wire-pullers who wanted his billet? What is his position to-day? He is a party to an alliance which practically places him in the hands of that little clique. In &#39;addressing&#39; an audience at Melbourne Ports during the last election campaign, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports said that he had been asked nominally to sign the labour pledge, and that he would then be recognised as a member of the Labour Party. Thereupon an interjector - one of those objectionable individuals whom we all meet at political meetings when we are looking into the cold and steely eye of the elector - inquired, &#34; Then the Political Labour League is not a success ?&#34; In reply, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, said, &#34; Not only is it not a success, but it is an absolute fraud.&#34; What has the honorable member done now ? Has he not pledged himself to a manifesto embodying the fundamental principles by which the Labour Party is bound together? The honorable member for Bourke occupies a similar position. He denounced to his constituents the tactics of the Political Labour League. He declared that they wanted a commission upon his &#34; screw,&#34; and wished to obtain his billet. They wanted him to sign a pledge before <inline font-style="italic">tks</inline> electors could know whc the selected candidate would be. </para>

                                <para>- Truly, the Parliamentary Labour Party - as the leader of the Opposition recently informed the public at a pleasant Sunday afternoon meeting - is purely the creation of outside organizations. Yet, forsooth, these honorable members talk about the conservatives being ranked upon this side of the Chamber. There are honorable members sitting upon the Ministerial benches who are not going to warp their political convictions to please any one. What have the protectionist members gained by entering into this wonderful alliance? From its manifesto, I gather that each party is to retain its separate identity, that the alliance is to continue during the life of this and the next Parliament, and that each member of it is to use his influence individually and collectively with its organizations and supporters, to secure support for, and immunity from opposition to members of either party during the currency of the alliance. is not that a complete admission that they approve of the conditions under which the members of the Labour Party are nominated for election? Undoubtedly it is. What an illogical position is that occupied by the honorable member for <inline font-style="italic">Bourke,</inline> who at. the last general election denounced the practice? Why, to-day, he is a party to machine politics. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. That is the whole of my point. The honorable member has entered into an alliance with the party which approves of forcing upon electors a candidate of . whom they know nothing. He is a party to that proposal at the present time. But I do not intend wittingly to be drawn into any recriminations with honorable members in any part of the House. At this stage, I wish to repeat what I have already declared from many platforms, and also in this House. If there is one thing more than another which I admire and respect, it is the self-sacrifice and solidarity of the Labour Party in attempting to achieve the principles in which they believe. Those who endeavour to raise up a bogy in the form of Socialism - for I regard it merely as a bogy- </para>

                                <para>- I have made that statement in my own constituency within the last month or two, and I also made it. from the public platform on the eve of the last election. The cry in regard to Socialism is merely a bogy. When we hear such a confusion of terms as we heard the other night, when some honorable members seemed to think that the resumption of land for closer settlement and land nationalization were identical, it is evident that some of us require a little more education in political matters. It is said that because we sit on this side of the House we have no sympathy with industrial workers or with social reform. It is admitted that the Labour Party is the evolution of recent times. In Victoria we have known it as a party for, perhaps, twelve or fourteen-&#39; years. I think that the honorable member for Melbourne Was one of the first members of the Labour Party in Victoria. A member of another place, who has the respect of every one who knows him, was another member of it. These facts being known, is it not a piece of arrogance to say that the condition of the workers in Australia is the result of the zeal and industry of the Labour Party? What party is it that has done so much for the betterment of the industrial section of the community ? </para>

                                <para>- I do not intend to raise the fiscal question at this point, but there are men who, irrespective of their views on free-trade and protection, have given their best efforts, as far as their opportunities would permit, to create a standard of comfort and of living for the industrial classes. Now, however, we have the Labour Party - I say it with all respect to them - attempting to belittle what has been done by their predecessors, and to hound out of public life some of those who have done so much in the past. They attempted to drive out of politics in Victoria at the last general election, a man who, above all others in Australia, has done most in the interests of the workers. The political Labour Council of this State attempted to secure his defeat. It is unnecessary for me to mention his name. He now occupies a seat in another branch&#39; of the legislature. No man has rendered better service in the interests of the workers of Australia, or has made greater sacrifices. I remember the time - not many years ago - when that gentleman&#39;s name was anathema to the employers throughout the length and breadth, not of Victoria alone, but of Australia. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports can confirm what I say. But no one could have been more bitterly and unfairly opposed than that gentleman was. And by whom? Not by the liberals, not by the conservatives - who, although they never agreed with him, still respect the man for his ability and his courage - but by those very classes for whom he has done so much, the nominees of the Political Labour Council of Victoria. </para>

                                <para>- It is not the alliance I am condemning, but the machine by which one party to the alliance is dominated. The words of the honorable and learned member for Indi, by which he announced in all seriousness that the &#34; happy alliance &#34; had been consummated, are still ringing in our ears. I shall not attempt to disparage that honorable and learned member in any way. Many years ago in the State Parliament I greatly admired the way in which he conducted his case, when in charge of certain measures, and had arrayed against him most of the legal ability in Parliament.

But with respect to the alliance, I wish to know whether the marriage settlement was properly signed, and whether the endowments were duly made; because we have the author of the Labour Party already demanding a divorce; we have the Political Labour Council saying to the Labour Party, in this House, &#34; When you go before your constituents you shall be no parties to this alliance.&#34; </para>

The Labour members of the Federal Parliament had agreed to use their influence towards securing to those who were members of the alliance immunity from opposition. If an organization desired to put forward a candidate in opposition to those who were combining with the Labour Party, there was nothing to prevent them doing so. </para>

                                <para>- All. I believe we are the same happy band still. The little fences which honorable members opposite have attempted to put up will not effect what they desire. There is no danger whatever of that; and I feel that when the battle-cry is raised on the big principle we have at heart honorable members are not going to sacrifice it for any reason. For the present, so far as I am concerned, on the eve of the last Federal election, rightly or wrongly, I pledged myself to fiscal peace for the life of this Parliament, with one reservation, and one alone, which was to this effect: that should the Imperial Parliament submit a proposal for preferential trade, I was prepared to alter such items of the Tariff as might be necessary, in order to comply with that request. </para>

                                <para>- Ten months ago!. Has the honorable member for Melbourne Ports been asleep since, or was he asleep then? Was he asleep when the interests of the manufacturers of Australia were at stake, and when suggestions came back to this Chamber from the Senate? At that time I believe that I alone suggested to the then leader of the Government, the , honorable and learned member for Ballarat, that he should throw the whole thing under the table, and then let us fight for protection or free-trade. </para>

                                <para>- No; there was no division. Of what use would it have been ? The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has now had a sudden awakening. Surely those who had any knowledge of the conditions prevailing in Victoria under a protectionist Tariff could foresee, with a fair degree of accuracy, what was going to occur as the result of the reduced duties then being forced upon this House. I never had a doubt as to what the result, would be. Take, for instance, the reduction of the duties on agricultural machinery from 25 to 12^ per cent, and the alterations of the duties on some of the minor lines which the manufacturers were using. I realized then that it would mean ruin to the industry. Still, in face of that fact, at the last general election I dis- &#39; tinctly said that for the life of this Parliament there ought to be fiscal peace. </para>

                                <para>- Those who charge the followers of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat sitting on this side with having deserted the party and their principles, forget the position in which they themselves are. They have not yet told the House how they expect to get a revision of the Tariff from the party with which they are allied. The honorable member for Gwydir has just stated - and I think it is a reasonable assumption - that the honorable member for Bland, as a party leader, has practically no fiscal policy. Then, it is said, &#34;Oh, look at the Prime Minister; you are sitting behind a free-trader.&#34; I admit that a man is the creature of his environment to a very great extent, but I do not forget that as a small handicap on the Prime Minister, we have two dead- weight protectionists, in the persons of the honorable member for Gippsland, and the right honorable member for Balaclava. </para>

                                <para>- Will the honorable member look at the occupants of the benches on his right hand, and say if equal ballast is to be found there? It will be just as difficult for him to carry the honorable member for Maranoa across the plains of Riverina as it would be for any honorable member on this side to carry the Prime Minister. Will the honorable and learned member for Indi, the second leader of this party, after his experience as a colleague for six years with, and under the leadership of, the right honorable member for Balaclava, question his honesty or integrity of purpose? Will he, even in his mildest breath, murmur that there is a possibility of the Prime Minister - giving him credit for all the astuteness it is possible to have embodied in the human form - being able to turn in the slightest degree the Treasurer from his political- purpose? </para>

                                <para>- I am not assuming the role of apologist for the Prime Minister. 1 am placing before honorable members on the other side a few arguments which, I hope, will be answered. Their first cry - and, indeed, their only battle cry in substance - is the miserable charge made by the leader of the Opposition that the Government do not intend to introduce a High Commissioner Bill this session. What a puny charge ! If there was one thing which the people of Australia expected more than another, as the result of Federation, it was that the cost of the States Governments would be diminished in proportion to the cost of the Commonwealth Government. I should think that all honorable members will admit that when it is intended to appoint a High Commissioner for the Commonwealth it is a step in the right direction to ascertain if it is not possible to abolish the Agents-General, who are doing to-day that which he would do in the future. That charge against the Administration is a little too thin. Then it is uiged that the White Australia policy is in danger, presumably owing to some utterance of the Prime Minister in the last Parliament, or in his pre-election speeches. Now, honorable members who made that charge forget that it is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that hu has admitted to the House, as he has done in regard to the fiscal question, that he has not the numbers behind him. </para>

                                <para>- That is an old bogey. Assuming, however, that the right honor able gentleman said all that the English language would permit him to say about the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, does it follow, because men fight strenuously on some principles, that they are to be estranged for all time, and can not come together on other issues upon which they might join hands for their mutual benefit, and for the welfare of the country ? Is it statesmanship to refuse to take that course? Is the argument worthy of the &#34; higher and rarer atmosphere &#34; which we expected to find in this Parliament? No, that is paltry party politics. </para>

Therefore the only fault that honorable members Opposite can find with him is that he has not been recreant to his oath to administer the law as he found it.

                                <para>- What is the position of honorable members opposite in regard to preferential trade and the fiscal issue ? They are trying to make a battle cry of these things, in order to entangle protectionists. But, before I go back on my pledges, I shall take my constituents into my confidence. If the honorable member for Coolgardie was correctly reported - and the report has not been contradicted - he, speaking as a free-trader, at the Fitzroy Town Hall, told an audience within the past month that the Prime Minister had sold the free-traders. If tha.t is so, what have the protectionists who have joined him to fear? Seeing his present environment, and knowing the strong protectionist feeling by which he is surrounded, it seems to me that there is a danger of his slipping from grace in the direction of protection. I told my constituents that I would support fiscal peace during the present Parliament. I am not <inline font-style="italic">going to</inline> shelter behind the subterfuge put forward by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, that I was not aware at the time of the elections of the effect of the Tariff upon Australian industries, because I realized when the duties were reduced by the Senate to the starvation limit at which they now stand on the stature-book, that we had to accept them for at least five years to come. With regard to the working of the Tariff, honorable members opposite, led by the honorable and learned member for Indi, have asked for a patch-work investigation. </para>

                                <para>- I leave him to answer for himself. When I become Prime Minister, I shall be ready to answer questions about the occupant of that office. The honorable member for Hume has spoken of the result of the non-introduction of the Iron Bonus Bill, in keeping back the establishment of a possible industry. But what party was it that killed the&#39;Bill which he introduced? That little combine opposite, which is conscientiously opposed to bonuses in any shape or form, and whose members believe that the industry should be established only under State control. What is the position to-day? We know that the States will not undertake the development of the industry, and, therefore, honorable members opposite, if they were in power, would not reintroduce the Iron Bonus Bill. This is more playing to the gallery. </para>

What was it that created a split in the Deakin Party, so that now some sit on one side, and some on the other side of the gangway? If was the division taken on a clause of the Arbitration Bill. It would appear from the speeches of some honorable members that the principle of preference to unionists was then at stake ; but the leader of the Labour Party has shown that that principle was not challenged by the amendment. Preference had already been agreed to ; but an attempt was made to define, for the instruction of the Court, at what point it should be granted. </para>

I wish now to occupy a few minutes in putting before the House what appears to me to be the true cause of the attitude of honorable members opposite towards the Bill. We have been told how much the Hon. B. R. Wise did to get a Conciliation and Arbitration Act placed on the statute-book of New South. Wales. What did he say when he introduced the measure into the Legislative Council of New South Wales ? That there was no provision in the Bill that would place non-unionists at a disadvantage, as compared with unionists, in seeking employment. Was it not simply owing to judicial interpretation that it was eventually found that preference could be given to members of organizations ? </para>

                                <para>- I consider that if the late Prime Minister had had a proper appreciation of what was due to his position he would not have hesitated for a moment to place a straight-out issue before the House. He should have come down at the first opportunity after that division, and asked honorable members to reverse their votes. If they were not prepared to take that step, he should have resigned office at once. That was the constitutional course to adopt. What was done by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat? Did he consider his position for six weeks? Did he ask honorable members to eat the leek ? He told the House that he regarded a certain matter as vital, and that if a majority of honorable members voted against the Government he would resign his position. The honorable and learned member was honour and dignity personified. </para>

                                <para>- That interjection reminds me of one matter which I desire to have placed on record. Some honorable members have stated that they would have joined the alliance between the protectionists and the free-traders if the honorable and learned member for Ballarat had been the leader of the Government. Do not honorable members clearly see why the honorable and learned member cannot lead the party until the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is finally disposed of? Would the most humble of his followers, with any experience of public life, expect him to eat the leek, and adopt a Bill containing a provision to which he had expressed strong objection, even to the point of sacrificing his position on the Treasury benches ? </para>

                        <para class="block">That was the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Darling Downs, which, I think, I am right in saying, the late Prime Minister accepted. A proposal by the honorable member for Angas was under consideration, to the effect that the organizations should be constituted practically for the -purposes of the Bill. A number of honorable members, including myself, were not in favour of proceeding to that length, because we saw no reason why the existing organizations should not be utilized. I made the stipulation, however, that the organizations should not be permitted to have anything in their rules which would trammel the political actions of their members, and should not be allowed to use their funds for party political purposes. The honorable member for Kenendy stated that he had not been afforded an opportunity to vote against the amendment framed by the honorable member for Darling Downs. He represented that he had no choice between the amendment eventually adopted and that which was originally proposed. It is well known, however, that when a clause has been amended, an honorable member may- vote for or against what may be termed the substantive proposal. The honorable member might have moved an amendment or voted against the substantive proposal. The action taken, however, disclosed the reason why the amendment in clause 48 was made vital. The amendment in clause <inline font-style="italic">62</inline> was the fly in the ointment, because it deprived organizations constituted or utilized for the purposes of the Bill of their power as political machines. Was ever an honorable member placed in a more humiliating position than that occupied by the leader of the Opposition and honorable members sitting in the Opposition corner, who perfected the clause with his concurrence. When the honorable member for Kennedy moved that the clause should be excised, they went out of the House because they were unable to vote in support of the motion, unless they were prepared to swallow their previous -votes. Even the Prime Minister was dragged in the dust. A more degrading spectacle I never witnessed in any Parliament, and I trust that it will never be repeated. Some honorable members may think that this provision in clause 48 will prevent the Bill from being accepted by the trades organizations. </para>

                                <para>- That provision I claim, according to the statement of the leader of the Labour Party, has not endangered the principle of preference in the slightest degree. To urge that defeat upon a mere detail of the measure has caused the party to wash its hands of all responsibility, is scarcely in accordance with fact. . At any rate, that is my view of the situation. Personally, I have no regrets. I hope that I have said nothing offensive to those honorable members who were at one time associated with my party. I venture to say that when the occasion arises, it will be found that upon matters of broad principle, upon which we have stood shoulder to shoulder in the past, nothing will keep us apart. I say to members of the Labour Party, who arrogate to themselves the exclusive right to represent the interests of those engaged in the industrial life of Australia, that they - should extend to others a little of that tolerant spirit which they expect to have extended to them. When they point to the different opinions which have been expressed by free-traders and protectionists upon this side of the House, I would ask them to recollect that some of the most enthusiastic free-traders in Australia to-day are to be found amongst their ranks, and that the Labour Party has not yet publicly disclosed that it possesses any fiscal policy. To those of my late political friends, who declaim against honorable members sitting upon this side of the Chamber, and still acknowledging the leadership of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, I say that before they commenced to throw stones, they might at least, in justice to their late comrades, have informed them of their intentions. To the most ardent protectionist, who is inclined to exclaim, &#34; Your protectionist faith and principles are in danger,&#34; I reply, &#34; I do not fear to follow those who have allied themselves in the present Cabinet.&#34; Having regard to the political principles which have been entertained by the leader of public life in Victoria for so many years - I refer to the present Treasurer - and by the Minister of Trade and Customs, is there any likelihood - weak and unaccustomed as I am to the wiles of public life - of my own principles being sacrificed? </para>

                            <para>- Upon several occasions in the course of this debate, the honorable member for Laanecoorie and the Minister of Defence have referred to me, by way of interjection, as &#34; a new convert,&#34; and &#34; a new broom.&#34; I do not understand the point of the interjection, but if it is intended to imply that my advocacy of industrial legislation - legislation for the amelioration of the conditions of the masses - is of such recent date that I ought to be called &#34; a new convert,&#34; I hurl back the accusation with contempt. As you, sir, are aware, I have been twelve years in political life, and I challenge either of these gentlemen to point to any legislation that has been introduced for the advancement of the people which has not commanded my support. Prior to entering political life, I was for many years - and the honorable member for Laanecoorie when he made his statement was well aware of the fact - associated with the miners of the very district which he now represents. Only last year this &#34; new broom &#34; was asked to assist him at the general elections. Had he thought that I had no influence, or that I did not possess a record of good work accomplished in that locality, he would scarcely have requested me to assist him in his campaign. If, on the other hand, the term &#34; new broom &#34; has reference to the fact that I recently became a pledged member of the Labour Party, my reply is that I made the move voluntarily. I was not coerced from without, and certainly there was no coercion exercised from within. I threw in my lot with the fortunes of that party voluntarily, not because I was promised immunity from opposition at election time, Lui because I saw the political combination which was being effected. I noticed that the leading conservative journals were advo&#34;rating &#60; coalition of parties - not for the purpose of carrying on responsible government, tut with the avowed object of preventing labour from obtaining any more power than it at present possesses. When it became a question of joining the Free-trade-Conservatives and the Protectionist-Conservatives, who had banded together for the sole purpose of strangling the labour movement, and &#34; downing the Labour Party,&#34; I had no hesitation in declaring my position. I ask honorable members opposite if they have- ever had any doubt as to my attitude upon industrial matters ? When the Prime Minister advocated something in which I did not believe, I was never afraid to voice my opinions. I took care that there should be no misunderstanding. When an attempt was made to rope me in by making it appear that, at the last elections, we went to the country in opposition to the Deakin Government, I at once repudiated any understanding of that character. It has been acknowledged that at that time anybody could join the present Prime Minister if they, were sound in one faith, namely, a desire to displace the Deakin Government. Who would have dreamed when the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was originally introduced, that, it would have had such a rough and stormy passage ? We all recollect the occasion when a difference in regard to it occurred in the Barton Administration, as the result of which the right honorable member for Adelaide resigned his position.- A little later the honorable member for Kennedy carried an amendment, the effect of which was to make the Bill applicable to railway employes. Then the Barton Government abandoned the measure. The general election followed, and if there was one thing more than another which was placed clearly before the people during that campaign, it was the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. When this Parliament opened the measure was re-introduced, and the amendment to include within its provisions the &#91;railway servants of the States was again carried. As a result the Deakin Adminstration resigned. The Watson Government then assumed office, and they in turn were displaced upon the same measure. Now we have the composite Ministry that is before us. When I look at the Government, I find it difficult to understand how they can agree upon any policy, except it be a policy of doing nothing in order that they may retain their seats upon the Treasury benches. They certainly cannot remain there upon the fiscal issue. They admit that they have submitted no policy. Their apologist, the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, has informed the House that they have not yet had time to formulate a policy. He spoke of them as if they were inexperienced hands in the matter of Cabinet-making. They are certainly a very funny mixture. </para>

                        <para class="block">If I were asked to describe them, I should say that they were half fish and half fox. One-half of them are foxy, because of their cunning; and the other half are fishy, because of their slipperiness. It will be impossible for them, during the life of either the present or the next Parliament, to submit a policy upon which they are in anything like agreement. Then, look at their followers ! For example, there is the honorable member for Dalley, for whom I have the very greatest respect: How could a policy which would command his support suit the honorable member for Flinders, the honorable and learned member for Parkes, or the honorable member for Kooyong? The secret of the strength of the party, which is at present led by the Prime Minister, is that it is destitute of a policy. Despite the right honorable gentleman&#39;s boast, that he would put the fiscal issue before the electors clearly at the last election, did he not agree that every free-trade Victorian member should be allowed to sink that issue? </para>

                        <para>But, still, we in this young Commonwealth, viewing the history of the great nations where these joint interests fight to a point at which human life is ruthlessly sacrificed - remembering that behind all these employers and workmen there stands that great helpless element in our national life, the women and children of Australia; remembering that the homes of labour will, under a Bill of this sort, be more secure from the misery of poverty, and the agitation and dangerous ebulition of class feeling; remembering the great humanity which deals with this imperfect state of things - will, I hope, cheerfully pass this Bill, trusting that the time will come when, under a more rational and voluntary arrangement of intelligent men representing these great interests, a method will be found of settling their disputes without any recourse to legal machinery. </para>
                        <para class="block">In the same speech the right honorable gentleman said that it was one of the greatest tributes to the representatives of labour in Australia that they had agreed to allow the Judge of a Court to settle industrial disputes, instead of ha;-;ng recourse to the old methods. What has become of all those noble sentiments and aspirations? I felt my blood warm within me as I listened to that speech. I thought that the right honorable gentleman was the great democrat who was going to stand at the head of the forward movement in this country. But some little time afterwards, I had a rude awakening. The scales were removed from my political eyes when I heard this very man denounce those who, in New South Wales, had practically kept him in office tor years. He is now making political capital out of the fact that the alliance endeavours to secure immunity from opposition to those who are supporting it. But what did the right honorable gentleman do when the Barton Government dropped the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill in the last Parliament ? Did he not move the adjournment of the House, and while the debate on his motion was&#39; proceeding, was he not communicating with the Labour Party with the object of bringing about the defeat of the Government? Not only that, but the very thing that he is now condemning in the alliance - the granting of immunity from opposition - he agreed to grant to every labour man who stood at the elections. Yet we have this same gentleman posing before the public and saying that the Labour Party is a menace to Australia. I am glad that the Labour Party did not accept his overtures. Immediately after that, he entered into other intrigues to bring about the downfall of the Deakin Government. It is idle for him to say that simply because he voted with the honorable and learned member for Ballarat he could not have prevented the downfall of that gentleman&#39;s Government. While the Prime Minister was shaking hands with the then Prime Minister in voting with him, he was driving a political stiletto into the side ot his Government by the assistance of those who publicly declared that they voted against the Deakin Government in order to wreck the Bill, and the Ministry. The Prime Minister tacitly agreed to have the Bill killed.- Why ? Because he thought that if the Deakin Government were defeated he would be sent for. This is not idle talk. When the honorable member for Bland was sent for, did not the Prime Minister declare that he did not know on what constitutional grounds the Governor-General could send for him, instead of for the leader of the Opposition ? He complained bitterly about it. But still the right honorable gentleman did not abandon his attempt to get into office. Further intrigues were tried. He approached the honorable and learned member for Ballarat for the purpose of forming a coalition. There was to be no immunity from opposition for labour men then, but they were to be fought against in every shape and form. While the right honorable gentleman&#39;s party were prepared to swallow a coalition proposal, the Deakin party would not agree to it. Matters drifted on until the Watson Government was threatened with a no-confidence motion. The newspapers said that the right honorable gentleman had left Sydney with a no-confidence, motion in his pocket. The honorable member for Bland, while Prime Minister, announced in a speech in Sydney, that if clause 48 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill were not amended in Committee in a certain direction, his Government would resign. That was the right honorable gentleman&#39;s opportunity. </para>

It may be above my mental level to understand what the honorable member should have done in the case I referred to; but I challenged him last night to show one case on record where a Chairman of Committees had acted as he had acted. The honorable &#39; member pleaded as an excuse that he was representing his district, and that his vote should not be lost to his constituents, because he happened to be Chairman of Committees. I venture to say that when the honorable member accepted the position of Chairman of Committees, he knew, as you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> know, that one of the responsibilities attaching to such a position is that the honorable member accepting it has frequently no opportunity of recording his vote. I repeat that there is no case on record where a  Chairman  of Committees has done such a thing as was done by the honorable member for Laanecoorie. If there is such a case, I challenge honorable members who have yet to speak to quote it. </para>

What I say is that the immediate result of the course followed by the Chairman of Committees was to place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in such a position that he could not vote. Surely the  Speaker  has as good a right to a vote as has the  Chairman  of Committees ? Is it because the  Chairman  of Committees is an officer of their own creation that honorable members opposite claim that he should vote whenever they desire him to do so? I challenge the honorable member for Parramatta to state another case in which a  Chairman  of Committees has voted in the way in which the honorable member for Laanecoorie has done. </para>

                                <para>- I can refer honorable members to the action taken by one member of the Government, who is possessed of a conscience. I refer to the right honorable member for Balaclava. When that right honorable gentleman learned that the question which was to be decided was. whether the House should recommit a clause in order to consider whether or not it should be amended, and that the Watson Government staked their existence upon the recommittal, he gave a pair in favour of the Watson Government, and gave distinct reasons for his action. His reasons were that he had never in his experience known a case in which a Government asked for the recommittal of a clause, and when such a request was refused, and particularly when the Government staked their existence on the proposed recommittal. The Prime Minister said that the honorable member for Bland chose his Own ground. I say that is a distinct fabrication, and the right honorable gentleman well knew it. We know the intrigue that was going on for some days in order to secure to honorable members opposite the possession of the Treasury benches. We are told that it is their intention to restore responsible Government. Have we not had a lovely illustration of it? I invite honorable members to look at the exhibition of responsible Government which we have had during this debate? I ask them to consider the anxiety which the members of the Government have shown to remain a little longer on the Treasury benches. They have exhibited no anxiety to bring this debate to a close. It is, on the contrary, their desire that it should continue. That is evident from the. fact that at 10 o&#39;clock at night an honorable member has only to get up and ask for the adjournment of the debate, when immediately a representative of the Government will rise to say that the request is granted. </para>

I challenge the &#34;Government to push the motion speedily to a division. I am prepared to sit here night and day until the debate, is concluded ; but we know that the members of the Government are in no hurry to proceed with it. What an exhibition of responsible government it all is. Last night we had complaints about the way in which the debate was being conducted, and about the evident lack of desire on the part of the Government to push it along, and one-half of the head of the Government, the honorable member for Gippsland, said that with the assistance of the leader of the Opposition, the Government would try to. push the debate to a conclusion. The honorable gentleman excused the Government in . the matter by saying that the motion had been tabled by the . leader of the Opposition. This Government assumed office in order to restore responsible Government, and have they no concern about the management of the business of the House? I say that the anxiety which members of the Government exhibit to remain on the Treasury Benches is a disgrace to this House. If they are conducting responsible Government, and really control the business of the House, why do they not insist that the debate should be brought to a close at an early date? The honorable member for Laanecoorie seems to be very anxious about his present leader. He has complained that others have deserted their leader. When people live in glass houses they should be careful how they throw stones. Is it not a fact that the honorable member deserted his leader 021 two occasions when motions of want-of -confidence were submitted ? The honorable member now wishes to pose as a very loyal supporter. He gave expression to certain views at a banquet recently. I do not know whether what he said was due to exuberance of spirit, and if it was, I forgive him ; but it is difficult to believe that he said these words coolly and deliberately. The honorable member is reported to have said that - </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member is such a stickler for the good conduct of honorable members, why did he not protest when the Prime Minister used &#34; Billingsgate &#34; about a fortnight ago, and used certain dirty expressions when referring to the honorable and learned member for Corio. I have no hesitation in saying that the only man I ever heard use language in this House that might be termed &#34; Billingsgate &#34; is the present Prime Minister. Where was this censor of public morals that he did not bring his present leader to task on that occasion? It did not then suit the honorable member to do so, and I leave it to him to- explain his inconsistency as best he may. Some honorable members on the other side think that when they attack us we suffer in public estimation. We are told, forsooth, that we do not represent the real workers, that we have never done any hard work, and that the honorable member for Kooyong, the honorable member for Flinders, and the honorable and learned member for Parkes are the true representatives of the honest workers. Let me assure honorable members that every insult directed to this side of the House &#39;is an insult to the working men in Australia, and it is accepted in that way. I am asked why I object to this Government. I object to them, first, because of the way in which they got on to the Treasury Bench, and which, to say the least of it, was &#34;fishy,&#34; and secondly, because of the way in which they are deliberately misrepresenting the aims and aspirations of the Labour Party. Just imagine the Prime Minister standing up at a meeting of the Farmers&#39; and Producers&#39; League, and saying that the Labour Party would have an inspector on every farm. He knew that it was a base fabrication which he was addressing to his audience, and that fact and others of a similar nature make me feel more strongly against him than I should otherwise do. If he really believed these things, all honour to him for having the courage to express his thoughts ; but he knows quite differently. At another meeting, he said that under the Labour Party the &#34; Government stroke &#34; would be instituted in connexion with all Government undertakings. For five years he was Premier of New South Wales, and during that period a good many public works were carried out under his Government. It is a singular thing that he never discovered any sign of the &#34; Government stroke &#34; as a result of the labour movement. For five years his Ministerial existence depended upon the support of the Labour Party in that State, and a time came when he could not get them to do all he wished them to do. In view of that fact, it very ill becomes the right honorable gentleman to go before the electors of Australia, and try to throw dust in their eyes by saying that the aim of the Labour Party is to introduce the &#34; Government stroke &#34; everywhere. I am against the right honorable gentleman, too, because he took part in a meeting of the Women&#39;s League of Victoria, whose policy includes a plank for the purity of home life. That plank is an insult to every right-thinking man in this House, and I rejoice that the honorable member for Grampians refused to go upon their platform while their policy contained that plank. Does any one here imagine for a moment that we believe in a system of free love and the breaking up of home life, as is suggested bv some of our critics? When the right honorable gentleman went upon the platform of the Women&#39;s League, he must have known that that plank was a lie from start to finish. And yet the honorable member for Laanecoorie has not the courage to rise here and denounce that sort of thing. I am against the right honorable gentleman, too, because instead of trying to bring about conciliation between the two great forces, he is going upon every platform throughout Australia and stirring up class bitterness. He is stirring&#39; up strife between employers and employe&#39;s, and posing as the only &#34;Simon pure&#34; in connexion with this political crisis. He is appealing to the prejudices and passions of the great farming&#39; community. He has addressed to them remarks which he knew were not correct, and which have been contradicted here time after time. He has made that admission on the floor of the </para>

                        <para class="block">House, and yet he continues to make practically the same accusations, although they are couched in different words. I was amused at the sophistry of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, when in his laboured speech he tried to make the House believe that the Wages Boards and the Arbitration Court are synonymous. It was quite a revelation to me to hear his statement to that effect. His greenness was so conspicuous as to cause me some anxiety. There is no comparison between the Wages Board system of this State and the Arbitration Court sought to be created. The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is based upon organization. Its provisions cannot be given effect to, except by organization. An award cannot be carried out without organization. An organization must consist of at least 100 members before it can go to the Court. The honorable and learned member&#39;s attempt to justify his&#39; vote by the institution of that comparison was very lame, indeed. I was equally astounded at the new-born zeal of the honorable member for Echuca. It is certainly very refreshing to see the affection which he has bestowed upon the Prime Minister. It was only very recently that he used to describe the right honorable gentleman by such endearing terms as &#34; a political mountebank.&#34; &#34; a political humbug,&#34; and &#34; a political buffoon.&#34; And yet, to-day, we see him practically hugging the right honorable gentleman, and discovering in him some wonderful qualities which he never perceived before. This may not be politic, but it certainly has the recommendation of being honest. The difference between the honorable member for Echuca and myself is that, while I speak what I think, he does not speak what he thinks. It is interesting to notice the warmth of affection which he displays for this new combination. His record shows that he has always been against a Liberal Government. He is only masquerading in a Liberal&#39;s clothing. He got into congenial company, I think, when he crossed to the other side. If we take away from that side the honorable member for South Sydney, the honorable member for Parramatta, and the honorable member for Dalley, the honorable and learned member for Wannon, and the honorable member for New England, what sort of legislation would suit the other members on the Ministerial benches? There is a degree of similarity between the honorable and learned member for Wannon and the honorable member for New England. The former is a renegade Single-taxer. The other night he admitted the soft impeachment of having been at one time a single-taxer ; but he said that he &#39;has his politicaL sight now. Singular to say, he only cut his politcal wisdom teeth just prior to standing for a country seat. </para>

                                <para>- What did the honorable member for New England, who is always boasting ot his consistency, and never misses an opportunity of attacking the Labour Party and others who sit on this side, tell us the other night? He said, in effect, &#34;I una single-taxer. I do not want any of this land of trumpery legislation.&#34; But when he was asked if he would impose a Federal land tax, what did he say? &#34;No,&#34; he said, &#39;that was a proper thing for the States Parliaments to do.&#34; This bold apostle of Henry George ran away from a State Parliament where it was possible to impose a land tax, and got a seat in the Federal Parliament, so that he should not have to vote in support of his view. From the honorable member for Richmond we had a nice display the other day. I have a great admiration for him ; but I never take what he says very seriously. To me he is a political enigma, a sort of political&#34; monstrosity - what is called a sexless politician. He has no convictions. He repeatedly says, &#34; Why should I consider about any policy, why should 1 do anything, why should I have an opinion? We pay the Government .to have opinions.&#34; Those are the lines upon which he proceeds. He is very much like a chip in porridge in that respect. When any one who knows the honorable member reads the newspaper reports of his remarks, he merely remarks, &#34;It is only Tom Ewing who is speaking. He is never in earnest, he is joking. Take no notice of him.&#34; The Prime Minister, however, occupies a responsible position, and he goes before the public and deliberately misrepresents the aims of the Labour Party. On one occasion he said that he was against Socialism ; but he has modified that statement, and he ,is now against extreme Socialism. I wonder what he calls extreme Socialism. I should imagine that that plank in the platform of the Women&#39;s League of Victoria - a branch of the &#34;National Ass.&#34; - to which I have referred, would be extreme Socialism. I am a State Socialist, and I wish to briefly refer to what State Socialism has done for New Zealand. The policy of State Socialism is put into practice there, and it approaches more nearly to the policy of the Labour Party than does any other policy in Australia. </para>

                        <para class="block">It has been the policy of New Zealand for a number of years, and this year, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon&#39;s</inline> Budget speech, that Colony, after carrying forward ,&#163;350,000 to the Public Works Fund, has a surplus of &#163;649,740. One of the planks of the Labour Party is the stoppage of public borrowing. They believe that additions, extensions, and repairs, as well as new works, should, as far as possible, be paid for out of revenue, instead of out of loan funds. In New Zealand, between the years 1892 and 1904, they have in this way trans1f erred &#163;3,755,&#176;&#176;&#176; from the revenue account to the Public Works Fund, and by so doing, have saved the people ,&#163;119,800 annually in interest alone. Then they have a State bank there, which is another phase of State Socialism. That bank was established in 1895, and in 1904 had advanced ,&#163;4,009,520. As you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the institution of a State bank in South Australia meant cheaper money to the people there, and in New Zealand the slaving of interest has amounted to &#163;493,542. The total amount of the private loans in New Zealand has been estimated at &#163;^40, 000,000. Now. as we know from experience in South Australia, not only does a State bank reduce interest for those who borrow from it, but iti also saves interest to other persons, because the other banks and mercantile institutions have to reduce their rates to compete with the State institution. This saving has been calculated to amount to &#163;3,500,000 in New Zealand, which is nearly equal to the total amount that has been advanced by the State bank. That is an example of what can be done by State Socialism. They have also an old-age pensions fund there, and a number of other institutions for the amelioration of the conditions of the people. Although the number of pensioners is large - pensions are paid to between it, 000 and 12,000 persons - the Colony had a credit balance at the end of the financial .year, equal to nearly &#163;1, 000,000. Another socialistic project which has been carried into effect there is to re- purchase land for closer settlement. In this way 129 estates, comprising an aggregate area of 615.581 acres, have been acquired bv the Government, and of this area 576,045 acres have been subdivided into 2,729 holdings, classified and valued at &#163;3,030,462, and producing an annual rental of ,&#163;15 1, 523. The receipts during the past financial year amounted to &#163;150,883. There have been 2,076 houses erected on these properties, and 8,255 persons reside on them. The value of the improvements effected is &#163;608,611, and at the end of the financial year, after paying the cost of subdivision, interest, and other expenses, there was a profit of &#163;49,398, which will go towards the. purchase of other estates. There are also State Insurance Departments, covering fire, life, and accident insurance, all of which have progressed remarkably well. It has been found that the State Fire Insurance Department has reduced the rates of private fire insurance companies. Therefore, not only do those who are insured with the Government benefit from the establishment of the Department, but those who do business with other institutions also benefit. New Zealand is the only place where socialistic legislation has been given anything like practical effect. We have been told that socialistic legislation will reduce all to an equality. </para>

                                <para>- I withdraw them; but when I was a lad I was taught that children should be seen and not heard. I find that in the socialistic Colony of New Zealand there are 243.675 depositors in the Savings Banks, that is, one person to less than every three and a half in the total&#39; population is a depositor, while the average amount deposited represents ,&#163;30 6s. 5d, One of the most gratifying features in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr-</inline></para>

                            <para>Honorable members will notice a largely increased education vote. This, I hope, may be cheerfully accepted and provided for. It means the complete education of our youth, and his equipment for the battle of life. Primary, secondary, technical, and university education are imperative, if our children are to compete and tight the battle on level terms with others. </para>

                        <para class="block">These facts should afford material for thought to honorable members opposite, who would deprive us even of education if they could. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> that New Zealand is God&#39;s own country. The statements in his Budget speech read almost like romance, but they are nevertheless statements of fact. I wish that Australia could show such magnificent results as have been obtained in socialistic New Zealand. Yet, under the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Julius</inline> Vogel, although there was the same land, the same sunshine, and the same rainfall, people were leaving the Colony. Despite these facts, we are told that socialistic legislation brings ruin to a country. If such legislation were passed in Australia our conditions would improve very materially. I should like very much to go amongst the farming community which the honorable and learned member for Wannon represents. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose it would be almost impossible for any honorable member to increase the intellectual obsession which doubtless this long debate has produced in the House. But, as the honorable member for Wilmot has not yet delivered judgment, we are all expected to emulate the ladies in the <inline font-style="italic">Vicar of Wakefield,</inline> by continuing the conversation, if not the argument. However, I shall endeavour to attain the merit of comparative brevity, by keeping as clear as possible of any attempt at extemporizing the details of honorable members&#39; political careers by indulging in any personal retrospects, because I firmly believe that the electors are not particularly edified by our excursions into the domain of political inconsistency. By this time they have learned to take it for granted that a capacity to adapt one&#39;s self to circumstances is a condition essential to success in public life, and that in times, when principles are so often affected by the proximity of power, all of us, in the opinion of our opponents at least, fairly fit the portraiture of Dryden&#39;s lines - </para>

                                <para>- I am not speaking for other honorable members just at present. There is one thing, perhaps, about which the electors have some right to, and do, complain. I allude to the growing tendency to abandon power on inadequate occasions - power which is so dearly sought, and which, when given, is intended to be used for greater ends. I say that it is ignoring the true principle of party and responsible government to surrender the power to carry out the bulk of great principles upon a division affecting a subordinate matter of method in Committee. The fact is it seems to me that if a Cabinet has a majority in the House upon matters of current policy, it&#39; should not resign upon any division in Committee, if that division does not clearly indicate a want of confidence in its general principles or administration. The public who sent us here, as I mentioned previously, have a large interest in the stability of government, and the balance of principles which bind a party together should not be sacrificed owing to a difference of opinion among members generally upon one principle. The essence of party government is that honorable members upon some matters subordinate, while not abandoning, their personal convictions in the interests of unity on a great many others. </para>

                                <para>- I do not care by what name it is called. I am afraid that we are too much the slaves of names. Undoubtedly it is the true principle of party government that, for the sake of power, members have, in some respects, upon matters of current policy to subordinate their opinions in order to gain momentum upon others. It may be that upon a division in Committee the vote of an honorable member may be cast with a view to keep in power a Government which will further his views upon other questions rather than upon the matter immediately engaging his attention.- I would ask, is it a matter of precedent even on the second reading of a Bill that Ministers when defeated should resign? We know that it is contrary to the usual custom. Much less then, should they throw up the reins of government upon a division in Committee. Some divisions which were taken in Committee upon the Tariff were very far-reaching in their effects. But no Government would dream of throwing up the reins of office because they were defeated upon them. In the last session of the first Parliament, we had a far-reaching division upon the question of borrowing for the purpose of carrying out certain lines of expenditure. But the Government never thought for a moment when such a sweeping reversal of custom was insisted upon, that it was a matter upon which their existence should depend. The bulk of the principles of a party may be sacrificed through over sensibility as regards the carrying out of one. Men then come into power as a mere political accident, and not as emphasizing the main lines of policies acquiesced in by the country. I say that, because it is applicable to an extent to both sides of the House. We get as the result an abnegation of the true principles of party and representative government. . We get, when men are so forced to seek other lines of cohesion and of separation, such a farrago of halting opinions as the alliance programme of the Opposition. I do not wish to enter into an analysis of that programme ; but I find from a perusal of it that it consists of twenty-two planks, seventeen of which deal &#39;with matters of general policy, whilst the, others relate more particularly to the elections. Plank one is certainly deserving of some commendation. It introduces a novel principle of union. It is a marriage after the latest fashion, in which the tie. is temporary, and the sense of personal independence and ethical laxity remains as active and agreeable as before. The parties to this somewhat &#39; sexless union are, we are told, to retain their separate identities. It is an arrangement which the lawyers would describe as <inline font-style="italic">sui generis</inline> - a marriage unaffected by any old-fashioned ideas of marital or moral responsibility, in which the vinculum is dissolved when the honeymoon ends; in fact, one which even the most confirmed of political bachelors might enter without foreboding, as he certainly might leave it without regret. As regards the seventeen items of the alliance programme, I find that nine of them, such as the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the Trade Marks Bill, the. Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the Papua Bill, the Anti-Trust Bill, the question of exchanging ideas in connexion with preferential trade, the Quarantine Bill, and the submission hereafter of other matters to the consideration of the joint caucus, are really subjects which most members of this House, judging from their votes, might accept without any possible forestalling of their better judgment. Then there are four lines in the programme to which any honorable member, owing to the qualifications which surround them might subscribe, without prejudicing his future action, whilst three others, which are somewhat radical iri their principle - though not, perhaps, in the method of carrying them out - such as the establishment of a tobacco monopoly, the Iron Bonus Bill, and the question of old-age pensions are also subject to conditions which leave an easy opening for any subsequent variation of policy or action. But, in the seventeen general planks, there is not one single item in which a positive, and, therefore, dangerous opinion is asked of any one as a condition of his admission to the party. Not one single profession is he expected to make without qualification which would tie him down to a definite radical policy. I am measuring what is best upon the Opposition side by the aspirations of the Labour Party. There is not a single contentious line which would pin a man down to a definite democratic opinion. There are three matters which possibly may be far-reaching, two of which it is therefore proposed to refer to Commissions - an  easy  way out of a difficulty - and another upon which it is proposed to appoint a committee. &#39; From the point of view of a democrat, such a policy seems to me to be neither stimulating nor sincere. It lacks the pluck and candour of true propagandism. Let us take the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as an example. That measure is to be restored by the Alliance Party to its original shape, a claim for which there is no doubt a good deal of reason on the side of supporters of the Bill. But that has to be accomplished without any member of a party changing any vote which he has previously recorded. How, then, is it to be done? Do honorable members think that the result can be attained by their internal inconsistencies of &#39; voting being compensated for by possible defections from this side of the House? </para>

                                <para>- No doubt the honorable member has a faculty for reconciling incompatibles, but for the life of me, I cannot see - in view of the close divisions which have been recorded upon matters declared to be vital to the machinery of the Bill - how it can, with the liberty of action permitted bv the alliance, be restored to its original shape. I say that the policy of the alliance upon this Bill alone is not as candid and as sincere as generally the programme of the Labour Party has been. Then, as regards Tariff legislation, is not the reference of the question and of the interference with the last adjustment to a Commission a surrendering of responsibility? Or, rather, is it not an easy way out of a difficulty created by certain clamourous representatives of the protectionist class? I have not much faith in these Commissions. The general result of them is that same men - those who ask for an increase of duty - secure that their case, at all events, is well put before the Commission, but that the bulk of the trades which are indirectly interested, and the raw material of whose industries may be burdened by the proposed increase of the duties, are not represented. Because it is only after the increased duties are imposed that they become alive to their interests, and recognise the extent to which they are affected by the alterations proposed. </para>

                                <para>- By the vote of this House. But I should say that there is no justification at all, even from a protectionist point of view, for a revision of . the Tariff after an experience of its operation extending over only two years. Then, again, the interests of the consumer are not likely to be represented before any Commission. They are too general and appeal too little to direct personal interests to induce any, except, perhaps, some patriotic men, who, apart altogether from possible effects upon themselves, take a sympathetic view of these larger matters of politics, to be concerned with them. The interests of the con- &#39; sumer are too indirect to secure representation before any Commission. We know also that if we grant a Commission in obedience to the importunities of some manufacturers, we cannot refuse its application of it to all; and we shall thus be introducing into Australia one of the greatest curses of America, the system of lobbying in connexion with a revision of the Tariff. </para>

I believe in political fechterizing in connexion with these matters. The Tariff report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s</inline> Commission, dealing with the iron and steel trades, discovered an array of facts as regards the increase of iron production in the United States and Germany, with which every one apparently, except the members of the Commission, had been previously familiar; and they deduced from these novel premises conclusions with which perhaps not one man in ten in England would agree. </para>

                                <para>- It was known to every one familiar with the circumstances, into which I need not enter - one of which is undoubtedly the tremendous increase of manufactures throughout the world during the last thirty or forty years, and therefore the great demand that accompanied that increase for the raw material of those manufactures in the way of iron and steel - that production had been greatly stimulated in Germany and in America ; and though England had maintained an absolute increase, the comparative increase was greater in the United States and Germany. This is one of the great, discoveries of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s</inline> Commission, but their explanation is one that will be accepted by exceedingly few. That explanation is that the increase is due to the arrangements for export in Germany and the United States, and to the high Tariffs that prevail in those countries. Now I do not intend to go into the question of preferential trade, but I am just going to show that these calculations of party Com- missions are not to be relied upon, and how futile they are, owing to the manner in which the questions inquired into are approached, and the sometimes prejudiced reports that are framed, I shall do so by pointing out that in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of a week or two after the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s</inline> Tariff Commission was published there are reports of lectures delivered before the British Association by Professor Lotz, of Munich, on the operation of protection in Germany, and another by M. Yves Guyot, a French authority on the effects of protection in France. Professor Lotz shows that in Germany, as the result of Tariff legislation and the restriction of exports of the produce of a good many industries, the raw materials of some industries are touched. He says that - </para>

                                <para>- No doubt, but that Government went out, and that Government might have remained in had it agreed to widen. as some of its members wished, &#39; its democratic lines. I said that the policy of this alliance is equivocal and halting, scarcely up .to the <inline font-style="italic">morale</inline> of a party which has hitherto aspired to lead in matters of social amelioration. Policy seems to have become attenuated with the view of power, so that the policy of the Labour Party, as the result of new associations, is not up to the standard of men who aspire to represent the working class - a class whose leaders have hitherto, with most unswerving fidelity and courage, held fast to principles until they came by force of reason to prevail - men who always believed that what has been the experience of one reform may be made the experience of all, feeling, as they do, with Carlyle, that the truth that was yesterday a restless problem, has to-day become a belief burning to be uttered. I should like to mention also the result of this frequent change of power. Through the more accidental features in it, and the rearrangement of parties on lines less of principles than petty expediency, the members of the alliance cannot, if they come into power, give the country a Cabinet with the essential British characteristic of unity of opinion in great matters of policy. Unanimity amongst the members of the Government on the broad matters of current policy is the essential feature of the British system for the past 150 years. </para>

                                <para>- I am afraid that I am harassing my honorable friend, the member for Melbourne Ports, and, as I wish to be fair, as well as candid, let me say a few words on this much-confused issue of Socialism against anti Socialism. Personally, I always refuse to take the platform on any cry of anti-Socialism, because I believe Socialism covers an immense amount of what is good in policy as well as sometimes mistaken in method. As the honorable member for Grampians yesterday suggested, the definitions differ very widely. We have a general consensus as to what are the aims of Socialism, but very often the true meaning is misrepresented, owing to the prejudiced ignorance of even writers of assumed authority. I find that Professor Ely, ah unprejudiced authority, in his little handbook on Socialism, says - </para>

                            <para>Even a hasty examination of the vast majority of books written on Socialism or Communism shows how utterly worthless they are. The authors start out with such an intense hatred of all socialistic systems that it is simply impossible for them to understand those systems. But the worst of it is, they couple their misunderstanding with such hard words and severe epithets as to excite bad blood and drive the various classes of society farther apart than ever. </para>

                        <para class="block">I say that when we find men like Professor Foxwell. who, I think was a lecturer on political economy in the Oxford University, and Professor Caird, of the University of Glasgow, saying that many of the principles of Socialism are legitimate deductions&#39; from economic doctrines, we must not, with the cock-sure dogmatism of economic tyros, endeavour to blast it with a name. Its aim, as distinct from its methods, and there it is often less a matter of design than mistake, is, as we all admit, distributive justice. Its meaning is well suggested by the great master-poet of our nation, in the splendid aspiration which he puts into the mouth of Lear as- he stands bareheaded against the elements - </para>

                        <para class="block">Now in the opinion of Professor Ely, it seeks to improve the common lot of the working classes by the application of thoroughgoing measures. It refuses to believe, no. matter what the concomitants of an apparently heartless social evolution may have once suggested, that in the words of Mirabeau, &#34; the oppression of the poor, like the hail and thunder, is a thing inevitable, the ordinance of nature.&#34; But the method is the great difficulty and subject of difference, and here I hope we shall be ready to be a little tolerant of each other&#39;s opinions, or perhaps mistakes. Buckle was not a man of conservative views; but he points out that the great difficulty is the method in legislation. It is on methods we differ ; the means of carrying out principles acknowledged to be good. Where the theorist suggests improvement, the difference of opinion in point of view of methods shows how many mistakes we are liable to. make in the furtherance of good aspirations. Continental Socialism is one thing, British Socialism is another. </para>

                                <para>- Between, for instance, on the one side, the methods of Lassalle and Marx, both of whom condemn capital, describing it as theft, and, on the other, the methods of, say, Professor Thorold Rogers, who, I think was a professor of political economy in the University of Oxford, and? of the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fairbairn,</inline> who a few years ago held the position of President of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, and wrote some very able works on social questions, the difference is very great. We find that Professor Ely, in dealing with methods, says there are very sharp lines of difference between Socialists. You have, for instance, pure Socialism, State and professional Socialism, Christian Socialism, French Collectivism, French Blancqueists, French Anarchists. Social Democracy, and international Socialism, all of which are radically different in method. John Stuart Mill, strange to say - and it proves my point that method is the difficulty in legislation - is regarded by some as the protagonist of Socialism, and by others as the great champion of Individualism. </para>

                        <para>John Stuart Mill was not one of those pseudo-reformers who would attempt to frame in a day a programme for eternity. With the modesty of all great men and all deep thinkers, Mill said that he had not the presumption to suppose that he could foresee by what precise form of institutions these objects could most effectively be attained, or at how near or distant a period they would become practicable. He pointed out that it was only by co-operation between the various classes of society, between capital and labour, and through a system of culture, prolonged through successive generations, men could be brought up to the point of efficiency. The method here, again, is the difficulty ; but are we, therefore, to allow our faculties to rust, and to sit idly by whilst human destitution calls for remedial means? I say &#34;No.&#34; Some experiments must be made. Every healthy politician knows that there is a clear line of demarcation between the sphere of private enterprise and the sphere of Government interference. I say that nearly all the ameliorative measures which have been adopted during the last fifty or sixty years, were originally deemed to be socialistic. Factories Acts, Health Acts, and agrarian laws, that changed the relations between landlord and tenant, were all expressions of socialistic interference. I remember reading that when the great Devon Commission of 1844 inquired into the state of affairs, respecting landlord and tenant in the Old Country, and particularly in Ireland, Lord Brougham, who was then described as a fingerer of all things, condemned the probable outcome of the Commission as socialistic, and cautioned the members of it, and particularly Lord Devon, the chairman, against any interference with the sacred rights of property. The <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> replying to him, asked what were the limits of the interference asked for ? Did they not mean this in effect : the assertion of the, right of the poor man under God&#39;s charter to live and breathe upon this, the Almighty&#39;s world? </para>

I here use the term, &#34; England &#34; in the larger sense, as even including the better part of the United Kingdom, Ireland. I say that if the acceptance of the results of municipal enterprise in Glasgow, Birmingham, Berlin, and other great centres of population indicates a leaning towards Socialism, I confess to being affected&#39; somewhat in that way. But I stop where monopoly ends. I say it is the duty of the State to control monopoly, but not to interfere with the true sphere of private enterprise, not to obtrude upon the thousand and one other lines of our industrial activity. </para>

                                <para>- I stop at that,, the honorable member may go beyond it. The test I endeavour always to apply is this : The test that Government is formed to protect the individual against oppression, whether it be the oppression of physical duress or industrial monopoly. But beyond that it is not right to go, and the chief reason is that the State in its guiding power, the Legislature, is of a comparatively low intellectual level. As an organization it does not express the individual intelligence of its component members. The level of every deliberative assembly, if we may trust men like Lambroso and others, is lower than that of the individuals who compose it. There is, he said, such a thing as the madness of popular assemblies. Buckle, to whom I have already referred, mentions that the history of every civilized country is the history of its intellectual development, which kings, statesmen, and legislators are more likely to retard than hasten. Almost every Empire of modern times, from the Roman to the Spanish, went down through the corruption or folly of its Legislature. I say, therefore, that except where mono ply is clear, we must distrust the capacity of the legislative machine. Let us take, . for instance, the Socialist Marx, and the quotation I shall read shows how many mistakes may be made in the endeavour by Utopian methods to carry out a principle acknowledged to be moral. In dealing with Liberals, whose policy was somewhat analogous to what is best in the policy of modern Radicals, he says - </para>

They endeavoured to free labour, but only succeeded in subjecting it more completely under the yoke of capitalism; they aimed at setting at liberty all labour powers, and only riveted the chains of misery which held them bound ; they wanted to release the bondman from the clod, and deprive him of the soil on which he stood by buying up the land. They yearned for a happy condition of society, and only created superfluity on one hand, and dire want on the other ; they desired to secure for merit its own honorable reward, and only made it the slave of wealth ; they wanted to abolish all monopolies, and place in their stead the monster monopoly, capital; they wanted to do away with all wars between nation and nation, and kindled the flames of civil war; they wanted to get rid of the State, and yet have multiplied its burdens ; they wanted to make education the common property of all, and made it the privilege of the rich ; they aimed at the greatest moral improvement of society, and only left it in a state of rotten immorality ; they wanted, to say all in a word, unbounded liberty, and have produced the meanest servitude ; they wanted the reverse of all that which they actually obtained, and have thus given a proof that liberalism in all its ramifications is nothing but a perfect Utopia. </para>

                        <para class="block">But we are told by Foster in his recent work on the American Constitution, that the chief advantage of the Senate is to stop the mischievous measures of the House of Representatives. Should it not teach us modesty in our experiments, when we learn that in almost every case in America where the States have changed their Constitutions, they have made elaborate provision for checks upon legislative folly, whether by the referendum or otherwise, and also when we are told by Bryce that the Governor is appointed to watch and check the legislators as a cat watches a mouse? I decline to accept this legislative machine as one to direct our intellects and morals. I decline to allow it to obtrude its ineffectiveness into every sphere of our industrial and social life, to endeavour to lay down, as if with the eye of omniscience, the lines and scope of development of a civilization which, whereever it has been stable and sound, has been the result of a growth for generations, and&#39; of unconscious adaptation and sustained evolution. Considering the record of mistakes that legislators have made, we ought to keep the State to its true province, which is to destroy monopoly, to afford to all equal opportunity, arid to leave to private enterprise, to individual intelligence and guidance, the task of perfecting and sustaining what is best in our industrial and social civilization. </para>

                            <para>- During this debate the House finds itself in a peculiar position, arising out of the attempt of certain honorable members to try to- create two parties. The House was constituted by the electors &#39; into three parties, which, as we know, were practically equal. Certain honorable members, however, seemed to think that such a state of affairs was absolutely fatal to the administration of responsible government under our Constitution. We know that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, in a speech he made before the House met, declared as a fundamental principle, that we must have two parties. Those who stood as members of each of the three parties took up a certain attitude with respect to their constituents when they were elected, and now it is sought by artificial means to try to compel honorable members who have found themselves bound by certain pledges to range themselves in two parties. The attempt to a certain extent has been successful, and the result is that during the last few days we have had a series of recriminations arid attacks made upon persons for trying to adapt themselves to the conditions of two parties. Honorable members seem to think that two-party Government was a magnificent thing so long as they had two of the opposite parties sitting on one side of the House. But a number of honorable members find that by reason of the _ pledges and promises they gave they cannot adapt themselves to the position of sitting behind the right honorable member for East Sydney. Honorable members have also been inclined to express the belief that the present state of the House indicates a certain weakness in the Constitution. I for one do not share that opinion in the slightest degree. That great instrument of government which was created by the people of this Continent is as stable and solid a piece of governmental legislation as was ever devised by any intelligent people. We have a Constitution giving us ample powers of legislation, and conveying to us splendid powers of administration. But what is wanted in the Commonwealth is a party with confidence in the powers of government conveyed in the Constitution, and prepared to frame and stand by a policy on good strong national lines. I believe that the electors throughout Australia &#39;spoke in favour of such a policy, as I think I shall be able to show. However, the issue before us to-night is a simple one, and it is whether or not the Administration which has been formed by the right honorable member for East Sydney commands&#39; the confidence of the House. I am not desirous of making any personal remarks during my speech. The Prime Minister seems to think that our feeling towards him is very much like that of the son-in-law, who on receiving a telegram informing him that his mother-in-law was dead, and asking whether she was to be embalmed, and buried, or cremated, wired back, &#34; Do all three, lest there should be any mistake.&#34; I can assure the right honorable gentleman that that is not the feeling which is entertained for him by honorable members on this side of the House. He has declaimed as strongly as did the honorable and learned member for Ballarat that we should have two parties in the House, that we should have party government, that we should go back to those great principles of responsible government under which Great Britain became what she is. And if, as a result of his efforts, honorable members find themselves ranged on each side, I am perfectly sure that he will allow us that same right of conscience which he has claimed - that he will not continue the line of remark which he employed in Adelaide the other day, when he said that the alliance on this side savours of office-seeking. </para>

                                <para>- As the result of the efforts of the right honorable gentleman and honorable members opposite, two parties have been created. On the very evening when the fatal amendment was passed, which brought about the defeat of the Watson Administration, the honorable member for Gippsland declared in the most emphatic terms that as a result of that division two parties had been created. Speaking to the press on Saturday, 13th August, he said - 1 look upon the division on Friday evening as a line drawn between two distinct parties in the House of Representatives. The combination that voted against the Ministry with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> is a solid party. Its members are united on all questions except that of the Tariff, upon which a truce has been declared for the life of the present Parliament. As I remarked before, the party that voted against the Ministry on Friday is a solid one. Two parties have emerged from the chaotic state of the House, the line has been drawn, and if it stops at all it must stop so as to add a few more members to the Opposition parties. </para>

                                <para>- That is a solid party. I think there is no &#34; yes-no &#34; about it. Seeing that both parties are trying, as it were, to create this system of responsible government, we can afford, I think, to be generous towards each other in our criticisms. The issue, however, is, have we confidence in the present Administration? Speaking on behalf of this side, I say absolutely no. </para>

In the first place, I regard the Ministry as one under the lead of a free-trade Prime Minister. I believe that he has still a firm belief in those principles which he has declared all his life are the most cherished convictions of his heart. The policy announced by him to the electors was defeated absolutely ; therefore, I am against him on the ground that the people of the Commonwealth pronounced against him as a candidate for the position of Prime Minister. I am against him because on all the measures which _ he criticised, the people pronounced against him, and in favour of their administration by sympathetic persons. I am also against him, because I am still in favour of all those principles which were advocated by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and which were opposed by the right honorable gentleman. </para>

                                <para>- The right honorable gentleman will be strong enough before he is done. I am also opposed to the Administration because I do not believe in the methods by which it obtained possession of the Treasury bench. I am not speaking personally, nor do I wish to insinuate that there has been anything dishonorable ; I am speaking merely of the political methods by which they obtained their places on the Treasury bench. What was the policy announced by the Prime Minister when he stood before the electors of the Commonwealth last year? He stood, first of all, as an out-and-out free-trader. He would not accept fiscal peace, or a fiscal truce, the proposal for which he described as a specious barrier, raised by the protectionists to fight behind, and a ruse to enable them to win a certain number of free-trade votes. He stood out firmly for the principles of freetrade, for which he had fought during his whole life. He declared that if he had been ready to abandon them, he would then have been at the head of an almost irresistible party; but he could not sacrifice them. &#39; He was not going to give way upon principles which had brought him honours in the shape of Cobden medals. </para>

I do not believe that the right honorable member has sunk his free-trade principles. He has been &#34;Yes-No&#34; upon every subject except freetrade. I do not know sufficient about his State career to say what his attitude has been on all subjects. </para>

                                <para>- I can speak of the right honorable gentleman only as. I have found him in this House, and I know that he has taken up a &#34;Yes-No&#34; attitude on many matters. He also fought during the elections against preferential trade. He was not going to raise duties against the mother-land. He did not believe in attempts to bind Australia to England by commercial ties. The great tie of relationship was strong enough. He would throw open all Australia, not only to the goods of Great Britain, but to the goods of America, France, and every other country as well, so full of love was his heart. Therefore he would oppose preferential trade. Those were the two chief matters of policy upon which he spoke ; but he went further, and dealt with the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, as exemplified by the six hatters&#39; case. He said that that legislation was &#34; utterly mean, disloyal, and unnatural,&#34; and that he would make an effort to repeal it if he got a chance to do so. He took up the stand that the Act was one which should be administered in a proper way, and he condemned the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton. He ridiculed the treatment meted out to the six hatters, though it seems to me impossible to distinguish that case from the six potters&#39; case. </para>

I think that I have always acted fairly in this House.

                                <para>- Of course, that is a question of policy upon which it is permissible to hold different views. I find no fault with the right honorable gentleman for holding that view. At the elections he also sounded his trumpet very loudly about the terrible gerrymandering which had taken place in this House in regard to the redistribution of seats. I have gone through all his speeches, and the matters which I have mentioned were the chief issues which he put before the people. What was their answer? Did they authorize him to pass a free-trade Tariff? Did they reject the preferential proposals which he opposed ? Did they authorize him to repeal the Immigration Restriction Act and certain sections of the Post and Telegraph Act? Did they, as a whole, pronounce against the men who were responsible for our electoral legislation ? </para>

The right honorable gentleman at the elections was hopelessly beaten on every issue. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat had a clear constructive policy. Throughout the Convention, and ever since, he has believed in the Constitution. He knows the great powers which the nation possesses under it, and he went before the electors with a policy which he believed would do something to build up industries in Australia. He recognised that the first Federal Parliament, although there were three parties in the House, had laid a great many splendid foundation stones. That Parliament passed machinery measures, none of which have yet been subjected to serious criticism. It established a White Australia, enacted an excellent Electoral Act, with a splendid franchise, instituted a Federal Judiciary, framed a Tariff, and passed the legislation necessary for the proper administration of the great Departments of the Commonwealth. None of these measures was subjected to any serious criticism. The honorable and learned gentleman&#39;s remarks were confined to the case of the six hatters. </para>

The first Ministry has been subjected to a good deal of abuse ; but I believe that in years to come, when things are seen in better perspective, Australians will be proud of it. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat went to the constituencies with a clearly defined policy. He believed in this principle of protection. </para>

He told the people that preferential trade would present great opportunities for the . producers of Australia. He believed that there was an unlimited market in the old country, and that, by means of preferential trade, that market could be secured .for us. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member&#39;s interruption is both irrelevant and incorrect. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat put before the people the principles of protection and also advocated fiscal peace. He believed that we should stand by the existing Tariff, and the majority of the people of Australia agreed with him in the view that he put forward. He argued for fiscal peace, not as the mere suspension of the Tariff. He regarded the issue as being not between fiscal peace and fiscal war, but between national trade and foreign trade, between preferential trade and the rejection of the offers -made to us. Protection, in his view, did not mean the mere collection of duties at the Custom House, but an attitude of mind favorable to legislation in the direction of building up industries upon a firm basis, establishing satisfactory conditions between employer and employed, and providing that all persons in the community should receive fair remuneration for their services. He expressed his reliance in our magnificent resources. He pointed to the fact that we had great deposits of minerals scattered throughout the Commonwealth, and an almost unlimited area of agricultural land, and the question, to his mind, was how we were to secure the best results, and obtain the best conditions for our people. Now, on the other hand, the Prime Minister&#39;s idea is that we should repeal all the Customs . duties, and let everything come about spontaneously. Perhaps he also leans to the view expressed by the honorable member for Lang, who thinks that the standard of intelligence can be raised, and improved conditions can be secured by imposing a land tax - that all the blessings that we could desire would flow from the imposition of such a tax. The constructive clement characterized the whole of the policy of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. He said we must, first of all, ascertain how we could give the people of the Commonwealth a market for their produce, and he indicated preferential trade as one of the means. Then he advocated the establishment of a Department within the Commonwealth, by means of which those engaged in the producing industries might be so guided that they would be enabled to secure the best results from their efforts. That led up to the idea of establishing a Department of Agriculture. He also considered it necessary to assist our producers by obtaining information with regard- to markets across the seas, and with that end in view he pressed for the appointment of a High Commissioner. He believed in establishing proper conditions of employment, but wished to avoid industrial strife, and, therefore, proposed that protection should be afforded to the workers by means of a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. His was essentially a constructive policy, whereas that of the Prime Minister is entirely destitute of that element. </para>

                                <para>- If the right honorable gentleman held the same views as does the honorable and learned member for Indi he might be worthy to lead even the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. The honorable and learned member for Indi can claim that he has consistently stood up for his principles right through the piece. He has fought the fight from the beginning, and has no reason to be ashamed of the results. He has stood up for his principles, whilst many of those who should have supported him have arrayed themselves against him, and he has emerged from the struggle triumphant. We have no reason to be ashamed to sit behind&#39; him, 01 to be afraid to follow him, because his record in this House has been one of honour. Reverting to the policy of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, I would point out that he believed that we should initiate an immigration policy, that we should encourage the development of our iron industry, that we should assist our producers by means of bonuses, and that we should pass a Navigation Bill to protect the seamen and others engaged in trading along our coasts. He also believed in the Western Australian railway. The only difference between the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and the Prime Minister upon the last-named subject was that the Prime Minister was at one time in favour of merely drawing a straight line across the map .from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, and allowing the railway line to be constructed straight ahead without any inquiry. That, at any rate, was the attitude he assumed when he was in Western Australia. </para>

                                <para>- He now has some one sitting behind him who will take good care that he -does not forget it. The views I have indicated were those which were placed before the people of Australia by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and I say that they show that, between the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and the Prime Minister, there is an absolute difference of method in approaching the solution of political questions. The Prime Minister is an individualist who believes in conciliation and arbitration only because the workers have asked for it. While offering to grant it to them, he reminded them of the fact that they would be subjecting themselves to legislation which would involve the abandonment of all the glorious -liberties, including the right to strike, which they now enjoyed. </para>

                                <para>- I do not deny that the right honorable gentleman praised them, but his attitude throughout has been that of an individualist. His frame of mind throughout his political life has been similar to that of the honorable and learned member for Parkes. There were two policies before the country, and that of the right honorable gentleman was rejected, whilst the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was returned here with a large following. There was another party in this House which also had a policy, embracing many of the proposals announced by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. Their programme was - (i) Maintenance of a White Australia, (2) Compulsory arbitration, (3) Old age pensions, (4) Nationalization of monopolies, (5) Citizen defence force, (6) Restriction of public borrowing, (7) Navigation laws. If honorable members analyze the programmes put forward they will see that the party represented by the free-traders in this House had practically no support in the community. </para>

An examination of the programmes to which I have referred will show that if fair opportunities had been afforded a great deal of useful legislation might have been carried out. But those honorable members who were anxious to give all the assistance they could to the community by means of legislative enactments were blocked by certain combinations. A majority of honorable members were pledged to carry out a number of definite proposals which would have afforded great relief to the people of Australia, but by reason of the changes which have taken place, all their efforts in that direction have been blocked. </para>

                                <para>- That is not so, but I shall come to that presently. So far as the Arbitration Bill was concerned, there was only one real point of difference between the Labour Party and the members of the party led by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, which prevented that piece of legislation from being placed upon our statute-book. That question had reference to the inclusion of States servants within the scope of the Bill. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat was entitled to take up the attitude he assumed upon that question, but 1 think that he made a mistake, and that subsequent events have proved it. </para>

                                <para>- So far as we can judge, there was only one point of difference between the two parties at that time to prevent the House from carrying on business, and passing a number of the leading measures advocated by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. But, owing to the action of the Free-trade Party, the will of the people has been absolutely frustrated, and after a good deal of political engineering, the Free-trade Party have taken possession of the Treasury bench. After six months of inactivity, brought about by their action, we are here to-day. We are not following their bad example. We held that as soon as we found ourselves face to face with a Government policy with which we could not agree, we should, instead of blocking business, and intriguing, and whittling away this amendment, and that amendment, come straight out into the open, and say, &#34; We cannot support you. If you have a majority, show it by your numbers, and then proceed to deal with the legislation required by the country.&#34; Why did not the Prime Minister take up that position ? If, when the House met six months ago, the right honorable gentleman thought he could command the confidence of the House, why did he not table a motion of want of confidence, and show exactly what his strength was? Instead of that, he allowed legislation to go on, and amendment after amendment to be moved, so as to block legislation, and eventually endeavoured to remove the Ministry from the Treasury bench by a subterfuge. I think that the actions of the right honorable gentleman have been such that this House should condemn them in anticipation of the displeasure of the electors which will be visited upon him when he meets them. Now, I desire to say a few words as to the means adopted by the right honorable gentleman to obtain power. When the honorable and learned member for Ballarat met the House, he knew that there was trouble ahead in connexion with the provision for including the public servants of the States within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. </para>

I am not denying that the honorable and learned member for Indi was following the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and I wish the right honorable gentleman would confine himself to relevant interjections.

Is there to be no such thing as consistency? Can the public have any confidence in that method of dealing with important acts of legislation? Is there to be no definiteness and certainty in our expressions of opinion? The right honorable &#39;member accuses us. of a breach of faith. What has he to say upon this question ? </para>

                                <para>- My attitude upon this Bill has been perfectly clear and logical throughout. Last year I voted in favour of including the railway servants within its provisions. Subsequently I went before my constituents,. and I was not called upon to deliver a single speech. I made no promises to them. I was returned unopposed. Consequently, I felt that I was in duty bound to repeat any vote Which I had recorded in this House. I voted with the honorable and learned member for Ballarat against the inclusion of States servants generally. Therefore, the interjection of the right honorable member for Swan is not very relevant. I still believe, however, that the general policy advocated by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was the correct one. But, seeing that two members of his Cabinet accepted office in the present Administration after that provision had been inserted in the Bill, it is to be regretted that at the time they did not advise him that in their opinion he was making a mistake. . </para>

                                <para>- Upon the defeat of the Deakin Administration His Excellency saw fit to send for the honorable member for Bland, and not for the present Prime Minister. The latter then stated that it was absolutely unconstitutional for the honorable member for Bland to accept the position. I think that he had authority for acting as he did. In this connexion, I propose to quote from Hearn&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Government of England,</inline> in which .the writer says - </para>

                            <para>We thus arrive at a further check. Since the Queen&#39;s Government must be carried on, those persons who have overthrown one Administration must be prepared to provide a substitute. From the nature of the case they must, in doing so, be subject to unsparing criticism. Thus, -if the Ministry be responsible, an equal responsibility rests with the Opposition. They oppose, knowing that they are liable to be required to substantiate their statements. They cannot merely harass or displace their opponents. They must take those opponents&#39; places, and give &#34;practical effect to their doctrines. </para>

                        <para class="block">The present Prime Minister declared that the honorable member for Bland had no authority for accepting the position of leader of the House. I say -that in doing so he showed that he had a keen appreciation of the important position in which he had placed himself. He occupied practically the position of leader of honorable members upon the Opposition side of the House. But what can be said of the free-traders who voted with him? Here was an important provision which the present Prime Minister and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat had contended was of vital importance to the States. They urged that it struck at the very foundations of the Federal compact. The party upon this side of the House disagreed with them. They held that it was in their power to insert the provision in question, and they exercised that power in the interests of good government. How many free-traders sat upon this side of the Chamber then ? I think there were some fifteen or sixteen. Those honorable members, upon a matter which it was argued involved the whole Constitution, were prepared to overthrow the Deakin Administration. </para>

                                <para>- I do not cast discredit upon those who voted according to their consciences. The present Prime Minister declared that the honorable member for Bland, in accepting office, acted unconstitutionally. I have quoted from a constitutional authority to show that the duty was cast, not only upon the honorable member, but upon those who assisted to displace the Deakin Administration, of seeing that responsible government was carried on. Honorable members opposite talk about responsible government, but do not cite authorities in support of their statements. We all know that the Watson Administration carried on for about three and a half months, and that members of the two parties, led by the present Prime Minister and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, sat upon the Opposition side of the House. It was not long, however, before it became patent to everybody that there were forces at work which were extremely hostile to the Government, and to the particular piece of legislation to which every party was pledged. Whenever an opportunity presented itself of whittling away the powers conferred by the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, it was eagerly grasped. I do not find fault with honorable members for so acting, but I say that it was remarkable that a great many who were keen advocates of industrial arbitration quickly began to see that the foundations upon which they originally rested were of a very weak and untenable nature. </para>

                                <para>- I did vote for certain amendments upon some occasions. I did my best to give effect to the wishes of this House. In the interests of industrial peace, I desired to see an arbitration law placed upon our statute-book. I repeat that parties began to manifest their presence in this House, and certain honorable members of the section led by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat were found constantly acting with members of the Free-trade Party. By association, I suppose, their ideas became assimilated, and that condition, perhaps, constituted the beginning of the coalition between the two great parties, which the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was so anxious to establish. Those honorable members, who formerly sat in the Opposition corner, and who are admittedly conservative, were always found &#39; voting with these Deakinites. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo and the honorable member for Moira, two as true democrats as are to be found in this House, from time to time voted with the free-traders. Unfortunately, their fears were appealed to, and in the end, they supported the amendment of the honorable and learned- member for Corinella, which resulted in the downfall of the Watson Government. </para>

Honorable members sitting upon this side of the House are in agreement upon a great many things, and upon the general trend of legislation. Wherever, in the interests of the public, they believe that the State ought to exercise its power, they intend that it shall be exercised. </para>

                                <para>- Why all this trouble about the honorable and learned member for&#39; Indi? Is it because he is not sitting behind the Government? The Watson Administration, I repeat, were defeated upon an amendment which was moved by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. That amendment was really a test one, and one which divided the parties in this House upon the true principles of legislation. Honorable members were elected to pass an industrial Arbitration Bill. Was it to be a mockery and a sham, or a piece of legislation which would give effect to the wishes of the people who sent us here? It was intended that it should&#39; promote industrial peace. It was not to be a Bill passed purely in the interests of either the employers or the employes. The public were to receive first consideration, because a strike falls more severely upon the people than it does upon -the parties who are immediately concerned in it. The electors sent us here to enact a law which would provide that strikes should cease, and that a Court of Arbitration should be used for the settlement of industrial disputes. Some honorable members urge that we should have only voluntary arbitration. They do not believe in compulsion. That is a logical position to take up. But I say that when we come to deal with compulsory industrial arbitration, the Court, when once constituted, should have the same liberty of action as is. possessed by a voluntary arbitration board, when it undertakes to settle a dispute. What is the present position? We have a number of organized trade unions. Those organizations are faced by employers&#39; associations. We know that disputes of many kinds can arise between them, but one of the &#34;most fertile sources of dispute is to be found in preference to unionists. That question is one which may be left to a voluntary board of conciliation and arbitration. I wish now to refer to a passage from Mitchell&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Organized Labour,</inline> dealing with these unions. It reads - </para>

                                <para>- So that in the United States the position which the unions take up is that for arbitration to be effective the unions must have preference right through. I am not saying that I favour that position. I am simply pointing out existing facts; and from the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell</inline> himself in this book, it is clear that in England preference to unionists is a principle that is readily admitted by very many persons connected with industry. To create an Arbitration Court, and not give it the power to grant a preference to unionists, is really to deprive the men belonging to those unions of a right which they have at the present time. It is a right which is clearly admitted in law, that people can combine and refuse to work with any person if they choose to do so. There is no dispute about that. Whether they are morally justified in giving effect to that principle is quite another question. But when you come to take away from men their right to settle disputes by the old method of voluntary arbitration, I say that whatever disputes they can submit to a voluntary arbitration board, ought to be capable of being submitted to the compulsory Arbitration Court. The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill merely allows that ; and, as it was introduced by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, it gave the Court, in any dispute arising between employers and employed as to whether preference should be granted, the right to decide that question for itself. I found when I was over in New South Wales that, owing to the remarks made in this House, many people there believed that the Court to be established under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would be bound to give a preference to unionists. That is an absolute misrepresentation. The Court will have only a discretionary power. </para>

                                <para>- Whether the misrepresentation was wilful or not I do not know, but the power proposed to be granted by the Bill is purely a discretionary one. The Court will have to consider all the terms and conditions surrounding an industry, and then to determine whether or not preference to unionists shall be granted. It is well known that in many voluntary agreements, which have been registered, preference was readily granted. I do not hesitate to say that, personally, I do not like the preference provision. But I can conceive of cases in which preference ought to be granted. I therefore believe that it is only right and just - seeing that at the present time such a preference can be given under a voluntary agreement - that we should not tie the hands of the Judge but allow him to give the same judgment as can be given by a voluntary arbitration board. Take, for instance, the great shearers&#39; strike which occurred in Queensland some years ago. Honorable members know the terrible confusion that existed in our great State in consequence of that dispute. They know of the sufferings that the people had to endure in consequence of it, and they are aware of the class hatred that sprung up, and which is still rankling in the minds of the parties to that strike. What was the cause of it? The shearers made a claim to have their unions recognised. The squatters turned round and said, &#34; We claim the right to employ whom we please.&#34; The shearers asked for a conference, but the squatters said, &#34;No, we will not have any conference on any conditions.&#34; That was the essence of the dispute. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. That great strike threw the whole community into confusion. Would not honorable members give the Court appointed to decide disputes of that kind the right to decide whether preference should be given to unionists? Is it not better that the Court should have such power than that the community should be subjected to a loss of tens of thousands of pounds, that bitterness should be stirred up to such an extent that the military should have to be called out, and that almost a state of revolution should be produced ? I am not taking the part of either the shearers or the squatters, although I think that the shearers&#39; demand for a conference ought to have been conceded, because by means of free discussion a public conscience is aroused, which sooner or later is brought to bear upon the parties to a dispute. The late Government was defeated upon an amendment moved by the Minister of Defence. I must confess that, of the two amendments then before the House, there is not the slightest doubt that that proposed by the then Ministry was infinitely better than the amendment of the Minister of Defence. I am not prepared to say that if even the amendment of the Government had been considered in a fair and impartial way, something better might not have been devised. But what I do claim is that honorable members opposite took up a rigid attitude, and refused to allow the late Government the courtesy of an opportunity to submit a further amendment. It may be urged that there have been other cases in which the House has refused to recommit, but I do not know of any case where this House as a House wilfully and deliberately took the business out of the hands of the Ministry expressly for the purpose of humiliating them. There has been no precedent in this House for such a course as that. Honorable members who wished to bring about a change of Ministry were no doubt perfectly justified in adopting that attitude. Some honorable members voted against the recommital be* cause they wished to take the control of affairs out of the hands of the late Government. The right honorable member for East Sydney certainly was not enamoured of them, because he was constantly reported to be going about with a no confidence motion in his pocket, which was always to be moved &#34; next day.&#34; That &#34;next day&#34; was never reached, but he was evidently prepared to take advantage of any opportunity to turn out the Government. &#39; I say again that the amendment prepared by the late Government was far better than the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corinella, which provided that preference should only be granted to unionists if in the opinion, of the Judge a majority of the persons affected in the industry who had interests in common were in favour of that preference. </para>

                                <para>- The purport of it was that a majority of the persons affected by an award, and having interests in common, must be in favour of preference being granted. A man has to go into Court &#39; and make, his application. Before he went into Court at all, what evidence would he have to submit? He would have to submit the evidence of the majority of the persons who were affected by an award. Who are the persons affected by an award ? Are they only the persons who are immediately affected? Who are the persons whose interests are &#34;in common&#34;? Are they the persons who alone are interested in the award? The terms of the provision are uncertain, but still more uncertain is the &#34;opinion of the Court&#34; concerning the majority of the persons affected. No man would care to go into Court until he had the strongest possible evidence - obtained quite possibly by a ballot of the unionists affected, as well as of the non-unionists - in order to get the decision of the Court in favour of preference. When we consider that we are- dealing, not with matters in connexion with some little area under a Factories Act, but with the whole of the vast continent of Australia, what would be the meaning of &#34;opinion of the Court,&#34; under a vague and illusive term like that used in the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corinella? Because it must be remembered that it is only a matter of the opinion of the Judge. It is a question as to which there could be no appeal from his decision. It is purely a matter of opinion. If in the Judge&#39;s opinion there was a majority, preference might be given. As a rule,&#39; a Judge, seeing this language used in an Act of Parliament, would say - &#34; It is the intention of the Legislature that I must be satisfied in my own mind that there is a majority.&#34; That opinion would have to be formed on what kind of evidence? It is quite true that the Judge could act upon any evidence. The good conscience clause comes in there. But no matter whether it was hearsay evidence or written evidence, the Judge would require that it should be very strong indeed, and I am quite clear that he would almost certainly ask for statistics concerning the persons engaged . in the industries affected in the Commonwealth. Imagine the difficulty of getting those statistics concerning all the persons who might be interested in an award in this Commonwealth? The whole thing is impracticable and unworkable. </para>

                                <para>- If our attitude is not correct, the attitude of honorable members opposite is just the same. But the attitude of the alliance is clearly this - that we are quite prepared -to take the Bill back into Committee, and have a free discussion upon it. The alliance will never object to a free discussion upon any clause in any Bill. The other proposal before the House was as to whether the amendment indicated by the honorable member for Bland should be accepted. I say that that amendment was essentially a judicious and a wise one. It was a wise amendment, for this reason - that it was no mere empirical legislation; it was not an impracticable idea sprung upon the House,&#39; but an amendment based upon the experience of the working of the Arbitration Act in New South Wales. It has proved, in common practice, to work out well. There have been no complaints against it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cohen said that there had been some complaints in the newspapers, but they had never come before the Court, and there was no substantial evidence submitted to him as to its unsatisfactorines&#39;s. I say, therefore, that it was a workable amendment based on experience, and one which the House might have done the late Prime Minister the courtesy to consider. But it is evident that advantage was taken of the opportunity to &#34; clown &#34; the late Ministry. The present Prime Minister did not move a no confidence motion, because there was a belief that such a motion, if submitted by him would not- succeed. However, the effect was just the same. The Watson Government went out of office, and we then had brought into being the present Administration. It has been said that our alliance on this side was formed in a hole and corner sort of way, and without due consideration with our colleagues. </para>

                                <para>- That is the charge which is made. When the protectionists met as a party,&#39; we were asked whether we would accept a coalition which involved the present Prime Minister as leader, and, as a party, we unanimously decided that no coalition would be satisfactory to us that did not retain the honorable and learned member for Ballarat as leader. Did we mean that, or was it but a foolish statement ? I contend that, as a party, we meant it, and it was our desire that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat should retain that position. </para>

                                <para>- I did accept it. That decision was communicated to the present Prime Minister, and, surely, it was an intimation to that right honorable gentleman that as a party we declined to place ourselves under a freetrade leader. So eager was the present Prime Minister for an alliance that, in reply to that notification the tight honorable gentleman said he was prepared to concede the leadership to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. Then we met again. </para>

                                <para>- I should like to know in what newspaper the honorable gentleman saw it. I can say that I never heard of it. The first I heard of any alliance being proposed or suggested was when we were forced to take some steps by reason of certain honorable members of the party enrolling themselves under the free-trade banner. In view of the deep interests of the people of the Commonwealth involved in the proper exercise of the powers given us under the Constitution, we felt we were bound to come together to resist what promised to be a conservative alliance. When we saw honorable gentlemen taking office contrary to their own agreement, what other course was open to us but to see whether something could not be done to check what was in progress? </para>

                                <para>- My present policy is one of destruction of- the present Ministry, and I think I am justified in it, for the reasons I have given. I regret that a good democrat like my friend the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is not here, where he ought to- be, helping me. However, the position is that there has been clearly expressed by the people of the Commonwealth a belief in democratic legislation. They have expressed the belief that&#39; we should exercise the powers&#39; of the Constitution, in accordance with the democratic policies&#39; which have been announced. I say that the alliance proposes to give effect to that. The parties to the alliance have been drawn together because I believe they have sympathies in common, though there may be some differences of opinion with respect to the means to be adopted to give effect to them. What is the position with honorable members opposite? What is the bond of cohesion between them? They find fault with trieparty on this side because, in their opinion, it has put forward a vague and indefinite agreement. Let us consider what is their position. The Prime Minister has said that there was an agreement drawn up in no secret way, in no cave away down at Queenscliff, but at the residence of the ex-Opposition whip. What&#39; does that agreement contain? </para>

Unfortunately, the party now in office, quite apart from any question relating to its programme, maintains a control of its minority by its majority, and an . antagonism to all who do not submit themselves to its organizations and decisions which seems to make it hopeless to approach its members on any terms of equality, even on the present exceptional conditions. </para>

The honorable member for Lang is to be still at liberty to advocate his land tax, and to propose that we should heavily tax the farmers in the Richmond district. I hope that when the honorable: member for Richmond sets out on his election campaign he will take the honorable member for Lang with him, to explain to the farmers the virtue of a land tax. Perhaps he will also get the honorable members for Parramatta and New England to assist him. </para>

When you enter into an alliance with a party you act in honour and good faith, and you do not expect to be told after five years&#39; faithful service that you are too slow for them. But, when the Prime Minister goes before his constituents he will warn them of the dangers of Socialism; he will touch the pocket nerve; he will tell them to be careful lest what they have in their pockets should be taken away; he will describe Socialism as meaning the nationalization of all industry, and will refer to the way in which the policy has operated in the States. I wish to mention, as a corrective, a statement made by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat in Brisbane. The National Liberal Union issued a platform, containing this plank - 5 - &#34; Opposition to all legislation of a dangerous socialistic character.&#34; By this phrase is meant opposition to that class of legislation advocated by the Labour Party throughout Australia, which aims at the nationalization of the primary industries, the abolition of the private ownership of property, and the destruction of individual idea. </para>

The clause he referred 10 suggested opposition (o all legislation of a dangerous socialistic character, and amongst these were included measures relating to the nationalization of industries. Well, over industries the Commonwealth had no control, except fiscally. Then it referred to. measures for the abolition of private ownership - with private ownership the Commonwealth had nothing to do, except when it took .1 man&#39;s land and paid him for it for public purposes. And then allusion was made to the- destruction of individual ideas. Well, he did not know that either the State or the Commonwealth could be successful in accomplishing that end if they attempted it, but he did know there was nothing in the Commonwealth charter authorizing the Commonwealth to attempt it. </para>

The Labour Party is attacked because its members are Socialists, and yet a member on the opposite side says that, under the Constitution, there is not a single socialistic measure which can be passed. We can pass democratic legislation; we can pass a number of measures which have a socialistic tendency, and which must relate to the carrying on of the public Departments. But we, as a Commonwealth, have no right to go and nationalize the land. These statements are intended for the purpose of deluding the electors. . Honorable members say they know that under the Constitution we have no power to deal with land. </para>

Philp,</inline> the Premier of that State, a known free-trader, and other free-traders would not organize upon broad national lines of principle, but called meetings for&#39; the purpose of securing ^10,000 to fight an election for a class - such men, although they may pose as men of intelligence, as men of light and? leading, expose themselves to criticism. And they have obtained their deserts. Whenever a class issue is raised . between the classes and the masses, we need not inquire into the rights of it, because we all know what will be the result.

                        <para class="block">What is the issue now before the House? The Prime Minister has condemned freetraders in Queensland for not raising the fiscal issue, and for raising a dispute between the classes and the masses. But when we refer to his programme we find that in many respects it is almost the same as that of the National Liberal Union, which raised the issues in respect of which he spoke. He has opened a war between the classes and the masses. He on that side is leading the classes while we on this side are standing for the masses. It can only have one result, he says here, and that result can only tend to his displacement from power. The last ground on which I condemn the right honorable gentleman is because he has no policy. We are entitled to have&#39; from him a statement with respect to his future actions. What does he ask 11s to do? He asks us to allow him to go into recess for a period of six or seven months - practically at his pleasure. He is seeking to have control of the administration of all these Acts of Parliament which he has condemned. He is asking us to give him power with respect to a great many matters of negotiation. I contend that inasmuch as he was condemned by the electors of the Commonwealth, we should not be justified in allowing the session to close without a protest. </para>

                                <para>- All I know is that in New South Wales the Prime Minister passed an educational test, and&#39; that when he came here and thought he could put out the Government on the White Australia policy he abandoned his view, and voted for the honorable member for Bland&#39;s amendment, which wiped OUT the test. At that time the right honorable gentleman was &#34; steering from the steerage,&#34; as he termed it. He was doing all he could to get control of the Labour Party. He was always reminding his dear friends of that splendid alliance five years ago, and saying how he cherished the friendships which sprang up between them, quite forgetting, however, to mention the fact that ultimately he got too slow for them. In fact, they almost found him so slow that they never trusted him afterwards. </para>

First of all, the Prime Minister announced in .the House that preferential trade . was a matter of Ministerial policy. But later on he said he was going to deal with the matter when it was suggested by the Imperial Government. Then the honorable member for Gippsland said that in dealing with the matter they were going to stand by their pledges ; and finally we had a statement by the Prime Minister that if it involved any sacrifice of his fiscal faith he was going to dissolve the Cabinet. That is practically his position. That is as clearly defined an attitude on preferential trade as we could expect to get from the party. Then he adopts the Conciliation and Arbitration&#39; Bill, and charges us with breach of faith and inconsistency. But what is his position as regards conciliation and arbitration? First of all, he voted against preference to unionists. He used some very strong language on the subject - </para>

                        <para>He was then speaking, not of the modified preference to unionists, but of the principle of preference to unionists. Again, when the question of political unions came up, he said he did not believe in political unions even being entitled to register under the Act. We remember in what scathing terms he denounced political unions. He did not mind if a union were formed for industrial purposes only, and yet we find now that the clause is in the Bill which allows political unions to register, but will not allow them to have a preference. Again, he accepted the provision in regard to the inclusion of State servants. Did honorable members ever see such a &#34; swallowing &#34; policy as this ? Here are three matters which he mentioned as absolutely vital - preference to unionists, which was a piece of legislation practically unknown to the Empire; political unions, which was a gross abuse and attempt to use the judicial machinery for party purposes; and the inclusion ot State servants, which was absolutely unconstitutional. He comes in now, and says he is quite prepared to accept the Bill with all those three provisions. He was very vigorous in opposition, when he was on this side, but now that he is on the other side he says, in effect, &#34; Oh, I am so complaisant that I am prepared to adopt anything you like to put in. So long as you Will allow me to sit here, I shall let you pass anything you want.&#34; </para>

He will adopt the proposal for the survey of the Transcontinental Railway, even as proposed by the Labour Government. The Naviga-&#62; ion Bill was introduced by the Labour Government, and referred to a Royal Commission, and, therefore, he will accept the measure. The Papua Bill contains some clauses in respect of non-alienation, which he does not like, and he will accept that too. He will also take the Trade Marks Bill. </para>

The Government will not take charge of the Bill, but will allow a private member to do so, and when a division is taken Ministers will vote as they think fit. That is the position in this National Parliament, where we have only laid, as it were, the foundation stones of a great edifice. People are waiting expectantly to see on what lines this great Commonwealth is to develop. They ask &#39;for a policy. For over three years the right honorable gentleman has been criticising the administration of affairs. He has told us that he has a scheme for developing the Commonwealth, that he can set things right, and restore public confidence. Now that he has come into power, what does he do? He has adopted a few of the minor measures introduced by his predecessors, and is willing to swallow anything, so long as he is allowed to stay there. He offers no single piece of original legislation to the people. He says to them, &#34; Parliament has been in session for six months, and has done nothing; therefore let it do nothing more, but go into recess.&#34; Who was responsible for displacing the Deakin and Watson Administrations? Was it not the right honorable gentleman who now wishes to do nothing but get into recess? That is his first and only plan. There are other important matters with which I should like to deal, but I feel that the hour is getting late. We have sought from this coalition a justification for its formation, but what justification have we got? Not a single member of it has been able 10 justify it. All that has been done has been to attack the alliance; and particularly the members of it who sit in this corner. Why are we so bitterly attacked? If three or four of us were to transfer our allegiance to the. other side we should be perfectly safe; but because we do not do so we are subjected to all sorts of attacks and ridicule. During the whole debate honorable members opposite have tried to ridicule the terms of the alliance; but we are not ashamed or aft aid of their attacks, which have left us unscathed. </para>

Will fiscal peace prevent us from dealing with that important question, which strikes at the root of an industry which gives employment to thousands of people, and, according to present indications, appears likely to be one of the greatest and most profitable industries in the Commonwealth? It would be monstrous to say that, because the people have declared that the time of this Parliament shall not be taken up with Tariff details, that important question is not to be dealt with. The sugar bounty is paid out of the excise duty on sugar. Although I believe in a fiscal truce, if it be shown that persons are famishing for. want . of employment, that industries are being sacrificed, and capital is going out of use, I think that Parliament should give such remedy as an investigation into the matter suggests. I state that on the ground of pure humanity, and I do not fear the effect of such action on my constituents. I was elected without opposition, and. did not address a meeting before the election.

                        <para class="block">That was a clear and definite statement. I believe that the people of Queensland do not wish the Tariff to be re-opened. The finances of no State have suffered more under Federation than have those of Queensland, and if there were a movement on foot which would bring in more&#39; revenue to the States, the people of Queensland would be glad of it. It is unfortunate that the financial provisions of the Constitution are inextricably interwoven with the finances of the States, and that the present revenue Tariff is every year tending to decrease the Queensland revenue. Last year there was a considerable falling off. and apparently this year Queensland will suffer a further loss of at least &#163;70,000. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member&#39;s leader voted against the tea duty, which, unfortunately for Queensland, was not agreed to. For these reasons, the Commonwealth is restricted in its public works expenditure, because it is afraid that by reducing their revenue it may cause trouble and confusion to the States. But, although a larger revenue would be welcome to Queensland, a continual tinkering with the Tariff, and a perpetual alteration of the incidence of its duties, would undoubtedly cause confusion to the States Treasurers, because they could not properly estimate what was coming to them. The Prime Minister, however, did not accept the proposal for a fiscal peace, an9 now he calls it a fiscal truce, because he knows that a truce is merely a cessation of warfare, and he is ready, when the session is closed, to fight for free-trade again. Already the alliance has done a wonderful amount of conversion. A Select Committee was suggested by this side of the House for the investigation of the operations of the Tariff in regard to such industries as the House might specify, and the proposal was spoken of as a breach of faith. But now those who sit behind the Government are so complacent that they have found a new plank for their platform, and are prepared to give us a Tariff Commission. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members like the honorable member for Laanecoorie are prepared to give immediate relief. The honorable and learned member for Corinella, on one occasion, after he had been made a Minister, suggested the appointment of a Tariff Commission. He thought that it would be a good thing; but that the results would&#39; be a matter for future consideration. It did not, however, become a matter of Ministerial policy until it had been warmly taken up by the people and by the alliance. Then the Ministry thought it was good enough to make it a plank in their platform. This took place after all the talk we had heard about fiscal peace. So far as the alliance is concerned, we have nothing to be ashamed of. It has been suggested that the provision as to immunity from opposition on the part of the Labour Party at the forthcoming election is of a corrupt character. We do not consider it is corrupt, and we do not wish to suggest that the Prime Minister acted corruptly when he signed an agreement by which he undertook to allot four portfolios to members of the Protectionist Party as a condition precedent to the formation of the coalition. I do not suggest that that was a corrupt action on the part of the right honorable gentleman, and I do not think it was fair for him to say, as he did in Sydney, that liberal members of the alliance practically arranged upon a price with the Labour Party. </para>

                                <para>- The terms of the alliance have been published throughout the Commonwealth. We do not consider that we are bound as a party to formulate a policy, but we have indicated our determination to unite our forces against the Free-trade Party. There is a paper bond between the two sections of the alliance, but in addition to that there is a bond of sympathy which. I believe, will tend to good results. I know that we have all suffered from the strife we have gone through, but we can lay the blame for the fact that nothing has been done in the past six months at the door of the Free-trade Party. There has been strife amongst us, it is true, but I believe that- </para>

                            <para>- I think I shall be expressing the feeling of the majority of honorable members when I say that we are all sick and tired of this debate. If that be so, how must the general community regard the situation? Without doubt they view with indignation the conduct of this Parliament, the time of which has been almost entirely taken up in useless discussion. I have listened to the speeches delivered&#39; during the last three weeks with astonishment and sorrow. I have been atonished that honorable members should so far forget their dignity as gentlemen as to make use, during the heat of debate, of language of which, in calmer moments, they would never dream. Some honorable members have been charged with bribery, corruption and. robbery, and the term &#34;vile curs,&#34; and others equally objectionable, have been hurled&#39; at them. I have listened with sorrow to the speeches because the time of the country has been so wilfully wasted. I do not intend to follow the example of many honorable members who have preceded me by filling the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with irrelevant and absolutely useless matter. All I propose to do is to clearly define my position with regard to the question before the House. Even if I were not in sympathy with the present Government I should hesitate to record my vote in such a way . as to bring about another change of Administration, and thus disturb the business of the country. Even if the honorable member for Bland had been in office, I think that I should have voted with the Government in order to avoid a dissolution and the dislocation, of trade and commerce that must follow such an event. </para>

                                <para>- The Watson Government put itself out of office. If honorable members were to go into the country districts, into the suburbs, and into the large cities of Australia, and ask representatives of all classes of the community what they thought of this Parliament, they might be astonished at the tenor of the replies. They would be asked to point to what had been done by us, and if they were honest men they would have to confess that practically nothing had been done during the seven months we have been sitting. I ask whether we are paid to come here and do nothing but talk and talk until the country is sick of our quarrels? I venture to say that I shall have the approval of every sensible man- and woman- in Australia, from workers in the factories to those in the counting-houses, from the occupants of shepherds&#39; huts to residents in Toorak mansions, when I say that no Parliament in Australia has had so poor a record as this the second Parliament of the Commonwealth. We are wasting our time in . useless discussion, and ignoring the duty that we owe to the public. The small consideration which honorable members are exhibiting for the best interests of the people is really shameful. It is now proposed by honorable members opposite to place an additional burden upon the people by involving them in the unnecessary expenditure of &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000 upon a general election. Who wants a general election? I do not think that any honorable member on this side of the House has any such desire, and I am confident that not one honorable member on the other side wishes to go to the country. It is not so long ago since we had a general election, when most of us spent almost our last shilling in contesting our seats. We have had no time in the interval to save anything out of our &#34;starvation&#34; allowance. A dissolution at the present time would serve the purposes of only a few disappointed office-seekers, and would involve the country in an additional expenditure at the rate of about &#163;20,000 per annum for the next three years. I consider that the motion is unwarranted. The business of the country, as we are all aware, has not progressed during the period that we have been in session. The speech of the leader of the Opposition, in submitting this motion, was an exceedingly poor effort, and I was greatly disappointed with it His utterances are usually of a very high standard, being full of life and enthusiasm, but upon&#39; this occasion, his heart did not appear to be in his work, and therefore he contented himself with delivering a long lecture upon Socialism. </para>

                                <para>- I am dealing with the speech of the leader of the Opposition. The malcontents, it is true, have made no secret of their determination to raise the fiscal issue, despite the fact that every honorable member had accepted the verdict of the country that the Tariff should remain unaltered, at least during the life of the present Parliament. I claim that the honorable member- for Bland cannot honestly assist in the raising of the1 fiscal issue, in view of the emphatic decision of the electors in December last. Honorable members are well acquainted with that verdict. The honorable1 member for Bland himself admitted that the present was not the time to disturb the existing Tariff. Speaking at Wagga on the1 2th -September, he said - </para>

                            <para>He would not in any circumstances be a party to disturbing the fiscal peace now reached. The Labour Party had been able to knock out a few taxes, which pressed heavily on the people, and in this way had reduced the revenue by a large amount. The proof of their prudence in cutting down the Tariff was found in the fact that, on examination, the Tariff, as adopted, would now appear to average about 15 per cent, all round. As it stood, it was a reasonable Tariff, and should be allowed to remain undisturbed. </para>

                            <para>I believe there is no probability of any appeal for an alteration of the Tariff being responded to during this present Parliament. The people were assured at the last elections that it was desirable to have fiscal peace, at any rate for this Parliament, and I must say that I agree that it is desirable to have some rest from the eternal fight on the fiscal question. If this were a country which had been united for many years, and the full effect of Inter-State free-trade could be accurately gauged, and the whole records were available for years, then I should say that there might be grave reason to inquire again into the conditions brought about by the Tariff. But we have not had time since the passing of the Tariff to get any clear idea of what its incidence will be in the future. </para>

                        <para class="block">The honorable member could not have been very much in earnest at the time he made that statement, or else he must have made it with certain mental reservations. Otherwise he could scarcely have changed his views so rapidly. The honorable member for Hume, the honorable and learned member for Indi, and others, including myself, also declared that we would not be parties to disturbing the Tariff for some time to come. 1 hold that it is inconsistent and dishonorable for the honorable member for Bland to assist in bringing about fiscal strife with its necessary corollary, and dislocation of trade and commerce throughout the Commonwealth. Let us have fiscal peace and practical legislation. I am -sure that is the wish of those who have the best interests of the country at heart, as some honorable members will discover when they appear before the electors. The leader of the Opposition and his supporters have frequently complained that the Labour Administration did not receive fair play at the hands of honorable members on this side of the House. That statement is utterly incorrect. The fact is that the Watson Government could have been displaced during the very first week of its existence. It is well known that it never had a majority at its back. The Opposition, however, recognised that it was entitled to a fair trial, and I claim that during the period that it remained in office fair play was extended to it. The honorable member for Bland has also complained that the Prime Minister did not inform the House of the legislation which he proposes to bring forward nine months hence. Is it likely that any Prime Minister would indicate what his programme would be during the following year? I say that sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. The leader of the Opposition also urged that no mention was made in the Ministerial statement of policy of; an. old-age pensions scheme. While he was in power for four or five months he made no attempt to introduce old-age pensions. That should have been one of his first measures. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, so long as it was a feasible scheme. But we must see our way clear as to where the money is to come from. From that point of view, an old-age pension scheme cannot be hurriedly carried out. Is it not better, as the Prime Minister proposes, to consult with the States Governments as to the best way of raising the money? I understand that it would cost &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;1,500,000 per annum to pay anything like a moderate amount to the aged poor throughout the Commonwealth . </para>

                                <para>- I think so. We must not quarrel with the States, but must recognise that this is a matter which will require their serious consideration. I shall certainly be prepared to support any feasible scheme for the maintenance of the aged poor. But we know that the policy of the Labour Party for raising money for old-age pensions is to impose a Federal land tax, which will cast additional burdens on the farmers. It is possible that the Labour Party may attempt to carry out a portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Tom</inline> Mann&#39;s socialistic policy to the extent of compelling the farmer to part with his land. That is one plank of the socialistic programme. I should like to quote what a working farmer has said with regard to taxing the farmers. It will be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 2028, and is as follows: - </para>

After many years of toil, the farmers of the heavy forest timber country of Gippsland and elsewhere, farmers of the Mallee, who have lost their all through the drought, and are still striving to make homes foi their families, the backbone of the country, are told that they should be taxed off their homes. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is what the farmers may expect from a strong Labour Party. In Queensland, we already have a very heavy land tax, and I am quite sure that the farmers of that State are not prepared to submit to any further land taxation. I sincerely hope that this Parliament will not attempt to enforce any taxation which would tend to cripple the farming industry, which is already heavily handicapped. Instead of more restrictive legislation, what we need is practical legislation which will give more opportunities for the workers, and help to establish new industries throughout the country, as well as give encouragement and freedom to the industries that exist, and to trade and commerce. The honorable member for Bland said, a little while ago, that if a man is successful in life, and by thrift and industry has saved money, he must have done so at the expense and the injury of the many. I will quote his exact words, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 4706- </para>

It is true that occasionally the newspapers will mention the fact that one or other individual has managed, after great efforts, to emerge from the ruck, and he is pointed to as an example of what is possible for all others. They say, &#34; Brown, Jones, or Robinson, has succeeded ; why not others ?&#34; But very often, when the individual succeeds, he does so at the expense of others, so that the blood and tears of the many have contributed to the success of the few. </para>

But I do know quite a number of men in Queensland with whom I was acquainted thirty-five years ago, some of whom were in my own employ, and who, after years of hard work, and attention to business, have saved a sufficient sum to support them in a small way. They have afterwards started in a larger way of business, and have succeeded. Only the other day I met, in Townsville, a former employe who had a place of business as large as the one which </para>

He wished to impress upon me that he had succeeded in life by carrying on business exactly on the same principles as I had pursued when he was in my employment. I was as delighted to_ see him doing well, as&#39; I was at my own&#34; success. I can honestly say that the little which I have made, I have made honestly, and I do not think that any one has suffered at my hands. It seems to me that under the policy of the Labour Party there is to be no freedom of action, and no encouragement to individual enterprise, but that our industries are to look to the Government for all things needful. There is now to be no self-reliance, and worthy ambition on the part of the individual must be utterly destroyed. It was not so in Melbourne when I first knew that city forty-two years ago. The working people here were then self-reliant, they wanted no preference, they were content to depend on their merits, and desired no favours from any one. All they wished for was work, and they gave full value for any wages they received. In the present day it appears that the workingman requires to be nursed and fed by the Government, and he must have preference in employment. </para>

                                <para>- I say that no sufficient reason has been given the House for the want-of-confidence motion which has been proposed. It is true that the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne gave two reasons for his present attitude towards the Prime Minister. The first was that he could not trust the present Government with the administration of the White Australia policy. How verv suspicious the honorable and learned member has become all of a sudden. His second reason was that he wanted a dissolution. The honorable and learned member did not tell us why he was so anxious for a dissolution. Is it because, in common with others of his party, having experienced the sweets of office for a time, he is in a hurry to get back to the Treasury bench ? </para>

                                <para>- I do not know ; but I can say that they will not get back if I can help it. I am satisfied that there will be no obstacle in the way of my coming back to the Federal Parliament, unless it be myself. I am opposed to a dissolution for many reasons, but if the House is determined to have a dissolution, let us by all means have it as soon as possible. No speeches which have been made since the motion was tabled, and no speeches yet to be made, will influence a single vote for or against it, and if a dissolution is desired, let us have it by all means as soon as possible, and squander the taxpayers money for no good purpose. I wish to emphasize the fact that honorable members on the other side, though they may not have signed the labour pledge, will in future be classed as labour members. They will be known in their true light, and it is right that they should be. I believe that every honorable member on the opposite side should sign the labour pledge, that the party opposite may become a compact body of Oppositionists. </para>

                                <para>- We have no pledges on this side. I sign no pledges for any man. I allow no man to influence me in any shape or form. I must be allowed freedom of action, and freedom to form my own opinion as to what is the right thing to do, even here in the Federal Parliament. I told the electors when I stood for Parliament, that if they wished me to come down here as a delegate, to do whatever might be wanted in the interests of a special class, I declined to come on those terms. I said that I must be allowed the free use of my own judgment and discretion as to what was best for the community as a whole. I will not encourage or support any class legislation. Our friends in the Opposition corner have entered into an alliance with the Labour Party. There are not many of them present to-night. They have run away j but I wish to say that they will have a poor chance of coming back here if a dissolution takes places. Honorable members who have joined with the Labour Party imagine that they will not be opposed at the general election. It is utter nonsense for them to I imagine anything of the kind, because the Trades Hall party must bring out a pledge-bound candidate to oppose every other. It cannot help itself. Does the honorable member for Melbourne Ports or the honorable member for Bourke believe that the workers&#39; organizations have already forgotten what they said about them in December last ? </para>

The electors are likely to deal with the alliance, if - there should be an election, in a way that I am certain will make it impossible for it to exist in the next Parliament. It is not, to my mind, an arrangement of which any labour man has any reason to be proud. I have exceedingly regretted the alliance, and have Opposed it, and will continue to oppose it. In doing that, I believe that I am fulfilling a duty I owe to the electors who sent me here, and to the labour electors of the Commonwealth generally. </para>

                        <para>- I must again protest against the dragging out of the debate on the no-confidence motion. I do not think that it should require any motion to induce the Government to sit until a later hour - I &#39;do not say all night- so that the debate may be finished within a reasonable time. If they are not: prepared to take that course, I think that the House should meet at an earlier hour and sit longer, so as to get on with the business of the country. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WEBSTER</inline>(Gwydir).- I would ask the Prime Minister to at least expedite the decision on the no-confidence motion bv agreeing to the meeting of the House at half-past10 every morning, until the debate terminates. I am sure that every honorable member wishes to see the matter brought to a conclusion, whether the result is to be that we must go to the people, or whether we are to remain here. If we remain here, we should endeavour to get on with some of the business which our constituents have elected us to perform. The debate has now continued for nearly three weeks, and there is every justification for appealing to the Prime Minister, in the interests of the economy of the time of the House, to allow longer sittings. </para>

                        <para>- I do&#39; not wish to sound a discordant note, but this is one of the important debates of the Federal Parliament. A new set of circumstances has arisen ; there is now a new grouping of parties; and it is- just as well that matters should be set out clearly and fully once and for all. Furthermore, some Consideration should be shown to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> You cannot be expected to sit here from 10 in the morning until 10 at night. Such a proposal would be perfectly unreasonable; I suggest that honorable. members should curtail their speeches to a reasonable length, and hand in their extracts to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> unread. </para>

                            <para>- No ; I have always been in favour of that course. I believe that the only way in which to get through business is- to occasionally sit late. I have not occupied a great deal of the time of the House ; but I do not wish to take from other honorable members the right to speak as long as1 they choose. I think that every honorable member who feels it necessary to speak should be free to speak as long as he deems right: But the only way in which we can get through a considerable number of speeches is to occasionally sit late. We have been now three weeks discussing this motion ; but comparatively few speeches have been made. I do not complain of the length of them. The honorable- member for Wide Bay stated that the matter is one of great importance ; but while I admit that, I think that we should make an attempt to conclude the session by meeting earlier, or sitting later. In that way, we shall get through our work much more expeditiously, and. the country expects us&#39; to do that. </para>

                        <para>- I am positively amused at the farce which is now being played. This is the first time in the history of responsible government that an Opposition, having launched a motion of censure against a Ministry, has complained of the time wasted in discussing it. During my fourteen years in Parliament, I have never seen anything to equal that. And these complaints come from honorable members who have taken four and five hours to deliver a speech. I think that they should be addressed in caucus to their fellow members, not to honorable members who oppose them, and to whom their remarks do not apply.&#39; </para>

I hope that the suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should take the chair at half-past 10 a.m. will not be agreed to, and that there will be no attempt to sit all night. I speak feelingly on this subject, because I believe that I have taken years off my life by attending the all-night sittings which &#34;were so common in the New South Wales Parliament. If the honorable member for Boothby once had a dose of that kind of procedure, he would be the last one in the world to suggest it again. </para>

It is the way not to do things. The effect of all-night sittings is to destroy the health of those who attend them, and to demoralize and degrade all parliamentary institutions, while they do not expedite business. I speak on the subject out of a full knowledge. There is a way to remedy matters, and it is in the hands of honorable members. We do not want any one to compel us to lake it; we can take it for ourselves. </para>

I hope that the honorable member for Gwydir will not delay the House any longer than I did. He ought not to do so, for very shame&#39;s sake, after the long speeches to which we have listened from the honorable member for Darling, the honorable member for Canobolas, and the honorable member for Melbourne. I would suggest that we . should try to shorten the debate in the only legitimate way that can be adopted in a free Parliament, namely, by limiting our speeches to a reasonable length. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta has lately developed an objection to all-night sittings. He says that they have a tendency to demoralize and degrade Parliament, and to inflict a number of injuries upon the country. </para>

                            <para>- All I can say is. that I supported a Government, of which the honorable member was a component part, for five years, during which we had one weary succession of all-night sittings. Tha honorable member did not then protest against the demoralization of Parliament by means of all-night sittings. I do not agree with the idea of meeting at half-past ten in the morning. I think that an effort might be made without taking away from the liberty of&#39; any honorable member to address himself to the important question now before the House, to shorten the debate- in a reasonable way, and I shall be glad to endeavour to persuade honorable members on this side of the House to bring the debate to an early close. I think it is desirable in the interests of all parties that we &#39;should do so. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Gwydir ought to have known, that his suggestion was impracticable. A proposal for such an alteration in our time of sitting, must be preceded by due notice to the House, and the suggestion was made at a time when it was impossible to carry it out. In connexion with debates involving the position of the Government, the Ministry cannot act as it is often in a position to do when other matters of public business are being discussed, and bring pressure to bear on the House to shorten discussion. We have to allow every honorable member - and properly so. too- the fullest opportunity to express his opinions upon our administration. Both the leader of the Opposition and myself are anxious to do what we can to shorten the debate, and we had a consultation this morning to see if we could possibly bring it to a close this week. Knowing, however, that a large number of honorable, members desired to address the House, and claimed the same right that had been conceded to -others, we came to the. conclusion that it would be impossible to close the debate this week; but we both hope that a vote will be taken on Tuesday next, or on Wednesday at the latest. &#39;We are anxious that there shall be no surprise in connexion with the division, but that all. honorable members shall be acquainted with the time at which they will be called upon to record their votes. Those honorable &#39;members who have made . long speeches must concede the same right to other honorable members who have not yet spoken, and if the Government were to attempt to curtail debate, they would be exposing themselves to the imputation of attempting to stifle discussion. </para>
