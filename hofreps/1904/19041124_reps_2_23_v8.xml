                        <para>- I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if he has seen the report in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> concerning the treatment of the crew of the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Queen Helena,</inline> which arrived recently from New York. It is there stated that, owing to the action of the Customs authorities in sealing the stores, the crew were without provisions for many hours. To make the case clear, I will read the letter addressed by the captain to the Collector of Customs on the subject. It is as follows : - </para>

I pointed out to the boarding officer that it would be after hours when the ship got up to Victoria Dock, and that he had better let me have enough stores for the crew&#39;s supper. He said no, and that there would be an officer on. the dock to open up the seal. </para>

                        <para>- The newspaper announcement is the first I have heard of this matter. I had an interview with the Comptroller-General on the subject this morning ; but it had not before come under his notice, and he went off immediately to investigate it. In a preliminary report, which reached me just before the meeting of the House, there is a very serious conflict of testimony between the officer concerned and the statements in the captain&#39;s letter. The charge made by the captain is a very serious one, and the whole incident most regrettable. I have, therefore, given instructions to have the facts of the case fully investigated, so that I may judge as to what further steps are necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I should be very loth to countenance such a rule as the honorable member suggests in connexion with the conduct of business in the Federal Parliament, because there is a very great difference between the position of the Senate, and that of the second branch of the Legislatures of the States in regard to Appropriation Bills, since they have no power of suggestion in regard to amendments, such as exists in the Senate. The Senate, having the power to make suggestions in regard to Appropriation Bills, it is only reasonable that its members should be given a fair amount of time in which to exercise it, if they desire to do so. The exercise of that power would not be possible if the Appropriation Bill were sent to them in the closing moments of the session. We should show a proper regard for the rights of the other Chamber in reference to measures which come clearly within their constitutional province. Viewed broadly, the usage to which the honorable member for Bland has referred is the proper one, and I have no wish to break in upon it. This Chamber will act wisely in not allowing Appropriation Bills to pass away from its control, while important business remains to be transacted. But whilst regarding that as a wise rule, and one to be observed, I think that honorable members will agree with me that we must not go to the other extreme, and leave the passing of the Appropriation Bill to the last three or four, or perhaps the last two, days of the session, in the expectation that it will be passed hurriedly through another place by the suspension of their Standing Orders. I have no desire to ask the House to pass the Appropriation Bill while there is any business of serious importance still in this Chamber. The honorable member for Bland and myself have practically come to this agreement, that we may fairly take the Appropriation Bill into Committee. There is, however, one part of the appropriations which I think honorable members will readily agree to assent to in the form of a Bill, and send the measure on at once to the Senate - I refer to the appropriations for public works, which are separate from the ordinary appropriations for the year. I have received very urgent representations from the Sydney Trade and Labour Council, urging that works which have been authorized by Parliament shall be dealt with as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that my honorable friend and honorable members opposite will place no difficulty in the way of that Bill passing through all its stages without delay. I hope indeed that they will help the Government to forward it to the Senate as soon as possible, and I intend to ask them to allow it to be put through all its stages to-day. Now that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill has been disposed of, there is not a great deal of work for the other Chamber to do; but I should like to avoid any slackening off of the pace there, because they have had a very slack time all through the session. I ask honorable members, in the interests of putting useful works in progress with the least possible delay - a matter which &#39;appeals to the good feeling of everyone in the Chamber - to pass the necessary Bill through all its stages to-night. I promise, however, that the Appropriation Bill proper shall not be taken further than the Committee stage - which will leave all its items open for discussion - until other serious business has been transacted. With regard to the appointment of the Tariff Commission, I am happy to say that, despite press&#39; reports to the contrary, the leader of the Opposition has intimated to me his willingness to assist me in securing a thoroughly representative and satisfactory Commission, and in return I can only assure him that the matter will be treated as one of grave urgency. I am making special efforts to settle the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Commission, which is the first step to be taken, and not an easy one. Now that the subject has been divested of any party significance, I think that we shall be able to come to an agreement on this very important matter without delay. </para>

                        <para>- As a rule, the serious Bills are those which take the least time to pass ; but I am not going to answer my honorable friend in that way. I look upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as a serious measure - a very serious measure. But there are some other subsidiary measures, such as the Trade Marks Bill, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, the Papua Bill, and the Defence Act Amendment Bill, to carry out a scheme of which Parliament has already practically approved, which need not delay the Appropriation Bill, in view of our obligation to place it before the Senate within a reasonable time before the prorogation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline> LYNE.- The Prime Minister has not yet referred to two or three important measures. I desire to ask him whether he has made any arrangement as to the date upon which the Manufactures Encouragement Bill shall be further considered, and whether he has arrived at any understanding as to the date upon which the honorable and learned member for Ballarat may be permitted to deal with his motion respecting preferential trade. I should also like to know if he can make a definite statement as to when the Tariff Commission is to be appointed. </para>

I can assure honorable members that the fact that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and the motion relating to preferential trade were not mentioned, does not at all mean that those matters are not to receive attention.

There is such a large number of boys, and we have such a comparatively small service, that it is difficult to find employment for all the lads who are qualified to perform other work than that upon which they were engaged.

                            <para>- The increments accruing under the States Acts involve a very serious question of law, upon which high legal officials have given - I have not seen the text of their opinions, but I have perused a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of them - conflicting opinions. The question being one of law, I think it is highly probable that we shall have to refer it to the present Attorney-General. Therefore, with reference to the increments under the States laws, I am sorry to say that I cannot give any definite assurance, because the legal position has not been clearly ascertained. So far as the increments under the Commonwealth Act are concerned, there will be no difficulty whatever with regard to payment. </para>

                    <para>There have been no serious delays in dealing with applications accompanied by provisional specification. Although 1,157 provisional specifications have been received in the Patent Office in less than six months, notwithstanding the enormous work involved in organizing a new Commonwealth patents system, no less than 471 of these provisional specifications have been accepted. Considerably more than this number would have been accepted but for the fact that, upon investigation, a large number of informalities have been discovered, owing to applicants or their agents having failed to comply with the requirements of the law. In many instances applications have either been improperly signed or not signed at all, whilst in others the applications show no title to the invention for which they desire to obtain letters patent. The applicants, or their agents, have been notified of these informalities, and asked to give them immediate attention ; but owing to a number of these people living in places beyond the State, some time elapses before these informalities can be rectified. A strong disposition was evinced by Parliament, when the Patents Bill was being debated, that the Patents Office should not place insurmountable difficulties in the path of the poor inventor, consequently the Commissioner has used every effort, where an applicant has filed his own application, to enable him to deal with his own case. No possible loss can accrue to an applicant by the non-acceptance of his provisional specification, seeing that he is in no better position after such acceptance than he was at the date of the filing of his application. The acceptance of a provisional specification gives an applicant no rights against the public. </para>

						<para>Since this resolution was submitted to the Committee, I have carefully perused the speech delivered by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, with a view to ascertaining how far the position which he placed before us was supported by facts. While I do not claim to be a constitutional lawyer, I am of opinion that his dissertation upon the Constitution shows conclusively that we have no power to nationalize &#39; the tobacco industry. In my judgment he has altogether misinterpreted the provisions of the Constitution. He has dealt with this matter as though we were empowered to legislate upon every subject which had not been specially transferred to the Federal arena under that charter of government. I claim that we are bound by the provision of the Constitution, which sets forth most distinctly the various matters with which we can deal. Unless the States empower us to legislate upon matters other than those which are therein specified, we are quite unable to deal with them. It appears to me questionable whether, even assuming that the tobacco industry were nationalized, we could raise the enormous profit which the honorable member evidently anticipates. He has given us no indication of the data from which he draws the conclusion that a State monopoly in tobacco would return an annual profit to the Commonwealth of more than ,&#163;600,000. The honorable member states that a certain quantity of tobacco is imported into the Commonwealth, upon which he apparently estimates the amount of profit which we should receive. He says - </para>
					</talk.start>
                <para>I find from research that the annual profit upon imported tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes within the Commonwealth would be ^572,029, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> &#39;6,439. and ;&#163;II2&#62;857 respectively. He does not say what the cost of production of tobacco is, or what would be its selling price. He contents himself with saying that he finds, &#34;from research,&#34; that the annual profit upon the articles in question aggregates so much. Surely he ought to make a clearer statement than that. He continues - </para>
                <para>These sums aggregate ^1,001,325. </para>

                            <para>- A Select Committee, appointed by the Senate, is already inquiring into this matter. Under such circumstances, I ask is it necessary to appoint a Royal Commission? Personally, I do not believe in spending money unnecessarily upon such inquiries. If it can be shown that there is any reason why the Select Committee, which is at present engaged in investigating the matter, cannot obtain the information desired, I would not &#39;be adverse to the appointment of a Royal Commission.

                    <para>The profit on locally-produced tobacco, added to the foregoing amount, increases the profit to ^2,005,750 annually, if we deduct the Excise and Customs duties now received by the Commonwealth, less 3 per cent., from the amount, in order to allow for the cost of the collection of our Customs and Excise duties upon tobacco, we shall derive a profit of ^673,454 per annum upon nationalization. </para>
                    <para class="block">From his own figures, I find that the value of the manufactured tobacco, cigars,, cigarettes, and leaf imported into the Commonwealth is ,&#163;780,000. In addition to that, there were 802,237 lbs. of leaf produced in the Commonwealth &#39;during last year. The honorable member expects the present combine, after paying Excise and Customs duty, together with the cost of manufacture and production, to obtain a clear profit of &#163;673,000, which would mean a total clear profit of at least &#163;&#91;2,000,000 upon raw material valued at not more than &#163;800,000 or &#163;&#91;900,000. To my mind, that is an utter absurdity. He points out that in 1900 the manufacture of tobacco in France yielded a revenue of &#163;13,215,799, whereas the amount of the duties collected in England aggregated only &#163;10,500,000. At the time, I regarded his figures as somewhat strange, and accordingly took the precaution to check them. As a result, I discovered that he had selected the year 1900, because it had yielded the lowest revenue derived from tobacco in England for many years. It is a most extraordinary fact that the highest revenue from this source was obtained in r9&#176;3-4- </para>

Instead of the revenue derived from tobacco in England in 1901 being ^10^500,000, it was &#163;12,813,578. The receipts for 1903 total &#163;12,451,000, and for 1904, ^12,627^000. I do not blame the honorable member for the selection which he made; but it is unfortunate for him that in 1900 the revenue derived from tobacco in England was the lowest received for many years. </para>

There may be a monopoly, but, so far, the public do not appear to have suffered from its operations. He, and others, have put forward the argument that competition in this case is an evil, and that we should abolish it, and yet the protectionists are always telling us it is undesirable that there should be no competition in any industry. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. Kronheimer</inline>was also one of the original shareholders in the firm of Cameron Brothers. It is immaterial, so far as the point at issue is concerned, whether he came from Hamburg or not. We endeavour to induce foreign capitalists to invest in industries in Australia, and when they do so the honorable member would sneer at them. &#34; Kronheimer &#34; may be a foreign name,. but &#34; Jacobs &#34; is not ; while the Messrs. Dixson, who were mentioned by the honorable member, have been carrying on business in New South Wales for very many years. It will be found that the shareholders in this company have been engaged for a number of years in the industry in Australia. The honorable member asserted that the State monopoly in France was an advantage to the workers, and proceeded to show -the benefits they had derived from it. Whilst he was speaking, I inquired how many women were employed in the industry there as compared with the number of men engaged in it, but he was unable to give me any satisfactory information on the point. I have since investigated this aspect of the question, and find that in France, in 1902, there were 14,941 women employed in the industry, at an average wage of 3s. 3d. per day of ten hours, while there were only 1,746 men, who received an average wage of 4s. 1 id. per day, employed in it. In Austria in 1902 there were 36,029 females employed in the industry, who received an average wage of 10s. per week of fifty-two hours, while there were only 4&#62;377 males, who received an average wage of 11s. 2d. per week. These figures do not include the wages paid to boys and girls, for they come under the heading of apprentices, who receive 5s. 8d. per week. It will thus be seen that the State monopoly in Austria has not done much for the women. In Australia in 1903 there were 1,380 females, receiving an average wage of 3s. per day of eight hours, and 1,51.4 males, who received an &#39;average wage of 6s. per day of eight hours. These figures show that there are more men than women engaged in the industry in the Commonwealth, and that the wages paid are higher than those which obtain in France or Austria. Then I would point out that the revenue we derive from the trade under existing circumstances is almost as much per lb. as that received from the tobacco monopoly in France, while the revenue per head is a little more. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable member suggest that our revenue would be increased by the establishment of a State monopoly in tobacco? In France the revenue per lb. in 1902 was 3s. 1¾d., and 6s. 8Jd. per head, while in Austria it was 3s. 8jd. per lb., and 3s. 2jd. per head. In Australia, however, the revenue derived from this source amounts to 2s. lod. per lb., and 7s. per head. In other words, the revenue which we derive from that source is very much larger than that obtained from the State monopoly in France or Austria. </para>

                            <para>- So far as some matters were concerned, he would not say that there was a monopoly. In dealing with the tobacco-growing industry he went back to the condition of affairs in the eighties, and sought to show how t&#39;he output had fluctuated from time to time. May I point out to him that there was an increase in the production of colonially-grown tobacco at the time of the American war, owing to the shortage of American leaf. Then, again, colonial tobacco was used in New South Wales for the treatment of the disease known as scab in sheep. </para>

                            <para>- Colonially-grown tobacco was used for that purpose, and as soon as the disease was stamped out there was naturally a decrease in the consumption of the local article. How can the honorable member say that the tobacco-growing industry in Australia is being destroyed by the combine? As a matter of fact, it is being destroyed in France, as the result of the State monopoly. The growers there receive no protection of any kind. During 1902 the price of locally-grown leaf in France was 31/2d. per lb., whilst that of the imported leaf was 51/2d. per lb., and 44 per cent, of the locally-grown leaf was used. That accounts for the excellent quality of the tobacco produced by the State monopoly in that country ! It is of such good quality that, when a Frenchman had smoked a Britisher out of a railway compartment in which they were travelling, he thought that he had avenged Fashoda. He said that if the French troops would only smoke French tobacco the British Army would never face them. This is an indication of the sort of stuff which is turned out by the State monopoly, and which Frenchmen have to smoke. In 1903 the price of the locally-grown leaf in Australia was 4d. per lb., whilst that of the imported leaf was10d. per lb. Notwithstanding this, the imported leaf was, for the most part, used in the manufacture of tobacco. If the manufacturers will give 10d. per lb. for the imported leaf, although they can obtain the local article for 4d. per lb., it stands to reason that the foreign article must be infinitely superior. No man would give10d. per lb. for tobacco leaf if he could obtain an article of the same quality for 4d. per lb. We have also to remember that there is a duty of1s. 6d. per lb. on the imported leaf, which brings the total cost up to 2s. 4d. per lb. Would any one say that the manufacturers would pay that price if the local article, obtainable at 4d. per lb., would produce equally good tobacco? There must be some good business reason for the preference shown for the imported leaf. It is certainly not due to the fact, as suggested by my honorable friend, that members of the tobacco combine are interested in plantations in the United States and elsewhere, &#34; which are worked by black labour,&#34; and desire to draw their main supply from those sources rather than from local growers. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the honorable member would not expect any man of common sense to believe that these business men would import leaf all the way from America, and pay a duty of1s. 6d. per lb. on it, simply that black labour might be kept in employment, when they could grow it in Australia for 4d. a lb. The honorable member must think we are fools, if he imagines that we are prepared to accept such arguments. He may deceive himself, and those whom he addresses from public platforms by making statements of this kind, but when he puts them before the Committee he must expect to have them analyzed. I hold that his assertions are utterly absurd. </para>

                            <para>- Excise must be paid on tobacco, whether manufactured from the colonial or the imported leaf, so that there is nothing in that objection. Every effort has been made &#39; to encourage the growing of tobacco in suitable country in the New England district, such as the Moonbi Ranges, where the soil is said to be good for tobacco. The manufacturers have not set themselves against the production of tobacco leaf locally, but have, on the contrary, spent money in trying to develop the industry. To my mind, it is impossible that these men should be making a profit of nearly &#163;700,000 a year. I have not had time to go thoroughly into figures, but the statements of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie are opposed to common-sense. There is not yet a monopoly in the tobacco business, because in Victoria there are one or two factories which do not belong to the combine, while there is another in South Australia, and I think others in other States. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnell,</inline> of the firm of Dudgeon and Arnell, when examined before a Select Committee of the Senate, stated distinctly that his business had not been, injured by the combine, of which his firm was not a member, and that the price of tobacco had not been increased. The two tobaccos which went up in price were one. made by his firm, and another called &#34; Derby,&#34; but in each case the increase was due to the duty. So far as I can understand, the combine has not affected the position of the retailers, supposing there to be a combine in existence, though that is not proved by the evidence hitherto taken by the Committee. Neither have the general public been injured. I understand that Kronheimer Limited are the distributors for all the manufacturing companies in the combination; but the circular to which reference has been made has been issued by them, not to retailers, but to business houses. No retailer has been interfered with in regard to prices. </para>

                            <para>- It is desired to keep prices at what they are now. The honorable member when speaking upon this question, said that if the industry were nationalized, smokers would not get their tobacco any more cheaply than they do now. They would probably get a worse article; and the growers would not gain any advantage, because in any case the industry must be conducted on business lines. If it were under the control of the Government, its managers could not refuse to use imported leaf, and manufacture only the colonial leaf, because, if they did, the consumption of tobacco would fall off, since smokers would not like the article which was being manufactured. With regard to the dismissal of hands, I understand that commercial travellers! were taken off the road by some of the firms, but that they have been found other employment. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know; I am not acquainted with the details of their business. I understand, however, that very few travellers were stranded. If the honorable member had given me information on the subject. I could have made inquiries. I am altogether opposed to the nationalization of the tobacco industry. It is silly to suppose that the profits made by the combine are as large as they have been stated to be, and the Government certainly could not conduct the industry as cheaply as it is being conducted by the business men now connected with it. It is impossible for a Government to compete with private individuals in manufacturing. From the information which I have obtained, wages here in the tobacco industry are higher, and the hours of labour shorter, than elsewhere, while the&#39; revenue obtained by the State is as large as the profits of the industry in France. Personally, I think all tobacco bad ; but I understand that, according to the taste of those who smoke, the tobacco we get here is better than that made in France. I think that in every way it is more in the public interest to let matters remain as they are than to make the tobacco industry a Government monopoly. We could have dealt with the subject more satisfactorily if the&#39; honorable member for Kalgoorlie had told us on what his figures were based, so that we might check them. I think that he will admit that his speech was absolutely bald. No one can test the accuracy of his statements, or determine whether his estimate of profit is at all correct. I cannot conceive, however, taking into account the cost of raw material, of manufacture, distribution, and excise, that the profits can be as large as they have been stated to be. I shall oppose the motion. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for New England has criticised the proposals of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie with his usual vigour, and with characteristic enthusiasm. He has told us that he is not one of those unfortunate people who contribute to the revenue indirectly by the consumption of tobacco and the use of intoxicating liquor; though it seems to me that he would be improved as a politician and a humanitarian if he would take unto himself one or two mild little vices. </para>

Although the honorable member is a paragon of virtue, it would be an improvement if he could discuss questions of this kind from the point of view of one who has practical experience, instead of regarding the industry as one to be suppressed in the most violent way possible. His chief reason for opposing tha motion seems to be that the tobacco monopoly is not an evil, because it is not inflicting any hardship on the community, prices now being the same as they were before it came into existence. He allows it to be inferred, however, that if it became a serious evil he might change his opinions. </para>

It was shown then that no evil has been done to the natives by the system now prevailing in the Territory, but the honorable member looked forward to a Lime when evil would be done, and he was anxious to prevent that time from arriving. I ask &#39;him to be consistent in this matter, and to look forward to a time when the tobacco monopolists will carry into effect the policy which monopolists all over the world have at heart. </para>

                            <para>- The arguments advanced were on the lines which I have indicated, and the honorable member must see that he is inconsistent. Even if the tobacco monopoly is not at the present time a public evil, it will, like monopolies all the world over, try to extract the utmost profit from the community, so soon as it can do so with reasonable safety. At present it is on its trial, and is beginning to collect its forces. It takes a little time for a combination such as this to get to work to effect its purposes I can understand the argument of the honorable member for New England with regard to some monopolies, which he contends should remain the property of the community, as a whole. But when he discovers some radical distinction between the proposed monopoly and natural monopolies I am totally unable to follow him- A natural monopoly may be a perfectly healthy one, whilst an artificial monopoly may be entirely unhealthy. We have to apply common sense to matters of this kind, and I contend that the honorable gentleman, who believes in the creation of certain monopolies for the benefit of the community, ought to apply exactly the same method of reasoning to the subject we are now. discussing. I do not intend to traverse the figures which the honorable member has quoted so plentifully. </para>

                            <para>- I always remember the statement made by a sagacious professor of Edinburgh, who declared that statistics, like mince pies, depended for their good quality very much upon the individual who concocted them. Whilst I have no doubt that the honorable member for New England, so far from having concocted the statistics he quoted, derived them from what he regarded as a safe and sound source, I wish to make a few general observations which I think will go far to prove the unsoundness of his conclusions. The State monopoly of the tobacco industry is no new idea. It has been found entirely advantageous by other communities, whose intelligence is at least equal to our own. </para>

                            <para>- In the case of tobacco, as in that of liquor, taste has very much to do with the judgment passed upon the article consumed. Although I do not consume much liquor or tobacco I know that some brands that I would not care to touch are highly esteemed .by others, who have as correct a taste and as much intelligence as I have. French tobacco is manufactured in a manner entirely different from that followed in English-speaking communities. In almost every country modifications are made in the system of manufacture, in order to suit the national taste, so that what might seem highly objectionable to others is regarded by them as of the highest possible quality. Doubtless, the consumers of tobacco in France regard English-made tobacco with as little favour as the smokers across Channel look upon theirs. At any rate, the people of France have shown no inclination to do away with the monopoly. They are evidently satisfied with the quality of the tobacco, as shown by the revenue that is yielded by the monopoly, and we have a right to assume that the position is one which is not likely to be changed in a hurry. </para>

As the proposal now before us has already run the gauntlet of criticism in another place, it need not be debated at very great length. Most honorable members interested in the subject have probably read the very able speeches made in another place, notably that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I do not suggest that. I have already given the honorable .member credit for perfect good faith. It is possible, however, that he may have been misled, and I doubt whether we can accept his figures as absolutely reliable. I have been looking up some authorities upon this subject, and I have arrived at the conclusion that the nationalization of the tobacco industry will not remedy the evils which exist under what is admittedly a great monopoly, and as such most undesirable. A comparison which I have made shows that in the matter of taxation, we levy upon tobacco in the Commonwealth a duty equivalent to two or three times the value of the article, whilst in France the taxation imposed is equivalent to five times the value. The wholesale price of the cheapest tobacco sold in Australia is about 2s. 6d. per lb., whereas in France the cheapest tobacco is quoted at 2s. iod. per lb. Therefore, under a State monopoly, the cheapest tobacco is dearer than the lowest-priced article amongst us, even under a private monopoly. </para>

The quality of tobacco most largely consumed within the Commonwealth - such brands as &#34;Havelock&#34; and &#34;Yankee Doodle &#34;-is sold to retailers at 4s. 6d. per lb., and the most popular French tobacco realizes about the same price. Therefore, I do not see that any particular advantage is conferred upon the French consumer. </para>

                            <para>-That is stated by all the authorities I have consulted. It is said that no one with any self-respect would ever dream of smoking French tobacco. I am informed, on the authority of an expert member of this House, that some of it is almost as deadly as lyddite to those who come within the range of its odour, and that the Japanese have been seriously thinking of importing it in large quantities for use against their enemy. They find, however, that, brave as the Japanese are credited with being, even under the most adverse conditions, none of their soldiers are sufficiently brave to smoke this particular tobacco. That statement may be the result of a little stretch of imagination, and honorable members are at liberty to seriously regard as much of it as they choose. There is, however, a general consensus of opinion that French tobacco is uniformly of vile quality. I do not think that the Commonwealth would be likely to benefit much by the proposed change from the point of view of&#39; quality. Notwithstanding the great difference between the population of Australia and that of France, . I find, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hirsch&#39;s</inline> statements, that the former derives a revenue of 3s.01/2d. per pound from tobacco, whilst the latter receives about 3s. 13/4d. per pound. It will be seen, therefore, that from a revenue stand-point there is not a great deal of difference between the two countries. But as a matter of fact, as no private manufacturers or dealers are allowed to make any profit upon the sale of tobacco in France, the State profits there ought to be two or three times greater than is the revenue obtained by the Commonwealth from this source. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I can understand, tobacco cannot be sold by private persons in France for profit. As I have shown, however, the advantage is only slightly greater in France from that standpoint. In regard to production, it must be remembered that there is an enormous difference between the population of Australia and that of France. Yet we find that in Australia the production of tobacco is between two and three times greater than is the production in France. I can only surmise that the great majority of its citizens prefer to smoke imported tobacco. </para>

If we take France as an example, I do not see that any advantage is likely to be gained by the adoption of the change proposed, so far as wages are concerned. In that country the wages paid are alleged to be 40 per cent, lower than those which rule in Australia, whilst in the matter of hours the operatives engaged in the tobacco industry there are required to work one-fourth longer than are those engaged in the industry in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Off hand, I am not able to check that statement. When I was in the United States - which is the home of great tobacco trusts - a number of people were suffering from leprosy, and a special Commission was appointed to inquire into the cause of the spread of the disease amongst the white population which, it had been alleged, was due to excessive indulgence in smoking. In its report the Commission stated that in one of the States in which its members had visited the tobacco factories, they had discovered that only two factories did not employ leprous Chinamen in the manufacture of cigarettes and cigars. From that moment I thought it would be wise to discontinue smoking, and I have not since indulged in the habit. </para>

I cannot support the motion, because no argument has been advanced to justify the change which is sought to be effected. I do not say that a change is not desirable, but, in my opinion, we need a change in a different direction from that which the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has suggested. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to call your attention, sir, to the fact that there are two motions upon the business-paper which seem to conflict with one another. The first proposal asks us to assent to the decision of the Senate that, in order to provide the necessary money for the payment of old-age pensions and for other purposes, the Commonwealth Government should undertake the manufacture and sale of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes. The second has reference to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into and report upon the position of the tobacco trade in relation to the production, manufacture, and distribution of tobacco. In dealing with this motion it seems to me that we are anticipating a debate upon the proposal relating to the appointment of a Royal Commission. I desire to ask whether that is not so? </para>

                        <para>- I would point out that I have very little to do with this matter. The Order of the Day relating to the Government manufacture and sale of tobacco is the first upon the business-paper, and although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has given a ruling, in which I subsequently concurred, that it was not competent to anticipate debate, surely that could not be used as an argument in a case of this character. Otherwise it would be possible, when a notice of motion appeared upon the business-paper, to completely block discussion upon the subject in question. I would further point out to the right honorable member that, as Chairman, I have been directed bv the House to take this matter into consideration, and, therefore, it would not be competent for me to decide in the direction which he desires. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me extraordinary that we should be asked to deal in a definite way with this proposal, and subsequently to debate the question of the desirableness or otherwise of appointing a Royal Commission to investigate it. The question of the control of the tobacco industry and the revenue that we receive from the trade is one of very great importance. I do not suppose that there is any industry which is surrounded with greater difficulties than is that of the growing and manufacture of tobacco, and to call upon the Committee before any investigation has been made to agree to the establishment of a State monopoly is to ask us to adopt a most unbusiness-like and unprecedented course. This is one of the most extraordinary propositions that has ever been submitted to the House. I agree that it would be reasonable to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the working of the industry, because the report which the Commission would furnish would assist us to arrive at a proper decision. I do not know on what evidence another place was induced to agree to this proposal, but certainly no information has been submitted to us, showing that it would be a wise step to take. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the honorable member has studied this question so carefully- that he is prepared to create a State monopoly without further consideration. There are others, however, who desire that the whole matter shall be carefully investigated before the Commonwealth is asked to embark upon what would be really a speculative undertaking. Practically the crux of the whole question is whether we can produce as good a leaf as is obtainable from other countries which are celebrated for their tobacco, and whether we can grow it in sufficient quantities to meet all our requirements. There is not much to be said in favour of the creation of an industry which would interfere with the revenue of the country, and at the same time have to import all the raw material. During my term of office as Treasurer of Western Australia, a tobacco factory was established there, but I never regarded it as of much importance to the State as we lost a large amount of revenue. It seemed to me that we could have done very well without it. </para>

                            <para>- I have seen tobacco growing in Western Australia, but I should be inclined to say that, owing to the dryness of its climate, that State is not very well&#34; suited to its production. The lands in the tropical parts of Australia are not as moist as are those on the northeastern side of the Continent. I do not suppose that any honorable member will contend that the proposal to create a State monopoly is a matter of such urgency that we should agree to it without careful consideration. I would suggest that we refrain from dealing with the question until we have arrived at a decision in regard to the motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission. That would be a reasonable course to pursue. I invariably hesitate to vote against any motion for the appointment of a Select Committee or Commission to gather information for the guidance of the House, and I think that we should act wisely in agreeing to the appointment of the Commission for which the honorable member for Boothby has moved. The proposal immediately before us. however, appears to be a haphazard and mischievous one. </para>

The proposal now before us involves interference with immense private interests. Those engaged in the industry have expended large sums on their plant and buildings, and I have no doubt that if we created a State monopoly, we should have to grant them compensation. It has not been suggested that those who have invested their capital in the industry should be told that after a certain date their plant must be thrown aside and their workers &#34;thrown out of employment without compensation being granted to them. </para>

When hotels are closed, in accordance with the decision of a local option poll, that course has to be pursued, in fairness to the proprietors and licensees.

If we act with caution in dealing with this matter we shall give satisfaction, not only to the people of Australia generally, but to those Who are directly interested in the industry. No attempt has &#39;been made to prove that the enterprise would be a source of profit to the Commonwealth, and in these circumstances I sincerely trust that the motion will not be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - A difficulty has arisen now, for the first time in nearly four years, as to the meaning of the standing orders governing private members&#39; business, and I invite the House to lay down the rule that on all occasions motions shall share with general&#39; orders of the day the time devoted to private business, as the latter always share the time with motions. The intention of the Sessional. Order seems to be that orders of the day, general business, and private members&#39; notices- of motion shall share equally the time devoted to private business; but the wording is rather imperfect. If the House agrees to my suggestion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the Chairman of Committees will act accordingly. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the present method of dealing with private members&#39; business is unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it leaves only a short time for the consideration of either a motion or an order of the day, as the case may be. I think it would be better to allow the private members&#39; business entered upon to be taken right through until completion, or until the time allotted for private members&#39; business had expired. Under the present arrangement we have not a sufficient opportunity to deal completely with any business, although we enter upon the consideration of a great number of subjects. </para>

                    <para>- As this is the first occasion on which difficulty has arisen, I would point out that the Sessional Order relating to private members&#39; business appears to contemplate an equal division of time on Thursday afternoons between notices of motion and orders of the day. While, however, the Standing Orders provide that orders of the day shall be called on two hours after the meeting of the House, and so equally divide the time when notices of motion are taken first, there is 110 corresponding standing order providing that when orders of the day are taken first, notices of motion shall be called on at the expiry of two hours. As this is the first occasion on which the point has arisen, I call the attention of honorable members to it, and unless it is otherwise desired, I propose to allow the consideration of orders of the day to be continued. Do I understand that it is the desire of honorable members that private members&#39; time shall be shared equally between orders of the day and notices of motion? </para>

                            <para>- This Parliament was elected in December last, and has been in session for nearly nine months, which is too long a period, considering the amount of work which has been accomplished. If the Federal Parliament is to be in session almost perpetually, some of us will be faced with a very serious position, and the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of this House will be very materially changed. All but those of us who live in Melbourne - and who can attend to their ordinary business during the day, coming here in the evening - are even now put to serious inconvenience, and if we are to have almost perpetual sessions, the representation of the people will ultimately be confined almost entirely to the members of two classes - members of the wealthy class, whose time is at their own disposal, and for whom the remuneration offers no material attraction, and members who are prepared to give up all their time to Parliamentary work for the sake of the allowance of &#163;400 per annum - men who are prepared to live absolutely on the game, or what are known as professional politicians, though I do not wish to use the term offensively. </para>

                            <para>- There are many honorable members who will not be able to continue in politics if our sessions become practically perpetual. But if this Parliament is to truly represent the people of Australia, it must contain a large proportion of those who are in active commercial life, and who, though not prepared to give all their time to public business, because they cannot afford to do so, are yet willing and able to render valuable public service. The House of Commons contains 670 members, and the British Parliament deals with the affairs of one-fifth of the globe. That Parliament generally sits from about the middle of February to early in August, with occasionally what is known as an autumn session, lasting from six to eight weeks. Yet the first Federal Parliament had a session of nearly a year and a half, while the first session of the second Parliament has lasted nearly nine months, and is likely to continue for another three or four weeks. What have we to show for this long session ? The Arbitration Bill has every prospect of being passed, but it is practically the only useful measure with which we shall have dealt; the other measures which have been under consideration having occupied but little time, and some of them being measures which might very well have been postponed for future consideration. The trouble which is facing us has faced the Parliaments of nearly the whole world. I have gone through some of the works which have been published on this subject, and I find that in Portugal the deputies are allowed one hour in which to speak on miscellaneous matters before passing to the Orders of the Day, while in many of the States of the American Union the sessions are limited. In Indiana, the session is limited to sixty-one days, and in </para>

                            <para>- I think that what occurred in this House the other evening should be a lesson to us. It is most objectionable for the Government to have to put its foot down, or for a Speaker or a Chairman to be compelled to apply the direct closure to an honorable member. That procedure is certain to arouse feelings of animosity which should not find any place in this Chamber during the discussion of important public questions. The closure is the most objectionable means that can be employed to bring a discussion to a close. </para>

                            <para>- I know of no honorable member who would complain more loudly than the honorable member for Barrier if the closure were applied to him. I have seen it resorted to only twice, once in the Parliament of Tasmania, and once in this House, and I do not wish to see it again. In the Italian Parliament, which has to deal with matters quite as important as those which engage our attention, honorable members are allowed to write their speeches, but are restricted in the reading of them to fifteen minutes. I think that it would perhaps be of advantage if honorable members in this Chamber were allowed to write their speeches, because there is no doubt they would, by that means, be able to make their utterances very much more effective. I have taken some trouble to obtain information upon this subject, and I think that the facts placed before honorable members should be sufficient to show that this question is not a new one, and that it has had to be faced wherever Parliaments have met. I have not the slightest desire to deprive honorable members of fair and reasonable liberty of speech, but I think that in the interests of honorable members themselves it would be desirable to place a time limit upon speeches. Honorable members must agree that many speeches which have extended over two, three, and four hours would have had much greater effect, and would have been listened to much more closely by honorable members, if they had been curtailed to one hour&#39;s length. My idea is that this motion should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for consideration during recess, so that an order may be framed and submitted to the House next session. I think that the leader of the Government, or of the Opposition, or any honorable member who has to introduce an important subject, should be allowed unlimited time for that purpose. For instance, if the leader of the Opposition desired to move a motion of want of confidence, I should give him absolute freedom, and, similarly, I should place no restrictions upon the leader of the Government in his reply. My experience in the Federal and States Parliaments has shown me that it is not the leaders who are responsible for the long speeches that are delivered. I would restrict all other honorable members to three-quarters of an hour, or, if honorable members think one hour preferable, I should not object to that extension. Furthermore, I think that the honorable member who closes a debate should be free from restriction. If the course I suggest were adopted, no debate upon any subject need extend over more than two or three days. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that honorable members should be permitted to speak three or four times, or occupy an unlimited time, in Committee. One address upon any given subject should be sufficient. Honorable members frequently make Committee speeches on the motion for the second reading and second-reading speeches in Committee. During the consideration of the Arbitration Bill the Speaker had the greatest trouble in restricting the debate to the measure under discussion, and the Chairman of Committees had an equally difficult task in keeping honorable members to the question before the Chair. In the interests of the good government of Australia, and for the credit of this House, something must be done to put an end to the great waste of time that has been involved in our proceedings. </para>

I am also in favour of adopting the system which obtains in some of the States of America, of fining each honorable member <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> for every day that he is absent from the House during the session. I should like the Standing Orders Committee to consider whether, by limiting the length of the speeches of honorable members, we should not shorten our sessions, and whether by fining absentees we should not insure the regular attendance of honorable members, with the result that business would be conducted in a very much better way. I hope that the House will give this matter its very serious attention, and thus rescue this Parliament from the well-merited opprobrium which is now being cast upon it. </para>

                        <para>- Personally I am quite in accord with this motion. I think that a good deal of time is needlessly absorbed by honorable members in making long speeches. I am even prepared to go further than the honorable member for Franklin. Under certain circumstances, I am quite in favour of the application of the closure. I do not think that any private member should be able to move that an honorable member be no longer heard, but I should be quite satisfied to see that power vested in any Minister who is in charge of any Bill which may be immediately under discussion. </para>

                            <para>- But honorable members should recognise that the public business must be transacted. In the New South Wales Parliament any honorable member used to be at liberty to move that an honorable member be no longer heard. I do not think that that is a proper power to place in the hands of members generally. In the case of a Minister, who is in charge of a Bill, however, the position is very different.

Of course, I am not prepared to vest that power in a Minister without providing that he shall first obtain the consent of the Chairman or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> That condition would afford some guarantee that the motion was not submitted for party purposes, but because the subject had been sufficiently debated. I heartily support the motion. I am aware that the honorable member for Melbourne is very strongly of opinion that when a quorum&#39; is not present in the Chamber, the  Clerk  of the House should be empowered to immediately draw attention to the fact, and that the bells should be set ringing. I am not prepared to go so far as that, because I do not know that it is necessary to have a quorum present at all times. In Committee, honorable members should have an opportunity of speaking as many times as they choose, but I think that some restriction should be imposed upon the length of their utterances. </para>

                            <para>- Judged by his recent attitude, I am inclined to think that the honorable member would be violently antagonistic to such proposals. I am surprised to hear him advocating the application of the guillotine as it is practised in the House of Commons at the present time. I am amazed that an honorable member who professes to be in favour of liberal measures should advocate a procedure which recently resulted in the maiming and crippling of the Opposition there, when some Bills of the most vital import to the country as a whole were under consideration. There is no analogy between our position and that which obtains in the old country. In the Imperial Parliament, honorable members have to look after the affairs of a great Empire. The discussion of Britain&#39;s foreign policy absorbs most of their attention, and they have to husband their time in a way that we have not to do in Australia. Nevertheless, I frankly confess that in view of recent  events, something must be done to curtail the long speeches of honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- No. There is no analogy between the events of past- years and the inane drivel to which we have had to listen hour after hour in this Parliament. There is all the difference in the world between fighting for a great principle, and the deplorable waste of time which has recently been witnessed in this Chamber. There are occasions in Parliament when obstruction becomes a sacred duty - occasions when the Opposition believe that measures are being passed which are diametrically opposed to the will of the people. </para>

                                <para>- I believe that an outside printer would charge far more than does the Government Printer for the reprinting of these addresses, and I am not sure that the practice to which I refer does not savour of an attempt to sweat private printing firms. I do not think that honorable members opposite who are so strongly in favour of unionism, and all that relates to labour, should take advantage of the Government Printer in the way they; do. The time of the House could be devoted to a better purpose than that of enabling honorable members to address their constituents. There is always the public platform open to those who&#39; wish to place their views before the electors. </para>

                                <para>- I believe they did. I am happy to say that I have not availed myself of this system, but I may do so if it is to be continued. The whole House in this respect seems to be demoralized. I submit to the honorable member who moved the motion, as well as to the honorable member who replied to him, that it is easy for the public to provide a. remedy. I have heard many persons complain of the waste of time that takes place, and of &#34; the degradation of Parliament,&#34; as they term it ; but the remedy is in the hands of the people themselves. The secret of the whole matter is that the people have returned to this House three parties so equally balanced that they neutralize each other&#39;s efforts, and render it impossible for any effective work to be done. That state of affairs cannot be remedied by any rule of procedure which we may adopt. Even if we amended our Standing Orders in the way suggested by the honorable member for Franklin, we should find that those who wished to block the business of the House, or to prevent it from being conducted in a proper way, would still be able to do so. None of the proposals made by the honorable member would overcome the difficulty. </para>

                                <para>- I would remind the honorable member that there is no analogy between the United States system of Government and that of Australia. Ours is an entirely different system. There is no such thing as representative and responsible government as we understand it in the United States. In a Parliament, where most of the work is carried out in Grand Committee - where they have a miniature Parliament within a Parliament, in which honorable members may speak a hundred times on any question if they desire to do so - I can well understand that a limitation may be placed on the speeches delivered in the larger Assembly, whose duty it is to pass the measure which has been perfected in the smaller one. The Grand Committee of Congress is about as large as is the whole Parliament of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, there is no analogy, between that system and our own. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know that it would. Limitations of this kind are imposed in the Legislature of New Zealand, but there is no limitation to the number of times that a member may speak. Those who desire to make long speeches are, therefore, able to get over the difficulty by delivering them in sections. I understand that there is a time limit of twenty minutes to speeches made in Committee, but when a member desires to occupy further time he resumes his seat after the twenty minutes allotted to him has expired, and, later on, speaks for another twenty minutes. I am assured that the limitation of debate in the Parliament of New Zealand leads really to a very small saving of time. The only course open to us is to impose a limit to speeches which extend over so long a period as four or live hours. I do not think that we should allow any one - the Prime Minister or any other honorable member - to speak in this House for four hours at a stretch. If an honorable member cannot say what he has to say in an hour and a half or two hours, he had better leave it unsaid. The country would be all the better for his having left uttered those views which he could not express in a speech of two hours&#39; duration. Any proposal in the direction of limiting the right to make such unduly protracted speeches will receive my cordial support; but I am not prepared to support the adoption of the extreme measures urged, to my very great surprise, by the honorable member for Barrier. I see no necessity for any Parliament in Australia to resort to the political guillotine. The real remedy is for the people to so arrange the state of parties in the House that effective government will be possible. </para>

                                <para>- It is something very different. The political guillotine simply enables a Government to secure the passing of a section of a measure or portion of the Estimates without rhyme or reason. I do not suggest anything of the kind. The method of shortening debate which I have just indicated is one for which provision is made by the Standing Orders of every Parliament in Australia except our own, and it has worked well. We have not exhausted the possibilities of our own Standing Orders. We are working under a set which is obsolete, and should have been abolished long ago. Another place has already adopted new Standing Orders, and there is a draft set awaiting our consideration, which should be dealt with as a matter of urgency. </para>

By a simple alteration of our Standing Orders, we should be able to rid ourselves of the trouble of which the honorable member for Franklin complains. But the people must take the composition of the House into their own hands, and return a Government to power with a sufficient majority to enable it to control business and deal with it with all possible dispatch. </para>

                            <para>- I think we owe a debt of gratitude to the honorable member for Franklin for having brought this matter before the House. I pay but little attention to his assertion that he has met persons in all parts of Tasmania who are opposed to this or that practice. Tasmania is full of persons who are opposed to everything. Some of them are opposed to anything to which a few men in the neighbourhood tell them &#39;they should object. In every part of Tasmania, with the exception of the West Coast, men are to be found who arte Barnums and Napoleons. They consider themselves to be the genii of the earth ; they think that the ordinary men are returned to this House, and that the great men remain in the State. A person cannot remain in* a public house for ten minutes without finding twenty men who are prepared to say that the representative of the district does not really represent it, and that the right man to return is one of those who is drinking with him. What the man on the street says about this Parliament is unworthy of consideration. When the elections come round, the people reject the candidate in whom they do not believe, and the members of this House are the best that could be selected from a population of nearly 4,000,000. They have been opposed by at least an equal number of candidates for legislative honours, and have not been defeated, so that what the man on the corner believes is immaterial to us. He has a kink in his brain. In America such men are known as &#34;Western kinkerites,&#34; and we need not trouble ourselves about them. I recognise, however, that there should be a time limit to our speeches, for every honorable member should be able to say all that he wishes to say in an hour, or an hour and a half. The honorable member for Franklin spoke of what is done in the United States. In Congress the mover of a motion is allowed an hour in which to speak in support of it, and if he speaks himself for only half an hour, he may allot the balance of the time amongst his supporters. When the hour has expired, his opponent gets up, and he in like manner farms out as much of his hour as he does not occupy himself. Then the mover has another hour in which to reply. </para>

                                <para>- The time occupied in replying to interjections counts in the hour. I think that it would be a good thing if we allowed movers of motions in the House to occupy an hour in introducing them, and an hour in replying, and imposed a limitation of ten minutes on speeches in Committee. It would not then take long to get through our business. I see nothing to admire in long speeches, though one side offends as much as another in this matter. Everything depends upon whether members are on the Treasury benches or in Opposition. With regard to. what he said about professional politicians, I ask the honorable member for Franklin if he would like to see the Chamber full of amateurs, men who come here for an hour, and then go away to attend to their own business, leaving the professionals to keep a quorum ? </para>

                                <para>- There is a need for professional politicians as there is for professional doctors and professional lawyers. One would not employ a student who had not gone through the dissecting room to perform a delicate operation on his wife ; he would call in a man of professional standing, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fitzgerald.</inline> The people of this country paid guineas to hear Madame Melba sing when she was a professional, but they would not pay sixpence to hear her when she was an amateur. I hate this talk about professional politicians. Was not Gladstone a professional politician ? Are not Balfour and Chamberlain professional politicians? Every man who has made a name for himself in British politics has been a professional politician. The amateur is an automaton who does what the Prime Minister wishes him to do. He is a mere &#34; job popper.&#34; We want professional politicians. The experience of the last three and-a-half years shows that for the next fifty years to come the sessions of the Commonwealth Parliament will always last for more than two or three months. The American States Parliaments, to which the honorable member for Franklin has referred, have only local laws to attend to. The Parliaments of Ohio, Iowa, and Indiana legislate only for their respective States. </para>

                                <para>- The House of Commons is an anachronism, and Englishmen are beginning to find that out. How could 600 or 700 men do any work if they all talked? In a few years there will be local Parliaments for England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, with an Imperial Parliament to deal with matters of Empire concern. This Commonwealth Parliament must realize its position and its members must be paid decent salaries. Those who will stay here to-night to keep a quorum, and will be here again at half-past 10 o&#39;clock to-morrow morning to make a House, are not the men who draw incomes from businesses. They are men who come from the other States, and are dependent upon their allowances. The salaries paid to us are ridiculous. The time is not far distant when Parliament will, by a secret ballot, elect the Ministry, for a period of three years, and there will be no premature dissolutions. When that happens, members will be paid decent salaries, and they will be professional politicians, who will devote their minds to the best interests of their country, and not to the obtaining of wealth. The best men whom Australia has produced did not make a dollar for themselves. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes never made a dollar for himself. Neither did Daniel Webster, the best Treasurer that the United States ever had. The fact that a man makes dollars does not show that he has brains. It only shows that he is a monopolist, who grabs what other men earn. </para>

                                <para>- I withdraw the statement if it is unparliamentary. However, I did not rise for the purpose of being disagreeable; I rose to protest against the inordinately long speeches which we sometimes hear, and the perpetual repetition in Committee of arguments delivered in second-reading debates. The proposition of the honorable member for Franklin appears a reasonable one. He would allow both the leader of the House and the leader of the Opposition to speak at length, and would confine other honorable members to a limit of three-quarters of an hour, or an hour. If an honorable member has prepared his speech, he can speak with excellent effect in half an hour, but if he has had no time for preparation, he will often occupy three or four hours. If honorable members know that they have only a short time in which to speak, they will give more time to the preparation of their speeches, which will, in consequence, be more readable, and more creditable to them. The great waste of time takes place in Committee. The handbooks published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucy</inline> of the proceedings of the House of Commons, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bradlaugh, Mr. Justin</inline> McCarthy,, and others, show that the discussions in committee in the House of Commons are conversational in their nature, whereas we have in Committee what are practically second-reading speeches. Possibly, if the reporting was not so good, we should have fewer speeches. I am certain that if the newspapers took but little notice of our proceedings in Committee, the speeches would be fewer. For the most part, honorable members wish to advertise themselves. I protest against these long sessions. </para>

                                <para>- Although the honorable member is one of our most regular attendants, he occupies more time than is his due, and .owes his notoriety greatly to the fact that he makes so many speeches. Although I am not here so often as he is, I am not absent when business is being done; I am always here when I am wanted. When no business is being done., however, I absent myself to attend to my personal affairs. When I entered this Parliament, I threw up everything, took an establishment in Melbourne at considerable expense, and began to live here regularly. I found, however, that I was only wasting my time by doing so, the session toeing of inordinate length, and therefore discontinued the arrangement. If Parliament met in Sydney instead of in Melbourne, I should be able to attend, as many Melbourne members do, long enough- to get my name recorded, and then go away again to look after my business. There is very little in being a regular attendant in that way. The great virtue of a member of Parliament lies in his bringing common sense to bear on the business of the House. The honorable member may not carry this motion, because very few great reforms are carried when first introduced ; but it will pave the way for better arrangements next session. Possibly when the Standing Orders are considered, steps might be taken for a reduction of the quorum, at least in Committee. Moreover, a standing order to prevent obstruction, and what is known as stone-walling, might be passed. </para>

Our thanks are due to the honorable member for Franklin for having brought this matter forward, and I hope that the Prime Minister will place some suggestion before the Standing Orders Committee which will have the desired effect. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member was at special pains to impress upon us that he was not in the habit of speaking at greater length than was necessary, but I do not think that he is to be held less blameable upon that score than are other honorable members. Whilst I am quite in sympathy with the object of the honorable member for Franklin, I am not sure that he can accomplish what he desires by the means suggested. I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that if honorable members desire to waste time, they will find- the means to do so. The evil that afflicts this Parliament is one which lies too deep to be reached by the means suggested. I have been fairly regular in my attendance in this House from the opening of the first Federal Parliament, and I have watched the proceedings very carefully. It appears to me that time has been wasted mostly when principle has been lost sight of, and party interests have loomed up too prominently. We require a more radical reform than that proposed by the honorable member for Franklin. With the honorable member for Darwin I look forward to the time when Ministers will be appointed by a method different from that now adopted. I hold very strong ideas upon that subject, and I intend to take action early next session, with a view to bringing about a reform. Whilst I believe in Government by majorities, I contend that Government by mere party majorities is bad. Although some of our speeches might well be shortened, I do not think it would be wise to restrict honorable members in Committee, because I have&#34; frequently noticed that those honorable members who do the most work, and accomplish the best results, are required to address the Committee very frequently. Ponderous speeches, that extend over many pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and are reprinted for the benefit of certain constituents, might very well be curtailed. </para>

I could point to many honorable members who have a tendency to offend in the direction I have indicated. Possibly I may have spoken at undue length once or twice; but I am not by any means the worst offender. I think we might improve our present methods, and I suggest that the Standing Orders, which I understand have been thoroughly revised, should be submitted early next session. In the light of the experience we have gained, we should be able to shape them in such a, way that they would tend to expedition in the transaction of business, without unduly curtailing the rights of honorable members. </para>

I desire to direct attention to one matter which has a general bearing upon the subject under discussion. I&#39; have noticed that sometimes fully three-quarters of an hour of our time has been occupied in. dealing with questions asked without notice. I do not say that these questions are not useful, but I think that if ii question is worth asking it could, nine times out of ten, be placed upon the noticepaper, so that an opportunity might be afforded to the Minister to furnish a concise answer. </para>

                                <para>- We can scarcely ask Ministers to take upon themselves that responsibility. Our Standing Orders are so framed that it seems to me that Ministers would expose themselves to a charge of discourtesy if they systematically refused to answer questions asked without notice. I hope that &#39; honorable members will agree that questions without notice should not be addressed to Ministers except on special and urgent occasions. </para>

                            <para>- I rise for the purpose of supporting the motion. I think that instead of having been referred to, as I have been, in rather severe language by some honorable members opposite, I should have received their thanks for having been largely instrumental in causing this matter to be brought before the House. I am inclined to think that the proposal will not have any practical result, and, therefore, that the time occupied in its discussion will have been to a very large extent wasted. The motion is not of a practical character. If it would have the effect of hastening the adoption of new Standing Orders it might be of some use. It is time that the new Standing Orders, which are supposed to have been approved of by the Standing Orders Committee, were adopted. At present we are in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> who looks after us exceedingly well ; but I think it is a pity that we have not more definite and satisfactory rules to guide us. I entirely object to the insinuations which have been made with regard to the motives which have actuated some honorable members in addressing the House at length. What right has the honorable member for Parramatta, or the honorable member for Robertson, to insinuate that other honorable members have occupied the time of the House in addressing their constituents, or in stone-walling? I have a distinct recollection of honorable members who are now sitting upon the Government side of the House keeping us here during the last Parliament for very long hours, repeating arguments <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam.</inline> If I have been an offender in the matter of long speeches, I think that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat occupies a good second place. I claim the right to speak until I am satisfied that I have made myself clear. I am not desirous that honorable members should be attacked by brain-fag, as the result of listening to me ; but as no limit is placed upon the length of our speeches, I do not know that I am committing any particular sin in taking my own time in expressing my views. If the Government have so many political sins that I could not enumerate them within less than four and a half hours, honorable members opposite who placed them in power are indirectly to blame for the length of my speech. I think that the honorable member for Parramatta hit the nail on the head, when he said that the large amount of time occupied by honorable members in addressing the House, and the extreme length of our debates,&#39; was due to the peculiar condition of parties. I do not believe that there is any desire on the part of honorable members to waste time, but that the cause of all the trouble has been the unsettled state of our political life during the last eight or nine months. Even if we had had more stringent Standing Orders, and the length of speeches had been limited, we should not have been able to transact any more business. The honorable members for Franklin and Parramatta have the remedy in their own hands. If those two honorable members will cross over to this side of the House and assist us to bring about an appeal to the country the electors will be afforded an opportunity of returning to power a Government with a working majority. I repeat that, during the present session, the House has not been in the humour to transact business. The same spirit prevails in every Parliament in which there is practically an equal division of parties. Where a Government possesses a strong working majority, the Opposition can do little more than act the part of watch-dogs ; but when parties are evenly divided, it , is the duty of the Opposition to endeavour to displace the Ministry. I felt so strongly in regard to the wickedness of the present Administration that I was recently obliged to occupy about eight hours in delivering two addresses. At the same time I entertain no desire to make long speeches. </para>

                                <para>- Most peculiar ideas have been suggested during the course of this discussion. It has been implied that it is wrong for honorable members to take an active part in Committee work, and to circulate what they may say - which to them may seem worth circulating - amongst their constituents. I am one of those who think it is desirable that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> should be distributed among the electors. I can quite understand the desire of the Government to keep the people in the dark, because it is the only way in which they can retain their positions. I deprecate the suggestion that honorable members deliberately talk to their constituents, or that the circulation of their addresses is a procedure to be condemned. I should like to see <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in every household throughout the Commonwealth. I desire the electors to be brought into close touch with our parliamentary proceedings, and that object can be accomplished only through the medium of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The honorable member for Robertson has affirmed that some honorable members talk for the sake of gaining notoriety &#39;and of getting their remarks reported in the newspapers. I would remind him, however, that the newspapers very rarely mention my name. I regard that as a great compliment. Upon the recent motion of censure, when I spoke for four and a half hours, only four lines were devoted to the report of my speech in one of the big Sydney daily newspapers. </para>

                                <para>- No newspaper reports our remarks. We are here to do the Lest we can in the interests of the people as a whole. Though we may view matters from different stand-points, it is not for any honorable member to suggest that we are actuated by unworthy motives. The fact that we have not done much work during the present session is entirely due to the equal division of political parties. Honorable members upon this side of the House have endeavoured to remedy that state of things, but without avail. I say that this House is capable of doing good business if it were in working order. The Government, however, cannot control their own supporters. It is difficult for them to maintain a quorum. Under such circumstances, how can we expect to do business?0 I support the motion, but to make it effective I think we should have an assurance from the Government that an opportunity will be afforded us of adopting our own Standing Orders as soon as possible. Of course, no such opportunity could be provided during the present session, but at an early date next session the matter might be discussed. </para>

                            <para>- I am very much opposed to this motion, but not because I am anxious to make long speeches. Probably I have occupied less time in this House than has the average honorable member. As a matter of fact, upon only one occasion have I spoken for more than an hour, and that was during an all-night sitting, when I took a hand in the proceedings, just as did the honorable member for Robertson, when, as a member of the Opposition, he indulged in &#34;stone-walling.&#34; I am quite prepared to accept his statement that I am a nuisance in this Chamber. It merely goes to prove that my criticisms must have pinched him very considerably at various times. His statement, however, will not affect my future conduct in the slightest degree. I shall continue to give expression to my views, irrespective of whom they may offend, or whom they may please. The honorable member has charged some honorable members with talking to their constituents through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I can recall occasions upon which he himself has addressed his constituents through the same medium. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member has had some of his speeches reprinted in pamphlet form, and upon one of these pamphlets he actually had his photograph reproduced. Up to the present time, however, I have not delivered a speech in this House which I have had reprinted. The particular pamphlet upon which the honorable member&#39;s photograph was printed contains a speech having reference to the black labour question, and in travelling through Queensland I have had occasion to make use of several extracts from it. In this House honorable members must realize that we occupy a very different position from that occupied by members of States Legislatures. The latter come more or <inline font-style="italic">less</inline> constantly into touch with their constituents. But what is the position of representatives of distant States in this House? Since the last election I have been continuously resident of Melbourne, and I shall not be able to get back to my constituents before Christmas. </para>

                                <para>- But the honorable member travels in a very different manner. I trust that this motion will not be carried. I have worked under Standing Orders where the closure and the guillotine have been in force - where the closure was applied first of all by a two-thirds majority of the House, and subsequently by the decision of a majority, consisting of thirty <inline font-style="italic">members</inline> out of a total membership of seventy-two. Independent of party feeling, which ran very high at different times, there was no greater source of irritation than were these Standing Orders. Whenever the closure was applied it gave rise to a feeling of bitterness which lasted several months, and I am satisfied that the adoption of a similar standing order by this House would have the same result. From time to time differences of opinion occur among honorable members, but I can safely say that no honorable member of this House entertains any feeling of personal ill will towards another. If we introduce drastic Standing Orders, enabling the gag to be applied, we shall inevitably give rise to much bitterness. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that any remedy is necessary. I oppose the motion, because I feel that it would prevent honorable members occupying responsible positions from placing much valuable information before the House. Where the parties are almost equally divided, an Opposition can prolong debate and harass a Government, no matter what rules of procedure are in operation. Probably, the only way to get over the difficulty would be to introduce the guillotine, but I, for one, do not favour anything of the kind. I have known a Government to say that so many pages of the Estimates - providing, perhaps, for an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds - should be passed within a certain time. After this declaration has been made, I have seen two or three supporters of that Government waste the time of the Committee up to within a few minutes of the hour at which the question was to be put, so that members of the Opposition should not have an opportunity to offer any criticism. Surely this House would not be prepared to agree to the application of the closure under such circumstances. Some one may say that the responsibility for putting such a standing order into force would rest with the Ministry, but it would never be applied except by a Government possessing a substantial majority. I trust that the course proposed by the honorable member will not be adopted, for it would tend only to engender strife and bitterness, and to put an end to that good feeling which has so long prevailed among honorable members. </para>

                                <para>- He disagreed, not with the terms of the motion, but with the suggestion made by the honorable member for Barrier, that the political guillotine should be introduced. With one remark made by the honorable member for Kennedy I certainly disagree. He said that the length of the speeches delivered by an honorable member in this Chamber was a matter between himself and his constituents. But something more is involved.

                        <para class="block">Orders to occupy more than a fair share of the time of the House simply tramples on the rights of his fellow members. He wastes the time, not only of his fellow members, but of the country, and his action also involves a waste of money. Each day&#39;s sitting of the House costs something like &#163;1,600, so that the honorable member who monopolizes three or four hours of each sitting-day is guilty of a waste of public money. As the honorable member for Parramatta has said, there is very little in prolonged speeches that is really worthy of attention. It seems to me that this motion, coming before us, as it does, practically at the close of the session, is tantamount to one of censure on the session, and upon honorable members themselves. The fact that nearly every honorable member approves of it, shows that they regard it in that light, and adds point to it. I trust that after what has been said, honorable members will pass a self denying ordinance, and so curtail their speeches that we may be able to transact some business. The honorable member for Darling laid very great stress on the necessity for a dissolution. No doubt the political atmosphere will not be clear until a dissolution takes place, but such a thing at the present time would be very unjust to those engaged in rural industries, who comprise a large section of the people of the Commonwealth. That, I take it, is the reason why the honorable member presses for a dissolution at the present time. </para>

                                <para>- Even then, it would have come at an inopportune time for the farmers and pastoralists. There is no doubt that the peculiar position of parties in this House is responsible for the present condition of affairs. I have always been a supporter of party government, but in view of our &#39; experience in this Parliament during the last year or two, I have been led to consider whether it is not a mistake to regard it as indispensable. I am strongly inclined to indorse the views of the honorable member for Perth, and to think that if better progress is not made under the present system, it will be our duty before long to seriously consider whether it would not be possible for us to have a non-party Government elected by the votes of honorable members of this House. If such a course were adopted, I think that we should place Australia in a very much better position than it is in at present. We have not resolved ourselves into strict party lines, and, that being so, a non-party Government seems to be a necessity of the situation. I believe this motion will bear good fruit, and trust&#39; that it will be carried. </para>

                            <para>- I am somewhat surprised to find my fellow members sitting in judgment upon themselves. The object which the honorable member for Franklin has in view meets with the warm approval of honorable members of the Opposition. No one is justified in taking up more time than is necessary for him to place his views clearly before the House, and I think that the Government should, long before this, have submitted to our consideration the draft Standing Orders which have been prepared, after very careful consideration, by the Standing Orders Committee. There certainly ought to be a standing order placing a reasonable time limit upon the speeches of honorable members. I feel that, in any circumstances, the Prime Minister would not be a party to an attempt to curtail any address that was relevant to the subject before the Chair, and which was having a good effect upon the House. The Standing Orders, which we have temporarily adopted, enable practically one member to say whether or not an honorable member shall be allowed to discuss a certain topic. I should prefer any set of Standing Orders to one that makes one honorable member practically a despot. If the new Standing Orders contain any provision designed to prevent unduly protracted debate, I shall welcome them, for it seems to me that it is just as necessary to place a limit on the speeches delivered by the older members of the House, as it is to impose one on those delivered by younger and less experienced members. </para>

                            <para>- The practice which this House has uniformly followed is that the resolutions reported from the Committee of Supply are brought up, as on the present occasion, and adopted by the House. The matter is then dealt with by the Committee of Ways and Means, and its resolutions are in turn reported and adopted. Bills are then introduced to give effect to the resolutions of the Committee of Supply and of the Committee of Ways and Means. Last year three such Bills were introduced ; but this year I understand that only two Bills will be brought in. These Bills will be dealt with separately. If the House thinks fit, one may be passed and the other rejected, or one put through all stages and the other passed merely through the first-reading stage. This division takes place after the resolutions of the Committee of Ways and Means have been reported and agreed to. </para>

We have arrived at the present stage in the ordinary course of business. Resolutions have been reported from Committee of Supply, and I have merely moved their adoption. I have, however, pointed out that in the course of a friendly chat with the leader of the Opposition - to which I do not hold honorable members opposite, because he did not bind them, in any way - we came to the conclusion that the constitutional usage to which he referred this afternoon would be sufficiently protected if we took the ordinary Appropriation Bill no further than into Committee, until after the other contentious business of the session had been concluded, and passed through all stages a Bill authorizing the construction of new works and buildings. </para>

                            <para>- In that case two separate resolutions should be submitted for adoption by the House, one covering the ordinary Estimates and the other the Estimates for works and buildings. By agreeing to the resolutions of the Committee of Supply, the House agrees to all the items covered by them, and when that has been done it is very difficult to deal with any items separately. It is only reasonable that ;the two sets of Estimates should be kept separate, and that two resolutions should be submitted to this House. </para>

The course proposed to be followed will result in confusion and possibly something worse. The resolution will relate to a matter with which we do not propose to deal at this stage. </para>

                            <para>- Order ! The honorable member is now really discussing the point of order upon which I gave a decision a few minutes ago. I then indicated that we are following the course that has invariably been adopted in this Parliament. The point at which the division of the two Bills takes place is when the resolutions of the Committee of Ways and Means are reported. The honorable member is now practically contending that my ruling is wrong. </para>

                            <para>-The two messages came down from the Governor-General, and were, by a resolution of the House, referred to the Committee of Supply. That Committee has chosen, in its wisdom, as it had a perfect right to do, to consider both messages, and to report to the House, not first one, and then the other, but both sets of resolutions at the same time. The Committeeman a perfect right to do that, and the question now is that the report of the Committee of Supply be agreed to. As I pointed out before, the next step will be to refer the resolutions to the Committee of Ways and Means, and upon the resolutions of that Committee being reported, it will be proposed that Bills be prepared to give effect to them. At this point the two matters will again become separate as the Constitution requires, and the House may then determine what shall be done. </para>

                            <para>- The course to be taken was a new one owing to the distinction between the ordinary Estimates and the special Estimates to be made for new works and buildings. This is the result of the distinction made in the Constitution between Bills which the Senate may amend and Bills which it may not. A misunderstanding has arisen owing to the House combining the two messages in the one resolution, and sending them to a Committee of Supply. I apprehend that what is now being done is perfectly regular. </para>

                            <para>- I am arguing on the point raised by the honorable member for Hume. I understand that his contention is that it is not right for the House to deal with a resolution of the Committee of Supply with regard to two distinct messages. I take it, however, that the House cannot do anything else at this stage, and that the mistake has arisen from our having sent to the Committee of Supply two distinct messages under cover of the one resolution. </para>

                            <para>- I would remind the honorable and learned member that a Committee of Supply is set up at the beginning of every session for the purpose of considering all financial matters relating to Supply that may be referred to it. Each year various messages have been referred from time to time to the Committee of Supply, which &#39;has Brought up its report on every occasion, as upon this, covering all the matters referred to it. Upon one occasion three separate messages were covered by the one report, and I am not sure that in another case there were not actually four messages referred to the Committee and reported to the House in the one set of resolutions. We are not adopting any new practice or one under which any mistake can possibly arise. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask whether it would be convenient for me at the present stage to raise a question which has been under discussion for some little time, and which probably should have been dealt with in Committee of Supply. I refer to the retirement of Colonel Price, the late District Commandant of Queensland, and the question whether the circumstances of his case would render it advisable to provide for him some special gratuity or compensation. Upon reflection, perhaps I had better take an opportunity to refer to the matter when the Appropriation Bill reaches the Committee stage. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to have it recorded that I do not regard the course now being adopted as the proper one. If we have done wrong in the past it is not too late for us to retrace our steps. The effect of carrying the two resolutions proposed by the Prime Minister will be to pledge honorable members, to a certain extent, to the whole of the Estimates. That is an argument that would be used by the Prime Minister if occasion arose. To my mind, the proper method is to deal with the resolutions separately, and they should have been reported separately. I wish it to be placed on record that this method may prevent the general Appropriation Bill being dealt with as honorable members may desire, and that I shall not regard myself as being prevented by the adoption of these resolutions from taking any action I may deem fit with regard to the Appropriation Bill, and I trust that their adoption will not be regarded as being binding upon any honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I stated that I saw no objection to advancing the Appropriation Bill to the Committee stage so long as we transacted the serious business of the session which remains to be done before this House lost control of that measure. That control, it seems to me, will still be retained if the Bill be advanced to the Committee stage. </para>

                        <para>- I do not regard all the members of the Opposition as toeing bound by the conversation which took place between the honorable member for Bland and myself last evening. Consequently, I shall not complain if some honorable members opposite do not feel inclined to assist the Government so far as does the honorable member for Bland. But I am quite willing to take only the first reading of the Appropriation Bill to-night. As honorable members are aware, that is merely a formal stage - a stage at which it is never discussed, and one which merely introduces the Bill to the notice of the House. But there is a positive reason for putting the Bill relating to works and buildings through all its stages this evening. Later on, when we reach the Bill stage, I propose to amend my resolution, so as to ask the Committee to put the Works and Buildings Bill through all its stages at the present sitting, and to pass only the first reading of the Appropriation Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite sure that the Prime Minister will find that the members of the Opposition will be only too willing to help him to transact the business of the country, so far as lies in their power, having regard to their public duty. So far as the Works and Buildings Bill is concerned, I think that he will receive every assistance. Regarding the Appropriation Bill, I understand that this afternoon he announced his willingness to recognise the right of this Chamber to retain control over it until all the serious business which remains to be done has been transacted. </para>

                            <para>- If I appoint the Commission, surely I must take full responsibility for my action. I have to watch my honorable and learned friend very carefully. He must not resume his seat under the impression that I have pledged myself to carry out a certain executive act before a certain date. I should scorn to occupy my present position if I allowed myself to be dictated to in that way. Having regard to my position as Prime Minister, and to that of the Government as advisers to the Crown - and the appointment of this Commission will be in the nature of advice to the Crown, without which it could not come into existence - I decline to give any pledge in such a matter. I have given something, however, which the leader of the Opposition has accepted - something which is just as satisfactory as any sort of lawyer-like pledge which my honorable and learned friend could construct -I have given my personal assurance to the honorable member for Bland that I intend to push this matter through with the utmost despatch. But I gave that assurance voluntarily, and I &#34;give to the honorable and learned member for Indi, who seeks to impose terms upon me and to exact pledges, no satisfaction whatever. </para>

                            <para>- It was with drawn owing to a statement and a promise which were made by the Prime Minister. Scarcely had the honorable and learned member withdrawn his motion than the right honorable gentleman attempted by his glibness of speech to deprive his previous statement of anything in the nature of a promise as much as he possibly could. No doubt, that is why the honorable and learned member for Indi is rather dubious as to his future action with regard to this matter. I was present this afternoon when the Prime Minister made the announcement concerning the appointment of the Tariff Commission. The impression left upon my mind was that he was doing all that he could, by means of his command of language, to draw the Opposition into his net. </para>

In regard to the interjection made a few moments ago by the honorable member for Moira, I would say that I desire to see the Commission appointed before we pass the Appropriation Bill. The Prime Minister promised the honorable and learned member for Indi, and the House generally, that the Commission would be appointed at the earliest possible date, or, at pall events, at an early date. Nearly a month has elapsed since that promise was given, but it has not yet been -fulfilled. I certainly do not think that the Commission should be appointed after Parliament has been prorogued, and at a time when we shall have no opportunity to raise any objection to it. </para>

I shall decline to be bound by the report of the Commission unless I feel that, in the circumstances, its constitution is a fair one. I hope that the Prime Minister will appoint the Commission before the Appropriation Bill is passed. The desire was, in the first instance, that the appointment should be made by the House ; but, in view of the promise made by the Prime Minister, the amendment moved bv the honorable and learned member for Indi was withdrawn, and it is only fair that that undertaking should be carried out. </para>

                            <para>- The suggestion was made, and indorsed by the House, that if possible the whole of the States should be represented on the Commission, and honorable members will recognise that it is not an easy matter to make such a selection in the course of a week or two. This matter does not lie altogether in the hands of the Prime Minister ; it is just as much the business of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is as keen, as ardent, and as honest a protectionist as is any honorable member of the Opposition corner. Honorable members on this side will see that the promise made by the Prime Minister is carried out to the full. The leader of the Protectionist Party, sits on this side of the House, and his honour is also involved in the appointment of a satisfactory Commission, so that the country need not fear that a fair and honest Commission will not be appointed. The appointment of the Commission is not a matter that comes solely within the purview of the House ; it is an Executive act, and as honorable members of the Opposition have insisted that the Government shall take the responsibility for it, full time must be allowed to the Government to make a wise selection, and such as the importance of the matter demands. </para>

						<para>- I think that honorable members of the Opposition, who are interested in the proposals for an alteration of the Tariff, are quite justified in expecting that the pledge given by the Prime Minister four weeks ago shall be redeemed before the House goes into recess. Of course, as the Prime Minister has said, the Government must take the responsibility for the appointments.</para>

						<para>- I wish to say that there are two ways of putting these matters to one . occupying my position - the way adopted by honorable members sitting below the gangway, and the course followed by the leader of the Opposition. After the statement which has just been made, I have no difficulty in repeating to the House the personal assurance I gave to the leader of the Opposition, that I shall lose absolutely no time in this matter - that I shall make it a personal pressing matter of public concern to appoint the Commission without a moment&#39;s avoidable delay. I can give such an assurance to any one who approaches me as the leader of the Opposition has done; but when there is a veiled threat - when veiled conditions are sought to be imposed, and veiled stipulations for pledges are made - I can only meet such approaches in one way. I congratulate the country and the Opposition that I am able to pursue the path of duty in a more pleasant way when I am approached as I have been by the leader of the Opposition than I should be under certain other conceivable circumstances. If my personal assurance to the leader of the Opposition that I shall make this a special matter of urgency is not sufficient to inspire confidence that I will do what I say, all the pledges in the world will not make it worthy of respect.</para>

The right honorable gentleman said, &#34; I am not going to bind myself to appoint the Commission before the recess,&#34; and the Postmaster-General interjected, &#34; No, we made no promise &#39;to appoint &#39;it before the recess.&#34; What consideration will the protectionists get if Parliament goes into recess before the Prime Minister appoints this Commission ? </para>

                            <para>- We desire a fair Commission and tha House should have an opportunity to discuss the appointments. I think that the Prime Minister is right in saying that the subject to be investigated should not be discussed before it is referred to the Commission, but, seeing that the Prime Minister holds office without the support of the country, and is half protectionist and half free-trader, we should know who are to be on the Commission before we go into recess. The Prime Minister says, &#34; I am not going to submit to veiled threats. I am not going to give lawyer like pledges.&#34; Whenever t&#39;he honorable and learned member for Indi rises to speak, the right honorable gentleman seems to think that he can secure the cheers of his supporters by throwing insults at him. In my opinion, it would be better for him to amend his manners. But, although in the beginning he took up a very strong position, after the leader of the Opposition had risen he said, &#34; Of course, when things are put in that sweet way, I am ready to back down. As I have been asked so nicely, I will give way in everything.&#34; It was only on the 25th October, because of the action of the honorable and learned member for Indi, that the Prime Minister promised to appoint this Commission. Now we have arrived at the 24th November, and nothing has been done, and, no doubt, if -he can get into recess without appointing the Commission, the Prime Minister will be only too glad to do so. Every one knows that the right honorable gentleman holds his position on sufferance, because of the fear of a dissolution. But the very man who keeps him in power - the honorable member for Wilmot - says that he cannot stand him. The right honorable gentleman is in office, not because he enjoys the confidence of those who support him, but because he is the least of several evils, and they wish to keep the Opposition out of power. The right honorable gentleman is not trusted by this House, nor by his followers, nor by the country, and it is a disgrace to allow a man who is distrusted in that way to appoint a Commission like this. </para>

                            <para>- The Russian Ambassador to the United States is reported to have said a little time ago, &#34; There is no doubt that we Russians did tell lies, and did break our treaties, but we hold Port Arthur.&#34; Similarly I think that the Prime Minister has constantly broken his pledges, and has gone back on all the convictions and principles of his life, in order to hold office. Therefore, we cannot trust him in this matter, and must insist upon the appointment of the Commission before the recess. I am not good at &#34;stone-walling,&#34; but if the Prime Minister announced that he would not appoint this Commission before the recess, I would do my best to keep the House sitting, even if it meant a month&#39;s talking. We had a discussion this afternoon about the waste of time in Parliament. Occasionally what seems to be a waste of time is not so in reality, and a &#34; stone-wall,&#34; which would avoid such a catastrophe as I believe the Prime Minister is trying to bring upon us, would not be a waste of time. We desire that an impartial Commission shall be appointed, and therefore we wish to know, before we go into recess, who are to be the members of the Commission. I am glad that the matter has been brought forward by members of the coterie - as the honorable member for Echuca has called us- - to which I belong. We have separated &#39; from the other protectionists in the House, and from our leader, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable member for Echuca says that of us, I take it, not as an insult, but as an appreciation. I am glad to have deserted a party which can follow a free-trade Prime Minister, who, in my opinion, intends to act unfairly. If our protest to-night fails, we must use other methods, and the responsibility must lie upon the members of the Protectionist Party who are supporting the Government to see that their part of the compact with the Prime Minister is kept. I appeal to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, because he can, apparently, do what he likes with this Government. A short time ago we heard that the Prime Minister would set aside for him only one day for the discussion of preferential trade. Then a paragraph appeared in the newspapers, stating that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat thought that one day would not be enough, because he wished, not only to make a speech on the subject himself, but to enable the House to come to a conclusion in regard to it. We do not now hear that only one day is to be devoted to the question. </para>

                            <para>- He is not, but I do not wish to discuss the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. All I say is that he must have great influence with the Prime Minister, and that we have a right to ask him to use it. We were told in the first instance that the Prime Minister intended to allow the honorable and learned member for Ballarat one day in which to place his -views upon preferential trade before the country, and that the whole question was then to be closed up. The honorable and learned member, however, wanted the House to arrive at a decision upon his motion. Then the Prime Minister expressed himself as agreeable that there should be a certain amount of discussion. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat was not content with that. He stiffened his back, and the Prime Minister, whilst declaring that it would be premature to take any action at present, because Great Britain had not declared herself, agreed to allow the honorable and learned member all the time he required. More than that, I believe that a promise has been made that the Appropriation Bill shall not be passed until the motion has been disposed of. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the influence which he possesses with the Prime Minister, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat ought to see that the Tariff Commission is appointed without delay. We know that he does not trust the Prime Minister. I had the pleasure of listening to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat speak about twelve months ago, when he gave a very frank expression to his opinions with regard to the Prime Minister. Although he has been sitting behind the Treasury benches for some little time, I doubt very much whether his views have undergone any change. We have a right - this little group of members in the Opposition corner, the small coterie of protectionists in this cave of Adullam - call it what you like- </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to say anything hostile to the Minister of Defence nor to my protectionist friends on the Government side of the House. I appeal to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat to take a hand in this fight. If he assures us that he has obtained a promise that the Commission shall be appointed before we go into recess, the whole matter will be disposed of, and I shall be satisfied. He pulls the strings, and the Prime Minister works. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand what all this commotion is about. I was under the impression that the gentlemen who represent the Protectionist Party on this side of the Chamber had ample confidence in their late leader, and, seeing that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat has told us that he has every confidence in the Prime Minister, it naturally follows that he has obtained information with regard to the appointment of the Tariff Commission that has not yet been communicated to the public. I think that honorable members are quite justified in assuming that the honorable and learned member has full power to see that the promise given by &#34;the Prime Minister is kept. I understood that the Prime Minister stated that he was prepared to communicate to honorable members the names of the members of the Commission before we went into recess. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister makes an appeal on behalf of some men who are out of work, and we know exactly what his motive is. If the light honorable gentleman has any real solicitude for these men he will show it by expediting the appointment of the Tariff Commission, .because if we are to believe the advocates of the appointment of the Commission, the work which it will do will be of much gt eater importance to the working men of Australia than the mere passing of a few works Estimates. I should have thought the right honorable gentleman had had a sufficient amount of experience of Commissions which have been appointed behind the back of Parliament, and that for his own sake he would have asked honorable members to share his responsibility. Honorable members belonging to the Protectionist Party seem to think that their cause is perfectly safe in the hands of Ministers who belong to the same fiscal faith as themselves, and personally I shall be perfectly satisfied, and will give the Ministry every assistance, in my power in closing the business of . the session if they will announce the names of the Commission before the prorogation takes place. </para>

                        <para>- I am surprised that so much heat has been shown during this discussion. I would like to remind the Committee that the Prime Minister was not the first in this Parliament to appoint a Commission. During the last session a distinct promise was given that the names of the members of a certain  Commission would be announced before the prorogation. Circumstances, however, prevented that promise from being kept, and the Commission was appointed during the recess. I refer to the Federal Capital Sites Commission, whose report was something like a Chinese classic, and had to be read backwards. I would strongly recommend the Prime Minister, in view of the results in that case, to announce to Parliament the names of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                        <para>- The most striking statement made here to-night was that which fell from the honorable member for Echuca, to the effect that the protectionist members on the Government side of the House were as anxious as, if not more anxious than, those on this side of the Chamber to have the Tariff Commission appointed. If my memory serves me accurately, not a single protectionist upon the other side of the Chamber uttered a solitary word in support of the motion submitted in favour of the appointment of the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- The fact is, the Prime Minister has got into the difficulty which we all foresaw, when he took upon himself the responsibility of appointing that Commission. The original motion affirmed that that body should be constituted by this House. The right honorable gentleman, however, declared that such a proceeding would be tantamount to taking the conduct of business out of his hands, and expressed his willingness to appoint the Commission and to accept full responsibility for his action. Originally, there were to be no members of Parliament appointed to that body ; subsequently there were to be one or two, and <inline font-style="italic">fit</inline> ,a later stage there were to be &#34; some.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I think that &#34; some &#34; means more than one or two. Consequently, there have been several changes in connexion with the appointment of .this Commission. Honorable members upon this side of the Chamber have a great deal to do with those changes, and it is because of the advances which they have made that they have been content to rest awhile. I do not wish to take any part in discussing the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Commission, but I desire that it should be appointed without delay, in order that it may get to work. The Prime Minister promised that he would embrace the earliest opportunity of appointing it for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister proposes to give time for the discussion of what he calls &#34;serious matters of business.&#34; Amongst that business he includes the question of Preferential Trade, although I do not know that he has promised to grant sufficient time for its consideration to enable us to come to a division upon it. He has further pledged himself to give the House an opportunity to consider the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Surely the rectification of Tariff anomalies, locally considered, is far more important than either of those subjects. </para>

The honorable member for Echuca has stated that the Government are doing something. But he is not an authority upon the subject, and the Minister of Trade and Customs is. If the latter would make an announcement as to what is being done we should know exactly where we stood. In default of such a statement we are justified in suspecting that nothing is being done. </para>

                            <para>- I am satisfied that the debate, which has elicited the statements made this evening by the Prime Minister, will lead to the appointment of the Commission at a much earlier date than would otherwise have been the case. He has assured the Committee that he will make it his business to look into the matter as one of pressing importance. </para>

                            <para>- The statement was made privately. What we desired was the public declaration which we have obtained this evening from the right honorable gentleman. Other statements which have been made by him lead me to believe that the debate has saved time, and cleared up several matters about which there was some doubt. I should certainly like to see the Tariff Commission appointed before the session ends, and, speaking for myself, shall not give my consent to the passing of the Appropriation Bill until we have had, not a promise, but the appointment actually made. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to pour a little oil on the troubled waters, and to utter some words of encouragement to my honorable friends of the Alliance. There seems to be a general impression that the Parliament will be prorogued at an early date ; but, having regard to the progress made this evening, and to the programme for the remainder of this session, which was announced yesterday by the Government, I think that honorable members of the Opposition corner have every reason to hope that the Commission will be appointed before we go into recess. It seems to me that the session is not likely to close before February next. The Government tell us that they intended from the outset - even before the matter was brought forward by the honorable and learned member for Indi - to appoint a Tariff Commission. They have been about three months in office, so that we have a fair indication of the rate of progress they are likely to make in appointing the Commission, and can form some idea as to when the proper time will arrive for the passing of the Appropriation Bill. The Government have now reached a stage at which they consider that the appointment of the Commission is an urgent matter, and the Prime Minister is prepared to accept nominations from any source. </para>

                            <para>- The Government, at all events, are prepared to accept nominations from any reasonable source, and I presume that honorable members of the Opposition corner are in a position to make nominations. We ought to have some sympathy with the Prime Minister, for he is at the head of a very mixed party. The Cabinet consists of two opposing elements, and that possibly is the reason why they have been so long in arriving at the conclusion that the appointment of the Commission is an urgent matter. Possibly the Commission will be appointed in the course of the next three months. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I am; but I wish to hold Out some hope of the appointment of the Commission to my honorable friends of the Opposition corner. There is some justification for their dissatisfaction, seeing that the Government have so long delayed the work of making a selection. The issues involved in the question of free-trade <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> protection are so well known that there should be no difficulty in making a satisfactory appointment; but the trouble is that the Cabinet is equally divided, and that the two opposing parties apparently must share and share alike. I would suggest that the two sections of the Cabinet should meet in separate rooms, and decide first of all how many gentlemen from their party should foe appointed to the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- They were a united body, and had a solid party behind them, but the Government is not in that happy position. If they adopted my suggestion, I think that they would be able to appoint a Commission in less than three months. We know that they are anxious to go into recess, because that is their only haven of rest, and they certainly ought to appoint the Commission before Parliament is prorogued. Having agreed upon the number of members to be appointed to the Commission, the two sections of the Cabinet should proceed to select the men whom they think should represent the protectionist and free-trade parties. If the Commission were tacitly approved before the prorogation of Parliament, the Government would be able to go into recess feeling much happier than they would otherwise do, for they would know that they would not be liable to be attacked, on again meeting the House, for their action in regard to the matter. </para>

                            <para>- Statements have been made to-night which must be offensive to the protectionist members in this corner. There has been a division of the Protectionist Party - I need not now discuss the causes of it- but it is nevertheless our duty to uphold the great principles of protection. I am willing to believe that those principles are still dear to the protectionists who support the Government. But what can be of more importance to all protectionists than the finding of a remedy for the terrible industrial conditions which have arisen out of the operation of the present Tariff? I was very much amazed to hear the Prime Minister say to-night that when the proposed Tariff Commission is appointed he will say to the House, &#34; These are the Commissioners,&#34; but that the House will not have an opportunity to approve or disapprove of them. </para>

In reply to the threat that the Appropriation Bill would not be passed until the appointments were made, I stated that that created a situation which embarrasses me in carrying out the duty of forming a Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I have always given the Prime Minister credit for upholding the principles of free-trade as well as they have been upheld by any one, and surely he might give the protectionists who sit on this side of the Chamber credit for being true to their faith. Three questions are now of great moment to us. The first is the appointment of a Commission to deal fairly and squarely with the Tariff, and to recommend a remedy for the evils which exist under it. The next is, how to bring about preferential free-trade with Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- The great question of preferential trade with Great Britain is not in the hands of the Prime Minister, whose principles compel him to oppose such preference, but in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is supposed to be the head of the Protectionist Party in the Ministry. Surely the protectionists in this Chamber should set principle above everything else. What we wish to know is what is going to be done in regard to these two great questions, and in regard to the third great question which we have at heart, the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, which is now in the hands of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro? We were not elected by our constituents to hasten into recess. Our duty is to face the difficulties which are now causing such an outcry throughout the country. I trust that these matters will be lifted above party questions. I, in the first instance, objected to the appointment of any but Members of Parliament to the proposed Commission, because I believe that Members of Parliament  know more about Tariff matters than do persons outside, since we spent twelve months in discussing the Tariff, and obtained information in regard to it from all points of view. It has been decided, however, that persons who are not Members of Parliament, but who, I presume, have positions in the commercial world, shall be appointed. </para>

                            <para>- We have had no statement as to how many Members of Parliament will be appointed. The Prime Minister. has not shown sufficient candour in this matter. It is the country that wants this information. The difficulty in connexion with the appointment of a Commission will be that there will be too many, not too few, good men offering. I should like to know why the protectionists who are supporting the Ministry are now absent from the Chamber ? </para>

                            <para>- That was not such an urgent matter. There is no use in our hiding our heads in the sand. We know that what is practically a Commission has been sitting for the last twelve months, collecting evidence with regard to the effect of the Tariff upon our principal industries. Testimony has been afforded from time to time that our industries are languishing, and that our workmen are being thrown out of employment as the result of the operation of the Tariff. All this should point to the extreme urgency of the case. I do not blame the Prime Minister, because I know that it is part of his policy to ignore the claims of our manufacturing industries. He does not wish to see them gain any ascendency over the importers. 1 look, however, to those who belong to the same fiscal faith as myself, for some light and leading. If the honorable and learned member for Ballarat is still the protectionist leader, why does he not give us some assurance that the Commission will be appointed without delay? Why should we be asked to &#34; shut our eyes, and open our mouths, and see what God will send us?&#34; We are not here for that purpose, but are required to do our best for the people of Australia in every walk of life. The Tariff Commission will, if it applies itself to its work conscientiously and earnestly, do an immense amount of good, as also will the measure which is intended to promote the establishment of the manufacture of iron and steel in our midst. The Prime Minister has avowed himself as an out-and-out opponent of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and he is also unfavorable to the appointment of the Tariff Commission. Unfortunately, we have a tug-of-war Government, one-half of the Ministers pulling in one way, and the other tugging in the opposite direction. Hence we can obtain no satisfaction. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will succeed in converting the Prime Minister to his views, and that we shall be able to obtain some assurance that no time will be lost in doing that which is required to conserve our manufacturing interests. I do not see any necessity for the display of heat over this question, or for any threats or talk about resistance of demands. Honorable members, irrespective of parties, should be taken into the confidence of the Prime Minister, and the people should be told what steps, are to be taken. If the Prime Minister will promise to announce the names of the members of the Commission, so that&#39; matters may assume a practical shape before we go into recess, I shall not have another word to say. It is of no use for the right honorable gentleman to say that he will resist certain demands, or for honorable members on this side of the House to indulge in threats. As a protectionist and a liberal, I am prepared to do my duty without intimating beforehand what steps I intend to take in the interests of protection, and with the object of providing work for our citizens* </para>

I cannot believe that he understood what took place. When the honorable member said that there was no necessity for any heat in connexion with this matter, the only remark I made was that I thought it was time we had a little more light on the subject. He then told me that I was not to be impertinent, or he would deal it out to me. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member said that he had something he could communicate to honorable members concerning my career, which would surprise them. I invite him to tell the Committee anything that he knows about me. The honorable member is an arrant cur if he does not accept my challenge. He has made insinuations, and has sat down without saying really anything concerning me. I invite him to say anything he likes as to my career, and the sooner he says it the better. I extremely regret the incident, but I submit that I said nothing to warrant the honorable member&#39;s statements with regard to me, or that was in any sense impertinent. The Prime Minister has said all that any self-respecting Prime Minister could say with regard to the appointment of the Tariff Commission. If he is to be the mere puppet of honorable members in the Opposition corner, who &#34;have interrogated him from time to time like so many pedagogues, he will not be fit to lead the party that is behind him. Some honorable members have tried to extract pledges from the Prime Minister, and have stated that if he does not make the appointments to the Tariff Commission immediately, the Appropriation Bill will not be passed. If those are not threats, I do not know what threats are. Unless the right honorable gentleman resists such menaces, there is only one course open to him, and that is to leave office, and allow honorable members in the Opposition corner to govern the country. The whole trouble seems to have arisen in consequence of the dual leadership of the Opposition. One section of the alliance is all right. </para>

                            <para>- Everything has been satisfactorily settled as between the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition; but the trouble seems to have arisen from the fact that the honorable and learned member for Indi has been left out. It is unfortunate that there cannot be two leaders of the Opposition. The honorable and learned member for Indi would no doubt make an admirable leader. I submit, however, that he would have consulted his own dignity and the prestige of those honorable members who are associate with him, if he had refrained from re-opening a matter regarding which a definite arrangement had been arrived at between the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition, and from making demands, such as have not been preferred by the recognised leader on his side of the House. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to place on record my opinion, that the protectionists of Victoria are not fairly represented on the Government side of the Chamber. I have taken the trouble to ascertain how many of the Victorian representatives sitting behind the Government belong to the recognised Protectionist Association, and I find that there are only three, including the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, the honorable member for Laanecoorie, and another, whose name I forget for the moment. There are twelve representatives of Victoria upon that side of the Chamber who do not belong to the Protectionists&#39; Association, some of them being free-traders, and the rest what we call &#34;shandy-gaff&#34; protectionists. Of the representatives of </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Victoria on the Opposition side, six belong to the Protectionists&#39; Association-, and two are outside its ranks, one of them being a free-trader. I grant that a man may be a strong protectionist, and still not belong to the association, but the protectionists of Victoria &#39; certainly do not recognise the honorable and learned member for Ballarat as their leader. If they held a meeting in Melbourne, and the honorable and learned member appeared before them and claimed to be their leader, they would hurl him from the platform. The private life of the honorable and learned member is to be admired, and any man might be proud of his personal friendship, but I absolutely deny his claim to be the leader of the Protectionist Party. The real protectionist parliament of Victoria is the Trades Hall, and the real power of the protectionists is in the trade unions, the members of which disclaim the honorable and learned member as their leader. Cannot we point to the very large meeting that was held in the Town Hall the other night? </para>

I do not think the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> would wittingly make a mistake in regard to that matter, because it appertains to the politics which it advocates. At the same time, I am of opinion that there were more than 1,200 persons present at that meeting. I am equally sure that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was not- proud of his reception by the gathering in question. I maintain that the real protectionists in this House are to be found upon the Opposition benches. If a public meeting of protectionists were convened in Melbourne, we should soon ascertain who is the real leader of the protectionist party, and who constitute that party.&#39; I will guarantee that if a meeting be called at any large centre in Victoria, it will be found that this State is feeling the injury which is being done to her industries by the present Tariff. </para>

Why cannot amendments in the Tariff be submitted to this House next session, and fought out to a finish?

						<para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. I object to haying words put into my mouth which I did not utter. The allegation made by the honorable member for Parramatta that I threatened to deal it out to him is absolutely incorrect. I object to such statements being recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as emanating from me. The honorable member has said that when  I  asked why so much heat should be imported into the debate, the only interjection which he made was to the effect that there should be more light.  I  really &#39;believe that the honorable member interjects without being aware of the fact.</para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wentworth will never have such a career if he remains in Parliament all the days of his natural life. What does he know of my political career? He is merely a boy in the House - ra political neophyte. He should sit silent, or otherwise he may get the political punishment which ought to be administered to naughty boys. His manner is against him and I would strongly advise him to cultivate a little more geniality towards his fellow members. I am&#39; content to allow honorable members who occupy seats upon the cross benches to determine the nature of my remarks in regard to the honorable member for Parramatta. When he addresses the Chair I always give him respectful attention, and refrain from interjecting. I trust that he will act in a similar fashion, and thus allow honorable members an opportunity to state their views fully and in their own way. It is not creditable that we should constantly have &#34; scenes&#39;&#34; occurring in the House, when they could be easily avoided by honorable members bearing a little with each other. </para>

That is the kind of interjection which he is constantly making, and yet he declares that he never interjects. Is it to be supposed that honorable members can tolerate continual interjections of that nature? the CHAIRMAN.- I would point out that it is entirely out of order for any honorable member to interrupt the speaker, and I ask the honorable member for Parramatta to refrain from doing so. </para>

They appear to be annoyed because some honorable members of the Opposition have made the request in all sincerity that the Tariff Commission shall be appointed before we go into recess. Simply because the statement is made by honorable members of the Opposition that it is only fair that the Commission should be appointed before the Appropriation Bill is passed, the Prime Minister asserts that a threat is being made. </para>

I have attended this House when some of the supporters of the Government have been touring the country denouncing the Labour Party, arid stating that we believe that marriage is a luxury. As a matter of fact, I have proved that is the view held by some honorable members opposite, and by the organizers whom they employ to tour this State the honorable member for Robertson knows better than to come to my electorate and make such a statement regarding the Labour Party and its aims, as that which he made in the backblocks. These are the honorable members who, like the honorable member for Robertson, tour the country making misstatements about the Labour Party, while we are attending to the business of the country. </para>

We may now be told what is being done, as one of them has already said this evening, that they know everything,- whilst we know nothing! The Minister of Defence said that the honorable member for Echuca suggested the appointment of a Tariff Commission before the honorable and learned member for Indi submitted his proposal. </para>

                            <para>- The provision made for works in Victoria is not at all in proportion to the population of the State, but I shall deal with that matter when the second motion is before us. I agree with honorable members that before the Appropriation Bill is passed the Government should deal with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, appoint the Tariff Commission, and give the honorable and learned member for Ballarat an opportunity to submit&#39; his motion in regard to preferential trade, so that the people, as the result of the debate, may gain more information upon the subject than they have at present. No doubt the representatives of Western Australia are also anxious that the Transcontinental Railway Survey Bill should be dealt with this session, and I am confident that the honorable member for Cowper desires that the British New Guinea Bill should likewise be passed. I trust, therefore, that the Government will attend to these matters, and not abandon them all in their haste to get into recess. I do not make any threat as to what I am prepared to do, but it is only fair to the House and to the country that the session should not prove an absolutely fruitless one. If we have the responsible government of which the Prime Minister has spoken, why does he not see that the matters to which I have referred are dealt with before he asks us- to pass the Appropriation Bill. </para>

I hope that the Government will see that the matters to which I have referred are dealt with before Parliament is prorogued, so that the people will not be able to say that the session has been practically abortive, and that the request of the Opposition that the constitution of the Commission shall be known before we go into recess, will be complied with. </para>

We have been told by him also that a promise to appoint a Commission is very different from a promise to give the House an opportunity to discuss the question of preferential trade - that the one relates to a legislative and the other to an executive act. The man in the street, however, will scarcely recognise the difference. The Prime Minister states that in the one case he is justified in making a promise, and that in the other he is not. </para>

It seems to me that the honorable and learned member, having submitted the motion which caused ...... Prime Minister to promise the appointment of a Commission, is justified in seeking for an assurance from the right honorable gentleman that the appointment will be made before the Appropriation Bill is passed. As my tendency is to free-trade rather than to protection, I shall probably have less fault to find with the Commission than the protectionist members of the Committee will have. As the Prime Minister has so many things to do, I suggest that if we adjourned for a week, it would give him an opportunity to consider this matter. </para>

						<para>- I wish to say a word or two in acknowledgment of the kindly advice given to me tonight by the honorable member for Riverina. I am obliged to him for his lecture on consistency, for his precepts as to my future behaviour, and, above all, for his expressed intention to let me alone in the future. Particularly am I obliged to him for his lecturette on temper, remembering the dis- play of light and sweetness which we have had from him. I recognise always his profound intellectuality, and the high plane on which he dwells, and I shall do my best to pay heed to his advice. I am afraid, however, I shall be unable to follow it.</para>

						<para>- I wish to call attention to the fact that, although matters of great importance to protectionists have been discussed during this debate, only two of the protectionists who support the. Ministry are present, the honorable members for Moira and Echuca . The Prime Minister, not having made a satisfactory statement as to when he intends to fulfil the promise which he gave on the 25th October last, I appeal to the Minister of Trade and Customs. In my constituency there are men who are starving for want of work.</para>

                            <para>- Not only are iron foundries being closed down, but there is a cement factory in Geelong which has dismissed all its hands. I would point out also that fellmongeries which formerly employed over 800 men, now provide work for only eighty -five employes, and that several tanneries have been closed down. Thousands of men are walking about unable to find work, and at the point of starvation, and another month&#39;s delay is threatened. I wish the honorable members for Moira and Echuca to recognise their responsibility. They hold the key to the position, because either of them could decide the fate of the Government one way or the other. Every day&#39;s delay will cause more men to be thrown out of employment, and more factories to be closed down. I cannot stir the Minister of Trade and Customs ; but if ever there was a. time when the protectionist supporters of the Government should revolt, now is the occasion. The Prime Minister has stated that he will not promise to appoint the Tariff Commission before we go into recess; and his protectionist supporters should show their resentment of his absolute repudiation of the pledges which he has given here and elsewhere. I would appeal even to the right honorable member for Swan, who is now present, and ask- him whether he thinks that our factories should be left to their fate. The Government have promised that the Tariff <inline font-style="italic">Commission</inline> shall be instructed to present progress reports. As soon as such reports are brought up, Ministers will be compelled to take action. Then there will be an end to the fiscal truce; and an end to this &#34; Yes no &#34; Ministry. The life of the Ministry depends upon delay, and the more obstacles they can place in the way of the Commission, the better off they will be. It must be apparent to all honorable members that the Government are interested in delaying the appointment of the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I appeal to the Committee, not in my own interests, but in the interests of the public, to pass a Bill which deals with a number of public works, and provides for the expenditure of a number of sums of public money throughout the Commonwealth. I have had appeals made to me by the Labour bodies of Australia, who have pointed out the great distress which exists in various parts of Australia, and the importance they attach to having the works for which provision is made in the Bill, set going. The Senate has arranged to meet specially to-morrow, in the hope that it will be able to pass the measure. I do not make this appeal in order to prevent discussion, because the Appropriation Bill -will afford opportunities to honorable members to make any remarks they wish upon every possible subject of importance. It is desirable that the Bill shall be passed to-night, so that </para>

I have every respect for the feelings of honorable members, and a due regard for the request of the Prime Minister, but when the honorable and learned member for Corio accuses protectionists on this side of interfering with the workers of Australia, I ask how he can forget the attitude which he assumed when the Tariff was before this Parliament ?If there was one member of the party who created distrust in the protectionists in this Parliament it was the honorable and learned member. His votes are on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and were registered against the interests of the very industries to which he has referred to-night, and amongst others against the industries of Geelong. </para>

What was it that put the present Prime Minister in the position which he occupies to-night ? Was it not, in the first instance, the vote of the honorable and learned member for Corio, who displaced the only protectionist Government we have had in the Commonwealth Parliament? It does not lie in the mouth of the honorable and learned member to accuse me of inconsistency, or of going back upon protection. I am, to-night, sitting behind the leader of the protectionist cause in Australia, whilst the honorable and learned member is sitting behind a leader who dare not state to the electors what his fiscal faithis. </para>

The other- night the honorable member talked straight to the Prime Minister, and when that right honorable gentleman said he would be less than a man if he stood it, the honorable member got up next morning and apologized. </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable member for Dalley should not have challenged me on the labour question. I unsurprised at the affected indignation of the honorable member for Moira, who has tried to humiliate the honorable and learned&#34; member for Corio by questioning his consistency. If there is any fiscal consistency to be found in this Committee it is to be found in the little party sitting in the Opposition corner. No argument which the honorable member for Moira can use will justify the position which protectionists occupy on the other side. The idea of an honorable member of his calibre talking to those who understand something of political matters in this Commonwealth, and telling us what consistency means when we find protectionists sitting behind the man who has declared all his life that he does not believe in their policy, and is determined to uproot it. It is simply marvellous that we should see on that side any protectionists, except those who are opposed to the progressive party known as the Labour Party. The party I see on the opposite benches place conservatism before radicalism or democracy every time. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government have reconsidered the question of the manner of charging these works and buildings. When the Budget debate was initiated, I raised the question as to the wisdom of departing from what has hitherto been the practice, and charging the cost of these works and buildings on a population basis. Of course, I admitted then that if the transferred properties were paid for immediately, no injustice would be done to any of the States through the new procedure, but that if for some years we put up works and buildings, especially defence work&#39;s, in those States where no provision or little provision has been made in that regard, it meant that other States would for a considerable time to come have to bear a much larger proportion than they otherwise would, and larger than they should do. Leaving out of account the items for armament, totalling &#163;180,000, and taking into consideration only the &#163;300,000 odd, which are to go for works and buildings proper, including, of course, some works for defence purposes- </para>

The proportion paid by New South Wales on a population basis would be &#163;112,000, and the estimates of expenditure are &#163;102,000. But the position is more accentuated in the case of Victoria. Her share, on a population basis, is &#163;93,000, and the amount of money to be spent is &#163;51,000, showing a deficiency of about &#163;42,000. Western Australia, this year, will have spent &#163;71,000 odd, and will have to pay, on a population basis, &#163;18,000 odd. I have worked out these figures in accordance with the percentages of population shown in the Budget papers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. that is the position, roughly speaking. Of course I do not pretend to say what the legal position is. The Treasurer&#39;s interpretation of the constitutional aspect of the question may be correct. But I do say that in the absence of any provision for payment for transferred properties, the equities would have been preserved by continuing the old system; and, personally, I am strongly of opinion that it would be much better to continue that system, pending some decision in regard to payment for transferred properties. Of course it is quite possible that next year we may have a practical scheme in that direction. I do not hope, for my own part, that there will be any immediate outcome in regard to taking over the debts of the States, but I do hope for some practical method of payment for the transferred properties being arrived at. In the meantime, it seems to me that a grave injustice will be suffered by the citizens of some of the States by the continuation of this method. </para>

                    <para>- I referred to this matter during the Budget debate, and the Treasurer then stated that he had obtained an opinion from the Attorney-General, and also from the honorable and learned member for Corinella upon the subject. I think, whatever the legal position may be, that some new means of allocating these moneys ought to be found. It does not matter whether my own State is particularly concerned or not. This year, it appears that Victoria will be about &#163;50,000 to the bad, and Western Australia will practically have the whole of that amount spent within her territory. On a population basis, Victoria will pay about &#163;90,000, and have only about &#163;40,000 of it spent here, and I desire to enter my protest against this new plan which the Treasurer has adopted. I have no doubt that the Treasurer has obtained the best opinion available; but, nevertheless, I think that the matter should be reconsidered, with a view to an alteration of the method adopted, even if we have to go back to the method which has been in operation for the last three years. </para>

                    <para>- This is a most difficult question, as the late Treasurer knows. We all know that the present Treasurer gives an immense amount of attention to these subjects, and the present method was adopted in consequence of its being found that the previous system worked out inequitably. If however, the new system works inequitably, we shall have to arrive at some other method. This was the best way we could arrive at, after giving the subject the best consideration. It will be admitted that the question is a most troublesome one. </para>

If the Minister will take the trouble to inspect that building, he will admit that it is in a disgraceful condition. If does not provide sufficient accommodation for the present number of officers. I need scarcely remind honorable members that the question of the employment of day labour in carrying out public works has been referred to many times in this House. When I was in office I stated that it was my intention, wherever possible, to employ day labour upon those works, and that where is was not possible the contract system would be adopted. But I would point out that the works which are carried out by the Commonwealth are few in comparison with those which are carried out by the States. In New South Wales, fortunately, no trouble has been experienced in this connexion, because wherever it was possible to perform work by day labour, that class of labour has been employed. The same remark is applicable to South Australia. A great deal has been said against the employment of day labour, but I claim that under proper supervision that system is cheaper than is the contract system. </para>

                    <para>- In regard to the point raised by the leader of the Opposition, I should like it to be understood that the representatives of Victoria do not waive any legal or constitutional rights which may be involved. My own opinion is that defence works may properly be regarded as new works, and should, therefore, be federalized. But public works which might be considered of a developmental character - post-offices, for example - should, I think, be regarded as continuing expenditure, and accordingly be debited to the States. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not waive any legal or constitutional rights in connexion with this matter, nor do I think that the House could in any way prejudice those rights. If any rights exist, they are preserved. by the Constitution, and may be enforced hereafter by proceedings in the High Court. </para>

					<para>- Since the establishment of the Federation, a great deal of trouble has been experienced in effecting improvements and repairs to transferred buildings, which some of the States Governments contend partially belong to them. In this connexion, I may instance the Sydney Customs House. Just prior to the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the New South Wales Government added one or two storeys to that building ; but did not complete its interior. Later on, I induced this House to vote &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 to finish that work. Thereupon, the Premier of New South Wales objected to that money being expended, and maintained that a portion of the building still&#39; belonged to the State. The result is that the building is in a disgraceful and deplorable state at the present time. If I had had my way in the matter. I should have tested the position before the High Court long ere this. A similar dispute exists in regard to buildings in Bendigo and Perth. I should like think it will be found to the interests of the Commonwealth to continue &#39;the system. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta will recollect that in the New South Wales Parliament I attacked him for employing day labour in connexion with a telephone tunnel. As a result of that attack a Committee was appointed to investigate the matter, and if honorable members will take the trouble to read the report of that body, and the evidence taken before it, they will see that under proper supervision the day labour system is cheaper than is the contract system by 25 per cent. In spite of the outcry a gainst it - an outcry which comes mainly from the contractors - there are certain works which should be carried out by day labour in preference to the contract system. I trust that we shall not revert to the old system under which contractors are able to make such large sums of money. The profits secured by them are due, not to the fact that the contracts accepted by the Government are too high, but to alterations and additions ordered by the architects, which enable them to make heavy claims for extras, representing the difference between the value of the work done by their employes, and the total sum paid by the taxpayer. I refer to this matter, because I have heard and read of many statements in opposition to the day-labour system, and I have also heard the statement that it is gradually being dropped in New South Wales. </para>

I believe . that the work in question was commenced whilst the honorable member for Parramatta was Postmaster-General in the State Government, and that he instituted the day-labour system. Recently certain changes were made, and a proposal was put forward, that the system of employing day labour in carrying out these improvements should be discontinued, and that the work should be handed over to contractors. The late -Minister of Home Affairs vetoed that proposal, and determined that the day labour system should be continued. </para>

I refrained from making a speech on the subject, because I anticipated a sympathetic reply from the Minister. I thought that as the practice had become so common in many of the States, and had proved so successful, he would be in full sympathy with the suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not make any promise in regard to the future policy of the Department until I have had an opportunity to make that investigation which any Minister ought to make before arriving at a decision in regard to such a matter. As the honorable member for Hume has said, by far the larger ; proportion of the works that are under the control of the Department of Home Affairs are carried out bv States Departments. The Department itself has neither the officers nor the plant to carry out these works. </para>

                <para class="block">Whilst I am perfectly ready, to do anything that is in the best interests of the workers, it is expected, of course, that I shall see that the tax-payers of the community are protected, and that undue expenditure is not incurred in carrying out Commonwealth undertakings. Consistent with that view of my position, the day-labour system shall have my full support wherever it can be shown that it is cheaper than the contract system. I am not in any way antagonistic to day-labour in itself, but must judge bv results; I merely say that, as Minister, I must not commit myself to any promise until I have had an opportunity to see the result of the working of both systems. That is the position. Honorable members can, at all times&#39;, know what is being done in connexion with the different public works of the Commonwealth. I hope that should I be called upon at any time to do so, I shall be able to show good reasons for. any practice that is adopted by the Department in relation to a particular work. The honorable member for Hume has referred to the condition of the Customs House in Sydney, and I may say that on taking office, I found that the facts were as he has stated. I at once: entered into negotiations through the Prime Minister,, with the Premier of New South Wales to have that unsatisfactory position at least remedied to some extent. As the result of these negotiations, the Premier of New South Wales has agreed to allow that portion of the building occupied by the Commonwealth to be repaired and altered, and provision is made on the Estimates to enable the work to be carried out. Consequently, the cause of complaint in regard to that portion of the building to which the honorable member has referred will be removed. Negotiations have also been entered upon, and I hope they will be brought to a conclusion at the Premiers&#39; Conference, if not before, for the settlement of the question of the ownership of the building. My action&#39; has, so far, been successful, and I trust that it will be more successful in. the, future in securing a settlement. </para>

                    <para>- I should like some information in regard to the proposal to grant ^1,000 for the construction of a new post and telegraph office at Canowindra. This post-office is .situated on the line, which divides the division which I represent from the Macquarie division, and, so that honorable members may understand the position of affairs, I may mention that at Canowindra there is a township built on private property, and what is known as the Government township, where a fine site was set apart on the laying out of the town for a &#39; post-office, and where there is also a public school and a police station. The original post-office, however, was a rented building in the private town. A controversy ensued between the townspeople as to where the new post-office should be placed, and I understand that the State Postmaster-General, just prior to Federa-tion, promised that no action would be taken without consulting those residing in the private township. </para>
