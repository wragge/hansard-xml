The magistrate before whom the case was tried is reported to have stated that he did not know whether or not there  was a Married Women&#39;s Property Act in Victoria, and, therefore, he discharged the prisoner.  i  wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he will give his attention to this matter, with a view to making arrangements to have all our States Acts&#39; sent to the leading law libraries in Great Britain and Ireland - just half-a-dozen or so - and suggesting to the Home authorities that a short noncontentious Bill should be passed through the Imperial&#39; Parliament to enable the Courts in Great Britain to take judicial notice of our legislation. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID.</inline>- I think that the honorable and learned member has directed attention to a matter of great importance, and the suggestion he has made is one that deserves very prompt consideration. It does seem anomalous that the laws passed under the Crown in different parts of the Empire  should stand in Great Britain only upon the same footing as foreign laws. I think that that is a state of affairs which should be remedied without delay, and that it would be of great convenience in the administration of justice throughout the Empire if that were done. Of course, the remedy can be applied as my honorable and learned friend has suggested, only by an Act of the Imperial Parliament, and I shall take the matter into very special consideration. </para>

It must be admitted that the regular weekly service supplied by the mail companies has, in a very large measure, helped to. build up this national industry. </para>

A few days ago I received a telegram from : Normanton, informing me that the members of the local rifle club had been refused railway passes to enable them to travel to Croydon to compete with the rifle club at that town. I saw Captain Collins on the subject, without effect, and then interviewed the Minister, from whom I learned that there is a regulation now in force which prohibits the granting of passes for distances over fifty miles. This regulation has been framed practically in the interests of one section of the community only. </para>

It has been framed either in the interests of one section only, or its framing is due to gross ignorance of the circumstances of rifle clubs in distant parts of Queensland. I am inclined to take the latter view, because I have been informed that the Minister is going into the matter at a later date, and will have a map pre-  pared showing the situation of the various clubs. Most of the clubs in Northern Queensland are more than fifty miles apart. Their members are required to go to enormous expense in perfecting themselves in the art of rifle shooting, and are then practically debarred by this stupid regulation from taking part in inter-club competitions. I do not know whether this Government or the previous Government are responsible for the regulation of which I complain, though I admit that it is necessary to have regulations preventing rifle clubs from travelling all over Australia at the expense of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- A rifle club in a place like Normanton is, by this regulation, practically cut off from all other clubs. Going south, the nearest club is 220 miles away. To the east, the nearest club is at Croydon, or at. Golden Gate, places three or four miles distant from each other, and eighty or ninety miles away from Normanton, while Thursday Island to the north is 300 miles away, and Cloncurry, to the south, is between zoo and 300 miles away. If restrictions of this kind are placed on the members of rifle clubs in outlandish places, they will refuse to be hampered by them, and will disband. Most of the members of these clubs are expert bushmen, who could find their way from one end of Australia to  another, and exist for weeks on a few pounds of rations. Without wishing to disparage the dwellers in our towns, I say that such men, as members of a defence force, are worth half-a-dozen townsmen. Honorable members must recollect that even when railway passes are granted, the members of clubs who travel away from home to engage in rifle matches are put to considerable expense. When the members of the Normanton club visit Croydon, for example, it costs them from&#163;1 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3,</inline> according to the length of time they stay there. Seeing that they are ready to spend their own money in perfecting themselves in rifle shooting, we should do something to assist them. The regulation of which I complain is a hardship to a number of other clubs as well. The Ravenswood club, for instance, is practically isolated from all other clubs, that township being sixty-four miles from Char ters Towers, while the nearest place at which there is a rifle club is Sellheim, fiftysix or fifty-seven miles away. Going towards the coast, Townsville is sixty or seventy miles away. Hughenden is similarly cut off from other big centres. I believe that they are establishing&#34; a rifle club at Richmond, about eighty miles away, while at Winton, 144 miles to the south-west, there is already a rifle club, and another at Torrens Creek, fifty-six miles away. The clubs in more settled districts are not affected by the regulation, and, therefore, do not feel the pinch ; but a great many clubs in Northern Queensland feel it. The club at Charters Towers, where there is a population of 26,000 people, is almost in the same position as the others to which I have referred, though it&#39; is able to compete with the club at Sellheim. Townsville, however, eighty-two miles away, has a population of 12,000 or 15,000 and the clubs of the two places should be allowed to compete with each other. The action of the Department in preparing a map at this stage, to show the situation of the various clubs, is evidence of want of knowledge on the part of the officials who are responsible for this regulation, or of carelessness which&#39; should be severely censured. They must have compiled this regulation without taking the trouble to obtain a map to ascertain where the different clubs are situated. </para>

          <para class="block">It appears to me that we do not heed to be reminded by any officer of the Defence Department of the amount which has been voted by this House for the purpose. We voted what we deemed to be sufficient at the time.

          <para class="block">Permanent Forces than they have for the members of our rifle clubs. I differ from them, and personally I shall always resent any reminder on the part of paid officials of the service as to what this House may have done. They have no right to act in that way, and it is just about time that we resented it. It is true that we voted a certain sum of money to cover the travelling expenses of members of rifle clubs. Probably we should have voted more had it been shown that the amount in question was not sufficient. Nevertheless, we do not need to be reminded of what we have done by any officer in the service. If any person is entitled to give us such a reminder it is the Minister himself, and not one of his subordinates. In submitting this motion, I have no desire to delay the business of the House. I contend, however, that the matter to which I have directed attention is a most important one, and that the strict enforcement of the regulation relating to railway passes would practically debar the whole of the rifle clubs in the northern portion of Queensland from taking part <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> inter-club competitions. </para>

            <para>- I think perhaps that it may curtail debate if I at once explain the position in which this matter stands, and the action which I am taking in connexion with it. As he has stated, the honorable member approached me in reference to the particular match to which he has referred, as did also the honorable member for Maranoa and the honorable member for Capricornia, in reference to another match, which is to be held at a. place called Emerald, in Central Queensland. I must confess that though I am not as familiar with the geography of the northern State as I  was when&#39; I was younger, I fully recognise that under present circumstances, or under the circumstances which are likely to obtain for some time to come, the strict enforcement of the regulation in regard to the fifty miles limit would have the effect of debarring the greater number of the Queensland rifle clubs from engaging in competitions. The regulation declares that the members of these organizations may, twice a year, travel free over the railways to engage in competitions within a radius of fifty miles and the District Commandants may grant them special permission to travel free over distances in excess of that limit. When this matter was first brought under my notice by the honorable member for Mara- noa, I promised privately that I would obtain a map of Queensland, showing the exact situation of the rifle clubs there, and the distances between the bulk of them, in order that I might reconsider the regulation with a view to insuring them a proper chance of effective competition. That seems to me to be the right course to adopt. As regards the two particular matches which were brought under my notice, the facts are these : A certain sum of money has been voted upon the Estimates to cover the travelling expenses of members of rifle clubs. In passing, I may say that I do not think it was ever intended that the official communication to which the honorable member for Kennedy has referred, should convey the impression which he seems to have derived from it. </para>

The position is that, in consequence of certain minutes made by the honorable and learned member for Balaclava, when acting as Treasurer in the Deakin Administration, and by the honorable member for Bland when filling the same office in the late Administration, my attention was particularly directed to the fact that State Commandants were exceeding their votes, and that - to use the words of the leader of the Opposition - the Treasurer was being forced, so to speak, at the point of the bayonet, to meet the expenditure actually incurred. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Shortly after I came into office these minutes came under my observation. Thereupon I issued a circular minute informing all District Commandants that they would be advised of the amounts voted upon the Estimates for the various services over which they had control, and that, if those amounts were exceeded, they might expect to be held personally responsible in cases where it was clear that they could have avoided the excess. That being so, it was obviously quite impossible for me to turn round -and inform them that they must spend a portion of their votes in certain directions, when they declared that their votes would not permit of it. Honorable members must re cognise that the moment the Minister did that, he would be quite unable to say to any Commandant, &#34;You have exceeded your vote,&#34; because the latter would be in a position to reply, &#34; But you told me to do so.&#34; And consequently I have refused to interfere with the final decision of the matter by the Commandant. In both the cases which were brought under my notice, I asked the Commandant whether in the special circumstances he could within the limit of his vote grant the passes. In each case, especially in the second, he said emphatically that his vote would not stand the charge. That does not mean that all the money has been spent, but that he has to recognise that there will be certain claims coming in during the remainder of the current year. Knowing the run of the matches for the year he has felt himself bound to say that the grant of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500</inline> will not permit of all these passes being issued, and I do not think I am justified in overriding the exercise of his discretion, as he is on the spot, and knows the circumstances better than I do, and especially as he has been notified that he will be responsible for unauthorized expenditure. </para>

              <para>- The Emerald match will cost ^50. There is an annual meeting of the Central Association, and I suggested either that the match might be held on that occasion or that it might be fired on their own ground under conditions which are arranged for in the regulations. There are two or three ways of meeting the difficulty. Either I had to exercise what I think is an unwise Ministerial interference with the Commandant&#39;s discretion - either I had to practically abandon the efficacy of the rule I had laid down, or I had to allow the Commandant to act. But I have promised the honorable member for Kennedy privately, as I do publicly, that where clubs are situated at a distance of sixty or seventy or eighty miles from each other, and there is not the requisite number of clubs within a radius of fifty miles, some arrangement shall be made to enable the matches to be carried out. </para>

              <para>- But they are not close at hand, for in this case the nearest club is eighty or ninety miles away. It is only when clubs are not within the prescribed distance of each other that this difficulty arises. I shall endeavour to so alter the regulations as to arrange for the special circumstances of Queensland or any other State which is in a similar condition. It is one thing to alter the general rule and another thing to interfere with the Commandant&#39;s discretion. I shall not take action until I have the necessary data. I have sent to Queensland for a map, showing the exact position of the rifle clubs. I am having notice taken of the towns at which it is likely that rifle clubs may be established at an early date. I promise the House that, so far as means permit, I shall make such alterations in the regulations as will enable the clubs to have reasonable facilities for competition with each other. </para>

              <para>- The point is whether I am to override the decision of the Commandant. The honorable member for Kennedy drew attention to the considerable increase in the Queensland vote. I admit at once that the increase, to a large extent, is in other branches than rifle clubs, but there is also a considerable amount of increase in that direction. I have the fullest desire to afford every facility to rifle clubs, and I am doing everything which can be reasonably asked of me. I am taking immediate steps to do away with the existing difficulties. I trust that the House will accept this assurance, and that it will not be necessary to debate this question at great length. I quite appreciate the anxiety of honorable members that rifle clubs&#39; matches and the clubs themselves should be encouraged. With that desire I fully sympathize. I think honorable members will admit that long before I became Minister I showed my earnestness in that direction by the way in which I spoke and voted, and .  I can assure them that that anxiety has not been in any way diminished by the fact that I am now charged with greater responsibility. I do not complain of the honorable member for bringing thismatter before the House, because it is well that the public should know . that these difficulties arise, but I trust that the House will rest satisfied with my assurance that, as soon as the full particulars come under my notice, I shall act as any other Minister would act in similar circumstances. </para>

              <para>- I think it is very hard that the Ministerwill not grant this concession. In Queensland we can-  not have rifle clubs within a few miles of one another as they can do in the metropolitan district of Victoria. The men who take part in the rifle&#34; club matches in Queensland are not like the &#34;  swaddies  &#34; to be found in the metropolitan district of this State. The men who belong to the metropolitan clubs are not as capable of enduring fatigue or as good riflemen as the others. It is very hard that the men in the outlying districts are not granted the same privileges as the men in the populous districts. In many parts of Victoria there are rifle clubs within ten or fifteen miles of each other. Perhaps that is so- in New South Wales, or in and around Brisbane, but in the district which I represent men have to travel 60, 70, or 100 miles from their townships to take part in these competitions. They have no opportunity on ordinary occasions to shoot at- other ranges than their own. &#39;It is impossible to train good riflemen if they shoot invariably  at one range. I have done a good deal of rifle shooting myself, and I know the value of shooting at strange ranges. There are but five men who are asking for railway passes. </para>

              <para>- It is the only one with which I am concerned. Let other honorable members speak for their own clubs. These five men have sent an application to the Department, and the Minister throws the onus of the refusal on the Commandant. I do not think that is right. It has to be remembered that when these riflemen go from Clermont to Emerald to take part in rifle shooting, they will have to pay their own living expenses for three or four days. The Department is only asked to pay their railway fares. They give their time, and pay their own out-of-pocket expenses. It is certain that the members of the rifle clubs are the best shots in Australia, and they should be encouraged in every way. If their services should ever be required, I have no doubt, whatever that, except in relation to drill, they would be even more valuable than the ordinary volunteers. Then, again, it has to be remembered that there is no burden placed upon the taxpayer by granting this concession. </para>

            <para>- The Minister was right in thinking that the honorable member for Kennedy acted properly in moving the adjournment of the House in order to call attention to the matter under discussion. The amount of money placed upon the Estimates for rifle club purposes has not been earmarked. The tendency in Australia, both under the Commonwealth and under State Government, has been to &#34;grease the fat pig.&#34; Those riflemen who live in places situated near to centres of population have obtained every privilege, and no adequate provision has been made for those who happen to live at distances from the centre. I regret that even the Minister of Defence appears to have no idea of the enormous distances which men have to travel in some of the States. Queensland is in a very peculiar position. Every part of the Stale is settled to some extent, and there are large centres of population at very great distances from other centres. The members of the rifle clubs go to great trouble to equip themselves and make themselves efficient for the defence of the country in time of need and are deserving of every consideration If this <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500</inline> is voted to encourage rifle shooting, and to assist those who are least able to assist themselves, I suggest that the Minister must go further than his proposal to alter the regulation. He should share the money amongst the different rifle clubs, and those in the more distant parts of the State should receive the largest share. If the bulk of the vote is to be absorbed by the members of rifle clubs in the cities and towns the interests of rifle clubs in the country will not be sufficiently considered. </para>

              <para>- That is because of the larger area, and the more scattered nature of the population of the State. Queensland is, I think, the only big State which is settled in every part. Undoubtedly persons who travel 100 miles or more and by coach in many instances to attend a rifle meeting, are entitled to more consideration than are those who can attend such meetings by riding a few miles on a bicycle. </para>

          <para>Mr.FISHER. - I am glad that the matter has been referred to, because the tendency of all Governments is to give assistance to those who are best able to help themselves, who are conveniently situated, and can personally appeal to the Commandant and to the Minister. The Commandant, in framing these Estimates, has excluded far-distant places from consideration. The development of rifle shooting and the encouragement of rifle clubs have increased the numbers of those who desire to take part in these rifle matches, and this has not been provided for in the Estimates submitted by the Government. If there is to be any concession given at all, it should be to those people who have few opportunities to amuse themselves, or to take part in any movement which will be of advantage to the Commonwealth. Instead of the bulk of this vote being expended in the large centres of population, it should be expended in the smaller centres. The Minister said  that he is prepared to alter the regulation, but, in my opinion, the alteration of the regulation will not remedy what is complained of. </para>

              <para>- Yes, that is the crux of the whole matter. A discussion of this kind brings before the House some idea of the distances to be covered in some of the States, and the pleasing fact that people living in very remote places are anxious to take their part in fitting themselves to efficiently defend their country in time of need. </para>

            <para>. - I should like to say that I do not at all complain of the action of the honorable member for Kennedy in moving the adjournment, in order to discuss this matter. We are always in danger of forgetting the special circumstances of the men who are scattered over the interior districts of Australia, as are many of the riflemen of Queensland. I can quite see that a mere alteration of the regulation might not achieve all that is necessary, but my honorable and learned colleague can be trusted to take the necessary action now that the matter has been brought pointedly under his notice by the honorable members for Kennedy and Capricornia. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable gentleman knows as well as does any member of the House that Western Australia and Queensland are countries of distances. In those States we have not rifle clubs in our back yards, as they have in Victoria. There are no two clubs in my electorate whose head-quarters are within sixty miles of each other. The members of these clubs are engaged in the primary industries of the State, and they give up their leisure time in order to become expert rifle shots. The honorable member for Capricornia referred to five members of a rifle club at Clermont, but there are members of rifle clubs in. other parts of Central Queensland who desire to go to the meeting held at Emerald in order to compete for the Foy cup. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foy</inline> of Sydney, when in Queensland taking up country, gave a silver cup to be competed for by the rifle clubs of Central Queensland, and it was decided that it should be competed for at Emerald, which is about half way between. Rockhampton and Longreach, and about 200 miles from each of those places. </para>

              <para>- I thank the honorable and  learned . gentleman. I should like to say that somewhat similar circumstances arose  two years ago, when the whole of the Central Queensland clubs competed at Emerald in the same way. On that occasion, the application for passes met with the same answer, that there was no money available, that the competitors had to travel further than the stipulated distance of fifty miles, and that the Defence authorities would have nothing to do with the meeting. The secretary of the Longreach Rifle Club wired to me at Charleville that they could not obtain the passes, and that the meeting, which was to be held purely for the love of the sport, would consequently fall through.I travelled from Charleville to Brisbane, a distance of 400 or 500 miles, in order to interview  Colonel Price,  who was then District Commandant, and as soon as I explained to him what the clubs desired, he said that in the circumstances he could stretch a point and give them the necessary passes. The whole matter was settled in a moment by the action of the District Commandant. I believe in the rifle club movement, bu t the staff, in Brisbane more particularly, are opposed to it, and do all they can to discourage these clubs. </para>

              <para>- I have already explained that Queensland is a State of magnificent distances., . Its population is less than that of Melbourne, but surely the population of Queensland, simply because it is a scattered one, is not going to be denied the privileges given to the people of other States. I was under the impression that with the establishment of Federation there would be an end to provincialism, but the right honorable member for Swan is always bringing it to the front. He should be the last to do anything of the kind. I can understand, of course, that he does not relish this criticism, as his administration has been called in question. </para>

              <para>- I have known from the first that we have the sympathy of the Minister in regard to this matter; but on interviewing him privately I found that our request could not be complied with unless he overrode the decision of the District Commandant. I do not desire any Minister to do that - I would not be a party to such a proceeding. If the District Com mandant . cannot see his way clear to grant our request there must be an end to the matter. I am pleased with the remarks that have been made by the Prime Minister, as well as by the Minister of Defence, and I shall telegraph to those interested, requesting them to defer their meeting to a future date, in the hope that the regulation governing this question may be so amended as to allow of their being treated more favorably. </para>

            <para>- I sympathize with the Minister in the difficult position in which he finds himself, seeing that in some parts of the Commonwealth he has to deal with a congested population, and in others with a scattered community, and I would suggest to him that something might be done to improve the present state of affairs by adopting the zone system. In the metropolitan districts there is a large number of , clubs which are able to interchange meetings, and to shoot on different ranges under differing conditions; but in scattered communities there are not the same opportunities for making these interchanges. Ihave notworked out the matter, but I think that the Minister would do well to adopt something in the nature of the zone system, whereby a certain number of clubs might be allowed to interchange visits regardless of the distance separating them. In centres around Melbourne we have forty or fifty clubs within the fifty-mile radius, and they should be allowed to interchange visits as before. In sparsely populated districts there may be a distance of 100 miles separating different clubs, but a regulation could be so framed as to admit of an interchange of visits between them, notwithstanding the distance, without unduly increasing the expenditure on rifle clubs. I find no fault with the increased vote provided in the Estimates for the encouragement of rifle shooting. I think that the increase has been fully justified by the Minister of Defence, who explained that it was due to the necessity to largely renew the stock of ammunition. It has been a stand- . ing grievance in Queensland, and, I dare say, in other States where small centres of population are a great distance apart, that the facilities which clubs enjoyed prior to Federation are not now forthcoming. We all know that some rifle clubs, while able to put up good scores on their own ranges, find that they cannot do any good shooting when they visit a range with which they are unfamiliar, and where the weather conditions are different. </para>

              <para>- The conditions in Victoria are dissimilar from those in (he western district of Queensland, of which the honorable member for Capricornia has spoken ; but, with all due deference tohis representations, I do not think that there is very much in his contention. No one will accuse me of want of sympathy with the rifle club movement; but I would point out that the Clermont Rifle Club is sixty miles from Emerald, and that all that is required is to pay the return fare of five men over a distance of ten miles. Under the regulations they can travel free by rail to within fifty miles of Emerald, and all that needs to be done is to provide for their return fare over the remaining ten miles. I do not think there is much hardship involved in that as compared with the position of clubs in townships which are more widely separated. I might refer to cases which have occurred in my own electorate, but I recognise that this is a matter of general application, and can be dealt with in only a general way. From what I know of the Minister of Defence, I am sure that he is in sympathy with the rifle club movement ; but I have to indorse the statement made by the honorable member for Maranoa, that those at the head of the Defence Department in Queensland are not so much in sympathy with it as is the Minister. </para>

              <para>- The reason for that may be differently interpreted by different men. I would remind the House, however, that some little time ago the retiring General Officer Commanding endeavoured to introduce a regulation providing that every holder of a Government arm should salute any officer whom he met. Riflemen will not submit to anything of the kind. Many of them will not even wear a uniform until the time of Australia&#39;s need arises ; and perhaps one reason why some of the commissioned officers are opposed to rifle clubs is that they have not the control over them which they exercise over the regular forces. Some one has taken credit for having, during his term of office, placed a minute on the records of the Department to the effect that any officer who exceeded a vote passed by the Parliament should be held accountable forthe excess expenditure. I should like credit to be given to the man who is really responsible for that minute. </para>

            <para>- I think that a larger question has been raised than the effect of the regulation upon the one or two clubs to which reference has been made. I do not desire to speak on behalf of any particular club, but to say one or two words on the matter of general policy. I am satisfied - that both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence are sincere in the wish to advance the interests of rifle clubs, but I think it is proper, at- this moment, when we are discussing a future regulation, to consider the general principle involved. </para>

              <para>- I must take leave to differ from the right honorable member on that point. It is a mistake to regard the amount spent in this manner as absolute expense. It is not like money spent for uniforms, if that were a Commonwealth expense, or for ammunition even, because there is really no expense to the people. Therefore, I do not think that we should be sparing in the amount that is debited for this service. It is only a book-keeping entry, after all. </para>

              <para>- I think that the Minister has sufficient courage to meet that objection with a proper answer. When we recollect what the members of these rifle clubs do, that they are engaged in a great public work, that they are men who would not be ready to travel from home without sufficient reason, because of the loss entailed in leaving their avocations, that they spend money in purchasing their uniforms, and to a large extent upon their ammunition also, in the desire to perfect themselves in shooting, which is a more difficult accomplishment than the acquirement of the evolutions of drill, we must admit that there is reason for encouraging them ; and I ask the Minister, in reframing the regulation, not to retain the limitation of fifty miles. I have been informed by men who took part in the recent contests at Williamstown, that the conditions in the country are so different from the conditions they met with here that they were at a great disadvantage. </para>

              <para>- I think that if greater opportunities were given to the members of the country clubs to come to Melbourne, the disadvantage would be largely removed. The men who practice at these targets daily are more familiar with them, and are therefore in a better position than men who come from the country. We can rely upon the members of country rifle clubs not abusing the privilege of free passes. It would not pay them to do so, even if they had the wish. I think, therefore, that passes should be granted for longer distances than fifty miles. The expenditure is merely nominal, and when that is taken into consideration, together with the benefit which the country obtains in affording the members of rifle clubs larger opportunities for practice, the Minister may well see his way to increase their facilities for travelling. </para>

            <para>- I am pleased that the Minister has told the House that he will do what he can to remove the difficulty which has been complained of, but he added that in altering the regulation, he will be compelled to have regard to tEe financial position, and may not be able to do much. There is a great difference between the position of members of country rifle clubs and that of rifle clubs in populous centres, inasmuch as the latter can travel free every we&#39;ek to take part in matches. At least that is what we were able to do in South Australia. </para>

I agree with the honorable and learned member for Indi that it does not matter to the people of the Commonwealth whether the members of the rifle clubs travel twice a week or twice a year, or two miles, or 102 miles, to take part in matches, because the travelling, costs the community nothing. It is a mere bookkeeping charge. The rifle clubs are the cheapest arm of the service, and should be encouraged, though at pre sent they get no encouragement. The club to which I belonged had to find not only their uniforms, but their range, and to erect their targets, and pay for their up-keep. Yet, under the regulation of the Department, no rifle club can obtain passesto permit its members to travel over fifty miles to fire a match with another club. The longer the distances which clubs have to travel to meet each other in competition, the fewer will be the matches, so that the pass system is not likely to be abused, and the least the Minister can do is to place the members of all clubs on the same footing. I think that it is a fair thing to fix a maximum number of passes, but whatever is done should apply to the members of all the clubs in the Commonwealth. If the Minister re-reads the regulation, I think he will find that, although State Commandants are allowed to sanction the issue of railway passes for distances exceeding fifty miles, the Minister&#39;s approval must be obtained. </para>

              <para>- I accept the honorable and learned gentleman&#39;s statement, though that was my impression. State Commandants have not been willing to give this concession ; I have never known it to be given. I admit that it is only proper that the amounts set down on the Estimates should not be exceeded. I know that the Minister is willing to assist the members of rifle clubs in every reasonable way, and I hope that he will put every club on the same footing. The travelling of members of clubs does not cost the people of the Commonwealth one penny. </para>

              <para>- I have a distinct recollection of what took place. When the subdivision relating to the GovernorGeneral&#39;s establishment was under consideration it was agreed that that and another subdivison, which was germane to it, should be taken together, and I continued to submit the&#39; votes in divisions until some discussion arose with regard to the method that was being followed. Then I pointed out that the practice had been to submit the votes in divisions, and that I was the first  Chairman  to adopt a different course. I made the change, not at the desire of any honorable member, but because I thought that it would serve the convenience of the Committee. When we came to the Department now under consideration, it was decided with the consent of the members of the </para>

I pointed out the great length of some of the divisions, and it was then agreed that the votes should be submitted in divisions, except where any honorable member desired any subdivision to be taken separately. I am quite prepared to ado pt any course that will serve the convenienceof the Committee.

Indeed, I have permitted a very full debate of details which are not usually touched upon in the general discussion.

              <para>- I will give the honorable member a case in point. Some time ago a request was made that a certain portion of Broken Hill, which was within the bounds of the municipality, should be granted a letter delivery. Honorable members will understand that years ago, when the township was first established, an area was mapped out within which letters were delivered. A certain portion of the township was excluded from that area, because it contained no residents. In the course of time, however, some hundreds of persons settled there, but although they were within a mile and a half of the postoffice, they were compelled to visit the central office in order to obtain their letters. After the lapse of some years they complained of this treatment. I then made representations upon the subject to the postal authorities, and in reply received- a communication, stating that it would be necessary for an inspector to travel from Sydney to Broken Hill to inquire into the matter. </para>

              <para>- I admit that ultimately the evil was remedied without any inspector being required to visit Broken Hill. Nevertheless, I contend that such a simple matter should have been settled without any delay whatever. I have in my possession a communication from certain residents at White Cliffs in regard to a similar matter. That town possesses a population of 2,000, and yet for years it has been denied a postal delivery. When I asked, in December last that the residents should have the advantage of a letter delivery, I was informed that the request would be acceded to. Six months after I received a letter from the local Progress Committee, informing me that no letter-carrier had been appointed. In reply to an inquiry, I was informed by the Department that they could not adopt this plan because it was necessary to have a bicycle. The Department had no bicycle which could be sent to White Cliffs for the use of the letter-carrier, and there was no money available for the purchase of a ma:bine. Consequently -the townspeople had to wait for six months for a letter delivery, simply because the Department could not provide a bicycle.. It was explained that as soon as there was a bicycle available elsewhere, it would be sent to the town. When a letter-carrier died elsewhere in New South Wales, his bicycle was sent <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Sydney to White Cliffs. If an inspector were located in the western district, such matters could be brought before him &#39; directly, and unnecessary delays would not occur. I have been informed by an officer in the Department that it is not its business to discover conveniences and facilities required by the public. If the public do not ask for such things, it is taken for granted by the Department that they are not wanted. My idea is that the Department should always be on the lookout to give reasonable facilities to the public. If the inspectors were located in their respective districts, the .people would be able to submit their complaints directly to them. It would also be the means of enabling telegraphists and others who now have to live in the back-blocks year in and year out to get a transfer to Sydney and other places. I can quite understand that an officer located in Sydney is not desirous of going to the back-blocks ; but I contend that a scheme should be evolved by the Department whereby men, after&#34; having served in the back-blocks for so many years, should have a definite opportunity of going to Sydney or elsewhere. The Department experiences much difficulty in getting men living in a nice climate to go to the western districts. When the honorable member for Parramatta was PostmasterGeneral for New South Wales he told me that the postmastership of Broken Hill had been offered to thirty-five officers, and refused by them, and that at last the Department had to put down its foot and tell an officer that he must go. I believe that if the inspectors were located in their respective districts a scheme would soon be evolved for the relief of officers in the interior. When some officials go to the back-blocks they receive an extra allowance, and when they ask for a transfer to Sydney or elsewhere they wish to be paid on the same basis. Naturally a man who has been paid a certain sum does not like to receive a lesser sum. I know that positions in Sydney andi Bathurst have been offered to western officers, but they wished to be transferred at the same salary, and to enjoy the same status. A great deal more ought to be done to provide telephonic com- munication.  I was very glad to hear the Minister say that he is prepared to use the telegraph wires. If the inspectors were located in their districts the people would be provided with a better system of telephonic communication. If a telephone were attached to every public-house near a telegraph line it would be a great convenience to the travelling public. It would be better for the Department as well as for the public to have in each district an inspector. I am quite prepared to accept the assurance of the Minister and to withdraw the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I am satisfied with the promise of the Minister to look into this matter. As the representative of a large area of back-block country in New South Wales I know that the consideration of many matters is delayed owing to so .many inquiries having to be made. It is unsatisfactory to have all the inspectors located in Sydney, because it means that cases are allowed to accumulate until there are sufficient to justify a man being sent out to make the necessary inquiries. I cannot help suspecting that some of the replies we get are drafted in the office in Sydney^ and that no local inquiries have been made. A recent case gives very good ground for entertaining that suspicion. To the secretary of a Progress Committee I sent an official reply, about a mail extension. He took the trouble to travel some distance, and to make inquiries. The mail-man should be the first person to whom the inspector should apply for the purpose of ascertaining the cost of carrying the mails a few miles further. Although he had not been seen, still the official  reply  mentioned what the extension would cost, and said the additional expenditure was so high that the Department would not be warranted in undertaking it. The secretary to the Pi ogress Committee could not find in the district any person who had beer seen on the subject, nor could . he learn that any official had been sent there to make proper inquiries. On several occasions I have formed a suspicion that, inasmuch as the inspectors know the country pretty well, the replies to such communications are framed in the Department. Any one who is acquainted with mining localities knows how constantly changes take place. Frequently no coach is being run on a road, but when a little settlement has taken place some person, for the sake of carrying parcels and passengers, will put on a coach, and then the Department could get the mails carried for a comparatively small sum. Unless an officer goes into the locality &#39;and makes inquiries the position of things cannot possibly be known at head-quarters in Sydney. Sometimes the local officers have an objection to making up an additional mail-bag. But I trust that the Minister will be able to abolish this desire to shirk work. The aim of every postal official should be to assist the public, and by that means to make the Department more profitable than it is. There is too great a disposition shown to refuse requests of this nature. It would be a good policy, I think, to require the inspectors to live in their districts. It would enable the necessary inquiries to be made far more quickly than at present. Il is a waste of time for an inspector to travel a long distance from the city to the scene of his labours. I do not believe in centralization. I trust that the Department will be able to devise a check on the inspectors, otherwise the system must break down. There are many efficient .officers, but we want to have a new spirit animating them. We want them to recognise that they are serving the public, and that it is their duty to afford every facility that the public require within reasonable limits. We do not desire to have a letter delivery for every person in a district, no matter how many miles he may be away from any other person, but there should be reasonable facilities. A good plan would be to divide up the country, and to place districts under inspectors, shifting the inspectors about from time to time, as has been suggested. </para>

              <para>- It is assumed that an inspector will constantly be travelling in the district in which he resides. If that were the case, the honorable member might make up his mind that any communications which he had to make would be longer in travelling than is now the case. It will be admitted that since the Post Office had been federalized, the red-tape has been made longer instead of shorter. Precisely the same would happen if these inspectors lived in the back country instead of in the capitals of the States. Suppose an honorable member has a difficulty in connexion with the Department, which has to be referred to one of the inspectors. I do not refer to a difficulty concerning a large matter of policy, affecting, perhaps, a matter of discipline, or a radical alteration of a mail route, but a small difficulty which is merely a matter of adjustment. Is it not better to go to the capital and have&#39; the matter out face to face with the inspector ? In five cases out of six the case can be settled in the office at once, but that could not be done if it had to be referred to an inspector in the country. </para>

              <para>- No doubt they are in Sydney a great part of their time, but it is necessary for them to be there. How can they be consulted, and how can matters be discussed with them, if they are always in the country ? At present a matter of detail can be discussed with the inspector in the office, and&#39; settled in five minutes, whereas if an inspector had to be consulted in the country a communication would have to be addressed to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, who would have to send it to the inspector, who would have to be found somewhere in the interior. The inspector might be hundreds of miles away, and it might be very difficult to find him. The business would have to wait until he got back to some centre. With reference to Broken Hill, I can tell the honorable member for Barrier that when I was at the Post Office in Sydney we had a capable officer at a high salary at Broken Hill, Tor the express purpose of intrusting him with authority in matters which were not ordinarily in the province of such officers. It would be a piece of moonshine to send an inspector <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Broken Hill for any purpose, however small. An inspector should not be required to go there, unless there were a large question of policy at issue. The postmaster is a competent officer, and knows more about the district than any inspector would be likely to know. The probability is that in many cases when an inspector visits country districts, he merely consults the local postmaster, and accepts, his recommendations. </para>

              <para>- That is another matter entirely. If it is contended that we should pursue an entirely different policy, and give inspectors plenary powers in these matters, I am with honorable members; but the mere transfer of inspectors from Sydney to some country locality will not confer any more power on them. I may point out that at present, although the inspectors live in Sydney, their districts are defined &#39;for them. There is a metropolitan inspector, an inspector for the western, southern, and northern districts, and every one of these officers has his district defined for him. </para>

              <para>- I do not offer any serious objection to that, but I am telling the honorable member that if there is not to be a radical departure made in connexion with the distribution of power, the mere residence of an inspector in a particular locality will not obviate the evils to which reference has been made. On the other hand, I am very much afraid that what is suggested will but add a long length to the already enormous length of red-tape which surrounds all these matters. What we wish to do is to shorten the red-tape used in the settlement of these questions, and I submit that we can do that effectively when we can get face to face with the inspectors, and thresh out our difficulties with them. </para>

            <para>- With a view to shorten the debate, I may be permitted to say a word or two on this matter. Already Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia have been divided into districts, and it has been arranged that inspectors will take charge of those districts. With all respect to the honorable member for Parramatta, I quite agree with the proposal to divide the State of New South Wales into similar districts. We adopted that system in the Mines Department of that State. It had been found that the sending of mining inspectors long distances to inspect mines caused delay and dissatisfaction, as well as expense, and we therefore divided the State into districts, and appointed resident inspectors for those districts. My own opinion is that these inspectors should not only inspect the various offices when called upon for report, but should also supervise the working of the Department in their districts. An inspector resident in a particular district will naturally become acquainted with the working of the various local post-offices, and will be in a position to suggest desirable alterations in the public interest. Such a system should largely minimize the red-tape now complained of. </para>

              <para>- I hope so. The inspectors under such a system will be better acquainted with the requirements of the public, and will be in a position to deal promptly with all requests. Broken Hill may be a somewhat exceptional case, but there can be no doubt that somewhat similar difficulties exist in connexion with the Bourke district, and some of the northern districts in New South Wales. In my opinion, an inspector should supervise the work of the Department in his district, he should be a live man, alert to discover the best means of improving the facilities afforded by the Department, and he should report upon such matters without waiting to be asked for a report by the head office. I intend, after these Estimates are passed, to take steps to divide the States in the way suggested, believing, as I do, that the adoption of this system will add to the efficiency of the service. </para>

            <para>- I have been very pleased to hear the Postmaster-General express so strong an opinion on this matter. If the honorable member for Parramatta had ever represented a large and scattered country electorate, he would recognise that the people in such districts suffer great inconvenience as the result of the system now prevailing. At present there is far too much circumlocution associated with the Department. Under the existing system an inspector, who may be called upon to report upon some departmental matter in one portion of a large district, makes his inspection, and then returns to Sydney to furnish a report. In the meantime numerous other complaints relating to the same district have been received <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Department, withthe result that the inspector is continually travelling to and fro, and there is agreat delay. </para>

              <para>- This happens, to my own knowledge. If there were a resident inspector, stationed in a central part of each district, he would be better able to attend to the requirements of the people, and could deal with complaints far more expeditiously than is at present possible. In the main, no comparison can be made between the Lands Department and the Mines Department of New South Wales and the Common wealth Post and Telegraph Department; but I would point out that the benefits to be derived from decentrali zation have been amply shown by the working of these State Departments. District officers are appointed by them, and are able to inquire on the spot into any grievance, and to furnish a report with expedition. This system works very satisfactorily as compared with the circumlocution shown by the Commonwealth Departments in dealing with matters of even small concern. By way of illustration, let us suppose that in preparing plans for the erection of a post-office, the Government Architect has overlooked some convenience which is absolutely necessary, and which could be supplied at a cost of&#163;5. Under the system which prevails, neither the Colonial Architect, the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral, nor the Postmaster-General himself could authorize the necessary expenditure. The matter would first of all be dealt with in a report sent to the Department of Home Affairs. The Department would return the report to the Colonial Architect, who would make further inquiries and send it back to the Department of Home Affairs. Thence it would go to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of the State, who in turn would refer it to the Postmaster-General. By that time, the contractor would have completed his work, and the building would have been occupied perhaps for months. Honorable members will recognise that this is a most objectionable system. If the Prime Minister were subjected to the irritation to which many of the electors in rural districts and their representatives have to submit, in regard to these matters, he would not be so jovial a man as he is. The worries of his office are as nothing compared with the difficultieswhich we experience in having the wants&#39; of our electors investigated. An officer is not even allowed to deal with a matter involving no expense, and the cost of investigating and determining a case brought under the notice of the Department is very often a hundred times greater than the expenditure which would be involved in at once giving effect to the request of the electors concerned. I hope thatthe Government will strike out in a new direction, and make reforms that will enable the business of the country to be attended to with expedition. No one would be more readythan I should be to sing the praises of the Ministry, if the residents of my electorate were more readily brought in touch with postal facilities than they are at the present time. Under the proposed new system of resident inspectors, the Minister would be able to come to a decision more expeditiously than he is at present, in regard to telephones and similar accommodation. </para>

              <para>- I am very glad to hear it. I admit that, so far as the public are concerned&#39;, the service has not suffered in any way from the present arrangement, but a great injustice is being done to the gentleman who so ably fills the position of Acting  Deputy  Postmaster-General. I should also like to ask the PostmasterGeneral to consider the position of the inspectors. At present the Chief Metropolitan Inspector, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maguire,</inline> has also to attend to the duties which he discharged as a rural inspector - plus those of portion of a district formerly allotted to his predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young</inline> - for the salary that he received as a rural inspector, namely, ,&#163;400 per annum. Prior to this promotion, the position of metropolitan inspector carried with it a salary of ^470 per annum. In the classification of the Public Service Commissioner, this officer is set down for an increase of .&#163;20, whether on the basis of his old salary as country inspector, or on the basis of his new salary as metropolitan inspector, I cannot determine. This officer has to discharge very important and growing duties, and, whereas under State administration there were at one time nine inspectors employed, there are now only six inspectors, one of them having been appointed within the last few weeks, and having been promoted to an inspectorship from the position of postmaster at Tamworth. I find from the records of the Department that the officer to whom I have referred, joined the service in 1859, and holds the highest testimonials for efficiency during his long career as a public servant. In 1882, he was appointed telegraph inspector, and held that position until 1893, when he was promoted to be postal inspector, a position which he held until the present year; when he was made metropolitan inspector. The matter is one of some urgency, because he is now very near the retiring age, and if he retires while temporarily filling his present position, he will not be credited in his pension allowance with the work done in that capacity. With regard to the inspectorial work generally, the Postmaster-General is moving in the right direction in decentralizing the administration. The people of country districts feel that they labour under considerable; disadvantage ion -not having inspectors in closer touch with their requirements. A great part of an inspector&#39;s work is now performed in the head office, so that he can make only periodical visits to his district. </para>

              <para>- It was found -that the difficulties which were feared did not arise in actual practice, and the efficiency of those Departments was improved by compelling inspectors to reside in, their districts. A similar result would happen if postal inspectors were compelled to reside in their districts. The inspectors should either be given larger and more direct control over their districts or the staff of inspectors should be increased so as to prevent delay. Another matter which  deserves attention at the hands of the Minister is the need for giving local officials greater latitude in regard to petty expenditure. Instead of requiring them to obtain permission  through Sydney from the Central Administration in Melbourne, for the expenditure of money for putting in a pane of glass, for instance, which causes great delay, and often expense, they might be allowed to authorize expenditure up to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2&#176;, &#163;5&#176;,</inline> or .&#163;100. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SPENCE</inline>(Darling).- Under the Public Service regulations, provision is made for recompensing overtime by allowing time off, but certain officers may be paid for overtime not exceeding twentyhours a year. I have here, however, a record of the overtime worked by twelve linesmen, amongst .them gangers, some of whom have worked  over forty hours, others over eighty hours, and  one as much as ug hours overtime during the nine months ending September last. I have made careful .inquiries into the matter, having seen the parties concerned, and having interviewed the Public Service Commissioner and the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in order to study the public interest, as well as &#39; that of the men, I find that the Depart-  mental regulations cannot be carried ou&#60; because the men could not be spared from, duty a sufficient length of time to compensate them for the overtime which they &#39; have worked. Upon asking if the service is not undermanned, and whether the working pf overtime cannot be brought ,to an end by appointing extra men, I was told that this overtime is mainly brought about by the necessity for repairing lines which are damaged by heavy storms. We have had several such storms in New South Wales during the past twelve months, and it has been found imperative to employ thoroughly experienced men to do this class of work. Then, again, some of the overtime is due to the cable work which has to be performed in the telephone tunnels. When a job is once started in the tunnels it must be carried through to&#39; completion without unnecessary delay. The arrears of overtime to which the men are entitled are accumulating to such an extent that it will be extremely difficult &#39; to compensate them by giving them .time off. It would be fairer, to the men if they were to receive pay for&#39; overtime work at the rate of time and ahalf, in keeping with the practice whichprevails in nearly all private employments. It is unfair to expect the men to take time off as compensation for the time occupied in performing special work outside ordinary working hours. When I submitted this matter to the Public Service Commissioner he pointed out that the same argumentswould apply to all forms of overtime, and that, as the regulation was a general one, it would be difficult to know where to draw the line. It is clear that some change will have to be m.ade. The men are not complaining about the odd hours and halfhours for which they are called upon tqcontinue their work, <inline font-style="italic">but</inline> they point out that the wages paid to&#39; them are so small that it would be of great advantage to them if they were to receive money compensation for overtime. I do not press for an immediate decision upon this matter, because it will probably be brought under the notice of the Minister by a deputation representing the men. An Inter-State conference of representatives of the employes in this branch of the service will shortly be held. I think that it would be desirable to limit the number of hours for which the men are to be compensated by receiving time off, and to pay time and a half in  re. spect  to any period in excess of the limit. One officer worked for twelve hours on each of three Sundays, and on twelve Saturday afternoons in 1903, and he has not yet been paid. Another officer had overtime to his credit prior to the present regulation being brought into operation, and he still remains unpaid. </para>

              <para>- I shall be happy to do so. The men claim that the work which they are called upon to perform, and which results in their being required to work beyond ordinary hours, is of an exceptionally arduous nature, and that it would be fairer to pay them at overtime rates than to con,tinue the present arrangement. One officer has 119 hours to his credit, whilst several have as many as eighty hours, and the least time to which any of the officers is entitled is seventeen hours. It would be impossible in many cases to fully compensate these officers by giving them time off. I hope that the Minister will take this matter into consideration, and that some arrangement will be made which will be fair to the men, and will&#39;, at the same time, enable the Department to fully avail itself of their services. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMAS</inline>(Barrier). - In connexion with the proposed vote for the conveyance of inland mails, I desire to know whether the Postmaster-General is taking any steps to abolish the sweating of mail-coach drivers. Some time ago, a deputation waited upon the honorable member for Coolgardie, when he was PostmasterGeneral, and pointed out that a number of drivers were required to work from seventy to eighty hours per week. They asked that a report should be obtained, and that, if possible, future contractors should be required to abstain from working their drivers for more than fifty-six hours per week. I know that there is some difficulty in imposing fresh conditions upon the present contractors, but special provision should be made in all future contracts for the fair treatment of the men employed. </para>

              <para>- I should reckon the actual driving time. I do not think that  even  the contractors should  be  permitted to drive for more than fifty-six hours per week. This matter has to be considered not only from the stand-point of the drivers, but also from that of the safety of the travelling public. The roads in the back-blocks are not always the best, and it is desirable that the drivers should be as alert as possible. Unless we make some provision such as I have suggested, contractors may, in some cases, be induced to tender at low rates upon the chance of their being able to secure the services of men who will work for unreasonably long hours. </para>

We must recollect that the latter work under conditions which are a perfect paradise when compared with those under which the former discharge their duties. I shall be glad if the PostmasterGeneral can see his way to insert in all future contracts a provision that only a maximum number of hours shall be worked by all mail-coach drivers. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BROWN</inline>(Canobolas). - I desire to direct attention to the item, &#34; Allowances to non-official postmasters, receiving-office keepers, and others, and to provide for the opening of new non-official post-offices and receiving offices, . &#163;32,500.&#34; I need scarcely point out that since the Postal Department was transferred to Federal control the system of employing nonofficial postmasters to perform certain duties has been very considerably extended. I understand that a rule obtains in the Department - that unless any centre can demonstrate that a certain amount of revenue willbe derived from it annually, an official post-office will not be established there. In my own electorate there is a little town named Manildra. It is situated upon the western line, is surrounded by a very fine agricultural district, and is a growing centre. Some months ago its residents, through the secretary of the Progress Committee, communicated with me with a view to securing better postal facilities by the establishment of an official post-office there. Hitherto the postal work of the place has been attended to by a non-official postmaster, who also conducts a store. So far as I am aware, no special complaints have been urged against the present management, but the residents of the town naturally think that to meet their growing requirements they should be granted increased facilities in the shape of an official office, and accordingly they made application to that effect. In reply, the Department forwarded a communication containing a copy of the following report by the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral of New South Wales :  - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As the revenue of Manildra post office is only &#163;222 for the year, and it has been determined not to establish an official or staff office, unless there should be a revenue return of at least&#163;400 a year, the erection of a governmental building for a post office is not justified. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>From this communication it would appear that the rule of the Department is that before an official or staff office can be established at any centre, it must be apparent that it will return a revenue of at least ^400 per annum. That seems to me to be a very high minimum to fix, and I would respectfully ask the Postmaster-General, in fairness to the Department, and in justice to a number of places which occupy a similar position to that of Manildra, to ascertain whether the amount in question cannot be reduced. </para>

I then asked a question in reference to it, because it seems to me that we are paying a very large sum of money for the hire of these bicycles. I also determined - as soon as the Estimates were disposed of - to ascertain whether some more economical arrangement cannot be entered into. In my opinion it would be better for us to purchase the machines. I shall have an inquiry made into this and other matters as soon as we get into recess. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMAS</inline>(Barrier). - I notice an item for printing postage stamps and postal notes. I desire to ascertain whether the Postmaster-General is willing to provide in the main post-offices of each State some stamps of the other States. Of course, I should like the honorable gentleman to put down his foot and say that a Commonwealth stamp must be introduced. But it may be that there are some difficulties to be overcome before that forward step can be taken. On application at the General Post Office in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, a person can purchase a few stamps of any State on paying a commission of 2d. per dozen. It is a great convenience to the people of Melbourne, for instance, to be able to purchase here stamps of New South Wales or Queensland. This advantageous system should be extended to all the main post-offices in each State, and the fact made known to the people by means of advertise ments. When a man is writing a letter on a business matter to a person outside his State, it is a great convenience to be able to inclose a stamp for a reply. When I was in Broken Hill I received a letter from a person in Victoria, who was a stranger to me, asking for information about a work. He expressed his regret that he was unable to enclose a New South Wales stamp for a reply, but hoped that in the circumstances I would furnish the information desired. If my suggestion be adopted a far larger number of persons would be able to enclose a stamp for a reply to a letter, and also to remit small sums to distant places in the Commonwealth. I should also like a few English stamps to be stocked at the main post-offices, so that any person would be in a position to enclose English stamps for the payment of any article which he required to get from the old country. If a pound&#39;s worth of the stamps of each State were stocked it would be sufficient to begin with, and as soon as they were utilized they could be replaced. A charge of 2d. per dozen, or per two dozen, would cover any loss which might occur. This would be a great convenience to those persons who live in border towns. The people in the rural districts ought to have the same facilities as the people in the metropolitan districts. </para>

              <para>- In very many ways,&#39; Broken Hill&#39; is placed in a peculiar position. For instance, all the material which is used by the Post and Telegraph Department has to come from Sydney, and, of course, that adds very considerably to the cost. Some time ago a person wished* a telephone to be fixed from Broken Hill to his station, which is some twenty miles outside the town. He offered to lay the line, but there were some objections made to his offer. I fancy that he wished to use .the telegraph posts, and he was told that he -could only use the telephone wire&#39; sanctioned by the Department. He was prepared to comply with that condition, but when he inquired about the price, he found that he could get the same wire for some pounds a ton less from a private company at Broken Hill, than from the Department. The difference in the price is mainly caused by the fact that the wire has .to be shipped from Sydney to Adelaide, and thence carried to Broken Hill. This not only places a handicap on private per-- sons who desire to have telephones of their own, and are prepared to buy the wire, but it also adds to the cost of anything which the Department wishes to do. Some time ago I asked that the telephone system should be connected with a mining township called the Pinnacles. The estimate of cost was based by the Department or the assumption that the wire &#39; would come all the way from Sydney. The cost would be pounds less had the wire been sent from Adelaide ,to Broken Hill. If the Department would only make up its mind to do so, it could easily -give effect to the Federal spirit. It would be very easy to make an arrangement with people in Adelaide to supply the articles required, instead of sending them all the way from Sydney <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Adelaide. The bicycle to which I referred recently, must have been almost worth its weight in gold by the time it reached White Cliffs. I should be pleased if the Minister will try to arrange that all stores shall be sent from the nearest port to Broken Hill. Now that the States are federated, surely it is not absolutely necessary that all the stores for that very important part of Nev South Wales should come from Sydney ? The townspeople are severely handicapped by the cost of the extra carriage. </para>

I do not object to pay &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000 for other purposes, if necessary. But we should have some assurance from the Minister that he will fight for his Department in this matter. What is the poundage rate which we shall have to pay when the present contract lapse&#39;s? </para>

              <para>- The poundage rate isvery high per lb. Why should thePeninsular and Oriental Company and the. Orient Company charge more for carrying a ton of letters than for carrying a ton of merchandise? They carry merchandise for &#163;2 a ton. I suppose that they take no more care of the letters than of the merchandise, and they do not accept the responsibility if a bag of letters is lost any more than they accept the responsibility if any portion of the cargo is lost. As under the poundage system the companies are not bound in respect of time and speed, I hope that the Minister will see that the rates paid are as low as possible. </para>

I . have made the statement that these sub-contracts, which are supposed to have been transferred, have, I think, been transferred only in name, and not in substance, and I believe that in connexion with them certain sub-agreements exist. I have not yet heard that the Minister has taken any action in connexion with the matter I brought under his notice. The charge I made is a serious one, and demands investigation. </para>

              <para>- He cannot deny the letter which I have in my pocket, and in which he demands over ^40 from this man. I do &#39;not desire that there should be any perfunctory inquiry into this matter. When I raised it first, about eighteen months ago, the Department made an inquiry by means of an inspector. The honorable member for Denison, who was then in charge of the Department, &#39;will know that what I am stating is correct. The departmental officers went to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vines</inline> and accepted his word. He told them that he had none of these contracts sublet, and  1  got a letter to the effect that the Department, having made inquiry into the matter, it was found that none of these contracts had been sublet. </para>

              <para>- I contend that these charges are so serious as to demand the  fullest investigation. I have been for a certain number of years in parliamentary  life, and I am not in the habit of making serious charges without good reason. So far, in connexion with this matter, I have proved every statement I have made. </para>

              <para>- I was not aware that there was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> at Smeaton. I have not received letters&#39; on the subject from any person named Poynton. I have not concealed the source of my information. The officers of the Department have all the information that has been given to me, and they are satisfied that it is correct. As a result of it, the Department gave notice of the cancellation of forty-one contracts. The officials agreed to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vines</inline> that he should be allowed to transfer his contracts, and he was thus allowed to escape the penalties which would have been imposed if the extreme step of cancellation had been taken. In my opinion these contracts have not been transferred in accordance with the spirit of the agreement arrived at between the Department and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vines.</inline> I believe that there are still some sub-contracts in existence - that men are to-day engaged in carrying mails for less &#39;than the amount of the Government contract. I proved the other day that in one case a man who refused to sign a sub-contract agreeing, for t&#39;he sum of &#163;108 per annum, to carry mails for which Vines received &#163;160 per annum, had been threatened with law proceedings. </para>

              <para>- There are various means by which he could be made to pay the penalties provided in such cases. In all probability Parliament will be prorogued within the course of a few weeks, and as the present mail contract will doubtless expire before next session, it seems to me that my complaint is worthy of serious consideration. I am led to bring this matter before the Committee, not from any personal feeling, but because I desire rhat justice shall be done, and I wish now to know what action the Minister proposes to take in regard to it. </para>

With regard to the statement made to-day by the honorable member for Grey, I may say that I intend to have a searching investigation into the whole matter. If that investigation reveals such a state of affairs as he has indicated - if it shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vines</inline> has not carried out the spirit and the letter of the agreement between him and the Department, by which he undertook to transfer the contracts and so escape the penalties - steps will be taken to see that he is punished in some other way. But until I have an opportunity to make a thorough investigation it would be unfair for me to prejudge the case. </para>

            <para>- I desire to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vines</inline> is prepared to give the PostmasterGeneral the fullest possible information in regard to this complaint, and is very anxious that a Select Committee should be appointed to inquire into it. When the honorable member for Grey first brought the matter forward I informed him that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vines</inline> desired that a Select Committee should be appointed to deal with the case, and he feels aggrieved that the good name which he has held for forty years should be taken away in this Chamber by <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements, based apparently on information supplied by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> - not the honorable member for Grey - and also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leviston,</inline> against whom he has instituted legal proceedings. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vines</inline> interviewed me to-day, and thinks it. disgraceful that a man who is not only known to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, but was also known to his father, as one having a reputation for straight-forward conduct, should have been attacked in the way disclosed by the last issue of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> without having an opportunity to reply to the charges made against him. When I spoke last week, I was not aware that, from his point of view, two contracts had to be taken over by Leviston. He also explains that Cobb and Company had been running their coaches on the road in question for ten years, and that, in addition to the sum that he was to pay <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leviston</inline> for carrying the mails, he agreed to give him absolute control of the passenger traffic which had been carefully built up in this way. That is a consideration which the honorable member for Grey ought to have mentioned. If he were not aware of it, I can only say that he should not have placed before the Committee a distorted statement of the facts. </para>

              <para>- It seems unreasonable that such an arrangement could not be made, say, by the executors of a deceased contractor. I believe it might be very well explained that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vines,</inline> in agreeing to refrain from carrying passengers on Che road, gave the sub-contractor a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for carrying the mails at less than the contract price. While the person who is subletting may seem to be gaining an advantage by the transaction, as a matter of fact, the subcontractor may be making a good thing out of it, too. The proper way to prevent this would be to let each contract for service separately, but neither the Department nor the contractors would gain by that. A man without money is always at a disadvantage in competing with a man who has money, and small contractors would find it difficult to compete against a well-established firm. Whilst we admire the honorable member for Grey for the goodness of his intentions, it is quite possible that if his proposition were assented to, injury rather than good might result to those whose interests he has at heart. </para>

Under a State Act, the Commonwealth public servants in South Australia are entitled to certain increments, and I understand that these increments are not to be paid until the appeals against the classification of the service by the Commissioner have been dealt with. I can understand the action of the Government in not paying the increases recommended by the Commissioner until they have been approved by Parliament, but there is no reason why the statutory increments should not be paid. </para>

            <para>- Where the increase proposed on the Estimates covers a statutory increment, as well as a classification increase, the statutory increment will be paid without delay.

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK (Parramatta).None of the increments referred to have yet been paid in New South Wales. I have been asking the Treasurer about this &#39;matter for the last four years, and he has repeatedly told me that he was anxious to pay the increases as they became due. Notwithstanding this, I understand that in New South Wales - and I suppose it is the same in the other States - none of the increases have been paid. So far as I can ascertain, this result is due either to dilatoriness on the part of some of the officials, or to short-handedness in the office in which the returns are prepared. I am informed that the returns relating to the increases have not yet reached Melbourne. Therefore, no blame attaches to the Treasurer, although some one is certainly at fault. The preparation of the list of increases seems to have occupied fully six months. Instead of their being ready at the beginning of the year, the particulars do not reach the Treasury until about Christmas time. I submit that some one should be stirred up in connexion with  this  matter, particularly as it affects officers who are in receipt of small salaries. Those who receive little more than&#163;100 a year have obligations , to meet, just as well as others, and it is unfair to require them to wait for six months after their increments become due, merely because some . officer, who isin receipt of a large salary, has not sent in the necessary list at the proper time. The Postmaster-General has promised to look into this matter, and I hopethat he will apply the remedy. Something should be done, and I trust that an arrangement will be made for paying the increments as I they become due. It could be remedied by commencing before the end of the year instead of after. </para>

              <para>- Of course, I fully understand that they cannot be paid until they have been voted by Parliament. I am not speaking about the increases which are dependent on the adoption of the classification scheme. I understand that those cannot be paid until the scheme has been approved. But. apart from those altogether, there are a number of statutory increments to officers in receipt of salaries over &#163;160, which, so far as I can understand, should not be withheld. If we are to understand that these increments are to be paid after the Estimates have been passed well and good ; but if, on the other hand, they are to be withheld until the. classification scheme has. been adopted, considerable delay, for which I know of no justification, will be involved. </para>

            <para>- I understand that the honorable member for Coolgardie desires to make some references to the question of transferring officers who are now employed on the gold-fields to stations where the conditions of life are more favorable. Perhaps I may be permitted to direct the attention of the PostmasterGeneral to the desirability of establishing a Commonwealth list of the public servants connected with his Department. Under present conditions officers, except in rare instances, are apparently required to remain in the States in which they are at present employed. A former constituent of mine, who was stationed at Queenscliff, was some time ago transferred to Kalgoorlie. He expected that, in due course, he would be able to return to Victoria. </para>

            <para>. - The launch to which the honorable member refers was required at short notice by Queensland to replace a smaller one which had been previously in use there. Consequently it became necessary to secure a vessel which was then in use in New South Wales. A substitute was afterwards built for that State, and an arrangement was entered into under which the cost of the new launch was to be debited to Queensland, and that of the repairs to the vessel transferred, to New South Wales. At the present time the new launch is stationed at Brisbane. </para>

              <para>- That is so. But I would remind the Minister that I eliminated from the Estimates a very largeexpenditure upon drill halls. I am not complaining of the items which appear upon the Estimates, because, in most cases, the expenditure proposed is necessary to complete halls which are already in progress. I maintain, however, that the outlay upon these buildings should be kept down to the lowest possible minimum. Over the greater part of Australia we possess a climate which permits of men being drilled in the open air. </para>

              <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member. I claim that it is possible to waste a good deal of money in this direction. I do not believe that the erection of drill halls encourages a taste for military training. In going home from the House last session I could not fail to admire the enthusiasm displayed by some young Australians who were being drilled in the open street on the west side of the Fitzroy Gardens. </para>

            <para>- Unlike the last  speaker,  I am very pleased to see on these Estimates an item for drill halls. The necessity for drill hallsis greater to-day than it ever has been. In South Australia we have not an up-to-date drill hall, but merely an iron shed. When the State is provided with three drill halls - one at Adelaide, and two in country districts - we shall not have too many of them. It ought to be remembered that part of the instruction consists of lectures. In South Australia it has been found very inconvenient to give lectures outside in the gas light. I am pleased to notice that provision is made for three drill halls, and I trust that the Minister will see that they are used for the proper purpose. </para>

            <para>- I wish to call the attention of the Minister of Defence to the necessity of erecting a hospital at Queenscliff. The Estimates for 1902 contained an item of &#163;1,000 for this purpose, but when the cutting-down process began, it was omitted, and has not been re-submitted. I understand that the house of the late  Colonel Umphleby  is vacant. The use of this building has been recommended, first by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. McDougall,</inline> and next by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. King</inline> Scott, who say that the hospital accommodation at the Queenscliff forts is utterly inadequate and improper, because a patient has to be taken up a staircase containing two or three turns. If the Minister will promise, on his next visit to Queenscliff, to inspect the proposed hospital, I expect that it will result in the placing of an item on next year&#39;s Estimates for this purpose. </para>

              <para>- At any rate, an item has appeared on the Estimates for two years. In 1902 the land was purchased for &#163;1,260, and an item of &#163;3,500 appeared on the Estimates for the following year, although my honorable friend says that it also appeared on the Estimates for the previous year. Whenthe Public Works Inspector visited Brisbane, a question arose as to the desirability of erecting the office, and the suitability of the present rented office for the purpose. He interviewed the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, who stated that they could manage for three years with the present office if certain alterations were made. A question was referred to my Department by the Post and Telegraph Department as to the erection of this building if the land could be disposed of. If it were not to be needed there might be some reason to dispose . of the land; but as the office will be needed in the course of three years, and as the site&#39; is. a good one for the purpose, it is considered that, in order to save the waste of the land and the annual interest of &#163;40 or &#163;50, a building smaller than that previously provided - one which will cost &#163;2,010 instead of &#163;3,500, and be justified by the savings effected - is reasonable. We are paying a rent of &#163;65 a year for the present office, and &#163;52 a year as an allowance for quarters to the officer, and the total of &#163;117 represents about 6 per cent, on the proposed expenditure of &#163;2,010. Under these circumstances, I thought that the proper course to take was to erect a building. </para>

              <para>- I may say, in reply to the honorable member for Capricornia, that, without any request from the Queensland Government, I, . in going through the Estimates, was careful to reduce them as far as I possibly could, knowing that it was of importance to the State that the expenditure should be kept low. I reduced this amount by , &#163;1,500, and, in addition to that, I reduced other Estimates, so that, after paying this &#163;2,000, Queensland will be debited with &#163;1,600 less than would have been the case under the Estimates of my predecessor. These facts are sufficient to show that every consideration has been shown to Queensland. The report of  Colonel Owen,  the InspectorGeneral of Public Works, is as follows : - </para>

            <para>During my recent visit to Queensland, I took the opportunity of visiting the site recently purchased by the Commonwealth Government for a proposed new post-office at Woolloongabba. The site is an excellent one. </para>
            <para>The present post-office is a building rented at &#163;65 per annum. The first floor of this building is not occupied, excepting the front room used by the caretaker. It appeared to me that the first floor might be used for postal business if a small staircase were erected within the building and a correspondence lift provided. The Postmaster at Woolloongabba appeared anxious thata new post-office should be erected, but said that if the proposal indicated above were carried out, there would be sufficient accommodation for him to carry on for the present. I. discussed the matter with the Acting Deputy PostmasterGeneral, who stated that the existing accommodation would suffice for the next three years. </para>

              <para>- The 16th May, 1904. The estimate of 1903-4 for the building alone was &#163;3,500, and that amount was voted by the last Parliament. The question which I had to facewas - what was the proper action to take in regard to the building? I entirely repudiate any insinuation such as has been made by the honorable member for Kennedy. The matter was looked upon entirely apart from the electoral district in which Woolloongabba is situated. In fact, members of the Opposition have been treated in precisely the same way by previous Governments. There have been communications from the Premier of Queensland in connexion with post-offices in the electorates of other honorable members in opposition, asking that the works should not be proceeded with, owing to the financial condition of the State. But they were proceeded with. I was very anxious to consider Queensland, but I could not justify refusing to erect the office when I knew that it would be required in three years, and when there was a loss of interest on the &#163;1,260 invested in the land. It was a question either of selling the land - which could not be justified, because it was required - or of expending a sum of money sufficient to provide the accommodation needed. We propose to erect a building that can be enlarged as required. Under all the circumstances, I felt that it was necessary to proceed with the work. </para>

What is the difference, if any, between what we are paying for the present accommodation, and what we shall have to pay as interest on the money expended upon the building that it is proposed to erect, together with the cost of the land that has been purchased? </para>

            <para>- We have been told that the land on which this postoffice is to be erected was purchased two or three years ago, and it appears to me that action in the matter must have been taken very suddenly. The initial fault was in the purchase of the land, which is not in the best position for a post-office. I believe that the erection of this building will really result in some little saving, and I shall not oppose the vote. </para>

            <para>- The Committee, by voting this &#163;2,010 for the post-office at Woolloongabba, will be effecting an actual saving. The premises at present occupied as; a post-office at Woolloongabba do not belong to the Government. They are very unsuitable, and have not sufficient accommodation for the post and telegraph business of this growing district. I have made inquiries into the matter in order to be able to place the facts before the Committee. We pay at present for the use of these premises &#163;65 per annum, but the lease will expire in a few months&#39; time. We also give an allowance of &#163;52 a year to the postmaster in lieu of quarters. Occasionally there are dull days in Queensland as well as in Melbourne. Being badly lighted, an expenditure of &#163;13 was incurred last year for lighting the present premises. If we allow , &#163;50 as interest on the cost of the new site, it will be seen that the present cost of the post-office at Woolloongabba is &#163;180. We have paid &#163;1,260 for the land, and we propose to erect on it a building costing &#163;2,010, making a total expenditure of &#163;3,270. At the same rate of interest that would involve a charge of &#163;130 a year, which means an annual saving of &#163;50 to the Queensland Government. Honorable members should, therefore, have no hesitation in agreeing to this item. The new building will provide ample accommodation for some years to come. As Lt.-Col. Owen has said, the site selected is an excellent one. It is a corner allotment&#39;, and it will be possible to give light to the building at both sides and ends. I hope the Committee will agree to the vote.- </para>

The purchase of the land was made in a very sudden manner, and we knew very little about it. The Minister informs the Committee that we were then asked to vote a certain sum of money for the erection of the building, but I do not remember noticing the vote on the Estimates. </para>

              <para>- I believe it will not result in a saving. We cannot repudiate the arrangement by which the present postmaster at Woolloongabba is paid an allowance of &#163;52 a year. If he is transferred to some other office he will still have to get this allowance, and it is therefore of no use for the honorable member for Oxley to try to hoodwink the Committee in the way in which he has done by suggesting that this &#163;52 a year will be saved. When that sum is included in the expenditure, it will be seen that the proposal will involve a loss, and not a saving. I am not strongly opposed to the vote, but I think it would be wise to delay the erection of this building. Queensland should be considered to a greater extent than probably any other State in the Commonwealth in the present circumstances. When we entered Federation, we knew that Queensland must suffer an enormous loss of revenue from Customs taxation of between &#163;200,000 and &#163;300,000, and the loss has been greater than was anticipated. </para>

I am surprised that the honorable member for Oxley has not pressed the Government to adhere to the original vote, because I feel sure that the honorable member is sincere in his desire to have the best possible building erected at Woolloongabba.

If the honorable member will reflect for a moment, he will see that it must be saved, because if an officer is living in quarters owned by the Commonwealth, 10 per cent, of his salary is taken for rent. This &#163;52 is not a living allowance, but an allowance for house rent, and when the officer is transferred to the new building he will not get that allowance. In view of the explanation made by the Minister,  1  am satisfied that money will be saved by erecting this : post-office. If we can become our own landlords, there is ho reason why we should not do so as soon as possible. </para>

              <para>- Since the preparation of the Estimates it has been estimated that an expenditure of  ,&#163;900  or  &#163;1,000  will be necessary to complete the buildings required. I believe the townspeople raised a question as to whether an entirely new building Should be &#39; erected ; but, after making inquiries, the Works Branch of the Department of Home Affairs considered that, as the present structure is a substantial one, the best course to adopt is to make additions, which will be entirely self-contained, at a cost of  &#163;900  or  &#163;1,000.  The new building will form part of a design, which may be. completed when it becomes necessary to replace the present structure. We shall then have an office complete in its design and in its accommodation. The officers of the Department consider that the best and most economical course to adopt, and I am sure that the honorable member, after looking into . the matter, will arrive at the same conclusion. </para>

            <para>- Amongst the. items in subdivision  5.  we find a re- vote ofl &#163;500 for the East Perth Post-office. This re-vote is almost perennial, and it as time; that something was done with the money.; Year after year considerable sums are re- voted for works in Western Australia, but apparently no attempt is made to proceed with them. I am aware that this postoffice is badly wanted, and there is no reason why it should not have been erected&#39; long ago. </para>

It would be impossible for officers in the Works Branch of the Department of Home Affairs to undertake such work, because they are not familiar with all the technical details relating to it. </para>

            <para>- I wish to refer to a matter which has already been alluded to in the discussion of these Estimates. I was very pleased to hear that it is the intention of the Minister to inquire into the subject, and, so far as he can, to see that the officers of his Department who have been sent out to places where there are practically none of the comforts of civilization shall be allowed, after they have served a certain term there, to return to more favoured districts. In Western Australia there have been some cases of exceptional severity, but one which I think is unparalleled is that of the postmaster at Balladonia, midway between Esperance and Eucla, who has been there for a numbet of years, and went there onthe understanding that after a certain term he would obtain a transfer. I would contrast the position of such an officer with that of those in places like Bunbury, who are allowed to remain in agreeable posts for their lifetime. </para>

              <para>- It is a fact that the postmaster who has been all his life at Bunbury has been appointed acting inspector out of his turn. Under the present administration of the Department it is impossible for an officer in one of these outoftheway places to get back to civilization. I do not desire that officers should be forced, without regard being paid to other considerations, to go to remote stations, but where it is necessary to afford relief to those who have already served a considerable period in such places, officers in more settled and healthier districts should be required to take their turn, if they wish to remain in the service. </para>

              <para>- I know that the Minister has difficulties to face in connexion with this matter. Under the Public Service Act an officer may not be transferred without the consent of the Commissioner for a longer period than three months, but the Government should impress upon the Commissioner the desirability of approving of the recommendations of the responsible officials in the Postal Department in this matter. I also favour the opinion that a more liberal allowance in outside districts would tend to minimize the present difficulty. I cannot be accused of being actuated byselfish motives, because these men are so far removed from centres of population that they have practically no &#34; say &#34; at election time. It is only through Members of Parliament that they can get their grievances  aired. </para>

              <para>- I doubt if there is any case in Australia worse than the Balladonia case. The people at that settlement see strangers only once in three months, when provisions are brought to them. I was unfortunate enough to have to go through this sandy country some months ago. At one station I found that the line repairers had one crippled horse, and another that could not get up. That was not a very satisfactory state of affairs. I have since been informed that the disabled horse has recovered to a certain extent. The linemen have to go out on horseback, and I think that in cases where the circumstances will permit of the use of a cart, such a vehicle should be provided. We expect to see telegrams  published in the newspapers daily, but we shall run great risk of having the lines blocked for longer periods&#39; than is at present of frequent occurrence, unless we provide the line repairers, with proper facilities for doing their work. I desire to direct attention to the Sunday work which some officers are called upon to perform. Officers who are provided with residential quarters do not receive any allowances. Perhaps that may be justified, except in cases where they are required to perform Sunday work. I know of two instances in which officers are called upon to do more work on Sundays than on any other day. When a mail-boat happens to arrive they have to prepare for the incoming and outgoing ship&#39;s mails, and also for the departure of the inland mails. Their work therefore extends over a great number of hours. I think that it is iniquitous to require officers to remain in their quarters throughout the Sunday, and to perform work without extra pay. I hope that the Minister will give these matters his best attention. </para>

            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, that the question of transferring officers from the more settled parts of the State to the outlying districts requires the most careful consideration. There has always been a great deal of trouble in connexion with these transfers, and a verysimple way out of the difficulty which has, on several occasions, been suggested to the authorities, has not been adopted to the extent that the circumstances require. The allowances should be proportionate to the hardships entailed upon the officers. I am sorry to say that we have not hitherto paid our officers located at remote stations upon a sufficiently generous scale. We should have a more effective and contented service if the allowances were increased to a reasonable amount in consideration of the privations which the officers have to undergo. As the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has indicated, some officers have spent a long time in some of the most pleasant and salubrious spots in the State, and have not been called upon to go out into the interior, whilst others, after only a few years&#39; residence in favoured localities, have been obliged to fill positions upon the goldfields. I know of two striking cases in point. One officer, who was in charge of a suburban post-office, who was thoroughly up-to-date and progressive, was ordered out to the gold-fields after about seven or eight years&#39; service. The reason for this was not very clear, but I imagine that the officer created some trouble for himself by showing that he was somewhat progressive in his ideas. </para>

              <para>- That affords all the more reason why those officers who have held positions in the more favoured districts for many years should&#39; have been transferred to the gold-fields. The unfortunate officers who have been sent to the interior have had to stay there because transfers could not be effected. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see that the system of transfers is improved, and that the administration in that connexion is of an impartial character. Also, that he will take into consideration the question of increasing the allowances, especially in the case of officers who are located in the more remote districts. I believe that if this be done we shall have no further difficulty in regard to transfers. </para>

            <para>- I rise to indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Perth with regard to the allowances to officers stationed in remote localities. For many years in the New. South Wales Parliament I advocated that officers should have allowances upon a liberal scale in proportion to the extent to which they were removed from the metropolitan areas. The salaries should be fixed upon the basis of the work performed in the big cities, and the allowances should be added in the way suggested. It is very;  difficult to induce the authorities to adopt this common-sense method of meeting the case. No consideration is paid to the great disadvantages under which officers living at remote stations have to labour. </para>

              <para>- I am claiming that the salary should first be fixed in accordance with the character of the work, and that a special allowance should be made in consideration of the disabilities under which the officers may have to labour. There are undoubted advantages attached to residence in the capitals. When I recently endeavoured to assist an officer who desired to be removed to a station nearer to Sydney I found that hundreds of others had a similar desire. This was perfectly natural, and the authorities offered no inducements to them to remain outside. </para>

              <para>- The Department might make allowances to officers proportionate to the conditions obtaining in the distracts in which they were stationed. If officers received allowances of from &#163;20 to &#163;50 a year as compensation for residing in remote portions of the Commonwealth, they would know that the moment they quitted those districts for better localities they would forfeit their allowances. That would deter many from desiring to obtain appointments near the coast. I do hope that honorable members will take a common-sense view of this matter, and will seek to equalize the con ditions obtaining. We have only to recollect the numerous conveniences which are enjoyed by an officer who is resident in Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane, to appreciate the superiority of his position over that of an officer in the back-blocks. I am astounded that honorable members who have an opportunity to show that they are fair-minded, do not take a broader view of this matter. The fact is that officers at head-quarters are constantly seen by their superiors, and as a result are able to obtain more advantages than are those who are located in outlying districts. In my opinion, we should seek to give those who do the work of the Government in the bush some compensation in the way of salary for the disadvantages which they suffer. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. I think that these cases should be taken into consideration. At the same time we must recollect that it is not fair to keep single men stationed in outlandish places year after year. Naturally they desire to enjoy some of the comforts of civilized life, and instead of encouraging them to remain in the back country by granting them increased salaries, I claim that some system should be devised under which, after they have served three or four years there, they should be afforded an opportunity of getting nearer to the coast, and of enjoying improved conditions. </para>

There is no doubt that single young men are in a better position to accept appointments in the back country than are those with family responsibilities. But&#39; I know of cases in which married men with families have been obliged to go out into the back-blocks, and have received an allowance equal to an addition of only 25 per cent. to their salaries, whilst their expenses have been increased by 50 per cent. What I ask is that in such cases the allowance shall be such as to make the new position of the officer at least equal to that which he has had to relinquish. </para>

            <para>- I quite agree that no officer should be compelled to live the whole of his life in an outlandish place. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has referred to the cases of officers who have been obliged to remain for a long period upon the south coast of his electorate. But I would point out that there are worse instances than those named, in Western Australia. I need scarcely remind him of the position of officers who are stationed between Geraldton and the northwest coast, La Grange Bay, Broome, Derby, Hall&#39;s Creek, and Wyndham, where very bad climatic conditions obtain. </para>

              <para>- r know that, at the time to which the honorable member refers, the Postmaster-General was very considerate to all his officers. There are, however, young men in the service who are qualified who should be willing to go out into the back-blocks, and I think that they might fairly expect to be sent there. I know a case in which an officer with a young wife and children, who occupied the position of postmaster in a suburb near Perth, and who had given the greatest satisfaction to the community, was transferred to a similar position at Peak Hill. That township is situated something like ninety miles from the nearest railway station, which, in turn, ds nearly 300 miles distant from the coast. In short, Peak Hill is upon the very confines of civilization. I interested myself in his case, and said, &#34; Surely from amongst all the young men in &#39;the service, this officer, who has a young wife and children, need not be selected for duty at such a distant and isolated place.&#34; My efforts, however, were unavailing. The officer in question was sent to Peak Hill, and did not, I believe, receive any consideration in the way of salary. </para>

              <para>- I was moved by some persons who had interested themselves hi his behalf. It was a case in which an officer with a young wife and children was selected to go to one of the most distant places. There should have been many others available for the post. He might have been sent to a place not so far removed, from civilization. I am glad that the matter has been brought up. A system will have to be adopted in this large service, whereby those who go out into the far-back country shall not be compelled to remain there too long. I believe that there is considerable room for improvement in this regard. I know that officers have been at Eucla for very many years. In some cases, they have become so accustomed to being in out-of-the-way places that they do not wish to move. What has interfered, too, with their removal has been the allowance which they would have to forfeit if they returned to civilization. I agree with the honorable member for New England that if the allowance were made a little more worth having, it would be an inducement to young men to volunteer to go out to distant stations into the back country. I feel sure that the Postmaster-General will give his attention to this matter j but so long as he supports the Commissioner in sending a young man with a wife and children into the uttermost parts of Western Australia, he may depend upon it that he will not give satisfaction to myself, and to many other members of the House. </para>

            <para>- With the officers this is very largely a question of getting better facilities for a growing family, and very often, it is a question of health. When an officer is sent to arn isolated district, apparently he is forgotten by the Department, and is allowed to remain there for ever, unless, of course, he can bring some pressure to bear to remind the authorities that he is in existence. The only remedy I can see for this state of things is a system under which the officers might have the option of changing stations at least once every five years. It should not be made a hard-and-fast rule that the officer should be compelled to change, but he should have the option of doing so if he wished.&#39; There are many men in the back country who have been trying to get removal for from six to ten years, but have had no reasonable opportunity offered to them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I do not hear very much complaint as to the matter of pay. The great complaint is that when officers with growing families are isolated, there are not sufficient facilities for giving their children a sound education, and, naturally, they desire to remove to those centres where it can be obtained. &#39; It very, often happens that the real reason why an officer desires to secure a change is because of the health of himself, or his wife, or his family. In New South Wales it is not uncommon to find that a medical man has certified that it is absolutely necessary for the preservation of her life that the wife of an officer should be removed from hot enervating districts. The only alternative which the officer has is to take the risk he is warned against, or to incur the cost of sending his wife into a colder climate, and providing for her there. In several cases officers in this Department have been compelled to take the latter course. That imposes a very serious strain on their salaries. Some officers would willingly adopt this plan if their salaries would permit, but, being in the lower grades, their pay is not sufficient to ^provide two homes, and they appeal to the /Department &#38;n vain for assitance. I know that the heads of the Department endeavour, as far as they can, to meet these cases. But I think that if a system were adopted which would give every officer, after five years&#39; service in the back districts particularly in the hot enervating districts, an opportunity of removing to a better climate, a great improvement would be effected. I am very pleased that this subject has again engaged the attention of the Committee, and I trust that by the time the next Estimates are submitted the Department will have evolved a better system of dealing with .these causes of complaint. </para>

            <para>- I thoroughly sympathize with the appeal which has been made on behalf of officers who live in remote country districts. I- shall be very glad to support honorable members in the stand they have taken as far as I can, but I am afraid that the Minister&#39;s hands are tied by the Public Service Act. I find that in a very great number of matters the Public Service Commissioner has much greater authority in the administration &#34;of the Post and Telegraph Department than has the Postmaster-General, and no doubt the Minister has found to what extent his (hands are tied. I venture to say that he could not make a transfer of an officer in a remote country district, no matter how hard the case might be, without the consent of the Commissioner. The Parliament has, I believe, vested too much power in the Commissioner. The Minister ought not to be a mere clerk in his own Department, to go to the Commissioner and make an appeal to him whenever he wishes an act of common justice to be done. </para>

              <para>- I do not know. I am merely pointing out that a transfer or promotion cannot be made without the consent of the Commissioner. I believe that the law as it stands places too much power and political patronage in his hands, and the time will come when it will have to be reconsidered, if not modified, in the direction of vesting more power in the responsible Ministers of the Crown. I was very much impressed with this view of the case by an incident which came under my attention only recently in connexion with this Department. I found that &#39;a large number of young telegraph messengers were being  dismissed wholesale on arriving at the age of eighteen years. Ostensibly no employment could be found for them in the Department, but at the same time, I find that the Public Service Commissioner was making  mew  appointments of persons outside the service, whose names happened to be upon the employment register, and who had passed certain examinations. I interviewed the PostmasterGeneral, and pointed out the monstrous injustice that had been done in turning out of the service young fellows who had been there three or four years, had been trained to the  work,  had become useful, and had, it  may be, disqualified themselves from obtaining employment in other walks of life.  These youths, on arriving at the age of eighteen, were turned out of. the </para>

          <para class="block">Department. They were undoubtedly qualified. Many of them had passed an examination - some for telegraphy, and some for subordinate clerical positions. Yet they got their walking .tickets whilst the Public Service Commissioner was appointing other young fellows, and- other young women, who had not previously been in the service. If to do so be within the power of the Public Service Commissioner, it discloses a state of the law which ought certainly to be taken into serious consideration. If the Public Service Commissioner is acting legally in making these fresh appointments whilst there are others in the service who are qualified to be appointed, Parliament should step in and take that power from him. Young fellows who have served as telegraph messengers for some years, who have been waiting for employment, and who have qualified themselves, ought not to be cruelly turned out at one door, whilst they see fresh people entering by another door. I hope that the Minister will take the view that these young telegraph messengers, who tramp round our streets year after year in the hope and expectation of being appointed to permanent positions after passing the necessary examinations, should be turned adrift whilst persons outside the service obtain appointments. It is very bad policy indeed to ask for applications for appointment to positions whilst there are those in the service who are qualified to fill them. I know that what I am saying is actually true, because several cases have occurred in my own electorate. Other honorable members are also aware of similar cases of hardship. The whole subject should be taken into consideration by the Minister, and if he can interfere without any alteration in the law he ought to do so. If an alteration of the law be necessary I feel certain that honorable members would agree to make it. </para>

              <para>- I know that some telegraph messengers have gone up for examination, have paid their fees, and have passed, when it must have been known by those who received the fees that there was no chance for them, even if they were successful. I maintain that in cases like that the officials should tell those who desire to be examined that it is absolutely useless for them to present themselves for examination, because there is no chance of their being appointed. Two cases Have been brought under my notice recently where persons employed in the Post and Telegraph Department have given satisfaction, and have become skilled operators, but because there were no vacancies on the permanent staff they have been turned adrift. I am aware that it is absolutely necessary that there should be a time fixed when these lads should go, because probably the service cannot absorb all of them. But those who are in the service and have passed the examination should receive the first consideration when vacancies occur; and if telegraph messengers have passed examinations, and vacancies occur shortly after they attain the age of eighteen, and they have been compelled to leave the service, they should be given the first chance, even if they have been out of the service for a few weeks when the vacancies take place. The complaint which many of them make is that, simply owing to the fact that they attain the age of eighteen a week or a fortnight before a vacancy occurs, their chance of entering the service absolutely disappears for life. Some of these youths I know have entered the service of the Eastern Extension Company, and are to-day skilled operators. The Postmaster-General might look into the whole subject, and I trust that he will do so. </para>

            <para>- The point raised by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo is important. The reason why the provision requiring youths to leave the service at the age of eighteen was inserted in the Post and Telegraph Public Service Act was largely on account of our experience in Victoria. We found that lads had been allowed to remain in the service for a&#39; number of years, had attained to manhood, married, and had families dependent upon them, whilst _ they were still being paid low wages for doing boy&#39;s work. In order to alter that condition of affairs we provided that boys should go out of the service automatically on attaining the age of eighteen, provided that there were no vacancies in a particular grade which they could fill. </para>

              <para>- But if in attempting to remedy that condition of affairs in the Commonwealth Service we have not carried out what we meant, we should alter the law. I understand from the honorable and learned member for Bendigo that, although there may be vacancies in the service, and although some telegraph messengers have qualified themselves, they have to leave at the age of eighteen, and no consideration is given to them if vacancies occur shortly after they leave. I agree that preference ought to be given to men who have been in the service. That was the intention of Parliament. Surely the spirit of the law is that if telegraph messengers qualify themselves by examination they shall have a preference, even if vacancies occur a few months after they leave the service. </para>

            <para>- In New South Wales the position in this respect is somewhat worse than it is in Victoria, because, under the Public Service Act of New South Wales, the retiring age of these lads was twenty years. When accepting positions as telegraph messengers, they had to sign a document agreeing to retire at the age of twenty years, should there be no openings for them in the Department when they reached that age. I have seen the New South Wales list of the lads who retired in this way, and I should say that it contained some 300 or 400 names of young fellows, for whom it had not been possible to find any openings in the Department. As under the Commonwealth the number of offices has been reduced, and unofficial offices have been instituted, there are now fewer openings for these lads, and it is impossible to guarantee that openings Will be found for them even though they should prove themselves highly efficient. The claim is made by honorable members that they should have preference for vacancies which arise after they have attained the retiring age, but honorable members who speak in that way should remember what that would mean for those who are still under the age. We fixed .the retiring age at eighteen years, because it was thought that if these lads were kept at this work until they were older than that, it would spoil their chances of getting other work to do. There are quite a number of young men in my electorate who have retired from the Department at the age of twenty years, and I have made inquiries as to what could be done for them. I find that it has been the practice of the Department in New South Wales to give them considerable notice in the shape of four months&#39; leave of absence on full pay, that they may be able to look out for something else to do. It is .true that when they accept positions as telegraph messengers, they know what they must expect, but they still think that they should be given permanent positions. A number of the lads are very clever, and&#39; have passed examinations before they have come to the retiring age. They have become expert telegraph operators, and able to do all the work of the telegraph office, and ,the weakness of the whole system is that these smart young men should be lost to the Public Service of the Commonwealth and States. I think that there is a lack of proper co-operation between the different Departments of the States, &#39; as well as of the Commonwealth, or we should not lose the services of young men who have good qualifications, and for whom there may be no openings in the Post and Telegraph Department. I can hardly believe the contention that vacancies in that Department are filled from persons outside the service while lads under the retiring age can be secured, because that is contrary to the Act. </para>

              <para>- What I say is that some other Department should absorb these young men who are compelled to retire from the Post and Telegraph Department. Unfortunately it would appear that the States and the- Federal Departments ignore each other. A private employer will look for the person best qualified for trie work he has to offer, and these young men, having  special training, should not be  lost  to the different Public Service Departments. Of course I do not, in these remarks, refer to the whole of them, because I am informed . that some of them take no interest whatever in their work, and do not try to learn telegraphy or any office work. Such lads must take their chance elsewhere, but there should be some arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth Departments by which young men who. have qualified themselves could be absorbed in preference to taking on those who have had no departmental experience. I do not agree with the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, that everything is done by the Public Service Commissioner. When we go to some of the Departments with complaints, they will put the blame on the Public Service Commissioner, when it .should attach to some on-e else. It is a habit in Sydney to put the blame on the head office in Melbourne, but when we . make inquiries, we find that it does not rest upon the officers here. I have traced the hist-. /ry of some of- the cases which have been brought under my notice, and I have  found  that the recommendation, and practically the selection for any appointment are made, not by the Public Service Commissioner birt by the Deputy Postmaster-General, and it is merely the formal approval that is given by the Public Service Commissioner. As I understand it, and the Minister will be able to correct me if I am wrong, the selection or recommendation is in the first case made by the heads of Departments, and is sent on to the Public Service Commissioner &#34;for his approval. With -respect to the other matter to which  reference  has been made, I am satisfied that many officers of this Department have been cruelly treated. Some have been stationed for seventeen or eighteen years in remote districts. They have lost members of their families, and have had their health broken down by1 long residence in a bad climate, and it is not creditable to the Department that they have not been transferred. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo cannot blame the Public Service Commissioner for this, because this kind of thing was done&#39; before there was a Commonwealth Public Service. There is nothing new in the treatment of public officers in this way. On my recent visit to my electorate, I was speaking to one of these officers, who had been stationed for seventeen years in a remote district. He is graded at a certain salary, and all that the Department has offered him has .been a transfer to two other districts where the climate is just as severe as it is in the district in which he is stationed. It will be admitted that that is manifestly unfair. In New South Wales the great bulk of the population is settled on the coast, because of the better climate to be found there. There is consequently a larger number of officers stationed there than in any other part of the State, and vacancies occur very frequently ; but the Department seems to lose sight of the back-country men when vacancies in their own grade occur in the coastal districts. A man is sent out into the back-blocks, and his existence is practically forgotten by the Department. The statements made by some of these officers are really pathetic. Imagine the position of a man stationed in&#39; a place where there is perhaps only one house. In Tilpa, which is in my electorate, there is only one public-house, and not even a store or a butcher&#39;s shop. It is enough to break a man&#39;s heart to be sent with his wife and family to such places, and compelled to remain there, notwithstanding repeated applications for a transfer. The only reason given for a refusal to transfer them to a coastal district, is that it is cheaper to transfer an officer from one suburban office to another, than it is to transfer one from a back-country office to a city one. I hold that officers stationed in the western part of New South Wales should not be compelled to remain there more than three years, and there are so many vacancies occurring in districts where the climate is more favorable, that there should be no difficulty in making transfers in this way. Representatives of New South Wales, who are acquainted with the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s work as a State officer, believe that he would not be opposed to the transfer of officers from the western to the coastal districts, at all events, after five years&#39; service. In one case I appealed on behalf of an officer who produced a doctor&#39;s certificate, showing that his health had been undermined by long residence in a backblocks district; that he had lost two of his children whilst stationed there, and that his wife&#39;s health had become so bad that he had been forced to send her to Sydney. He was promised, a transfer as soon as a vacancy in his own grade occurred, but although there has been several such openings, he remains at his old station. I  found, for example, that an officer had been removed from Grafton to another place close at hand, although that vacancy should have been filled by transferring a man from the western district. </para>

              <para>- That is the only reason given for the failure of the Department to make these transfers. I am not surprised that an officer should have -refused to go to Broken Hill. The local post-office is a large and important one, but any man who volunteered to go there would know that he would be forgotten by the Department. That is the position in regard to all the officers stationed in the western district. I am satisfied that the Department could overcome the difficulty by adopting the suggestion which I made a few days ago. An instruction should be issued that in filling any vacancy in the coastal districts, officers who have been stationed for some time in the back-blocks, where the climate is very unfavorable, should be given a preference, provided that the vacancy be in their own grade. It is natural that these men should desire to be transferred to the suburbs of Sydney if possible, but they would be satisfied if they were removed to one of the coastal districts. They enjoy very little social life. They never see even a travelling theatrical company or a circus, and they have scarcely any means of amusement. They live in the wilds of New South Wales, where they see nothing but an occasional sheep, and I should not blame them for endeavouring to be transferred to the suburbs of Sydney. They tell me, however, that they do not care where they are sent as long as they secure a change of climate. Under the present system, all vacancies are gazetted, and applications are invited from officers who are prepared to fill them. I hold that those who are stationed in districts where the climate is very extreme should be given a preference where any vacancy in a coastal district has to be filled. If the Minister adopted my suggestion I am sure that the Public Service Commissioner would not be found adverse to it. I do not know whether some of the officers under him desire to consider the claims of their friends, but, in one case, I was able to prove that preference had been shown to a local man. The reason given for his transfer was that his health was not very good, and when I pointed out that he had simply been removed from one office to another in the same district, the reply was that his new station was on a higher altitude. I pressed for a further explanation, and was finally told that the cost of filling the vacancy in this way was less than it would have been had an officer been removed from the western district. We passed the Public Service Act in order to do away with political patronage- </para>

If justice were done - if proper consideration were given bv the heads of Departments to the claims of these officers in the back-blocks - it would be unnecessary for them to seek our intervention.

I have, therefore, asked the opinion of the Crown Solicitor as to whether these young fellows, although they have left the service, are not eligible for re-appointment. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps it would be necessary to prescribe a time limit. It would be impossible in so small a service as that of the Commonwealth to find employment for all telegraph messengers who had reached the age of .eighteen, because boys are continually growing up, and swelling the number. ii r </para>

              <para>- I understood that a man in the service, qualified for appointment, was given a preference. This is a matter which Ministers should inquire into, though I do not think that an amendment of the Act is necessary to prevent injustice. In my own electorate, within the last month, young men of twenty have had to leave the service under a provision of the State Act. One of them is the son of a widowed mother, who has done a great deal to get her boy into the post office and to keep him there. His superior officers think well of him, and say that he is a competent telegraphist, and fitted to do almost any work in the Post Office. It is not right that he should be dismissed while there are vacancies to which outsiders are being appointed. The idea of Parliament in passing the section of the Act which the Minister has read, was to prevent the keeping on of youths engaged as telegraph messengers who had not qualified for higher positions, or for whom there were no vacancies <inline font-style="italic">Li</inline> the service. &#39; It was not intended that men not in the service should be appointed to vacancies which qualified youths already in the employment of the Commonwealth could fill. I hope sincerely that the Minister will look into this matter. </para>

            <para>- I wish to emphasize what has been stated by the honorable member for Parramatta. I know of four lads in South Australia who passed the examination, and obtained the highest credentials from the  &#39;Deputy  PostmasterGeneral, but who were debarred from promotion by the provision in the Act, which requires that they shall retire from the sendee at the age of eighteen. I am sure that if the Minister obtained reports from the  Deputy  Postmasters-General they would support the statements made by honorable members as to the hardships inflicted in a number of cases in which the Department have to get rid of bright and intelligent youths, qualified for work of a higher class than that of messengers. These boys, after having been trained in a certain direction, are condemned under present arrange ments, to make a fresh start in life. I trust that the Minister will give this matter his careful attention. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the statements made by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo and the Postmaster-General surprised many honorable members. Even if the Public Service Commissioner has the right to deal with these matters in the manner described, the Committee has a right to be informed how it comes about that outsiders are appointed to positions which might very well be filled by boys who, after having acted as telegraph messengers, have qualified themselves for a higher class of work. Some time ago I interested myself in the case of a messenger who was approaching the age of eigh- teen  years. He had not only passed the first examination required to secure his admission into the service, but later on passed another examination, under the impression that if he succeeded he would be able to claim appointment to a higher position. Of the whole of the applicants in the Commonwealth he took fourth position on the list, but in spite of this fact, and of his having given every satisfaction, he. was told that he would have to go. I think it is the duty of the PostmasterGeneral to seek some explanation as to the principle upon which the Public Service Commissioner appoints outsiders in preference to those who have done good work in the service, and who have obtained the highest testimonials from their superior officers. When a youth reaches the age of eighteen years, he is too&#39; old to be apprenticed to some trades. For instance, he would not be permitted to become an apprentice in the printing trade. In many cases the lads will be compelled to take up the occupation of labourers, whereas they are qualified by education to become first-class mechanics or public servants. They ought to have a chance of filling vacancies, if they -are qualified to perform the work attaching to the positions. I know of two or three parents who submitted their children for examination in order that they might secure admission to the service. They were not anxious that their lads should become messengers, but they thought that if they proved themselves qualified for higher work they would be able to secure permanent employment in the Commonwealth &#34;service. If, as the Postmaster-General has stated, the </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BROWN</inline>(Canobolas).- The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has raised an issue that is well worthy of consideration. The matter referred to has been forcing itself upon the attention of the public servants, and will demand the early attention of Parliament. As the honorable member for Darling has remarked, in New South Wales we are feeling the pressure of this legislation, perhaps to a greater extent than are the citizens of other States. Under the State <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> the retiring age for telegraph messengers was twenty-one. Now the age limit for messengers has been reduced to eighteen, and, further, all staff post-offices which could not show a revenue of &#163;400 per annum have been converted into private offices. In this way the opportunities for employment in the service have been curtailed. I quite appreciate the difficulties which have to be overcome in dealing with telegraph messengers. We require a much larger number of messengers than can, upon reaching the age limit, be absorbed in the higher grades of the service. Therefore, under any .circumstances, a considerable number of the youths must be dispensed with. Our great difficulty in New South Wales arose from the fact that men who had entered the service as telegraph messengers were doing boys&#39; work and receiving boys&#39; pay, and would never qualify themselves for any higher class of employment. It was in order to remove this anomaly that the age limit was reduced. The idea was that if a youth had not, by the time he had reached the age of eighteen years, qualified himself for a higher position in the service, he should be required to seek an opening in some other walk of life. I do not think that the Public Service Commissioner is responsible for the fact that under present arrangements no adequate provision is made for the promotion of messengers to the clerical branch of the service. Upon reaching the retiring age the lads have to be dispensed with1, and their places have to be filled by others who are selected as the result of competitive examination. But there is also a higher grade in the service, known as the &#34;clerical branch,&#34; vacancies in which are similarly filled. 11 r 2 </para>

              <para>- I say that the present position is anything but a satisfactory one. Youths enter the Postal Department, who show great aptitude for their work, and who qualify1 for higher positions than those which they fill. Under the existing system, however, they are not eligible for appointment to those higher positions. As soon as they attain eighteen years of age, their services are dispensed with, although the officers of the Department under whom they have served are very loth to lose them. What is required is some means which will enable telegraph messengers to qualify for and to obtain appointments to the higher grades of the service. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. If some such system were adopted - if some incentive were given to the brightest of these messengers to qualify for higher positions - it would not be necessary for the Public Service Commissioner to advertise vacancies for candidates outside the service. At the present time, the Commissioner is advertising an examination to fill eighteen vacancies which are expected to occur in the general branch of the service during the next eighteen months. In my opinion the telegraph messengers should be granted a preference, conditionally that they qualify for the higher positions. </para>

I do not agree with that suggestion. It would be in the highest degree foolish on the part of this Parliament, which is responsible for the conduct of an enormous Department, involving an annual turnover of many millions sterling - to place such restrictions upon any young man, who had. perhaps, passed a University course, as would prevent him from gaining admission to it. In my opinion, the Commissioner has adopted a very reasonable attitude.

            <para>- I quite agree with what honorable members put forward as their contention. But I was under the impression that they were contending that all the vacancies occurring in the service, no matter in what division, should be filled by messengers if a sufficient number were eligible. -If all youths entering the service had to start as messengers at fourteen years of age - they are not younger than that, as a rule, I understand - it would have a most restrictive effect in regard to the general development of the service. </para>

It is a proper thing to give these messengers a reasonable opportunity, but it would be a mistake to confine the whole service to them. That is the only point I am making. If honorable members are only asking that the general division be made open to the lads I certainly agree with them. </para>

            <para>. - I am reluctant to interfere when the Estimates of the Postmaster-General are before the Com-  mittee,  but really this discussion should have taken place on my Estimates, because, so far as the Public Service Commissioner is responsible to Parliament, he is responsible through me. This is the first time that this question has been raised, and I, as Minister, have not proposed to the Commissioner that he should introduce any new system in dealing with these matters. Now that attention has been called to the subject, I shall have much pleasure, also on representations from the Postmaster-General, in ascertaining exactly what are the rules which guide the Commissioner. I think there must be some good reason for what has been done, such as that mentioned by the leader of .the Opposition - that the Commissioner  considers  that there should be an opportunity to get in from outside those who have passed examinations, probably in many cases much better than the inside telegraph messengers have passed, and that there should be an opportunity to secure by competitive examination some of the talent which is outside the Department. Possibly, the Commissioner considers that he is under a certain responsibility to give those who have successfully passed examinations a share of the positions. </para>

But in deference to the remarks of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, and other members, I shall have much pleasure in conferring with the Commissioner, and ascertaining how far the suggestions made to-night can. in his opinion, be given effect to. I do not intend to bring pressure to bear upon him in his regulation of the service. Even if a Minister had power we ought to avoid the political management which we tried to p,ut aside by appointing the Commissioner. I shall confer with him, and bring under his notice what has been stated. Probably he has better reasons than some honorable members seem to think. I shall take the opportunity &#39; of letting him know the opinions of honorable members, and see whether he thinks any of the suggestions will be of advantage. </para>

              <para>- That is all I ask should be allowed. If a telegraph messenger who is to go out of the service can pass any examination which the Department requires him to pass, he should be appointed. 1 would not draw a distinction between clerical and other work. According to the Commissioner, a lad in the telegraph service is to be disqualified from entering into another position, and he will appoint only onehalf if they do pass the examinations. That it utterly wrong, I do not care who may defend that view. </para>

I am surprised at what the honorable and learned member for Bendigo has brought before the Committee tonight. Only one case of the kind has come under my notice. I was appealed to on behalf of a lad who had received notice that on a certain date his services would be dispensed with, because he would then have reached the age of eighteen years. I found that he had not passed the examination, and was therefore ineligible for a further appointment. </para>

              <para>- Where it is found to be the case there can be no complaint. If these lads have passed the examination they are entitled to a position  in the clerical division, and if they can pass an examination for the clerical division they have a right to admission to that division. The fact that they happen to be in the service should be a qualification rather than a disqualification. I do not accept the position which the honorable member for Bland takes up in this matter, because we want to have the very best men in the service, and if men show themselves to be the best thev should be appointed. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BROWN</inline>(Canobolas). - I should like to emphasize one phase of the question introduced by the &#34; honorable member for Darling. It is a matter which the States ought to deal with, and which might very properly engage the attention of t&#39;he Conference which is to be held at Hobart. I allude to the desirableness of greater re,ciprocity in the matter of appointing States public servants to positions in the Federal service. Under present circumstances a State public servant has the right to compete for any Federal appointment, and, if anything, has a preferential claim for consideration as against outside competitors, for positions in the higher ranks of the service. But the same consideration does not apply to Federal public servants who may desire to compete for positions in the States services. That is an oversight which ought to be remedied. The present position of affairs is creating some amount of friction. Naturally the Federal public servants feel that they have to face not only t&#39;he competition of their brother officers, but the competition of the whole of the States public servants, whilst they are debarred from competing for positions in the States. That is an anomaly which ought to be remedied. </para>

              <para>- If we send letters by the Peninsular and Oriental &#39; Company&#39;s boats under the poundage rate, we have to pay 3s. 7d. per lb., whereas if we send by a line that is not under contract, Ave pay 2s. per lb. Now, 3s. 7d. per lb. is &#163;401 per ton. Ordinary merchandise can be sent for &#163;2 per ton. So that practically we pay for sending one ton of postal matter as much as would suffice to send 200 tons of ordinary merchandise. Under the 2s. per lb. rate we should pay .&#163;224 per ton for postal matter, which is 100 times the amount that we should have to pay for ordinary merchandise. </para>

              <para>- I wish to see established penny postage with England. If we were to pay at the  rate of one farthing per letter, that would be 8d. per lb., or &#163;75 per ton. That would be a fair rate to charge. It must be remembered that, even though we pay 3s. 7d. per lb., we have no guarantee that the companies will look after the letters any more carefully than they look after merchandise. Nor are they under any obligation in regard to time and speed. I understand that the Government cannot avoid paying the full rate of 3s. 7d. per lb. in accordance with the Postal Union arrangement. But it appears to . me that when the next Postal Conference is held, those who represent Australia should certainly object to pay so much poundage. New Zealand, Canada, and the Cape have gone in for penny postage with England. Indeed, I believe all parts of the&#34; Empire have established Imperial penny postage, with the exception of Australia. Yet this is a serious matter of business, affecting our trade and commerce to a vital degree. I understand that if we established penny postage, the loss would be &#163;22,000 per annum. We used to pay &#163;75,000 per annum as subsidy. I take it that we do&#62; not intend to continue that payment. We are going in for the poundage rates. Probably the cost will be &#163;27,000 per annum. This will represent a saving of close upon &#163;40,000 per annum. So that if we pay . poundage rates instead of a subsidy, we shall be &#163;20,000 per&#39; annum better off than we were formerly - even if we have penny postage with England. If we can save that amount, we might very well go in for penny postage. </para>

              <para>- We already pay poundage to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#39;s boats, and I understand that we are making arrangements for the payment of poundage rates in the case of other boats. We pay 3s.7d. per pound to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam. Navigation Company&#39;s boats, which is a little over1d. per letter, and if we are to continue that payment we shall never be able to send letters to England at a charge of a penny for postage, because there would be a loss on sea freight alone. I think <inline font-style="italic">&#163;75</inline> a ton is a very fair freight to pay. </para>
