Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that your new system of assessing schools' needs takes no account of facilities such as rifle ranges, aerobics studios and equestrian centres, takes no account of school fees as high as $12,000 a year, takes no account of multimillion dollar donations and treats some millionaires as though they were poor?

The new system, for example, accommodates, in a way that the old system could never accommodate, for the fact that many independent schools in country areas of Australia have lived through the phenomenon of having had, 30 or 40 years ago, a far wealthier parent body than they now have, because of the changed circumstances in rural Australia. But, because of the historic funding formula that was entrenched in the ERI system adopted in 1985, those schools and those parents were unable to get additional assistance. In this whole debate, the difference between us and Labor is that we believe in choice. We do not believe that independent schools should be available only to a limited section of the Australian community. We believe people should be able to exercise the right of choice, and I totally reject the class driven claims of the Leader of the Opposition.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Salinity</title><page.no>21151</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>21151</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Prime Minister.

I am proud to say to the House that this is the biggest attempt at a national level by any government of any persuasion to do something serious about the salinity problem in Australia. For the first time, we have a national plan which seeks to mobilise state and federal governments, local communities and all of those who are concerned to leave to future generations of Australians not only a water quality but also a soil quality which reverses the deterioration of the past 200 years. We are putting to the states a plan, to be considered at the COAG meeting on 3 November, that over a seven-year period will involve a commitment by the federal government and the state governments of $1.5 billion. It will identify the 20 most affected catchment areas around Australia. It will develop in relation to each of those catchment areas an action plan involving not only the state governments but also the federal government and local communities. For the first time, we will have a plan of action for all governments and communities in Australia to do something about what everyone has known for a long time represents one of the most serious environmental challenges, if not the most serious environmental challenge, that this country faces.</para></talk.start><para>We must all be concerned about the fact that one-third of Australian rivers are now in a poor condition; that dryland salinity currently affects 2.5 million hectares, which is five per cent of the cultivated land area of Australia; that, without remedial action of the type I outlined today, this could expand to 12 million hectares; that land and water degradation is estimated to cost up to $3.5 billion a year; and that, if we do not do something about it, in 20 years time the drinking water of the city of Adelaide will be unfit for human consumption on two out of five days. The only way that you can address that problem is to have a national action planâsomething that this country has needed for years. I am proud that, building on what we did in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust and building on the other policy initiatives of my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, the coalition's environmental credentials have received another boost with the announcement that I have made today. </para><para>I would ask the state governments of Australia to join us in tackling this very serious environmental problem. I hope that they will put political differences aside. I hope that I can count as much on the support of the New South Wales Labor Premier as I can on the support of the Western Australian Liberal Premier, because this is a national problem that transcends political differences. This is a national problem that should have been tackled years ago. This government has summoned the political courage, the economic commitment and the environmental zeal to tackle this problem, and I hope it is endorsed by the premiers because, if they do so, they will be making a practical contribution to the restoration of the environment of Australia in an area which represents a very serious threat to the long-term environmental health of our nation.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Funding for Non-government Schools</title><page.no>21152</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>21152</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister.

I can inform the honourable member for Hinkler and all members of the House that the government's position with regard to the sale of Telstra is unchanged. The government has been open and up front with the Australian people, and the remaining shares in government hands will be disposed of at an appropriate time. I note that about an hour ago, at the Press Club, David Hale from Zurich Insurance was asked a question in respect of administration in Australia. He said that one of the things he would do is get bipartisan support for the sale of the rest of Telstra. He said that this is essential because the current ownership structure is depressing the share price, increasing the cost of Telstra, raising capital and limiting Telstra's ability to play a role in the region.</para></talk.start><para>The honest approach which the government takes contrasts starkly with that of the previous government. Labor's approach in government was to simply say they were not going to privatise something and then to flog it off.

This personal explanation raised more questions than it answered about the spokesman for privatisation's position on Labor's secret plan to break up and to sell off Telstra. In the statement, the honourable member for Melbourne confirmed that he met with Macquarie Bank and he confirmed that the structural separation of Telstra was discussed. What he did not state was his support for Labor's public position that no portion of Telstra would be privatised, and he did not disclose what he said to Macquarie Bank on Telstra. I looked at his words closely in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, and he said:</para><quote><para>At no stage in this meeting or in any other forum have I ever expressed support for further privatisation of Telstra.</para></quote><para>In his explanation, he ignored the fact that in his bookâand may I remind the House of his book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Open Australia</inline>âon page 179 he said the following:</para><quote><para>If the balance of Telstra is not sold, it may be desirable to restructure its core infrastructure functions into complete public ownership and fully privatise some of its service provision functions.</para></quote><para>He went on:</para><quote><para>Public money is more appropriately invested in the basic telecommunications network rather than the provision of particular niche services ...</para></quote><para>May I also remind the House of what the Leader of the Opposition said on 10 February 1999 in a doorstop.

Obviously, his ideas on a forum and mine differ somewhat. But I would have thought that his statements in print and clearly his discussions with the Leader of the Opposition on his idea to break up and sell off Telstra clearly constitutes a forum under any reasonable definition. The member for Melbourne continues to deceive and mislead. He has failed to clarify his position on Labor's secret plans to break up Telstra. He has refused to back Labor's public position that there would be no further privatisation of Telstra, that there would be no break up and sell-off of Telstra under a Labor government. He continues to defy the Leader of the Opposition.

Therefore, you need a funding system that more accurately measures the financial circumstances of parents than the old funding system. The old funding system, particularly in relation to parents in non-metropolitan areas, was clearly unfair and unreasonable. That is the view of not only the government but also the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Schools Association. Those who sit opposite seem incapable of getting into their heads the proposition that in the end it is the needs of parents that count more than some kind of rigid formula.</para></talk.start><para>The reality is that you can go to any independent school in Australiaâparticularly but not only some of the schools that have been mentioned by the Labor Party over the past few daysâand you will find thousands of parents who have made massive financial sacrifices in order to send their children to independent schools. That is a sacrifice and a choice that we believe should be recognised on an equitable basis, and that is the basis of our funding approach. Just as we fully support the right of people who are well-off to send their children to government schoolsâthat is their perfect rightâwe equally support the proposition that a funding formula that looks to the financial circumstances of parents rather than historic judgement about the wealth of schools is a far more equitable formula. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Government Policy: Privatisation</title><page.no>21154</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>21154</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Treasurer.

I can tell her that, no, the government has not altered its policy on privatisation. It intends to do precisely what it said to the electorate it would do before the election. In answer to the second part of the question, doing what you promised to the electorate at the time of the election when you were elected into government is a policy absolutely unprecedented. Certainly in fulfilling what we said to the Australian people before both the 1996 and the 1998 elections we are acting in an absolutely unprecedented way, because before this government came to office the Labor Party policy was always to promise one thing and do precisely the opposite. The Labor Party would always go out and deny that it had any privatisation plans until it launched a Pearl Harbor style attack on either a budget night or some subsequent occasion. Let me go through the evidence. On 17 September 1990, in relation to Qantas, the then transport minister, Kim Beazleyâcriticising the coalition, then in oppositionâsaid:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... the opposition would sell 100 per cent</para></quote><para>criticising us over Qantasâ</para><quote><para>... the position we are putting forward and which we are suggesting to conference, would sell around 49 per cent.</para></quote><para>May I ask the question: does Qantas still today have 49 per cent private ownership and government majority ownership? Who was it that privatised Qantas? It was the Labor Party; Mr Kim Beazley. The policy was then moved on in a higher plane to the Commonwealth Bank. Not only did the Labor Party promise that it would never privatise the Commonwealth Bank but in a letter dated 24 September 1993 to every investor in the Commonwealth Bank the then Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, wrote this, speaking of the Labor Party:</para><quote><para>The government has no intention whatsoever of further reducing its shareholding. The government is proud of the Commonwealth Bank's record and looks forward to the Commonwealth of Australia continuing as the bank's majority shareholder in the future.</para></quote><para>If a private promoter had put that out in a prospectus and then turned around and sold off all the shares, you would have the ASC down investigating and you would probably end up with some kind of conviction. And then we remember, notwithstanding that promise in 1993âand I will table that promiseâbudget night of 1995. As it turned out, Mr Willis was then the Treasurer and the now Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance. Having promised to every investor that the government would never sell down the government majority in the Commonwealth Bank in that famous budget where he promised he would produce a surplus and came in $10,300 million short, the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, said in relation to achieving a surplus:</para><quote><para>This is achieved by cuts to spending, increases in revenue, and asset sales, including part of the proceeds from the sale of the Government's remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank.</para></quote><para>The Labor Party backbench were not even told about that.

I say to the Labor Party backbench: it will happen again. You know it will happen again. You are not let into the secret until it is first cleared with the opposition. But I must say that there is one Labor Party member who fought this process all the way, who knew what was going on, who knew that the Labor tactic was always to say one thing on privatisation and do anotherâ </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kernot, Cheryl, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>âthat is, the lady who now interjectsâit was the member for Dickson.

There is no doubt that the partial sale of Telstra has delivered enormous benefits to the Australian community and created tens of thousands of jobs. About $990 million has been released into the community from the two tranches of the sale of Telstra to support a very wide range of projects. Some $250 million has gone into the Networking the Nation project which provides world-class telecommunications infrastructure for regional and rural Australians. We have seen $150 million allocated for untimed local calls in extended zones, which will allow even more young Australians to access the Internet without the burden of STD telephone rates, and we have seen $158 million go to the Building on IT Strengths program, including $78 million for incubators for young Australians to get their great information, technology and communications ideas to market. In September I announced in Tasmania a project worth $9.4 million to support skills development in the ecotourism and IT industries. This is going to help provide jobs to some 1,800 Tasmanians over the next four years.</para></talk.start><para>Just to show the great benefits of the partial privatisation of Telstra, I also draw attention to the fact that in Tasmania last week another project of great importance was launched by Senator Gibson and the Tasmanian Minister for Education, called Connecting Tasmanian Schools. This initiative is going to establish area networks linking government schools as well as provide additional computers and support equipment for both government and non-government schools in Tasmania. No wonder the Tasmanian Labor Premier, Mr Bacon, has called the privatisation of Telstra `a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity', because all these projects represent a very substantial investment in building communities and building opportunities in Australia. The Labor Party of course, which voted against and opposed all these initiatives, are showing that they are a party not committed to the kinds of community developments which this government believes in and which the partial privatisation of Telstra so far has permitted. The only question in everybody's mind is: can you believe Labor on this; will they do the same in office as they have done in opposition? We know the answer to that question. They say they will not, but they will.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employee Share Ownership Schemes: Potential for Abuse </title><page.no>21156</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>21156</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Treasurer.

Government members who contributed to a report released yesterday on employee share ownership advocated no such thing as legalising bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It is a totally false allegation and, frankly, you ought to know better. As I said earlier, I must say I am totally bewildered by the Australian Labor Party's position. On the one hand they go to their conference and say they want to promote employee share ownership, and then on the other hand they come in here and engage in useless, childish ploysâlike those engaged in by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who asks, `Did you take advice from the Remuneration Planning Corporation'â </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The bottom-of-the-harbour schemes were artificial schemesâif I can go back through a bit of tax historyâand the view was taken at that time that no sooner had you taken one such scheme to court than somebody would amend it in some particular way and make it legal. So the government at that particular time decided to change the tax law and introduced general anti-avoidance provisions. I believe it was the then Treasurer who did that. The general anti-avoidance provisions say that it does not matter whether you engineer things from this kind of structure to that kind of structureâif your dominant purpose is to get a tax break of some kind or another, the scheme can be struck down and tax can be assessed on the basis of what would be the transaction otherwise. Those provisions were inserted into the law so that such schemes could be attacked under general anti-avoidance provisions.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The commissioner's advice, as I said before, in relation to abusive employee schemesânot all schemes, but abusive employee schemes where the dominant purpose is a tax benefitâis that they will be found contrary to the law. That is the way in which he proposes to attack them. Those are the steps that he takes. That is why the provision is actually in the law. </para><para>I know that the Labor Party has a lot of trouble with tax policy. The Labor Party has sat in opposition in this parliament now for five years; what was its big tax policy? The `r word'âa word which it cannot now even pronounce. Let's say it for them: `roll-back'. In order to try to disguise the absolute lack of policy, they run around making false accusations.</para><para>I want to finish on this point. As far as this side of parliament is concerned, we actually want to encourage share ownership. We believe that employees should be able to own shares. We do not think you should lock employees up and have union bosses tell them what to join and how to think. We think you should give them a go in the company. We are pleased that Australia now has the highest per capita share ownership in the world. The only thing I can say to the Labor Party is that, if they want to encourage it further, they should get on with their policy to privatise Telstra.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Performance</title><page.no>21157</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>21157</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to the Treasurer.

This is not just an improvement in one or two ports; this is an improvement right across the board and in particular in the big ports in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Fremantle, where of course the reform process has been a long hard road to achieve.

The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party's policy of the abolition of the secondary boycott provisions and the encouragement of industry wide bargaining would return Australia to the bad old days. Not even Bob Carr, a Labor Premier, wants to go back to the bad old days. Even Bob Carr, a Labor Premier, can see the benefits of this reform not just for New South Wales but for the country as a whole.

It came to my notice because a member of the Department of Finance and Administration approached my personal assistant and asked her whether or not I was still using my telecard. She said, `No, he isn't.' She asked me about it, and I had not used my card for some time. I can advise the House that what had transpired was that a person at Telstra was looking at my accountâhe knew my name, obviously, because of my public dutiesâand came to the conclusion that there was no way known that a federal minister could make such phone calls. He was referring in particular to the period 1 January 1999 to 30 August when he made contact with us. Just to give you a sense of it, he sent an email to DOFA, which gave me a copy, which said that in the nine-month period to 30 August there were 619 calls to Malaysia, 448 calls from Singapore, 317 calls to Singapore, 389 calls from various mobile phones and 478 calls from various countries back to Australiaâ2,301 calls in total costing $9,100.45. So my immediate reaction was: obviously I have not been using the card, obviously this card has fallen into the wrong hands, as it were, and there was unauthorised use.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On that day I had someone from my office ring DOFA after I had seen that material and had been advised accordingly and we said to DOFA, `The minister has not been using it; obviously there should be a full inquiry by the department.' As we later were told, there were 11,000 calls roughly from approximately 900 locations. I was advised of that in about April. I certainly had a long discussion with DOFA and gave them all the information I had. As a consequence of that which, as I best understand it from DOFA, had sort of brought their investigations to a certain level, I advised the Prime Minister and said that I thought the matter should go to the police. In terms of my knowledge of this prior to 30 August, the fact is that, like many members, I certainly had a telecard. It was issued to me in the early 1990s. I stopped using it when I got a mobile phone, which I think was around 1994, and basically never gave any further consideration to the telecard.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brereton, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brereton</name></talker><para>âWhat about the accounts? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WI4</name.id><name role="display">Mr REITH</name></talker><para>âIn respect of the accounts, the senators and members handbook in 1996 and some of the other handbooks around that time that I have looked at say specifically, `Costs for telephone charge card use will appear on electorate office telephone accounts as a single line showing the number of calls and total costs.'

That is basically the only conversation I ever had with him about it. The best we can ascertain is that over five years his usage was to the value of about $950. As soon as I became aware of that, as is the normal case with other people where there has been expenditure outside the entitlement, I repaid the money. Should I have given him the card? No, I do not think I should have. That is a fact. I had not appreciated that he had used it. The irony of it is that, for a lot of the phone calls that he made to home, if he had made them on a reverse charge, this would not have come up. But it has come up. As has been advised, the matter is with the police. That is the proper place for it to be.

An efficient, effective and dynamic waterfront is absolutely essential if our country is going to achieve its full potential as an export nation. We all have memories of the horrors of the docksâthe holding up of farm exports and, indeed, the whole of the trade of our nation, under the previous government. During the life of the previous government, 25 per centâa quarterâof all industrial disputes on the waterfront in the world were on Australian waterfronts. A quarter of the whole world's supply of industrial disputes was on our waterfront, even though we had only one per cent of trade. </para></talk.start><para>Fortunately, that is being turned around. The laughing stock of Australian industrial relations, the embarrassment to our country, is now being turned around with this improved performance in grain handling facilities and with greater reliability of dock space for vessels when they arrive. Our ports are becoming more reliable. Since a significant proportion of our exports, including farm exports, leave in containers, that is very good news for Australian farmers. Around $1 billion worth of our wine exports leave in containers; half a billion dollars worth of rice, $2 billion worth of wool, significant quantities of dairy products and grains, $1Â½ billion worth of cotton and $2 billion worth of veal and other meat are now able to move more smoothly and more effectively across the waterfront. I would like to congratulate the minister on his achievements in taking on the tough fight on the waterfront. He took them on. Now there is a culture change on our waterfront. We still have some distance to goâthere are still more reforms to be undertakenâbut there has been a culture change on the waterfront. No longer do people turn up to work for the union or when the union thinks they ought to be there. They now recognise that they have a task to do and they want to do it efficiently and well. So this change certainly represents a significant improvement. It will boost our nation's export competitiveness and give our farmers a chance to trade freely and fairly around the world. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Refugee Week</title><page.no>21163</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>21163</page.no><name role="metadata">Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr THEOPHANOUS</name><name.id>QJ4</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.

It would have made it the record program under any government over decades. That is not something we hear praised by the member for Calwell. I do not suppose I would expect him to praise it.

There is an international crisis in relation to the way in which resources are applied and the demands that are being placed on developed countries like Australia through the asylum system. One ought not to use the fact that amongst some asylum seekers there are refugees to disguise the obsceneâand I use that word deliberatelyâmisuse of resources in developed countries like Australia to deal with asylum claims in comparison to the needs of people who are refugees around the world.</para><para>When honourable members understand, as the international community is starting to understand, that developed countries like Australia spend something like $10 billion a year through sophisticated, elaborate and jurisprudential models for determining asylum claimsâthat is, as the member for Bowman says, doing justice, and that justice gives people the opportunity to exploit every opportunity to test their claims in Australiaâit means that in comparison the 50,000 or so genuine refugees amongst half a million asylum seekers in developed countries use up something like $10 billion worth of resources and yet the UNHCR, to look after the world's 22.7 million refugees and people of concern, has only $1 billion. If the UNHCR had to use our systems to determine who were refugees, it would need something like $440 billion to be able to go through the process.</para><para>We would be able, if we made savings of 10 per cent in what we spend in dealing with asylum claims, to double what we spend in supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I suspect that, even out of this Minister for Finance and Administration, I might have been able to get a little bit of a dividend if I had been able to deliver those savings. But I make the point: if the international community could save one-tenth, we could double the UNHCR's budget to $2 billion. Instead of having the situation where we spend something like 11c a day on looking after a refugee in Africa, we would be able to put resources into supporting them more effectively, instead of the hundreds of dollars a day we have to spend in assessing, in relation to people who are here for long periods of time, asylum claims in this country. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: School Fees</title><page.no>21165</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21165</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs.

This puts them in dramatic contrast to the policies which the Labor Party pursued when in office. No party in fact has done more to force school fees up than the Labor Party. The fundamental fallacy of the position that is being put by the Labor Party is that, when parents work hard to build up the resources and facilities at a school, support for those parents should fall and that school fees should be forced to rise so that that school becomes less and less accessible. This government believe that, when parents make an effort to invest in education, we should widen access to that school to give more parents the opportunity to educate their children using those facilities.</para></talk.start><para>In New South Wales, this aversion to choice in education appears, today, to be driving education policy. We have seen comments from Dr Ken Boston, the highly paid official of the Carr Labor government, who has implemented policies designed to restrict access to non-government schools and ratchet up fees, apparently in an effort to prevent the continuing outflow of students from government schools in that state. I would have to say that I think that Dr Boston's contribution has been little short of scandalously inaccurate and unprecedented for a professional public servant. One can only speculate about his real motives.</para><para>Under Dr Boston and Mr Aquilina, 20,000 students have left the New South Wales government schools system over the last four years. The New South Wales government is consistently underfunding government schools in that state. In the last budget the Commonwealth government, the Howard government, increased funding for government schools in New South Wales by over four per cent, whereas in the Carr government's budget funding increased by less than two per cent. Some 50 per cent of all the capital expenditure on government schools in New South Wales is coming from the Commonwealth at the moment. In New South Wales the Carr government makes the lowest contribution to building up the capital stock, the buildings, of government schools of any mainland state government. Dr Boston has presided over 18 months of teacher disputes, strikes and 20 lost-teacher days while at the same time pocketing, one would have to say, a lucrative $20,000 bonus from the New South Wales government for his services. That works out at about $1 for every student who has left the government schools sector. Whether it was provided by the New South Wales Treasury or not, I do not know, but we can look to the next bonus with some degree of trepidation.</para><para>New South Wales has now instituted a review of non-government school funding policies. It has cut money from the non-government schools on a totally unjustifiable ground of the EBA. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reports this morning:</para><quote><para>Fear of retaliation by the State Government will stop many private schools reducing their fees ...</para></quote><para>In other words, the natural tendency of the Commonwealth's policies to push down school fees is being deliberately undermined by the Labor Party government in New South Wales. It is no different in this approach to high school fees than the Labor Party when it was in office federally; all its policies were designed to make schools less accessible. That was the reason why you failed to fund new low fee schools at their appropriate level of need. That is why, since this government abolished the new schools policy, some 113 new low fee schools have opened, which would never have opened under your policy. </para><para>This government believes in school choice. We believe that people are entitled to build up the resources of schools and that they should not be punished for that. This government approach is to encourage parent choice. The policies of the Labor Party are designed to undermine parent choice and to drive up the fees facing all parents at all schools.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business: Telecard</title><page.no>21166</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>21166</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question again is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, and I refer to his previous answer.

I note that unemployment in the Parramatta region peaked at no less than 20.7 per cent in February 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Trainingâa job which he described at the time as a `poison chalice'. Unemployment in Parramatta was 13 per cent in March 1996. I am sure all members of the House will be delighted to know that unemployment in Parramatta is now just 3.4 per cent thanks to the policies of the Howard government, and those policies of course include Work for the Dole. Since November 1997, there have been 14 Work for the Dole projects in Parramatta, which have given nearly 500 job seekers valuable work experience in things like environmental restoration, working with community groups and boosting local facilities. </para></talk.start><para>I have just become aware of a new Work for the Dole proposal in Parramatta to restore 42 hectares of degraded bushland which is part of the Vineyard Creek catchment. This proposal has the support of the local catchment committee. It has the support of nearby Macquarie Boys Technology High School. It has the support of local community work coordinators. The only group which does not support this proposal is Parramatta City Council under the leadership of the Left faction Labor Lord Mayor. In fact, what we are seeing here is a bit of a family feud inside Labor's ruling class. You have the member for Batman saying that community groups should participate in Work for the Dole and you have his brother, the member for Reid, who has vetoed participation by his factional acolytes on Parramatta City Council. There is hope for the Vineyard Creek project and for other community initiatives in Parramatta. The Labor Lord Mayor has been replaced, so I now call on Parramatta City Council to participate in Work for the Dole and give Parramatta job seekers a fair go.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nursing Homes: Uncertified Quality Assessors</title><page.no>21167</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>21167</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Aged Care.

This government has undermined a fundamental principle, an educational and equity principle, put in place by the Australian Labor Party when we legislated for the first time funding directly to schools on a per capita student basis back in the mid-1970s under Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister and my father as minister for education.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister likes to point out that, during the 1960s, the Menzies government put forward propositions for science labs in schools. As important as those science labs are, they were bagatelles in the expense of conducting education in the private sector. They were there for Menzies not so much to do something serious about the needs or the equity problems associated with the then some 25 per cent of Australians who sent their kids to private schools but to embarrass the Labor Party politically.</para><para>It took the Labor Party's coming to office, with its commitment to education and its commitment to access and equity opportunities, to actually put in place direct fundingâreal choice for working-class Australians on whether or not they would find themselves in private schools. It was us; we did it. And you opposed it. The Liberal Party opposed the Labor Party's position. They opposed it in the Senate. They opposed it in the House. Fraser, the Liberal Party education spokesperson, sat across the table from my father and said that we would not get our bill and we would not get assistance on this basis with private schools. What was their position? Their position was that, whether you went to Geelong Grammar or Our Lady of Lourdes School, you should get exactly the same per capita funding basis. </para><para>The Prime Minister stands in here and prances about, lecturing us on needs based funding, whilst he moves the system decisively in the direction that they wanted in the mid-1970s, which was to treat a child who goes to a school with the massive resources of Geelong Grammar the same as a kid who goes to school with the utterly inadequate resources of the average Catholic parochial schoolâor, for that matter, the average parochial school, be they associated with a Catholic religion or any otherâin this country. That was their position then, and a decisive shift is taking place now in the same direction.</para><para>There is an interesting debating point being made by George Bush in the American presidential campaign, and I intend from this point until the day of the next election to shamelessly plagiarise it. Bush hasâI think in all probability inaccuratelyâcharacterised the situation in the United States as an education recession. He said the Americans were experiencing an education recession. They may or may not be, but there is no doubt about it here. There is an education recession in this country. The Commonwealth public commitment to education is falling, and we are the only nation in the industrialised world where that is happening.</para><para>It is possible that that position might actually come back into equilibrium over the next four years. Why? Because of the loot being ladled out to the category 1 schools. That is not an education decision but a class decision. At least part of decent education policy has to be about access and opportunity for those who cannot necessarily afford it from within their own means, and choice and freedom of conscience is closely bound up in all of that. Proper needs based funding is essential to ensure that that actually takes place. That is an education principle. Shifting resources into schools with the dimensions of Geelong Grammar and ripping it out of the state system on the way through is not an educational principle but a class principle.</para><para>I have nothing against parents who send their children to the King's Schools and the Geelong Grammarsânothing at all. They love their kids just as much as anyone who sends their kids to public schools, or to parochial schools, or to Christian schools, or to Muslim schools, or to Greek schools, or to Jewish schoolsâall of those schools that got funding when the Labor Party was an office and did not get a brass razoo from Liberal governments. They care just as much for their children as the parents of the kids that go there, but they have the resources to care even more. They have the resources to pay $11,000 a year fees, $12,000 a year fees. The minister got up and said one of these schools has in fact lowered the fees on the basis of what the minister has doneâlowered them from $11,000 a year to $10,800 a year. The working class will be marching through the portals of that school in droves on the basis of that reductionâthere is no doubt about that at all!

We did say that it is not unreasonable for some small contribution to be made to the schools where the parents of those kids pay 11 grand a year. We said that it was reasonable for some small amount to be paid in. We thought: they are paying taxes; that ought to be done. Every kid was entitled to some degree of public subvention. But that act of generosity that produced a level of fundingâwhich the Prime Minister at the start of this debate had approved but has now abandonedâhas been taken to the nth degree by this government. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The term `category 1 school' needs some explanation here in this chamber. I thought I might take a Western Australian example, just so at least those people in my home state can understand exactly who is getting these resources. If you start up Stirling Highway from Fremantle you will see on your right Methodist Ladies College and Christ Church Grammar Schoolâbeautiful buildings, beautiful fields. They are not category 1 schools. Then you continue onto the South Perth freeway into South Perth and you will see Wesley College and in the neighbouring suburb of Kensington its sister college, Penrhos. You will see magnificent arts resources, particularly in Penrhos, magnificent playing fields, but they are not category 1 schools. You can then go further down the highway to Salter Point, to Aquinas, and you can see magnificent playing fields in a great school, but it is not category 1. Then you can turn back up the Great Eastern Highway and head out through historic Guildford and you will see magnificent historical buildings, beautiful playing fields on the banks of a river, but it is not a category 1 school. If they are not category 1 schools, what are?</para><para>What we find here is one of those category 1 schoolsâGeelong Grammarâunder this new government formula, not in the top 50-odd schools in this country. I strongly suspect that they would deny they are outside the top 10âand, if you actually listened to one or two of the graduates of Geelong Grammar, they would deny that they are below the top one. On this government's formula, Geelong Grammar is at 217. Why is it? It is for this reason, I say to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who is at the tableâand it does not matter whether the ERI formula needed to be changed or not; anything that is in place for a period of time probably needs reform. But you supported that, right through the 1980s and early nineties. It is because your formula takes no account of the fees paid; $11,000 is irrelevant in your formula. It takes no account of the facilities which are there, facilities such as those at Geelong College: two magnificent ovals, an all-weather synthetic hockey field and tennis, netball, basketball and squash courts. In addition, there is the new recreation centre, featuring a 25-metre indoor swimming pool, with eight lanes for FINA standards, a separate diving pool, a fully equipped gymnasium with a weights room and an aerobic studio. All this was paid for, no doubt, by generous donations. Again, no account was taken of that in your funding formula. No account was taken of any endowment or private income associated with that school. None of that features in the formula in any way whatsoever. That is why the very wealthiest schools in this country are now going from a reasonable contribution, given the fact that their parents pay taxes, of about 13 per cent of average government school costs up to about 40 per cent of government school costs now. All those things are eliminated from the formula.</para><para> They say that they are supported by all in the private sector. I would encourage everybody in the private sector to support whatever government is inâyour job is to get on with education. Take what you get and get on with that. Do not worry about the politics; leave it to the politicians. But no person has been more vehemently verballed in this place than has the Deputy Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission, Father Tom Doyle. When Father Tom Doyle was appearing before the Senate committeeâremember that he said `We accept the formula of the government' in one of the answers that the Prime Minister gaveâhe said:</para><quote><para>We would still maintain that the SES model in itself is not sufficient and that it needs modification ...</para><para>					...			...			...</para><para>That is where we talk about SES plus things like resource indicatorsâ</para></quote><para>I ask myself whether it was from the old education resource indexâ</para><quote><para>and resource availabilities. The pure SES model does not allow for that anomaly.</para></quote><para>We are now seeing how much that anomaly is, because when Tom Doyle was speaking I bet he did not know at that time that the massive amount of funding money that was going in to King's School and the other schools was going in so disproportionately. We have heard of those enormous amounts going inâup to $2,000 extra per pupil for Geelong Collegeâwhen the Tyndale Christian School at Blacktown got an extra $144; Our Lady of Mercy College, a low fee Catholic school in Parramatta, had no increase whatsoever; Our Lady of Lebanon High School, a low fee Maronite school in nearby Harris Park, where the working class are going, got $163 per pupil; and the St George College in Adelaide got an extra $253, one-eighth of that received by schools like Geelong Grammar. What has been happening here is a massive undermining of the needs based principle, which is the only educational principle on which this distribution of funds ought to be made. It is a deliberate undermining of the principleâan undermining that has been concealed as this minister resisted every effort, until he could do so no longer, to tease out from him what exactly it was he was doing for the wealthiest private schools in this country. </para><para>The Catholic system happens to cover 70 per cent of the young people in private schools here. You say they accept your system: the Catholic school system is out of it. They do not distribute funds and resourcesâand you have agreed to itâon the basis of your SES model, which they believe is deeply flawed and would result in injustices inside their system if they were to apply it. But you apply it to the other 30 per cent. They have opted out and made a sacrifice to do soâ70 per cent of the kids in private schoolsâbut you apply it elsewhere and to the detriment of the public school system and the education system overall. Your policy, Minister, is based on class, not on education. It is based on making up for your bitterness at having lost the battle in the middle of the seventies on the issue of a needs based principle. You have undermined it, you have wasted positively millions of education dollars in doing so, and we are going to pursue you right down to the next election on it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>21172</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Dr David, MP</name><name role="display">Dr KEMP</name><name.id>BT4</name.id><electorate>Goldstein</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe can see why the Leader of the Opposition has no credibility in the education debate from that pathetic address. Here we have seen the Leader of the Opposition desperately defending a system which has been abandoned by everyone who was subject to it in the non-government sector. It is very sad to hear the Leader of the Opposition trying to explain category 1 when category 1 has got three months to go and when everyone recognises that category 1 is part of a totally misleading and corrupt system, because that system has been manipulated by Labor again and again over the years. </para></talk.start><para>This matter of public importance highlights the absolute hypocrisy of the Labor Party. Labor's view of schooling has been to continue to drive up school fees wherever parents make a contribution. The Leader of the Opposition says he cares about the parents at all schools. He only cares until they show that they are prepared to make an effort to build up the resources of those schools, and then, under his funding system, once they have equipped their school, he comes in and slashes their funding. And what do they do? They are forced to put up fees, to narrow access to their school.</para><para>That is the way Labor's system worked for 15 years, and it is a sad commentary on the Leader of the Opposition that he stands up in this House and attempts to defend a system which is narrowing access to well resourced schools in the private sector. Let me say it did not exclude everybody from access, because people like Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, Kim Beazley, Simon Crean and Graham Richardson all accessed those schoolsâeven though Labor's policy was pushing up fees. Our policy gives many more parents and families the chance to enjoy the opportunities which the Labor leadership claimed for themselves. Our policy is designed to provide a downward pressure on fees at schools which are well resourced.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has a very bad record in education. When he was Minister for Education 30 per cent of young people could not read and write properly, and he did nothing about it. When he attempted to devise an education policy at the last election it was so bad that his shadow minister for education resigned and still sits on the back bench. He has no grasp of these issues. If we pursue the logic of what he is sayingâthat somehow or other we should not be taking into account the needs of families and parents but we should be taking into account the grounds, buildings, gymnasium and swimming pool to decide who is going to get access to those schoolsâthe inevitable consequence of his policy is going to be to narrow access. If ever you want to see a class based education policy, that is it. It means that well resourced schools become the privilege of the rich and the Labor leadership, and everybody else is shut out. </para><para>Let me ask the Leader of the Opposition what he thinks is fair funding for this school; let me just give the Leader of the Opposition an example of a school with significant resources. It is a school with its own purpose-built drama complex, complete with stage, curtains, sound and lighting facilities, and it has a college camp site set on 20 acres of land at Lake Eppalock to provide students with the privilege of an annual camp at the modern ski lodge type facility; two 25-seat minibuses to facilitate the school's extensive camping and sports programs; a modern, well-equipped gymnasium which caters for a wide range of both winter and summer sports, including full-sized basketball and netball courts, three volleyball courts, indoor soccer and cricket, as well as maintained gymnastics equipment; a 20-metre indoor heated pool which allows students to undertake swimming as a subject during PE and sports sessions and is also available to students at lunchtime; and four classrooms full of computers, as well as 12 computers in the library available to students. What is a fair funding level for a school with resources like that? Do you think a school like that sounds like a category 1 school that should be funded at 13.7 per cent of the average government school cost?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Beazley</name></talker><para>âIt sounds more like Aquinas.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Dr David, MP</name><name role="display">Dr KEMP</name></talker><para>âMore like Aquinas. Let us just see how serious the opposition are about taking resources into account. That school will be funded at 100 per cent of the average cost of educating a child at a government school. In 2004 the parents at that school could receive an estimated $8,172 for every secondary school student compared with the King's School in that year which will receive only $2,500 per studentâthat is $8,172 versus $2,500.

Are we saying that the resources of this school should affect the funding for that school? Are we saying that somehow or other this school should be accessed only by the wealthy, or should everyone have access to this school? Of course our view is that there should be the widest possible access. What is this school? Is this school an exceptional school? Is it Melbourne High School? Is it North Sydney Boys High? Probably the member for Calwell might recognise it if he were in the House because this school is Erinbank Secondary College in Broadmeadows in Melbourne's north-west. This is a government school, funded under government schooling policies, which provides outstanding resources to its students.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But the Leader of the Opposition applies a double standard. In the public sector resources have no impact but, if parents build those facilities, that school should be solely for the richâwe should not provide support to those parents. They pay taxes, but he does not even grasp the argument because he is totally out of his depth in this area. He thought it was a private school; he thought it was Aquinas. He did not even recognise it as a government school. That is because an accurate description of the government's policy has never passed his lips. He uses this rhetoric: `This is a policy which rips resources out of government schools.'</para><para>Well, what does it do for government schools? Over the next four years this policy provides government schools with an extra $1.4 billion. This year government schools are receiving $402 million more than they received when Labor was in office. Government school funding has gone up 26 per cent under this government. This is a policy that he represents as ripping money out of government schools. This is a man who is living in fantasy land. He seems to spend his evenings sipping chardonnay with the officials of the Australian Education Union who feed him these lines and he comes into the House trying to sell these lines. For heaven's sake, get your staff to do an analysis of what the government's policy is actually about. Try to get some logic into what you are saying about school funding policy. </para><para>The irony is that the Leader of the Opposition gets up in this chamber and says that our funding system is unfair, when everyone who is subject to it says that it is fair and when they are urging the opposition to pass this bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Beazley</name></talker><para>âNo, they don't!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Dr David, MP</name><name role="display">Dr KEMP</name></talker><para>âI do not know who advises the Leader of the Opposition, but everything he says is so inaccurate that you cannot place any weight on it. Let us go straight to the National Catholic Education Commission. The Leader of the Opposition has just interjected and said that they do not support the government's legislation. The first sentence of the press release issued by the National Catholic Education Commission on the government's bill is the following:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The Senate should pass the State Grants Bill 2000 intact.</para></quote><para>`Intact.'

Dr Boston has presided over, with the Carr government, the most unsuccessful education policy in Australia. If you measure the success of the education policy of those who run the government schools by the attitude of parents, then there is no state system in Australia which has a greater vote of no confidence against it than the New South Wales government system, with 20,000 students leaving that system in the last four years. </para><para>The reasons for this are several. Dr Boston has failed to persuade the Carr government to invest properly in building up the school buildings and the equipment of government schools in New South Wales. There is no state government on mainland Australia that relies so heavily on the Commonwealth government for the money it puts into building up government schools. Government schools in New South Wales have received increases over the last four years of some $121 million from the Commonwealth and yet Dr Boston, supposedly a responsible school official, has written that the Commonwealth government is cutting funding to government schools in New South Wales. That is totally false, and it shows that when you get a fair, objective, non-political basis for funding schools according to the needs of students it goes very deeply to the heart of Labor's left wing ideology.</para><para>In the end, they hate parent choice. All that Labor has ever come up with to try to defend public schooling in this country it to stop parents, particularly low income parents, choosing the school that they want for their children. They have not bothered about raising literacy standards, they do not worry about proper reporting to parents, they do not worry about broadening the senior curriculum with proper vocational courses. All they say is, `We'll protect you union officials in the government school sector by stopping people leaving the sector. We'll shut the doors; we'll stop new schools from being properly funded at their level of need. We won't fund the Catholic parish schools at their level of need.

A quote from thousands of years ago captures you and your government to a tee. Include the Prime Minister and the cabinet and what an evil little oligarchy we have. And of course there are plenty of other historical precedents, for instance, Roman emperor Honorius on 10 August in the year 410. Do you remember him, when King Alaric and 100,000 Visigoths came down with their bronzed battering rams to the walls of Rome? The Catholic popes of the late Renaissance, Louis XVI of France, Tsar Nicholas of tsarist Russia, Fritz von Papen in the then soon to be Nazi Germany: there is nothing original in this, Minister. In four short years you have transformed yourself: you have gone from the election platform of governing for all Australiansâwhich you went to the people on in 1996âto openly supporting the privileged to the detriment of the polis, the public.</para><para>This minister and this Prime Minister seem extremely keen on reversing the accepted concepts of choice and equity. Perhaps their arguments might have a smidgin of credibility if in fact choice and equity were a viable choice in an increasing rather than a decreasing number of Australian families. In this so-called strong Australian economy we are fast approaching the rich/poor divide noted in the failed oligarchies of the past. On top of seven per cent unemployed we have seven per cent underemployed, seven per cent hidden unemployed, seven per cent in full-time work but who are living in poverty and 22 per cent of our work force casually and precariously employed. That adds up to 50 per cent of the available work force. Are $11,000 fees a choice for these families? I think not. </para><para>This minister must live in a cocooned world, oblivious to what is happening around him. Like the United States, we are increasing the number of low skill and low productivity jobs. What is revealed about choice in the United States is mirrored in this country. Over the last 20 years the number of people earning high wages has fallen from 28 per cent to 21 per cent; the number of people earning middle ranging wagesâthose aspirational votersâhas fallen from 37 per cent to 16 per cent; and the number of those on low wages has grown from 35 per cent to 63 per cent. This information is from Dr Linda Barrington, a labour economist, of the Conference Board. Extending choice, Minister? Codswallop! Bulldust! Just plain and ordinary misrepresentation of the truth. That is your game.</para><para>And what about equity for families whose children have debilitating conditions like cerebral palsy, who require attention for 24 hours a day? What about equity for families of children whose behaviour is so extreme and dysfunctional that it wrecks relationships and physically destroys homes? What about equity for families of children who are at risk of committing suicide? What about equity for families who are at risk of severe substance abuse? What about equity for children who are at risk of being physically, sexually and emotionally abused? And what about equity for children who go to school hungry, come home hungry and who are inadequately fed, clothed and housed? Can't you see that in your own state? You see it in the main streets of Melbourne. Minister, is the giving of millions of dollars to the most privileged people in the country, whilst ignoring your fellow Australian families in desperate need your definition of equity? The intent of this minister is evil.</para><para>This minister gets up in this chamber and states that his model of SES funding for the non-government school has the overwhelming support of the private school communityâthat is what you said just a while ago. But it ain't necessarily so. Jeff Kennett used to say that about business in Victoria until they were sick of his high-handed, selective, dictatorial exclusions, and they worked to remove him much sooner than any pundit ever predicted. </para><para>I come from South Australia where there has generally been a productive relationship between public and private schools; it has been a good relationship. That is doomed by the actions of this governmentâand they are the words of the non-government sector. I have had many principals write to me supporting the passage of the states grants bill and, as you would expect, parroting your words from second reading speechesâwith one exception, and I will come to him later. I decided to ring them instead of writing because, as a former school principal, I know many of these people. I have worked with them; I have known some of these people for over 30 years. All but two took my call. They begged me not to name them or their schools, except one. I agreed I would never do it, but nevertheless I wrote down pertinent parts of the discussions, of the phone calls. Without exception noneânot oneâwould defend or support the outlandish funding for the elite schools. Not one. All agreedâthey are not stupidâthat it was just a tricky transfer from public school funding via the enrolment benchmark adjustment. That is not what you are telling this parliament, Minister. </para><para>And what else did they say? They said: `Pushing the envelope too far'; `I fear the inevitable backlash which unfortunately for us will have just cause'; `Advantaging non-government schools with funds from a discredited financial arrangement like the EBA and then denying it does not come from public schools is indefensible'; `I am very comfortable'âin my schoolâ`financially. I am very, uncomfortable morally'; `My parent body would sack me if they knew my real views'; `Dr Kemp presents arguments that are a real threat to Australian democracy as we know it'; `Rewarding the elite schools at the obvious expense of public education will fool no-one'; `It encourages all to play a game. Unfortunately some non-government schools are better equipped to play the game than others'; `To advantage the privileged against the needy is to deny God's teachings'; `The <inline font-style="italic">Bible</inline> tells us we cannot worship God and money at the same time'; `This funding regime will push the more difficult to educate children'âthe real test of competent teachersâ`to poorer and less resourced schools'. And we should all worry about that. And, finally, `There is no encouragement at all for schools to have low fees'. That is not an overwhelming endorsement, Minister. There was one principal who did not want his comments on the record, and I seek leave to table his comments without identifying his name and his school. </para><para>Leave not granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name></talker><para>âOkay, I will read it.

I am very angry about the attack the opposition have waged on public schools and non-government schools in Australia. They are the ones who are divisive. They are the ones who are undermining the confidence in public schools throughout Australia. They have embarked on a campaign of misinformation, untruths and hypocrisy in these arguments. When I came into this parliament nearly five years ago, I expected that debate would be well researched, based on factual information and based on what people truly believed when they came into this parliament. But this debate that the opposition have waged on education is nothing about those principles; they have no principles. They have used misinformation and untruths throughout. The facts are that the Commonwealth government is spending more on government schools than ever beforeâthese are factsâthat Commonwealth spending on government schools will rise by 21 per cent over the next four years, and that this year the Commonwealth government is spending $402 million more on government schools than in 1996, an increase of 26 per cent. Yet you hear the opposition saying that we are ripping money out of the government schools. All those comments are doing is undermining the confidence of parents and teachers in government schools. The school system in Australia is a good system. All that the opposition comments do is undermine the confidence in government schools. They also undermine the confidence the teachers have in government schools. Government schools are privileged to have many hardworking and dedicated teachers, but they never get any support from the likes of the Labor opposition.</para></talk.start><para>One of the things which is dishonest in the opposition's argument is when they compare dollar figures about extra funding that goes into government schools and non-government schools. It is one of the things that the shadow minister often likes to doâthat is, to compare dollar figuresâand the Prime Minister picked him up on it yesterday, saying it was a totally dishonest argument. You must remember that state governments are the main funders of government schools; it is their responsibility. The state governments fund 85 per cent of the cost of running government schools. If we have a problem with government schools, as we do in many areas of New South Wales, we should be talking to and working with the state governments and finding out what the problems are. The Labor opposition should be asking the state governments, particularly in New South Wales, what they are doing to resource government schools. There is a problem in many areas of New South Wales with resources for government schools, but it is not for lack of funding from the Commonwealth government. What is the New South Wales government doing to resource government schools? That is a question I never hear from the Labor opposition in the federal parliament. </para><para>The two million government school students in this country are supported by an annual budget of combined Commonwealth-state government money of around $13.4 billion. The one million non-government students are supported by public funding of about $3.7 billion. We have two well-funded and well-resourced systems of education in Australia, and that is something the Labor opposition should be trying to support. They should be looking at ways to encourage the system that has worked well for Australia, not trying to divide the community and run down particularly government schools. I mentioned the New South Wales state government. They certainly have not answered any of the questions we have put forward about resourcing and why the money that the Commonwealth is providing is not going to the government schools in New South Wales. There are many schools in my electorate that are desperately under resourced, and it is not for lack of funding from the Commonwealth government. We cannot get answers out of the New South Wales government.</para><para>I want to make some comments, as the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs did earlier, about this outrageous article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>of Tuesday, 10 October written by Dr Ken Boston, who is a public servant and Director-General of Education and Training in New South Wales. He should be the one asking questions of the New South Wales government about where the funding is for New South Wales schools. I understand that he has distributed this article to all the schools in New South Wales and asked the teachers and headmasters to circulate it. The article itself is totally untrue. Dr Ken Boston wrote: </para><quote><para>Under the EBA, the Commonwealth reduces funding for government schools as the proportion of enrolments in non-government schools increases. NSW has already lost $21 million as a result ...</para></quote><para>This is a total untruth coming from the Director-General of Education and Training in New South Wales. He is prepared to go out and continue to produce these untruths about money coming from state schools and being put into private schools. He should be asking questions of the New South Wales government. There is a lot of support in the community for this new proposal. I quote from Heather and David McAlpine from Victoria:</para><quote><para>As a family already electing to educate our children in an Independent School, we note with interest the imminent presentation to the Senate of the proposed SES education funding legislation. We consider the successful passage of this proposed legislation as <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">absolutely essential</inline> in order to retain at least some choice in education for families in <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">regional</inline> Australia.</para></quote><para>That is just one quote from the quotes of many people who support the passage of this legislation. The Labor Party have waged an outrageous campaign of misinformation, trying to divide the community with class warfare. The Labor Party do not seem to want to give parents the choice of how they might give their children what they perceive as the best education, whether that be in a government school or a non-government school. The ultimate hypocrisy of the Labor Party argument on this issue is that at the end of the day I understand they are going to support this legislation. So they run this argument of misinformation throughout the community, they try to stir up concern and distrust in the government system throughout the community, all for what they believe is short-term political gain, yet they are going to support this legislation. We have sat here day in and day out over the last couple of weeks and listened to them. They get up here with their indignation about class warfare, about how they believe government schools are not being correctly funded, using facts and figures that really are not facts and figuresâthey are just figments of their imaginationâtwisting figures around so they can build up this so-called case. But they have no basis for the case they are mounting. At the end of the day, it just shows their hypocrisy.  </para><para>I believe that Australia is in one of the strongest positions it has been in for many generations, and it has only been as a result of the Howard coalition government. The reason we are in such a strong position is the reforms and policies we have put forward. The Labor opposition have never supported our reforms and our policies. But have they put up alternative policies? Have they put up a different direction? Have they looked at the facts? No, we have always had negative carping and harping about blocking what we are trying to do which is right for this country. In this debate about education they have lost the plot: they are not concerned about parents and children. They are not concerned about the quality of education in this country. The quality of education in this country is the future of this country. Instead of being divisive about it, instead of trying to wage a class warfare, they should be out there trying to support what is the best policy to provide a good system of education in this country, the best policy that can deliver the education that is the future of this country for our children, the best policy that will allow the parents of this country to make a choice about how they want their children to be educated to get the best possible education so that this country can go forward and continue to be the strong country that it is, and the best policy that will give the children of this country the best education that they can possibly have. The Labor Party will be shown up for the hypocrites that they are.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âOrder!

It is a day when the Australian government and the Australian people would naturally want to recall the longstanding links that we have with Fijiâthe friendship between our two countries, the very close ties in areas historically of politics, of trade, of investment and on the sporting field. The peoples of Australia and the peoples of Fiji know each other well, and in that spirit we would all, of course, like to join the Fijian people everywhere in celebrating Fiji Day. </para><para>Our close links with Fiji though have meant that we have watched with great sadness the events during the course of this year starting on 19 May, when George Speight and his gang took hostage the Prime Minister and the democratically elected government of Fiji in their parliament. We were, naturally enough, relieved when, after 56 days in captivity, on 13 July the Prime Minister and his ministers were released. But the simple fact is that this seizure of the Prime Minister and his ministers led to the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Fiji. This was indeed a very great tragedy.</para><para>Fiji, as everybody knows, is an ethnically divided country with 42 or 43 per cent of the population being of Indian origin, about 51 per cent being of indigenous Fijian origin and the rest of the population being from a variety of other origins. For Fiji to work as a country, for the community of Fiji to bind together, there has to be a democratic process which is regarded by all as fair. No-one could regard what George Speight and his supporters did on 19 May as fair, and no-one could regard the overthrow of the Fijian constitution and the overthrow of Mahendra Chaudhry and his government as in any way fair. Inevitably this has led to bitter resentment, bitter debate and bitter dispute in Fiji, and that can only be resolved with the restoration of democracy. Australia unashamedly has taken the leading role internationally on this issue, and we have taken a very strong stand. We have introduced a series of what we call smart sanctions of targeted measuresânot to take measures which are disproportionate in their impact, throwing people out of work, reducing living standards more than they have already been reduced, but measures which not only demonstrate our deep concern about what has happened in Fiji but also target those who in particular are responsible for what has been done. </para><para>I am also pleased to say that the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group has been effective in galvanising international opinion for the restoration of democracy in Fiji and the upholding of democratic values. Not only has the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group been effective in its work but so too, perhaps one could say belatedly, has the South Pacific Forum. In 1987, at the time of the Fiji coups, the South Pacific community was divided: Australia and New Zealand, naturally enough, outraged about the overthrow of the democratic government in Fiji. Australia and New Zealand were largely not supported by other countries in the South Pacific. On this occasion it has been possible for the South Pacific foreign ministers to get together as they did quite recently in Apia in Samoa and to express as a South Pacific community our condemnation and our deep concern about what has happened in Fiji. Fiji will not be fully accepted back into the international community until democracy is restored, until there is a recognition of the equal rights of the people of Fiji and there is an attempt by leaders in Fiji, whoever they may be, whatever walk of life they may be from, to bind people back together under the re-established democratic institutions. We will, of course, help with the restoration of democracy in Fiji, but our relationship cannot return to normality until that has happened. </para><para>I know these sentiments are shared by all members of the House, and it is really with great pleasure that I move this motion today because this motion does send a message not just here in Australia but to all of the people of Fiji of the deep concern that there is in Australiaâa country with such close and deep links with Fijiâat what has happened to that country in recent times. It is a great tragedy, and we as a parliament, not just as a government, urge the Fijian interim government to restore democracy as soon as possible. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>21181</page.no><name role="metadata">Brereton, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRERETON</name><name.id>5T4</name.id><electorate>Kingsford-Smith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe motion moved today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is of significance as much for what it does not say as for what it does. Nearly five months have passed since Mahendra Chaudhry and his government were taken hostage by those terrorists and since we saw them removed from office through an unconstitutional action. Of course, coup leader George Speight may well now face treason charges, but his racist policies remain alive and well. On 15 September the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said, met in New York. With Foreign Minister Downer in attendance, CMAG rejected Fiji's interim administration's plan to hold new elections in two years after introducing a new, racially discriminatory constitution. CMAG noted that the 1997 constitution had been unanimously endorsed by the Great Council of Chiefs and by the two houses of the Fiji parliament. It expressed its very real concern that the interim administration intends the new constitution to incorporate further restrictions on the basis of racial origin. CMAG viewed with concern that the interim administration in Fiji is itself the product of the unconstitutional overthrow of an elected government and that its actions therefore lack both legitimacy and credibility. This was a very good statement. On 18 September New Zealand Foreign Minister Goff welcomed CMAG's decision. He affirmed the importance of early elections in Fijiâelections within the framework of the 1997 constitution. Goff made the important point that the interim government has no mandate to change the 1997 constitution and that its replacement with a racially biased one will be a grave injustice to the 44 per cent of the population who are of Indo-Fijian descent.</para></talk.start><para>Today's motion expresses strong concern `at calls from a few within Fiji for a new, blatantly-discriminatory constitution.' But the motion says nothing about the unconstitutional nature of the interim administration. Nothing is said about its declared intentions. The redrawing of Fiji's constitution was, of course, one of George Speight's key demands. The Constitutional Review Commission announced in Suva last Friday is dominated by Fijian nationals, including Speight sympathisers. The commission is to make recommendations by June 2001 so that a new constitution can be drafted by the end of next year and elections held between March and June in the year 2002. Elections may take place in 18 months but neither the process of constitutional review nor its outcome is likely to be acceptable. The interim government's intention to proclaim a new internal security decree to suppress political dissent and to suppress trade union activity is further cause of great concern to us.</para><para>It is worth posing the question: just where does the Australian government stand in all this? Today's motion puts Australia at some distance from New Zealand, and we know that New Zealand continues to press for the restoration of the 1997 constitution. Instead, today's motion calls for the earliest possible return of democratic rule on the basis of a fair, balanced and democratic constitution. Nice words but, I put it to the House, very ambiguous words. It is clear that the Australian government has given up on the 1997 constitution. With that, it has stepped down the slippery slope of accommodating the unconstitutional interim government and whatever new constitutional arrangements it might put in place.</para><para>Australia and Fiji and officials are engaged in negotiation on a successor agreement to the import credit scheme, which has benefited the Fijian garment industry through preferential access to Australian markets. Labor has been advised by reliable sources in Fiji that, despite CMAG's support for the 1997 constitution, the Australian government has privately indicated a preparedness to put in place a successor arrangement to the import credit scheme, provided  the interim government commits itself to elections in approximately 18 months but before Australia or anyone else knows the details of any new constitution. Labor has been further advised that following discussion with Foreign Minister Downer, who I notice is just leaving the chamber, Fiji's interim foreign minister put this proposition to his cabinet colleagues at their meeting on Wednesday, 22 September, and that they agreed. The interim administration announced its new timetable for elections last Friday, 6 October. An announcement about a successor to the import credit scheme will presumably be forthcoming from Canberra once negotiations on the detail are finalised. </para><para>Having dragged its feet on sanctions when the Mahendra Chaudhry government was overthrown, the Australian government is now quietly getting on with business. A democratic government and constitution have been swept away. Many countries looked to Australia to give leadership to the international response to Fiji's crises. That leadership was conspicuously lacking. Instead, quiet acquiescence has been the order of the dayâand that sad reality I think lies very much behind the government motion moved here today.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âMr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

I think that attempts were made to minimise there not being a minister present on this occasion.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MAIN COMMITTEE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>21182</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âI advise the House that the Deputy Speaker has fixed Wednesday, 11 October 2000, at 9.40 a.m. as the time for the next meeting of the Main Committee, unless an alternative day or hour is fixed.</para></talk.start></interjection></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS REFERRED TO MAIN COMMITTEE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>21182</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ronaldson</inline>)âby leaveâagreed to:</para><motion><para>That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for consideration:</para><para><inline ref="R1161">Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2000</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1162">Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000</inline></para></motion></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>21182</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Selection Committee</title><page.no>21182</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>21182</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>21182</page.no><name role="metadata">Nehl, Garry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEHL</name><name.id>AE4</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the report of the Selection Committee relating to the consideration of committee and delegation reports and private members' business on Monday, 30 October 2000.

We understand that the Australian Electoral Commission has been giving departments a range of electoral roll information in electronic form for some time. Following advice from the Solicitor-General in June of this year, it appears that the AEC has been doing so quite unlawfully. Not only did the Solicitor-General's advice force the Prime Minister to abort his GST direct mail letter which was to go to all households in Australia; it also made the AEC review its past and future handling of the Commonwealth electoral roll. This bill arises from that legal advice.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the government has refused opposition requests to see the Solicitor-General's advice, so we are unable to see to what extent the bill does actually reflect the advice. Nevertheless, given that the Prime Minister's letter was embarrassingly withdrawnâperhaps humiliatingly withdrawn might be an even more appropriate descriptionâand the Australian Taxation Office returned the electronic roll to the Electoral Commission, we can safely deduce that the Solicitor-General advised the AEC that it could not give the Taxation Office the roll in electronic form for the purposes of a mail-out, as it had done previously.</para><para>The opposition's understanding is that the AEC could only provide elector information in electronic format to departments, if permitted purposes for the use of that information had been prescribed. At the time of the Prime Minister's GST letter fiasco, no such permitted purposes had been prescribed. Therefore, in broad terms, the opposition supports this piece of legislation because, first, it should resolve any questions about previous use, by agencies, of electronically supplied elector information; second, it should preclude arguments about the admissibility of evidence in court which had been gathered relying on the use of such elector information; and, third, it should resolve any questions about the future use of that information. On that basis, the opposition supports the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>21184</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe matters before us appear, on first glance, quite procedural and, as outlined by the member for Melbourne, are necessary to address some legality associated with what had been standard practice: the use of the electronic version of the electoral roll by various agencies such as the National Crime Authority, Federal Police and Customs. They are agencies which have made use of the electronic form of the information which underpins the electoral roll upon which we all rely as members of parliament. I must say also that members of parliament themselves have come to rely upon being able to use this database of electors in a way which assists them in communications with their constituents and helps them to keep a note of those communications in a readily accessible form. I am sure that all members in this place would welcome the passage of the <inline ref="R1163">Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000</inline>, including its speedy passage through the Senate, so that we can get on with the business of accurately representing our constituents and recording our activities on their behalf on those databases which we do maintain in a very confidential way. </para></talk.start><para>But this matter also raises the concern held by so many people in Queensland about the integrity of the electoral processes taking place in that state. Given that the Queensland electoral roll and the Commonwealth electoral roll have been hand in glove for about 15 years now, it is important for us in this place to reflect upon just what is unfolding in Queensland at the moment in the form of the Shepherdson inquiry into allegations regarding the illegal obtaining of enrolments for the purposes of the Australian Labor Party and its preselection processes and other matters.</para><para>Apparently, the Labor Party in Queensland has the requirement of your having to be enrolled in an electorate in which you are participating in a preselection ballot. As a result of this, there have been some vigorous efforts by the Labor Party basically to rort the roll for its internal processes. It has also been a convenient factor when it comes to elections which have been taking place in various seats. As I said to the parliament last week, this is not a matter which is isolated only in the region of Townsville. Two of my constituents were named in connection with the Shepherdson inquiry as being key and keen participants in this particular activity.</para><para>I think it is very important to know the following details. The member for Woodridge in the Queensland parliament, Mike Kaiser, a former State Secretary of the Labor Party, has been mentioned in dispatches. The party returning officer, Joan Buddâwho is the wife of former member for Redlands John Buddâtold the Shepherdson inquiry yesterday, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, that she had told State Secretary Kaiser two forged Electoral Commission white cards had been used in an attempt to enrol ALP members for a preselection vote in the East Brisbane council ward in 1993. The member for Griffith would share my concern about this matter, given that we have this ward covering both of our electorates. This means the Labor Party in 1993 was involved in rorting the electoral roll for the purposes of internal matters, which then became a convenient matter come election time. If Mr Kaiser knew about these matters when he was state secretary, it begs the question as to why two other former state secretaries of the Labor Party also did not know about these matters and why they did not do something about them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>âWho were they?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>âThose particular peopleâin reply to the interjection of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administrationâwere the current Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, and the current member for Lilley, Mr Swan. Both were state secretaries of the Australian Labor Party at a point in time when this rorting occurred. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></talk.start></continue><para>The dogs have been barking for the member for the Northern Territory ever since that famous dog show he hired a VIP to go to a few years ago. I am surprised how sensitive the Australian Labor Party are on this matter. I would have thought that members opposite would have been interested in democracy and ensuring that the integrity of our electoral roll was never under any doubt. If those opposite want to keep raising quorums and points of order all afternoon, don't you worry, because we have enough material here to fill a thousand adjournment speeches and we will keep it coming.</para><para>Let me tell you that the facts do not just rest with the relationships of John and Joan Budd, Mr Kaiser, Mr Beattie and Mr Swan. Lindesay Jones, the former assistant state secretary, was also one of the people who knew about the fraud claims that are becoming obvious because of the Shepherdson inquiry. His wife wanted to be a senator for Queensland. If the AWU had not got her, she might have got up as a Socialist Left candidate. Then there is Linda Lavarch, who is now an MLA for the seat of Kurwongbah. Lavarch might be a name familiar to those who have been in this chamber for a while. Yes, she is the wife of the former Attorney-General of Australia, and she was also named as the recipient of a letter in October 1993 from then Assistant State Secretary Jones concerned about unprecedented electoral stacking in the ward of East Brisbane. So Mrs Budd has dropped in a few more people.</para><para>The relationships become pretty interesting. The current councillor for East Brisbane ward is Catherine Bermingham. Her brother Lee was named in proceedings last weekâhe is my constituent; in fact Catherine is also a constituent of mineâas being one of the key and keen vote rorters in the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. Then we hear that Jim Elder might have in fact been told about this. Jim Elder is the Deputy Premier of Queensland. In fact, Mrs Budd said that she had told the Deputy Premier, Jim Elder, that former AWU faction member Lee Bermingham had allegedly asked Brisbane party member Ross Musgroveâthe brother of Grant Musgrove, the member for Springwood in the Queensland parliamentâto put his numbers into Mundingburra for the 1996 election. That was the supplementary election that was ordered following the doubts cast over 15 ballot papers at the real election that took place in 1995. As history reflects, as a result of those fraudulent ballots, a new election was called, the seat of Mundingburra was won by the Liberal Party and the state government of Queensland changed to a very effective coalition government, although short-lived. So it is interesting to know that Mrs Budd interpreted this request as being to transfer Labor members onto the roll. This morning's <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> states: </para><quote><para>Ms Budd said she believed Mr Bermingham was the person responsible âbecause of talk I heard aroundâ.</para></quote><para>But it seems to go even further than that. The article states:</para><quote><para>She also said Mr Elder, ALP president Don Brown, and party organiser Linda Hollidayâ</para></quote><para>a former councillor in the Brisbane City Council, the darling of the Socialist Left and the partner of Queensland government minister Mr Stephen Robertsonâ</para><quote><para>did not believe it.</para></quote><para>She said that they did not believe any of these allegations. So they all sat on it. The points are really quite interesting when you start to consider all the relationships between all the people. It is not just factional business we are talking about in the Shepherdson inquiry; it is a family concern. It is a family business. So what did all of these people do about this? Essentially, they sat on their hands and did nothing. If it had not been for the fact that Karen Ehrmann and a couple of others had got caught and Ehrmann had rolled overâand became a Labor rat, I guessâthis part of the Labor culture may not have been revealed in the sort of detail that we have heard.</para><para>All of this raises questions about a number of interesting people in important positions in Queensland: the Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier, Mike Reynolds, and Paul Lucas, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee. The parliamentary committee which oversights the CJC was also mentioned in dispatches yesterday with regard to Mr Lucas's preselection for the Lytton by-election. Mr Lucas said that he had not been interviewed by the CJC on the matter, which makes me wonder just how important the parliamentary inquiry at the federal level is now becoming. Then there is Gary Fenlon, the member for Greenslopes and Chairman of the Legal, Constitutional and Administrative Review Committee. One of their current inquiries is into the minimisation of electoral fraud. We now have Caesar judging Caesar in the Queensland parliament. I make the point again: the parliamentary inquiry being conducted by a subcommittee of this parliament has never been more important when we consider what is occurring in Queensland.</para><para>Madam Deputy Speaker, let me tell you about Stephen Robertson. Stephen Robertson is the member for Sunnybank, which includes part of my electorate. He is the Minister for Emergency Services, but his nickname in the 1980s was the `little bagman' in the United Firefighters Union. The 1991 Cooke inquiry into union corruption in Queensland said that the ballot he presided over as the state secretary of that union in 1985 wasâand I quote from page 76, section 3.12.12 of the Cooke inquiryâ`fraudulently rigged'. So here we have in Queensland key and important parts of the current government who have been involved in this Labor culture of rigging ballots. Councillor Catherine Bermingham and others in the Brisbane City Council certainly have more to answer for.

The coalition does indeed welcome the support of the Australian Labor Party with respect to the <inline ref="R1163">Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000</inline>.</para><para>The member for Moreton, however, in his contribution pointed out the very real concerns and question marks which now apply against the names of Premier Beattie, Joan Budd, Lindesay Jones, Linda Lavarch, Catherine Bermingham, Deputy Premier Elder, Linda Holliday, Ross Musgrove and the member for Lilley. He referred to factional business in the Australian Labor Party being `family business'. He referred to the culture of Labor, and we are of course seeing daily in the Shepherdson inquiry the unveiling of Labor practices and procedures which most Queensland residents would find utterly abhorrent. We have seen questions raised about the parliamentary secretary to the Premier, Mike Reynolds; Paul Lucas, Chairman of the CJC; and Gary Fenlon, Chairman of the Legal, Constitutional and Administrative Review Committee who, most amazingly, is handling the inquiry into the minimisation of electoral fraud.</para><para>The member for Moreton referred to the `little bagman' in the United Firefighters Union, Stephen Robertson, the Minister for Emergency Services. He also referred to the comments made by eminent QC Marshall Cooke in his inquiry into union corruption when he said that the ballot presided over by the then office bearer in the United Firefighters Union, Stephen Robertsonânow Minister for Emergency Servicesâwas fraudulently rigged. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.

I was simply referring to matters in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> which were raised by the member for Moreton in his contribution to the <inline ref="R1163">Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000</inline>. The member for Moreton also referred to Catherine Bermingham. Indeed, questions must now be asked about the Brisbane City Council. Day by day, Queenslanders remain fascinated as they turn the pages of the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> and are appalled by what they see as institutionalised electoral fraud in the Australian Labor Party. As the current secretary to the Australian Labor Party, Cameron Milner, suggested, the ALP could well take water at the time of the next election. I want to make a prediction that the Beattie Labor government will be swept from office whenever the next state election is held.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But, returning to the specific provisions of the <inline ref="R1163">Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000</inline>, I wanted to point out that the Australian Electoral Commission had been providing a number of other prescribed authorities with electoral roll data under the provisions of subsection 91(10) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. As the act does not provide for end use restrictions on the data supplied to prescribed authorities under this legislation, the AEC used the privacy principles under the Privacy Act 1988 for guidance, together with a safeguard agreement made between the AEC and the requesting agency.</para><para>After questioning at Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee estimates hearings on 24 May of this year the AEC sought additional legal advice in written form to confirm previous legal advice from the office of the Australian Government Solicitor so that it could provide elector information to prescribed authorities in electronic format. Despite several legal opinions since 1991 that continued to advise that the AEC could lawfully provide this information, the Solicitor-General advised on 8 June 2000 that the AEC could not provide prescribed authorities with the electoral roll in electronic format under subsection 91(10) but could do so under paragraph 91(4A)(e).</para><para>However, the supply of the electoral roll in electronic format under paragraph 91(4A)(e) would require a regulation under subsection 91A(1) in order for the prescribed authorities to be able to use the information. No regulations had been made to that effect at that time. However, whilst prescribing regulations would authorise future use by prescribed authorities of the elector information supplied in electronic format, regulations could not be used to authorise past use. This can only be done by enacting legislation. On 8 June 2000 the Attorney-General issued a media release indicating that the government would seek to rectify, through legislation, regulation or other appropriate action, the past use by prescribed authorities of elector information received in electronic format.</para><para>There was also concern that prescribed authorities may have difficulty in progressing cases which had in some way relied upon elector information supplied electronically by the Australian Electoral Commission. Without the proposed amendments, there is a possibility that previous actions taken by prescribed authorities as a result of the use of elector information could be called into question and that challenges to prosecutions may result in lengthier trials and an increase in the number of appeals. The government's legal advice is that such challenges and appeals are not likely to succeed. However, they could result in an unnecessary waste of court time and legal resources. It is therefore preferable that any doubt in relation to the past use of elector information by prescribed authorities be removed. These amendments will fulfil that purpose. The proposed amendments will also authorise the future use of elector information previously supplied on tape or disk that has been incorporated into a prescribed authority's information systems from which it would be impracticable to identify and/or remove the elector information supplied by the Australian Electoral Commission. This will ensure that future actions taken by prescribed authorities using such material cannot be called into question. </para><para>On 26 June 2000, cabinet agreed that the AEC should prepare legislation which would resolve any questions about past use of the electronically supplied elector information and also resolve any questions about unavoidable future uses of the information. The uses to which the prescribed authorities can now put electronically supplied elector information are set out in the Electoral and Referendum Regulations made on 25 July 2000. Members on both sides of the House support this legislation. It is vital that it proceed to the other place tomorrow. I have a great deal of pleasure in commending the bill to the House.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>21190</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>)âby leaveâread a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TALLIES AND PICNIC DAYS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21190</page.no><id.no>R1104</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21190</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 29 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reith</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>21190</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate this afternoon. I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library for their very informative <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>, which is up to their normal very professional standard. The purpose of this bill, the <inline ref="R1104">Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000</inline>, is to remove tallies from allowable award matters and, as a result, from federal awards. The effect of the bill will be to narrow the scope of matters which federal awards can address. Talliesâwhich are, as you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, from your background in the rural areas of North Queensland, a form of piece rate or a payment of results remuneration systemâhave been included in the meat industry awards. The bill also prevents a union Picnic Day clause being considered as an allowable award matter, although union picnic days are not currently prescribed as allowable award matters. The bill also creates a six-month interim period from the bill's date of commencement during which parties to an award can apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to vary the award so that it provides only for allowable matters. At the end of this period, non-allowable matters cease to have effect. At the end of the interim period, the commission must review each award to ensure that it contains only allowable award matters.</para></talk.start><para>These issuesâthat is, the removal of tallies and union picnic days from this legislationâas I am sure you are aware, Madam Deputy Speakerâwere canvassed in the <inline ref="R894">Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999</inline>. That bill was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee for inquiry in August 1999. The committee reported on the bill on 29 November 1999. Schedule 6 of the More Jobs, Better Pay bill proposed removing some matters from allowable award matters while making the following non-allowable: minimum or maximum hours of work; transfers between work locations; transfers from one type of employment to another, for example part-time to full-time; training and education; recording of work times; accident make-up pay; union representation for dispute settling procedures; union picnic days; limitation of numbers of employees of certain types; and tallies.</para><para>As an aside on this question of training and education, I am advised that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs visited Groote Eylandt recently, and was involved in discussing with people on Groote Eylandt, Aboriginal people in particular, employment and training issues. He visited, as I understand it, a group of Aboriginal trainees employed by the mining company on Groote Eylandt. He was informed that their training time was paid for by the company. Heâin the presence of those being trainedâsaid that they should be paying for their own training. I guess that sums up this minister in relation to the extent to which he is prepared to go to deny Australians protection not only through awards but also through the provision of entitlements, in this case by an employer, to appropriate training so that the workers are sufficiently skilled up to take jobs that are available within the workplace. </para><para>To date, as you would be aware, the <inline ref="R894">Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999</inline> has not passed the Senate. What we have seen here is what the minister said we could expect, and that is that he would reintroduce parts of the bill in bite-sized chunks. Removing Picnic Day as an allowable public holiday will reduce award public holiday entitlements. Its effect will be to reduce public holidays from 11 to 10. The effect of making union picnic days non-allowable will be to reduce the public holiday entitlements of workers covered by awards that include picnic days. Instead of receiving the 11 standard public holidays determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission those workers will receive 10.</para><para>I have seen a number of awards, and I am thinking this afternoon of the Storage Services General Award 1999 and its public holidays clause. If you read that award, it contains Picnic Day as a holiday. The award is consistent with the commission's public holidays test case standard. All workers covered by the award, whether union members or not, are entitled to the union picnic day public holiday. If this day is to be deleted no alternative day will apply, leading to a reduction in public holidays from 11 to 10. Workers covered by awards with a union picnic day public holiday will be penalised by the loss of one public holiday by this bill merely because one of the public holidays is called union picnic day. Other workers will suffer no reduction in comparison.</para><para>I might say that union picnic day is very important to many Australians. It is worth while pointing out that in the case of the Northern Territory, as you may be aware, Picnic Day has been legislated for by the Northern Territory Assembly. The Northern Territory has a Picnic Day provision in its public holidays act. Picnic Day is on the first Monday in August and is included as part of the 11 public holidays. You may not be aware that this Picnic Day in Darwin on the first Monday in August is in fact on Darwin Cup Day. Some time ago my colleague Senator Crossin said that the government was proposing to remove this holiday from the calendar. That was denied by the CLP in the Northern Territory and by the spokesperson for the government. It is now writ large in this legislation that the government's very intention is to delete this Picnic Day from awards thus ensuring that the number of public holidays in the Northern Territory is reduced from 11 to 10 and by the way ensuring that Darwin Cup Day will no longer be held on picnic day or a public holiday.</para><para>I am not sure whether the minister has been the bearer of these good tidings, as he would see it, to the Northern Territory government, the Northern Territory racing industry, the Northern Territory tourism industry and Northern Territory hospitality industry. But I would say that this is just an indication of the consequences of what I regard as a very ill thought out and inappropriate proposal in this legislation. It also needs to be understood that in most awards the standard public holiday award clause also provides for the facility for an employer and a majority of employees to take an alternative day in lieu of the specified standard public holidays. Substitution agreements can also be made involving individual employees.</para><para>Other standard public holidays and awards include the Queen's Birthday. You will recall that part of the argument for the reduction of union picnic days is the level of unionisation within the Australian work force. The view has been put that, because the level of unionisation has diminished over the years, there is no longer a call to have this public holiday. I am sure none of us would proposeâcertainly I would notâthat it is appropriate to remove the Queen's Birthday from the list of official holidays. But how many Australians pay any regard to the Queen or the royal family on the Queen's Birthday public holiday? Indeed, if you were to ask Australian workers what they celebrate on the Queen's Birthday public holiday, I am damn sure they would say, `Not the Queen.' </para><para>All workers are entitled to that holiday, even republicans. Most of the workers that I am aware ofâcertainly in my electorateâwould fall into the category of republicans. We know that non-Christian people are entitled to Easter and Christmas holidays. Even the minister himself, as much as he opposes unions, wouldâif he were covered by an awardâbe entitled to Labour Day. I think the point needs to be made here that this is unnecessary and entirely inappropriate. You would have to accord some merit to the argument that this is all about the ideological prerogative that the minister believes he has in determining the nature of industrial relations in this country. You have to say that, if this is the way the government proposes to deal with these issues, the only people who are going to be disadvantaged by it are Australian workers.</para><para>Whilst the minister perennially parades into this place, going on about what he is doing to improve the lot of Australian workers, we know that, as I pointed out earlier in my contribution, his attitudes towards Australian workers do not reflect the gratitude he would want them to have because, clearly, what he is about is stripping away award conditions and entitlements and ensuring that Australian workers are, in fact, worse off. I have had cause to mention these issues in this place before. </para><para>It is also worth pointing out some other things, and I thank the Parliamentary Library for this information. There are a number of commission decisions relevant to picnic days and public holidays. The commission in its public holidays test case in 1994 determined that federal award employees throughout Australia are entitled to a minimum safety net of 11 public holidays per year. Easter Saturday was found to be a public holiday. The applications were made in response to the intention of the Victorian government to reduce the number of public holidays in 1993. The commission named 10 public holidays and provided that one other day be specified according to state, territory or locality or on some other basisâsuch as an award picnic day.</para><para>In 1997, another full bench of the commission was required to consider the continuation of the union picnic days within the requirements of award simplification or, more accurately, under the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Act's transitional provisions. In what became known as the award simplification decision, the commission held that union picnic days had been considered as public holidays for decades. The decision says:</para><quote><para>The employers and the Joint Governments submitted that union picnic days are not gazetted holidays or holidays which the public in general enjoys. Against these considerations is the fact that union picnic days have been included in the public holiday provisions of awards for decades in a large number of industries.</para><para>There are numerous decisions of the Commission and its predecessor, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, in which a union picnic day has been treated as a public holiday. The Full Bench decision which established the test case standard for leave entitlements in Commission awards relating to public holidays included union picnic day as a day which may be included as one of the additional public holidays constituting the minimum entitlement of leave under the public holiday clauses. As we have already indicated, the use of terms in their industrial context is an important element in construing the matters listed in s.89A(2).</para><para>We have therefore concluded that union picnic day falls within the expression public holidays for the purposes of s.89(A)2(i).</para></quote><para>The effect of this decision has been that, even though union picnic days are not expressly identified as allowable award matters under section 89(A) of the act, they have been regarded as public holidays which are allowable.</para><para>It is very clear that the approach being adopted by the government is both mean minded and mean spirited. The government needs to contemplate, firstly, why it is carrying out this activity given that holidays are of themselves, by and large, matters up to state and territory jurisdictions. To come into this place and seek to take out the ability of workers to enjoy a picnic day underlines, in my mind, very clearly the mean-spirited approach being adopted by the government. </para><para>The other major provision of this legislation is the matter which deals with tallies. The act specifies `piece rates, tallies and bonuses' as allowable award matters. Tallies and bonuses are used to set pay rates in agricultural industries such as the meat industry, sheep shearing, fruit picking and the clothing industry. The <inline ref="R1104">Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000</inline> will not remove either piece rates or bonuses as allowable award mattersâonly tallies.</para><para>Again, I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library for the following information. The issue of tallies was considered by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee in its review, which I referred to earlier, of the More Jobs Better Pay bill. At that time, the ACTU submitted that the three terms, piece rates, tallies and bonuses, are used interchangeably in awards in industries such as clothing and meat. It also expressed concern that clothing workers could lose their entitlements to bonus payments, and thus workers under these systems could seek clarification or attention of their particular earnings by results systems.</para><para>Not surprisingly, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business attempted to distinguish between the operation of these systems in its 1999 submission to the Senate committee. It argued that tallies are based on inputs, in contrast to piece rates systems, which are based on outputs.</para><para>In contrast, the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, the AMIEU, suggested in its submission on the More Jobs Better Pay bill that with the removal of tallies from awards, meat industry employers would replace the tally system with another piece rate system. Their submission reads:</para><quote><para>Removing tally provisions, given that most employers would maintain some form of incentive system, would destroy the effectiveness of the award safety net ... award tally provisions represent a key award entitlement, which must be maintained in order to avoid substantially reducing the award safety net.</para><para>... employees in the meat industry are not highly paid by committee standards.</para><para>The effect of making tallies a non-allowable award matter would be to make it legally possible to reduce a tally worker's gross pay by 25%. The safety net value of the award would become virtually irrelevant.</para></quote><para>It is very clear to me that the position we ought to be adopting on this legislation is not the one which is being advocated by the government. Further in their submission, the AMIEU stated that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was reviewing the tally system as part of the process of reviewing awards, as is appropriate. The union said that to remove tallies as an allowable award matter would inhibit the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from implementing the federal meat industry decision, print R9075, particularly those aspects of the decision dealing with the tally provisions of the award in question, and that the evidence presented during the AIRC hearings showed that meat processors, while not using the award prescribed tally system, were using their own arrangements whether contained in certified agreements or by way of private arrangements between the employer and employees and/or union. Much of the case before the full bench of the AIRC was in relation to the tally system in the federal meat industry processing award 1996. The tally system is very clear. </para><para>It is both unfair and unreasonable for the government to adopt the approach it has in relation to this matter. I referred a moment ago to the full bench's decision in the 1996 case. The decision was in relation to tallies in that award, but will have application to other awards containing tallies. The full bench at that time was conscious of the need to retain award protection for employees working under piece rate systems. It said:</para><quote><para>On the other hand, in our view, it is essential that the terms and conditions of any incentive payment system to operate in place of the standard time work payment system be documented, authenticated and readily ascertainable.</para></quote><para>Further, it said: </para><quote><para>Those measures are also necessary to ensure that employees have an opportunity to understand, or can readily ascertain, the terms of the incentive payment system, and are able to monitor accrual of entitlements under it.</para></quote><para>It is very clear that this bill's removal of tallies as an allowable award matter undermines the integrity of the decision reached by the AIRC and could prevent the AIRC from properly reviewing the effects of the FMID as it relates to fairness to employees. It is very clear that more work needs to be done on this issue. The government should be very conscious of our view; it is entirely inappropriate for this matter to be addressed in the way that is being proposed by this legislation. I have said before that it is very clear that this matter is being ideologically driven. In my view, this, and the question of picnic days, is something which the government should rethink. It is not appropriate to be doing it in this way. It will only penalise those people who should not be penalisedâAustralian workers. The issue of the holiday for picnic day will affect workers regardless of the industry they work in, and the issue of tallies will have most application for those industries that I have already mentioned, particularly the clothing industry and the meat industry. I do not believe that it is fair or reasonable to treat Australian workers with the disrespect that this bill seeks to do.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21194</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to talk on the <inline ref="R1104">Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000</inline> very proudly because, to my knowledge, I am the only member with a working-class background in this place who worked as a tally worker, both as a slaughterman and a boner in the meat processing industry, in my younger days, and I was also a member of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union.</para></talk.start><para>Before I talk about my personal experiences as a qualified tally worker, I will reflect on the attitude of the Australian Democrats and the ALP on the workplace relations bills. In their 1998 IR election policy, the Democrats supported a simplified and usable award system. Their record on voting on coalition bills shows that, despite several opportunities, and this bill is yet another one, they have failed to act in accordance with their own policies. Despite their self-adulation as those who `keep the bastards honest' and as those who `do not just say no to legislation', they have failed to assess this bill and others on their merits. Despite their rejection of the More Jobs Better Pay legislation, largely on the basis that it was an inappropriate omnibus bill, they have failed to assess on the merits the bills, including this one, that the coalition has served up in bite-sized chunks just so the Democrats could manage them.</para><para>Let me now talk about the Democrats workplace relations voting record. Between 1988 and 1996, Labor moved 17 pieces of industrial relations legislation through the Senate. Between 1996 and 2000, the coalition moved 16 pieces of workplace relations legislation through the Senate, with four bills currently in the House of Representatives. Only three items of Labor IR legislation were referred to committees, whereas 15 items of coalition legislation have been referred to committees. The Democrats even voted against a committee when Labor moved their 1988 omnibus billâthe Industrial Relations Bill 1988. The Democrats spent 833 days considering Labor's 17 pieces of legislation in the Senateâan average of 49 days per bill. By contrast, as at 6 September, they have spent 2,528 days considering the coalition's 16 pieces of legislationâan average of 158 days each. All pieces of Labor industrial relations legislation put before the Senate have passed into law, some with amendment, and every time there has been a vote on Labor's legislation the Democrats voted in favour.</para><para>The Democrats have only ever voted in favour of two coalition workplace relations bills since the 1996 election. One further bill passed in the last parliament without a vote. Only one coalition workplace relations bill has passed during the present parliament, and that was with Labor supportâand I refer to the youth wages bill 1999âwith the Democrats voting against. In every other case the Democrats have voted down, disallowed or delayed coalition workplace relations legislation. The Democrats have voted down four coalition workplace relations bills, disallowed three regulations and delayed another bill until it died at the last election. There are currently four pieces of workplace relations legislation still blocked in the Senate, with a further four bills on their way from the House of Representatives. The Democrats have been prepared to deal with Labor IR legislation in omnibus form but have refused to do so to coalition omnibus legislation in the coalition's second term. By the time the parliament resumed sitting in August 2000, coalition workplace relations bills had been delayed for approximately three times longer than Labor's legislation was delayed, and this tally was racked up over half as many years. </para><para>Let me now talk about the ALP's contribution. Award simplification should be a matter of bipartisan policy in this parliament. It was a policy advocated by the former Keating Labor government between 1993 and 1996. The Labor Party in opposition has, however, regressed in its own support for award simplification. It has caved in to its union mates, with an approach of mindless opposition, like that of the ACTU, to all award simplification. Rather than support simplified awards, Labor's policy promises the complete abolition of award simplificationâawards which are comprehensive, not simplified.</para><para>The removal of tallies from awards is long overdue and has been widely advocated within industry and by policy makers across the political divide. As related by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services to parliament on 26 June 2000:</para><quote><para>... for a short period only, (the Australian Labor Party) got realistic about this industry, and their spokesman, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Cook, in 1992 said `We ought to get rid of the tally system.' Peter Cook was not able to ... deliver. Do you know why not? The ACTU said no. Peter Cook said, `This will produce more jobs. This will save jobs and produce more jobs. It is an important reform. But the ACTU said no.'</para><para>Why did the ACTU say `no'? The answer lies in the quote from an article in the Journal of Industrial Relations (MA Jerrard, March 2000), which described the tally system as:</para><para>... the method by which the union controls the pace of throughput of the plant in a shift.</para></quote><para>The Democrats in particular will say that the bill is unnecessary and that the Industrial Relations Commission should put the remaining meat industry awards which contain tally provisions through the same process used for the major federal meat industry award. Neither the Labor Party nor the Democrats have called into question the AIRC decision to remove tallies from the major federal meat industry award. Apart from this award, unit tally systems also exist in a number of other federal meat awards. The removal of tallies as an allowable award matter will expedite the modernisation of these awards and remove the necessity for the commission and the parties to go through the same lengthy process they went through in respect of the major federal meat industry award.</para><para>Let me now touch on my experiences. As a 14-year-old I went into the meat processing industry at a small country abattoir at Echuca in Victoria as a labourer. After labouring for two years, as a 16-year-old I wanted to become a slaughterman to earn more money and to get a profession. Unfortunately, the award of the day and the way the tally work was structured prevented me doing so, but there was a section in the award that I took advantage of and this was called the improver section. As a 16-year-old, I was able to learn from one of the tradesmen the art of solo slaughtering on lambs and sheep. I was able to do that on a weekly wage and, when I got up to the tallyâat that time a low tally was 65 carcasses per dayâI could then go on to the full-time award. I became a proficient solo slaughterman at 18 years of age, when the tallies in those days were 65 minimum and 80 maximum per day.</para><para>At that time I was producing in my prime about 100 sucker lambs a day. I was starting at 7.30 in the morning and finishing at three in the afternoon. Because of the heavy lifting that was involved in that process while I was a young man, which also included some heavy lifting of pigs and beef which I learnt as a tally slaughterman, I have long-term physical problems. Apart from the normal dangers of knife stick injuries and cuts, which I have had a considerable number of, I suffer with what is called dry sockets, or the `screws', which means I have no liquid left in the ball-and-socket joints of my two arms because of the heavy lifting I did as a young man. Following on from becoming a proficient solo slaughterman, I took up tally work as a boner and I worked in the boning rooms for two or three years. </para><para>I then went off to the big city where I became a proficient chain slaughterman on a mechanised system producing 85 carcasses per day as part of a team of 32 slaughtermen on each chain. We processed sheep, calves and beefâwhen I was on beefâon the chain system. Part of the problem we had with the tally system in those days was that I, like many others, wanted to get out of the place as early as I could, so we turned the speed of the chains up to the point where we started at 7.30 in the morning and we finished our tallies by midday. We completed our tallies extremely quickly. But the effect that had on the workmanship of those particular carcasses in those environments was catastrophic in terms of the economic loss to the abattoir owners themselves, because when you turn chains up to get out quickly not only do you put an enormous amount of pressure on your body physically but you tend to take shortcuts and, when you take shortcuts with knives, you damage hides, skins and carcasses. When the meat processing industry decided that it needed to put more mechanism into the manual labour of slaughtering, it introduced mechanised slaughtering aids such as hide and skin pullers, air operated knives, splitting saws and so on. It did that in an endeavour to make the chain process and the tally system of slaughtering a lot easier for people, and it did to some extent, but it also created a compounding problem.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>21196</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The centre is not only a centre for learning and research but also a meeting place. Located at the Clayton Campus of Monash University in my electorate, it is a social centre where the indigenous students can relax, feel at home and get support and counselling from the friendly and accessible, if overworked, staff. Watching the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games reminded me of my visit to the centre during NAIDOC week this year. The strong message of reconciliation from the games is demonstrated daily by the fantastic work of the Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies. The centre educates both indigenous and non- indigenous students about Australian indigenous culture and provides encouragement for indigenous students into higher education via the Monash indigenous access scheme. </para></talk.start><para>The Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies had a lot to celebrate in NAIDOC week 2000: a newly founded centre; the introduction of a first-year indigenous studies unit in the Bachelor of Arts course; a recently announced ARC grant of $101,000; in collaboration with other colleagues in the university, the introduction of an indigenous access scheme; three Rio Tinto scholarships for indigenous students in the engineering faculty; and ongoing collaboration work with the medical and law faculties. The centre can also boast a Fulbright postgraduate student Kyllie Cripps. Kyllie is a Monash PhD student, and she was one of two candidates selected to receive a 2000 Fulbright Postgraduate Student Award for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, sponsored by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. As part of her PhD and in affiliation with the University of Arizona, Kyllie will undertake comparative research work among native American communities in Arizona. Her research, through extensive fieldwork in both Australia and the US, will seek to identify, examine and provide a comprehensive analysis of programs that are successfully addressing family violence in indigenous communities. Kyllie was one of 19 Australians to receive an award in 2000 under the auspices of the Australian-American Fulbright Commission. Kyllie was also recognised this year as being one of 30 high achievers in Victoria. Interestingly enough, during the process of that work, she had to explain that she was actually Aboriginal. Being of white skin, she has taken to carrying a photograph of her black mum and dad by way of explanation. The Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies at Monash University is another great example of how the community is leading the Prime Minister on reconciliation. I ask on behalf of the Australian community: why can't he just say sorry?  </para><para>On a note of indulgence, today is the birthday of the beautiful Madeleine Louise: she is one today.

The AWU faction dominates the parliamentary Labor Party in Queensland and is led by the Beattie government self-styled head-kicker, Deputy Premier Jim Elder. Deputy Premier Elder and his mates on the right of the party have for years worked hard to build their numbers and strengthen their position in parliament. Unfortunately for the AWU, things have not been quite the same since it single-handedly steered the Goss government to defeat. In 1995, the Goss government had a 19-seat majority before entering an election that saw it brought within 16 votes of opposition. Six months later, after a by-election in the Townsville based seat of Mundingburra, this 16-vote victory was wiped out, along with Premier Goss and the power base of the AWU. However, it now appears that the Mundingburra by-election was more hard fought than we on the Liberal Party side had first thought. Recent revelations at the Shepherdson inquiry point very strongly to suggestions that Labor, through its AWU operatives, rorted the Mundingburra election in a desperate attempt to stay in power.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Stephen Smith</name></talker><para>âMr Speaker, on a point of orderâ</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>âSo sensitive.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Moreton is not assisting.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Stephen Smith</name></talker><para>âAny sensitivity I have arises as a result of the standing orders and the rules of procedures.

It is a fact that at the time of all those activities I was working for the then deputy leader of the coalition in Queensland. In fact, after that activity up in Townsville, I remember that there was a call made to the deputy coalition leader's office in which people claimed that they had been bussed from Adelaide by the ALP and had not been paid for their efforts to go to Townsville and vote in the by-election. Those sorts of claims will be around the place and it is not surprising that we see them made.</para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Full Service Schools</title><page.no>21198</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>21198</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn the adjournment debate this evening I want to raise an important matter in this place relating to full service schools. In my constituency I have a school in the town of Morwell called Kurnai College, which has successfully for the last two years run a full service school program. It is important to bear in mind the history of the full service school program when considering the shutting of this type of program in the context of education.</para></talk.start><para>Historically there has been a program run by the Labor Party in government called the STAR Program, which was Students at Risk. It was a program which was put in place between 1993 and 1996 which had around $7 million in it per year, targeting those students who were at risk of not completing year 12. When the coalition came to office, they did not continue the funding for this program and so there was no Commonwealth assistance for activities of this nature in 1997.</para><para>When the common youth allowances changes were introduced by the coalition, which were expected to increase the number of students at risk staying on at school, the coalition provided $18 million over three years for the full service schools program, which was similar in its essence to Labor's STAR program. The Howard government decided to terminate the full service schools program this year, which I think is known to everyone here.</para><para>For the record, in certain instances this program has been a great success and it is especially important in areas like Morwell, which has a very high unemployment rate of 18Â½ per cent and a youth unemployment rate of above 40 per cent. I have received a letter from the campus principal of Kurnai College, Mr Peter Box, who writes to me over his concerns in relation to the stopping of funding for this program. I will not read the entire letter which he sent me but I will quote from it. He says in his letter: </para><quote><para>The program is characterised by two things:</para><para>1.   Its apparent success</para><para>2.   Its cost-effectiveness</para><para>In the case of Kurnai College, we believe that thirty-two students can be identified as being retained at school when they otherwise would have left and this has been done at approximately half of the cost of a teacher per year, ie $25,000.</para></quote><para>On the one hand you have the cost of running the full service school program at Kurnai College, which is $25,000 per year. On the other hand you have 32 students who would otherwise be unemployed. In an area like the Latrobe Valley it is almost certain that they would be unemployed in the context of us having such a very high youth unemployment rate. So the cost of 32 students at about $150 a week, which would be the unemployment benefit, is around $249,600 per year. So, on the one hand, there is the $25,000 for keeping the program; on the other hand, $250,000, which is the cost of those students going onto unemployment benefits. So I think it is a fairly clear, commonsense comparison to make, and I think most people in the Australian community would say that it would be better to keep those students at school for those extra two years so that they could gain those skills, get more employable and hopefully go on to a job rather than being unemployed.</para><para>The alternative program at the Maryvale campus of Kurnai College has been designed for students who have been identified as unlikely to succeed in a full VCE course. The aim of the program is to further develop the students' numeracy and literacy skills in preparation for the work force. The program operates over a four-day period for both year 11 and year 12. The remaining day of the week is taken up with work experience, TAFE or Scope courses, and/or VCE courses at the Maryvale campus. The outsourced TAFE and/or Scope courses to run have been determined by the students' interests or needs. There is a lot of variety in this course, and it is something which the students have embraced.</para><para>I received a letter from one of the students, whom I will not name in the parliament, in relation to this. She writes:</para><quote><para>To Mr Zahra,</para><para>I am writing to you as I have been in the Alt program for two year's nearly now and I would have to say that I have learnt more than what I thought I ever would after leaving school in year 10. The Alt program is very beneficial as it has built up my self-esteem, confidence, and has proved me wrong as I did not think that I would ever finish school.</para><para>The Alt program is also very beneficial as you get more one to one, so they get you ready to go out to the big world with more of an opportunity than those who may not be capable of finishing there vce.</para><para>I think it would be a shame if there was no funding for the Alt next year as a lot of people would miss out on a great opportunity and not get the support that they really need and that support is exactly what the Alt program gives those who need schooling assistance.</para><para>Doing the Alt program you also get to do work experience, course's such as hospitality, First aid and they also help you with finding way's to help get you a job for when you leave.</para></quote><para>I think her sentiments are dead right. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dunkley Electorate: Seize the Day Conference</title><page.no>21199</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>21199</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to bring to the House's attention another very successful Seize the Day conference. Members may be aware that each year the Frankston cluster of secondary colleges takes a number of students away from each of the colleges to a weekend workshop where we do a range of things, mainly inculcating these students with the key competencies. For those who are not aware of the key competencies, there are seven: collecting, analysing and organising information; communicating ideas and information; planning and organising; working with others and in teams; using mathematical ideas and techniques; solving problems; and using technology. </para></talk.start><para>The group involved in organising Seize the Day believes that these transferable capacities are applicable to any type of career path a young person may choose to pursue and also to their broader life and that they complement the academic studies and the VET available in schools and the expanded range of programs at secondary colleges, as a result of the Howard government policies. We believe that these key competencies complement those things very neatly, providing a workplace capacity for young people as they move out into adult life.</para><para>I have to commend Heather Worrall. Heather used to be a senior staff member at Monterey Secondary College, my former school, but she has now moved over to Patterson River Secondary College. To her credit and to the credit of Bob Stephens, the principal of Patterson River Secondary College, she has taken with her the organising of this weekend.</para><para>From Frankston High School, we had Grant Frost, Joel Warner, Travis Devalle, Andrew White and Adrian Kirke in attendance. Karingal Park Secondary College was represented by five students: Zsombor Bathy, Eleanor Tregoweth, Meg Beilken, Andrew Van De Beek and Ami Govett. Monterey Secondary College was again well represented with six students: Emma Quigley, Robbie Comfort, Jaime Jenkinson, Elsie Douglas, Glen Tate and Yana Kurpershoek. Mount Eliza Secondary College had three students there: Kerri Pope, Lachlan Mason and Erin Lysaght. Mount Erin Secondary College was represented by Brooke Munday, Craig Wright, Danielle Skelly, Sarah Catlin and Kiel Saunders. Patterson River Secondary College was represented by six students: Erin Shute, Matthew Clark, Christy Treble, Amanda Murphy, Beau Rixon and Deanna McLeod.</para><para>Those students were treated to a weekend at a conference venue in the Dandenongs, where a number of people from industry freely gave of their time to make presentations and to share with those young people the sorts of challenges and pathways that each of them pursued to achieve success in their lives, in the hope that some of that could be passed on to the students. The students were fortunate in that David Nicolson, Manager of Learning and Organisation Development, BP Australia, was a prominent figure on the weekend, explaining how the key competencies are an everyday part of corporate life in BP Australia and, therefore, connecting the learning experience with the real life workplace.</para><para>Professor Michael Carr-Gregg provided a presentation at the function. Jenni King, of Post Compulsory Education from the Victorian Department of Education, Employment and Training, also contributed. Hamish Riddell, from the Australian Retailers Association, talked about careers in retailing. We also had Emma Viskic, who is a professional musicianâa frightfully talented ladyâsharing the toils of being a professional musician. Keith White was there from Lavender Hill Multimedia. We also had, from the colleges concerned, Heather Worrall, whom I have mentioned; Robert Sutton from Mount Erin Secondary College; Robert Stephens; Sue Robinson from Mount Eliza Secondary College; Bruce Parish from Karingal Park Secondary College; Roger Page from Mount Erin Secondary College; David Kidd from Frankston High School; and Peter Hubble, who is a prominent character at these weekends.</para><para>The whole exercise of people from the professional world sharing their career experiences with these young people helped the young people to think about their goals in life, about the pathways that are available to them and how there are stepping stones that each of them can pursue to achieve fulfilment in their lives. Hopefully, from the presentations that were provided, they will learn a bit from our mistakes and from those who are already out there, about how to develop their networks, draw from the experience of others and develop their key competenciesâthe things that employers are looking for not only in the school environment but outside of school as well. They can develop a very attractive kitbag of capacity that they can take with them into adult life and into the work force.</para><para>I am delighted to have again sponsored this event. It is a great credit to the Patterson River Secondary College and all the participating secondary colleges from the Frankston area. This is a very worthwhile initiative, and I hope that the young people who were fortunate enough to participate in it grasp the opportunities with both hands and make a real go out of the learning that was available from the weekend. Congratulations to all who were involved. We are looking forward to seeing these individuals from the Dunkley electorateâthese young people, oozing talent and capacityâmaking a very substantial contribution not only to our own community but to the nation's life in the years to come. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cystic Fibrosis</title><page.no>21201</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>21201</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis evening I would like to raise again the issue of cystic fibrosis, CF, and the related issue of the carers allowance which, until July 1998, constituted a fortnightly payment and a Healthcare card for the sufferer. Since my election, I have come into contact with two families in my electorate of Lowe who have a CF sufferer and who have been discriminated against by the policy change of the government with regard to the carers allowance. One of these families are Drummoyne residents Ron and Suzanne Ford and their daughter Amelia, who has CF. My wife, Adriana, and I met Ron, Suzanne and Amelia when they attended my electorate office a few months ago. We were made aware of the level of devotion required from parents and carers to help a CF child in order to provide them with the best quality of life possible. Caring for a CF child is a 24-hour a day job. Make no mistake: the workload is immense and the expenses associated with caring for a CF sufferer are considerable.</para></talk.start><para>What exactly is CF? CF is a severe, incurable genetic disease which finally leads to the sufferer's death from complications caused by the disease. The disease mainly affects the lungs, making normal secretions thick and sticky, leading to repeated lung infections and eventually to respiratory failure. CF also affects the gastrointestinal system, with the result that CF sufferers must take enzyme supplements with their food to aid digestion. My colleague the member for Braddon, who is sitting with me today, has been a champion of this particular issue and has raised the issue of the carers allowance for this terrible disease a number of times in this chamber. He said in the House on 10 March 1999:</para><quote><para>... each day of care involves several rounds of home based physiotherapy and nebuliser treatment, dietary supplementation, exhaustive provision of enzymes and their monitoring.</para></quote><para>In the case of many CF sufferers, there are also other illnesses to cope with, including diabetes and asthma. A daily management routine requires total dedication to ensure that the correct dosages and preparations are administered appropriately and on time. Not just anyone is able to do this task: even family and friends may have difficulty understanding and catering for the complex needs of a CF child.</para><para>I would also mention that the emotional and physical impact on the family of the CF child is tremendous. The average life expectancy of a child with CF used to be five years, but in Australia it has now increased to 30 years due to medical advances and improvements in care for CF sufferers. The main factor in the increase of life expectancy is the care and management that devoted parents and carers give to their children. However, the carers allowance, which was abolished in July 1998, has also played a part in increasing the life expectancy of those with CF. Ron and Suzanne Ford recently wrote to me and said: </para><quote><para>We find it ironic that the very allowance that created an environment of proper care has been cancelled due to the good results received. The life expectancy of CF children will now decline as many parents in lesser financial circumstances will be unable to provide the care needed.</para></quote><para>During the review process in 1998, the then Department of Social Security advised that seven chronic medical conditions, including CF, were being proposed for automatic inclusion to receive the carers allowance. However, in the final result, all but CF were included. For no apparent reason, the functional assessment tool, the test used by the department to measure eligibility for the carers allowance, continues to deny the families of CF sufferers the child allowance. Be assured, Mr Speaker, that the allowance of $75.10 per fortnight which assisted parents prior to July 1998âthose who were recipients prior to this date will still be eligible for the allowance until 2003âwould have made reaching the quality of life we all enjoy more likely for children who suffer this chronic disease. But, as far as heartless Minister Newman and the Department of Family and Community Services are concerned, CF is no longer considered a disability or a chronic medical condition. This $75.10 per fortnight does not even begin to cover the many expenses associated with caring for a child with CF. </para><para>On 15 March 2000 in this House, on behalf of my Abbottsford constituents Paul and Annette Cahill, whose son Paul suffers from CF, I called on the members of the government to reverse the evil decision made by Minister Newman and allow the families of CF sufferers to access the child allowance. Tonight, on behalf of children like Paul and Amelia who suffer from this terrible disease, I once again call on the government to reverse the decision and give these children an opportunity to lead a higher quality of life, not to make victims of them. The member for Braddon, who is sitting here and supporting me tonight and, as I said earlier, has championed this issue, has pointed out to me the absurdity of the government's mean-spirited policy on CF. It is demonstrated by the conclusion that parents who lovingly do everything for a child suffering with CF make their chances of getting a carers allowance more remote, but if they neglect the child their prospect of receiving the allowance increases proportionately. This is disgraceful, and the government should be flogged on the issue.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>South Australia: 25th Anniversary of Vietnamese Settlement</title><page.no>21202</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>21202</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast weekend, on Saturday, 7 October 2000, I had the privilege of attending a dinner celebrating the 25th anniversary of Vietnamese settlement in South Australia. The Vietnamese Christian Community Centre at Pooraka, situated in my electorate of Makin, was an ideal location to celebrate this significant anniversary. Those present included the Governor of South Australia, his excellency Sir Eric Neal; Lady Neal; my parliamentary colleagues, most especially the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Neil Andrew MP, member for Wakefield; the honourable member for Adelaide, Trish Worth; the state member for Unley and Minister for Employment, Water, Resources and Youth Affairs, Mark Brindal, representing the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen; the Mayor of the City of Salisbury, Mr Tony Zappia, and his wife Viki; and various Vietnamese, religious and community leaders, especially Father Augustine, Sister Elizabeth and Mr Son Van Nguyen, who is president of the Vietnamese Christian community in South Australia. We all joined in the Prime Minister's message of congratulations to the Vietnamese Christian community on the occasion of the 25th anniversary.</para></talk.start><para>The tireless work of Sister Elizabeth and Father Augustine, stalwarts of the South Australian Vietnamese community, was appropriately recognised on the evening. Guests were treated to an evening of reminiscing, entertainment and traditional Vietnamese culture in the form of traditional costume, song, dance and music.

It was an honour and a pleasure to be involved in the 25th anniversary celebrations, and I thank the Vietnamese community for this privilege. I congratulate each and every individual who is part of the Vietnamese settlement in South Australia for their wonderful contribution. </para><para>While I would like to acknowledge that the Vietnamese community in Pooraka in my electorate of Makin are progressing well with the development of their local soccer fields, I would also like to encourage them to take up the challenge of developing football fields that will hopefully unearth future Adelaide Crows players from our Vietnamese community to play for South Australia. In closing, I would like to thank the Speaker of the House of Representatives for taking the opportunity to attend what was a very special occasion in my electorate of Makin, as it was a great honour to have both you and your charming wife, Carolyn, to join in celebrating the 25th anniversary of Vietnamese settlement in South Australia.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>21203</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 6.29 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>21204</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Portfolio Compliance</title><page.no>21204</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1778)</subtitle><id.no>1778</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21204</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hatton</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 14 August 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Is the Minister's Department and agencies within the Minister's portfolio compliant in respect of the Goods and Services Tax.</para><para>	(2) What action did the Minister's Department and agencies within the Minister's portfolio take to ensure that they were GST ready by 1 July 2000.</para><para>	(3) Is the Minister able to guarantee that no agency within the Minister's portfolio will suffer negative impacts on its budget or services due to the GST; if not, or if the guarantee was subsequently proved incorrect, would the Minister be prepared to resign.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21204</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) I am advised that my portfolio is compliant.</para><para>	(2) GST compliance within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA), the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) has been achieved through a comprehensive implementation program that commenced in August 1999.  The implementation was monitored and guided by a high level taskforce that included representatives from across key areas of DIMA, the MRT and the RRT.  The Taskforce met on a regular basis and periodically briefed the Departmental executive and myself.</para><para>	In addition to the internal management and monitoring of the implementation, the Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) monitored the progress of all agencies in implementation of the GST.  DOFA's monitoring was undertaken over the period from November 1999 to May 2000 via a series of comprehensive questionnaires and interviews.  DOFA assessed progress on implementation from these questionnaires and interviews and reported the findings to me and each of the agency's chief executive officers.</para><para>	During May 2000, DIMA engaged a consultant to assess the preparedness of its business and IT systems to cope with the GST, and to make recommendations of enhancements required to achieve GST compliance where any deficiencies were identified.  The consultant reported in mid June that if DIMA's implementation program continued as planned, DIMA would achieve compliance by 1 July 2000.</para><para>	(3) The implementation and ongoing management of tax reforms by DIMA, the RRT and the MRT is the responsibility of their respective chief executive officers.  While the Government will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation of The New Tax System, the reforms are not expected to reduce the level of funding of these agencies in real terms.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>HMAS Westralia: Deaths</title><page.no>21204</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1781)</subtitle><id.no>1781</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21204</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Price</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 14 August 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Did he ask for a report from Navy about the allegations in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin </inline>article of 16 May 2000 concerning an alleged cover up about the four deaths on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Westralia</inline>; if so, (a) when and (b) what were the details requested of Navy.</para><para>	(2) Has the report been provided to him; if so, when; if not, why not.</para><para>	(3) Will he make the report publicly available; if so, when; if not, why not.</para><para>	(4) Has he taken action on the report; if so, what; if not, why not.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21204</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Moore</name><name.id>EI4</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Yes.</para><para>	(a) 10 May 2000.</para><para>	(b) Information was requested on alleged deficiencies in administration and training. </para><para>	(2) Yes.

More significantly, however, the statement went on to state, and I quote, ânevertheless, the system is under increasing strain.  If not addressed, our Governments believe that these difficulties may jeopardise the effectiveness and credibility of the treaty bodies.  These bodies are faced with increasing numbers of reports and communications to consider against a background of reduced or static resources.â</para><para>	The statement also noted a report submitted in 1997 by Professor Phillip Alston which demonstrated the significant growth in the committees' workload.  For example, in 1989, 646 reports were overdue.  In 1993 that number had increased to 714, by 1997 to 957, and by 1999 to 1,146.</para><para>	The statement then went on make several practical recommendations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the committees.  These included the allocation of greater resources to support the committees, the adoption by the committees of a more focused approach to their work, the provision of shorter, more focused reports by states parties, international assistance for countries that have identified a need for assistance to improve their capacity to report to treaty bodies, and closer cooperation between states parties and the UN system.</para><para>	(2) The Government has not, I repeat not, withdrawn Australia from its obligations to the Human Rights Committee under Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or from any of its other international human rights obligations.</para><para>	The Government's review of the UN treaty body system has resulted in a determination by the Government to intensify its efforts to work with like-minded countries and within the UN system to achieve much-needed reform of the treaty committees.  This is essential in order to ensure that the work of the committees continues to be relevant to their mandate of assisting states parties to meet their obligations, and that they accord due weight and respect to submissions from democratically elected governments which, such as Australia, have excellent human rights records.</para><para>	As announced on 29 August, the Government will develop a high level diplomatic initiative with Ministerial leadership, together with more strategic use of meetings of states parties, to address our concerns.  The Government will establish a standing inter-departmental committee jointly chaired by my Department and the Attorney-General's Department to progress reform of the treaty committee system and coordinate future interaction with the treaty committees.</para><para>	(3) See answer to (2).</para><para>	(4) See answer to (2).</para><para>	(5) See answer to (2).</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
