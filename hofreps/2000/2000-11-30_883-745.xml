In comparing the application of the national privacy principles to existing data in the bill to the law that applied when the public sector provisions of the Privacy Act were introduced in 1988, I said that the retrospective aspects of the bill mirror the provisions that applied to the public sector at the time that the public sector provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 were introduced. That is at <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> page 22387. My department had provided this advice but has now re-examined the issue. I am now advised that the position under the bill is more complex than my statement might suggest.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The broad approach in section 15 of the Privacy Act 1988 and clause 16(c) of the <inline ref="R1049">Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000</inline> is the same in that some principles will apply to all information whenever collected and some only to information collected after commencement. However, it is necessary to consider the position in relation to each particular issue. For instance, I acknowledge that, in relation to the particular issue of access to and correction of personal information, the position under the proposed bill is that the relevant NPP on this issue only applies to information collected after the commencement of the bill. The explanatory memorandum on the bill makes this clear. In this respect, the position does not mirror the position under the 1988 act. In certain other respects, such as national privacy principles Nos 1 and 4, the position in relation to collection and security of information under the bill is consistent with the position taken in relation to those issues under the act.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES: WITHDRAWAL OF COMMENTS</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>23105</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>23105</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a matter of unfinished business from yesterday.

You can of course give indulgence to any member of the House, as you see fit, at any point in time, but the unfinished business here surely would take precedence over any indulgence. A request for a withdrawal is a simple matter—a simple, ordinary matter. It happens every day in this chamber and every day you exercise your authority. If, after the minister has withdrawn, you are prepared to give him some sort of indulgence, that is a matter entirely for you. But what is there in precedence is that you now have the first opportunity to act, with this minister being in the House after he has been requested to withdraw a statement about a member of parliament who has been offended by something he has said, and that ought to take precedence over anything else he does.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Reith</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, on the further point of order—</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—This is the last occasion that I will recognise a point of order on the current ruling before me.

This day has arrived without precedent basically because of faults in your own rulings.

Generally speaking, when a Leader of the Opposition gets up and asks for a withdrawal of a comment that has been made, it is withdrawn unreservedly. I realise you have a child, an unguided missile and a bully on your hands in the form of the Minister for Employment Services, and that is a difficult thing for a Speaker to deal with at the best of times. But it is one thing to have a termagant on your hands and quite another thing to allow him to get away with it.</para><para>This morning, it was time to bring this character, who has gone out there over the last 24 hours in defiance of the concerns that you expressed yesterday, to order.

She did not do live media lest she be asked the obvious question: how can you keep the so-and-sos honest when you are taking their money?</para></quote><para>This is plain language. It is a suggestion in this plain language that the member for Dickson had received a bribe. That was the implication of it, and it is against those sorts of implications that the standing orders stand to protect members. Then the minister came into this chamber and, firstly, misled this chamber by saying that all he had said was of generic application to Democrats as opposed to the member for Dickson—that particular proposition is a defeat of plain language, I would have thought—and then compounded this reasonable interpretation of it by getting up and moving a motion in this chamber to try to get the member for Dickson to come in and state that she had not received a bribe. It was a classic `when did you stop beating your wife' type performance. None of that would have happened if something very simple had occurred earlier this day, and that is if normal standing orders had proceeded.</para><para>I was reminded earlier today of an incident in the Senate in 1986 when my Senate colleague from Western Australia Peter Walsh described Senator Walters as a `harpy'. Walsh then left the chamber after a withdrawal had been demanded. The President of the Senate—and remember the President of the Senate does not necessarily have a majority supporting them—sent the Black Rod down to Walsh's office to arrest him to bring him back into the chamber to make a formal withdrawal. That was Doug McClelland—that was a Presiding Officer. That is what happened then. That was a President of the Senate determined to uphold the standards of the Senate. He was prepared to have the Black Rod arrest the minister to oblige him to enter the chamber to make a formal withdrawal. That is guts; that is defence of the parliamentary process.</para><para>That was not actually required of you, Mr Speaker. There was just a simple requirement for the Minister for Employment Services to get up and withdraw. And I note that recently you have developed this habit of also asking for apologies—though I must say that is nowhere in standing orders that I can find. Nevertheless, it might have been useful on that particular occasion to ask for an apology as well. Accusing somebody of taking bribes in the political process is in anybody's terms, in anybody's language, an offence against standing orders that requires, at a minimum, a motion and, backing up that motion, a serious presentation of evidence to that extent.</para><para>None of those things of course were occurring. That is how this whole imbroglio started. Then, after their smart alec efforts at seizing the standing orders in this place and getting stuck into us, they found themselves arguing against impossible propositions that rulings were not rulings—absurd propositions. Whenever you pronounce on the standing orders you make a ruling. Whether the ruling is clear-cut in your favour or whether it is an area of discretion—whatever—it is a ruling. You make rulings when you are asked by members of parliament. You cannot sit in the chair and say, `This is not a ruling. I am just giving you some sort of advice.' Of course you cannot do that. Everything you say from the chair, because you are the Presiding Officer in charge of standing orders, is a ruling—every point is a ruling. </para><para>A motion of dissent may be well based or ill based and, generally speaking, motions of dissent rarely are moved in this place. You find yourself in this situation, as I said, only partially through fault of your own. But, at the end of the day, you have to be independent of all of us and you have to make rulings. If we dissent from your rulings, that is a matter for debate in this chamber; it is a perfect entitlement of all members to do it. But, in persistently trying to slip-slide around that, we finally get to a position where a dissent motion was acceptable even to you and your very strange interpretation of what a ruling is in this place. That dissent motion was then put before this chamber, and in the course of that dissent motion the bells were rung. They were rung for a period of one minute. We on our side of the House suggested that perhaps they should have been rung longer. When we suggested that they should have been rung longer, you ruled that we were wrong. You ruled that it was perfectly appropriate in the circumstances for the bells to have been rung for one minute. It is not as though there was any doubt in the minds of any member in this chamber. There was a small problem with that, in that one or two of the folk who voted ultimately for you found themselves on our side at the normal closure of the division and were allowed, as you spoke slowly, to move to the other side.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>—After you had closed it, two of them came through the door. Had they been locked out, it would have been 55-57 against you. Then there was the vote, and the vote was 57-all. It was a vote legitimately counted in this chamber and a division legitimately held when all objections that could have been raised to it—that is, that the doors had not been quickly enough locked on the other side and that one minute was not a long enough period of time for the division to be held—had been ruled on by you. Those were the only potential impurities in the division, and before the count was held you had ruled on both of them. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Then, when you finally had handed to you, after avoiding it for a period of some 10 minutes, the Clerk's recording of the division, you stood up and said that as far as you were concerned there was a sufficient level of confusion for you not to cast your vote either for or against yourself and to invite a further division in this chamber. There was no confusion or error. You had given clear-cut rulings. Nobody was lying in the crossbenches there who was counted twice on one side or the other by the tellers. There was no issue as to whether or not the particular bodies in the seats at the time were alive. There was no issue as far as that was concerned. There was no question of a stranger in the House appearing to vote when the stranger should not have been voting. There was no question of that. There was no question of a member under suspension voting in the chamber and creating confusion and contaminating the result as a result of that. There was no person involved at all in confusing the division. Any potential inadequacies in that division had already been ruled on by you, and we did not persist with them. You made the ruling that the couple of characters who were let in after the doors were supposed to have been closed could vote. Fine, we did not persist with it. You made the ruling that one minute was long enough for the division after we had asked for it to be longer. We did not persist with it. We accepted the rulings that you made. And then the vote came to 57-57.</para><para>Now you find yourself in the position of working out what it is that you ought to be doing. You have to make a choice between your job and the dignity of this place—between your job and the operation of these standing orders. I am afraid, Mr Speaker, you did not take the choice that most accords with the dignity of this place; hence we have been obliged to move no confidence in you—no confidence in your handling of the processes around this division and no confidence in the way in which you have handled this particular minister, who has been treated with kid gloves over the course of the last 24 hours. I can recollect yesterday, one after another, our people being obliged to withdraw. I cannot recollect one of those withdrawals involving an accusation on the other side that they had been involved in bribery or that they had been involved in, for example, that particular incident which occurred in New South Wales when a member of parliament—a senior Liberal—invited the Shooters Party to change their preferences on the basis of a payment. We made no accusations to the Prime Minister on those matters, though he was the leader of the party at that point in time. We had plenty of opportunity to sling mud yesterday on those particular matters, but we did not. Only had we done so would we have found ourselves in a position where somebody on this side of the House said something anywhere remotely as offensive as was said by this particular minister. </para><para>This particular minister is the classic bomb thrower. He is so proud of his reputation that he does not care what happens to you, he does not care what happens to the government and he does not care what happens to decent standing orders in this place. He is utterly arrogant. From time to time people who live their lives in a state of suspended adolescence arrive in this chamber—people who spend their lives frozen in the school debating techniques of their childhood—people who have never left the sandpit do arrive in this place, and of course have no moral function, no moral direction and no understanding of the traditions that apply in this chamber, only an utter self-centredness, an utter pridefulness and an utter disregard for the basic decencies which dominate the political processes. Those children have to be stood on by Speakers to establish their authority. There is one child in this House now, and this is the child who has got you into trouble. But the child could have been dealt with by you, Mr Speaker, so simply, so easily. All you required of him was a simple withdrawal. He could have moved his childish motion after that if he had wanted to. He could have moved his childish suspension of standing orders, if he had wanted to, at that point in time, having been subject to the normal decent processes that apply to the rest of us. But that, Mr Speaker, was not a course you took. You have, as a Speaker, made error after error in your handling of this material over the course of the last 24 hours. You have allowed the chair to be defied; you have allowed the chair, therefore, to be defiled in the way in which you have conducted yourself in this regard. Then, finally, you have allowed a division to be bodgied. This House can have no confidence in you at all. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMullan</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>23120</page.no><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter (Leader of the House)</name><name role="display">Mr REITH</name><name.id>WI4</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, you are a good Speaker; Mr Speaker, you are an honest Speaker.

Just to give you a quick example, I could barely believe my ears but I did hear the Leader of the Opposition say, `Everything you say is a ruling,' therefore attempting to justify some of the absurd motions that he moved this morning. I refer you to page 204 of <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice </inline>where it says that, in 1984, Speaker Jenkins named a member and an attempt was made to dissent from his ruling in naming the member. The Speaker then ruled that the proposed motion of dissent was not in order as he had not made a ruling. In other words, there was a Labor Speaker making the very point that you made this morning, and we had this, quite frankly, stupid suggestion—but I say it was a malicious suggestion—from the Leader of the Opposition. He knows otherwise, because he has been a Leader of the House. That claim that those motions that he moved this morning in dissent were validly based he knows to be wrong. For him then to use that as justification for this motion shows you that, when he is after a political objective—in this particular case, the Minister for Employment Services—this weak leader is prepared to attack a Speaker who is well respected by people on his own side. So he was simply attacking you, Mr Speaker, and fabricating arguments for his own political purposes. That is weakness in the extreme, and we utterly and completely reject it, as we will of course completely reject this baseless, uncalled for, unreasonable and unjustifiable motion.</para></talk.start></continue><para>All this comes about—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Denison is warned!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter (Leader of the House)</name><name role="display">Mr REITH</name></talker><para>—because yesterday, as is often the case in question time, there was a controversy.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kernot, Cheryl, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter (Leader of the House)</name><name role="display">Mr REITH</name></talker><para>—I do not think the member for Dickson should throw barbs in our direction when the Manager of Opposition Business used the word `scumbag' in the House this morning, reminiscent of one of the worst offenders in this House, namely, the former leader of the Labor Party—the man from whom the Leader of the Opposition learnt some of his tricks—former Prime Minister Keating.

Big deal. What he referred to was a slogan of the Australian Democrats. That slogan was: `Vote for the Democrats and we will keep the bastards honest'. That is the slogan to which he referred. Yesterday in question time he referred to the fact that, to your great embarrassment, the Australian Democrats were receiving money from the Labor Party in a preference deal. In the 1996 election the party that said they would keep both sides honest in fact did a secret deal with the Labor Party. That is your embarrassment. Then, of course, the member for Dickson joined the Labor Party and she is now on their front bench. No wonder you are embarrassed! So what is the Labor Party's tactic today? They came in here today and they were acting so affronted! After the years of abuse which they have piled onto our side the Leader of the Opposition made an obvious statement, namely, that the Democrats—and in particular, because she was the leader of the Democrats, the member for Dickson—were involved in a deal to receive money from the Labor Party in an exchange of preferences. They waltzed in here full of fabricated and confected concern, anger and angst about those particular comments. They had every opportunity to allow the member for Dickson to get up on her feet and explain herself. In fact, when it was obvious that they were so determined to have a debate on this matter we offered them the opportunity. The Minister for Employment Services actually moved a motion to suspend standing orders to provide her with the opportunity to speak. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Many things are said in this place. When you considered the matter yesterday at the end of question time, Mr Speaker, you took a different interpretation of what was said. No-one in this House could ask more of a Speaker than what you did yesterday: you stood up and honestly and decently said, on the basis of what you had heard—and no-one should forget that when you are sitting in the Speaker's chair, with the babble that comes from the opposition side, you do not always hear every last word—that you had heard these words uttered and you thought they meant one thing and that you were therefore prepared to go away and have a look at the matter. Seriously, can anybody genuinely believe that any more could be asked of a Speaker? When the Labor Party was running this country and we had Labor Speakers we never had as fair a go as the fair go you yesterday provided to the opposition on this matter. Furthermore, you provided ample opportunities in giving the opposition the call this morning. They were up and down on their feet like yoyos this morning. The Minister for Employment Services provided the context within which he made his remarks, and that basically was the end of it. But, of course, from the Labor Party's point of view, it cannot be the end of it because so embarrassed are they by this matter, when they came in here and had the opportunity to put up the member for Dickson, what did they do? They attacked the Speaker. Instead of defending their own, because they do not trust her to get on her own two feet to explain herself, no, they fabricate an attack on you, Mr Speaker. Part of that fabrication was to say—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Melbourne Ports is not in his seat and I warn him.

Given the fact that the member for Lilley had in the House publicly disclosed and confirmed it—and we know that the Leader of the Opposition knows all about it because he has had them all in to explain themselves—how can it be contested? That was a fact on the record in the House, and it is a shame on you that you should attack the Speaker as a political defence on your own part. </para></talk.start></continue><para>A couple of other things need to be said. First of all, I mentioned the rulings. The fact is that the standing orders are the standing orders and you simply implement those standing orders. There are times and circumstances under the standing orders where it is necessary for you to exercise a discretion, and it is quite clear from reading the standing orders. For example, with respect to the closing of the doors—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Prospect is warned!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter (Leader of the House)</name><name role="display">Mr REITH</name></talker><para>—It is only a small point but it again contradicts what the Leader of the Opposition claimed. With respect to the closing of the doors, that is not a discretion for the Speaker—an exercise to let a few in to suit yourself, which was the snide, unpleasant, totally unsubstantiated accusation. The fact is this is a requirement under the standing orders. This does not require an exercise of your discretion. It is as simple as this: as the standing orders require, the doors are closed—full stop. Again, sure, it is a small matter in a sense, but it is typical of the Leader of the Opposition to make any claim, regardless of the standing orders and regardless of the facts, because he is fabricating a completely baseless, unjustified motion and arguments in support of it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In respect of the four minutes and the one minute, I thought there was intervening debate. I am now not quite sure whether there was or there was not, quite frankly. But I know this: we had had at least two, if not three, divisions beforehand. I do know that the government won the election last time around, I do know that we do have the numbers on this side of the House and I do know that some members of the House were off to the Main Committee, off to their other job, if you like. If they had thought there was going to be another division, they would have been entitled to think and entitled to presume, as I think the Leader of the Opposition half admitted, that there would be a four-minute break. Well, there was a one-minute break and I saw some of them standing outside. Quite frankly, so what! It is hardly the biggest deal I have ever heard of. So what! <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>23123</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob (Manager of Opposition Business)</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a crisis that arises because of a failure of leadership of the Prime Minister. It is his responsibility to point you into line, Mr Speaker. He had the opportunity yesterday to not put you in this position because he could have and should have required the Minister for Employment Services to come in here and withdraw, and he did not. He spoke to him after question time, but it is clear he did not require him to come in and withdraw, as he should have done. It is ultimately the responsibility of the Prime Minister to ensure that these people who misbehave in such a childish, irresponsible, rude and continually arrogant manner get pulled into line, not earmarked for promotion. It is a failure of leadership.</para></talk.start><para>There is an issue more serious—that is, the issue we raise with you, Mr Speaker, about your behaviour today and why we have a lack of confidence in it, accepting, as we do, that you have been put in an extremely difficult position by the irresponsibility of the Minister for Employment Services and the incompetence of the Leader of the House. We do understand you were put in a difficult position, but this is not a minor matter. When we have a division in this House, the Constitution of Australia says how it should be determined, and it has not been applied. Section 40 of the Constitution says:</para><quote><para>Questions arising in the House of Representatives shall be determined by a majority of votes other than that of the Speaker. The Speaker shall not vote unless the numbers are equal, and then he shall have a casting vote. </para></quote><para>That does not say, `Unless he feels like calling a second division.' It does not say, `It's a bit embarrassing, let's have another vote.' So what cover did you develop, on the best advice you had but on advice which was not good enough? That you would go for section 208 and say that there was an error or confusion. The Leader of the Opposition has clearly destroyed the potential argument that there was an error. There was nothing which occurred that was not known before the vote was declared. There was nothing that was known that did not establish clearly in advance that the vote was being conducted in a manner which you considered was proper and valid and in conformity with your decisions. </para><para>Had the rules been more precisely applied, the vote would have been carried, because the member for Mitchell and the member for Makin would not have been entitled to vote since they came in after the doors should have been closed. Okay, that happened. But there is another reason why the vote should have been carried—that is, if the standing orders were being consistently applied. One member on our side yesterday was suspended for 24 hours. The nature of her apology to you, Mr Speaker, was not sufficiently grovelling, so you suspended her for 24 hours. What she said and in light of what you now know was the provocation that led her to do it suggest that hers was a much lesser offence than that of the Minister for Employment Services—for which you gave him the opportunity to repeat his remarks. You did not require him to withdraw them. You let him say, `No, I repeat them, I reiterate them, and then I want to move a motion to say that the person who is aggrieved should explain themselves.' Not the aggressor, but the victim! He gets the chance to say, `The person against whom I made this slur should explain the basis of the slur but I shouldn't have to withdraw it.' So, Mr Speaker, if you had applied the standing orders consistently, the member for Fowler would have been in here voting, the motion would have been carried and then we would have had a very interesting situation. You would not have had to worry about your casting vote. It would have been carried. </para><para>It is clear that there is no argument to support your position or the Leader of the House would have used it. But he did not use one. He thought he might get away with attacking the member for Dickson again. She must have had the temerity to win a seat they thought they were going to win. What a shocking thing! And this offence has been something for which she has served a penalty of two years of sustained attack from the Minister for Employment Services without justification or basis in fact. The things which he said yesterday were not only scurrilous and unjustified, they were untrue. They seem to be pretty good grounds for requiring them to be withdrawn. Let me refer you, Mr Speaker, to how you defended him against statements that were made about him. Yesterday I said:</para><quote><para>No wonder David Oldfield left—you were not good enough for him!</para></quote><para>It is true that I said that. I still believe it to be true, and it was not generic. Mr Speaker, you said that you wanted to apply high standards: you asked me to withdraw the remark and I did. I said:</para><quote><para>Can I just seek clarification. I will withdraw—</para></quote><para>without qualification—</para><quote><para>but are you seriously saying I have to withdraw something that I said to him—</para></quote><para>the Minister for Employment Services—</para><quote><para>when he does not have to withdraw alleging that somebody took money? </para></quote><para>How can that be a fair application of the standing orders? When we say, `He is lower than David Oldfield'—which is true—`and David Oldfield left,' you say it is unparliamentary, but it is much less of an accusation than that which he made about the member for Dickson. I, unlike him, have the defence of truth. My statement is accurate; his is false. He preceded his statement by another false statement when he said that she `issued a press release. She did not do live media'. Even the presumption on which it was based was false, and then he went on to make false, unreasonable assertions which the standing orders say absolutely have to be withdrawn.</para><para>We understand that you initially misinterpreted his remarks and, critical as we are of what has happened subsequently, we did not criticise you for that. In fact, we bent over backwards to give you time to require him to withdraw. We said we wanted it done yesterday, but at the end of the sitting we accepted, reluctantly, your advice to us that he would come in this morning. We accepted that that put you in extremely difficult circumstances because of the character, personality and consistent pattern of behaviour of this minister—the only minister who has had to be thrown out of this place for his behaviour. That probably rescued him from something more serious if you had not which, in hindsight, we may regret, but you did the right thing then, Mr Speaker. But we bent over backwards to say, `Yes, let him come in this morning,' even though that meant the member for Dickson was subjected to that unjustifiable insult for the whole of yesterday and it was reported last night. And while you were being advised that the minister was not available to withdraw it, he was out repeating it. But he said, `I am not available. I am leaving. I am interstate.' He was out doing television interviews repeating the assertion. But even then we gave you time. Did you require a withdrawal? No, you gave him licence to reiterate. </para><para>It is an untenable position that you were put in but the standing orders say how you should resolve it. You should resolve it by requiring this person to withdraw. It needed to be withdrawn. Everybody in Australia knew it needed to be withdrawn, including the Minister for Employment Services. He simply chose to defy you and you chose to accept that defiance. You should not have done so and it has led to this series of events, culminating in that motion so incompetently handled by the government but which led to the division which you sought to have recounted, without a skerrick of justification, merely because it was extremely difficult and embarrassing. That is not, Mr Speaker, an acceptable standard for us and we cannot accept it. </para><para>It would not be, in my view, an appropriate course, but we are being left with little other than for us to come in here and say that the scandal which took place with the Liberal Party's behaviour during the Lindsay by-election was the responsibility of the Prime Minister. We have never said that, even though he took the state campaign director who was responsible at the time and promoted him into his office. We have never said that it was the Prime Minister's fault. We believe it was a rogue element in his party doing the wrong thing. But perhaps it was not, given that he promoted the person who was running the campaign at the time and brought him into his office. But we have never made that allegation. We have never made the allegation about the very worrying claims raised by the Chief Government Whip last night about behaviour in the Penrith City Council, which is part of a chain of events directly linked to the office of the local member, the member for Lindsay. We have never even said that the member for Lindsay knew about that, even though everybody involved worked in their office. We have never said that she knew about it. We have never held her responsible. We have certainly never said it was the Prime Minister's fault.</para><para>Those allegations would be equally as valid as the allegation the Minister for Employment Services sought to make and we have never made them and we will not unless we are forced to. But, can I make it very clear, there is a lot more if you actually want to go down this road. But we do not wish to do that and we do not wish your behaviour, Mr Speaker, to force us to do so. But let us make it clear: we will not sit idly by while this minister continually, rudely, arrogantly and untruthfully attacks one of our colleagues. It will not happen. Each time he comes in and, outside his portfolio, attacks our colleague, abuses our colleague and tells lies about our colleague we will not stand idly by. We will stand and fight. And if you do not stand up for the standing orders in that process, we will be forced to say that the failure which he started has flowed on to you. That is where we are today, the failure which this person started by his pattern of irresponsible, rude, arrogant, untruthful behaviour—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kernot, Cheryl, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Kernot</name></talker><para>—Serial.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob (Manager of Opposition Business)</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name></talker><para>—The pattern that this serial offender started has flowed on and you have been caught up in it. That is not all your fault, but you had the capacity to resolve it and you did not. That is what has led to this motion. In our view you should have resolved it yesterday, and you did not. You should have resolved it this morning, and you did not. That then led into a debate, consequent upon that failure, and we got into a very serious situation where a vote of no confidence in you was put and the government could not deliver a majority in support of you, Mr Speaker. They could not deliver a majority and you had to spend minutes pretending that you did not know what everybody here knew, what the result of the division was. In my view, it is not consistent with standing order 203—which requires you to declare the vote—your sitting there pretending. I see no evil, I hear no evil, so I can speak no evil is not an acceptable position for the Speaker. </para></talk.start></continue><para>You had to accept that that vote had been counted and led to a result which was uncomfortable and difficult and caused by the incompetence of the Leader of the House, to which you should be becoming accustomed. But it is not an acceptable position to fail to declare that vote and then, when the vote goes in a manner which is unacceptable, to seek to have it recommitted with no provision in the standing orders which justifies that provision. It is a very serious matter. It goes to the heart of how this parliament works. The Leader of the House said, `It should not matter because we won the election.' Maybe we will just call the parliament off and he could rule for three years or perhaps he could come in here with rottweilers and a few people in masks. But we are not going to have the balaclavas and rottweilers in here, Mr Speaker. We are going to stand up for the standing orders and we are going to stand up for our colleague and for the requirement that the standing orders be fairly, impartially and consistently enforced. When that is done by you, you will have our support and when it is not, you will have our censure. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>23126</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>—Withdraw!</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Opposition members</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline>Withdraw! </para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Minister for Employment Services will resume his seat.

What happened today in the House which sparked the behaviour of the opposition and which sparked the opposition's motion is that I came in here and clarified a comment yesterday which had obviously been misunderstood, perhaps wilfully misunderstood, by members opposite. Having clarified my comments yesterday, I then sought to give the member for Dickson an opportunity to fully explain her role in the 1996 preference selling deal. The most important point which has emerged from all the proceedings in this House today is that the member for Dickson has been gagged by her own side. The member for Dickson has been gagged by her own side because her own side do not trust the member for Dickson to explain exactly what happened in the course of that 1996 preference buying deal.

That is what I said yesterday. It was a reference to the fact that the Democrats slogan in 1996 was: keep the so-and-sos honest. At that time the member for Dickson was the leader of the Democrat party. There was a deal between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. We know that there was a deal. We know that there was a deal because the member for Lilley has told us in this House. </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Leo McLeay</name></talker><para>—No doubt, Mr Speaker, the lack of confidence motion in you has been caused by this minister, but he cannot canvass that.

In fact, he went straight from this House, scuttled out of this House, knowing that he had said something specific and not generic, and he repeated accusations in a doorstop of which I have a transcript. Amongst other things he said: `Where did the money go? Did someone pocket the money? Certainly Wayne Swan has admitted that the money was paid over.' And this is where the connection takes place, Mr Speaker. He said: `What happened to it? Cheryl Kernot was the leader of the Democrats at the time.' Make that connection, Mr Speaker. But the point—the reason that I mention my abhorrence of his hypocrisy—is that he went from that doorstop to Paul Lyneham's funeral service. The Comcar drivers told me that he arrived at 4.30. Obviously, he thought it was more important to get out there and continue to defame me than to go to the funeral service. But I want to point out that I think I have a perfectly valid right to point to the hypocrisy of a man who willingly joins in the following words. This is the man who considers himself a specialist on Catholic doctrine.

There is something of a John Kerr syndrome at work here in that the Labor Party will dump onto the person who refers it to the proper voting procedures or who processes the ultimate decision. So you are the subject of a no-confidence motion simply because you put the vote to the parliament. Where is the gravity of that error of judgment as alleged by the opposition? You simply left it to the parliamentarians to resolve the issue. I think it is odious of the opposition to bring this matter before you by way of a no-confidence motion.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is interesting that the Labor Party, having run two years of shock tactics in the House—of organised disruption, calculated noise and interference, interjections and points of order, so that they have overturned decades of established reasonable behaviour and restraint by parties on both sides of the House—now try to take the moral high ground. It simply does not work. It especially does not work to involve you in it. You have been a reformist Speaker of the parliament. You have faced daily provocation, at times from our side, and you have dealt with people on our side. I have been the subject of your warnings. Members on our side have been evicted from the House. We respect you for it, but the opposition do not, because they constantly test the boundaries of your authority. And when, Mr Speaker, you refer the final arbitration of this morning's prolonged and at times complicated exchange, they cry foul. They cry foul because the parliament resolved the issue as it ought to properly. </para><para>Let us look at this matter sequentially. It started yesterday, when there was a dispute about the interpretation of the words used by the Minister for Employment Services. The fundamental issue is that you—if I understand you correctly—came to the conclusion that the minister was referring to the Democrats generically, or as a party. As you explained yesterday, you had a different interpretation from that put on the minister's words by the member for Dickson, the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition at large. The dispute then arose about how to interpret those words and to what extent you would require withdrawal, but the minister was not in the House. You then, with typical fairness, balance and goodwill—for which you are rightly known—undertook to examine the record, which brings us to today.</para><para>The minister was spoken to. The minister gave an explanation, and points of order, in rapid fashion, followed. To try to resolve the matter, you then sought confirmation that the minister had not meant to reflect personally on the member for Dickson and that he withdrew any reflection on the shadow minister. As I understood the minister, he said that he was referring to the Democrats. This was not good enough for the opposition, because they wanted to stage-manage an attack on the Minister for Employment Services and, in doing so, were prepared to sacrifice the member for Dickson. They care not about her own personal position, because it was clarified this morning. Instead, they were prepared to trample on her standing, to confuse the issue and to muddy the waters, all for the purposes of attacking the Minister for Employment Services. You, also, were to be treated in the same fashion as the member for Dickson: as cannon fodder for their political opportunism and their political objectives.</para><para>The minister's explanation and your acquiescing in it this morning should have been good enough for the opposition. But it was never going to be good enough, because they had a political agenda. Whatever the cost to the dignity of the parliament, yours has not been infringed or compromised in any way. I cannot say the same about the parliament, but the Speaker rose above it. You properly and faithfully adhered to standing orders. You showed extraordinary cool, calmness and patience under constant provocation for more than one hour. There were dozens of interventions directed your way by way of points of order and questions—and insults, make no mistake, Mr Speaker, and nor have you. But, with good grace, you have decided to ignore or overlook the personal barbs thrown your way. If anyone is to emerge well from the heated debate and conflict this morning, it is you.</para><para>Mr Speaker, to continue on the events of today, you have properly fulfilled your duty as a Speaker, which is to determine whether words need to be withdrawn. You did so; you took the minister's word, as you do for all members. You were not affording the Minister for Employment Services any special treatment or favouritism—you dealt with him in the same way as you do all other members—but you had secured his withdrawal anyway. This will still not be acknowledged by the opposition—that the Speaker obtained the minister's withdrawal and clarification in any event. So all the nonsense and attacks that have followed, culminating in this phoney no-confidence motion, were totally unnecessary.</para><para>In the divisions that followed the vote was tied. You had the right to rely on a casting vote on the motion of dissent against you. Again showing the highest personal and professional standards, you did not give a vote in your own cause. It would have been the easiest thing for you to simply vote to strike down the malicious and contrived motion of dissent moved by the opposition. You did not do so. Instead you relied on your own judgment, in that you believed your ruling was correct, and indeed it was a correct ruling originally. </para><para>Speakers must make such decisions. It is not for oppositions or governments to complain if a decision that is fairly and properly reached by the Speaker goes against them. And that is what it is—the Labor Party will never accept the umpire's decision. The simple fact is that you are now the target of the opposition because they seek to attack the Minister for Employment Services and the government at large. Never forget, all of this could have been curtailed if the opposition had agreed to the minister's suspension of standing orders to allow the member for Dickson to state her case. It is as simple as that—this is a debating forum. But they did not want to let her.</para><para>I am sure the member for Dickson—not that I dare speak for her—like most members of this parliament, would have welcomed that opportunity. She has been boiling with frustration, understandably, and wanted her opportunity at the dispatch box to put her case and set the record straight as she sees it. Yet she was prevented from doing so from 9.30 this morning until midday—for 2½ hours the member for Dickson had to cool her heels because of the Labor Party. They ruthlessly exploited the member for Dickson's position so they could attack the Minister for Employment Services.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Banks is warned.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—In the end, Mr Speaker, you had to resolve this matter, after what you may well have considered a misjudgment or error in not allowing the four-minute division bells to ring, by calling for a fresh division. That is simply commonsense. Where there was—if there was—a mistake made in the length of time the division bells were rung which excluded a large number of members from participating in the division, as is their rightful responsibility, you called for another division. Why would the Labor Party object to a democratic vote in the House of Representatives?</para></talk.start></continue><para>Your action was courageous, Mr Speaker. The easiest thing for you to have done would have been to vote with the noes on the motion of dissent against your ruling. The simple fact is you upheld the best traditions of that chair in taking the decision you did, which was to put it back to the members of this House. There is no escaping our responsibility to decide these matters. As the Speaker has said on a number of occasions, along with his predecessors, the conduct and behaviour of this House is in the hands of the members themselves. So it was a brave decision which, to any fair or balanced member of the House, has only enhanced your standing as Speaker of the parliament.</para><para>Who really in this chamber believes in this no-confidence motion? The opposition do not believe in it. We saw a number of your predecessors behave in an undisguised partisan way and trample on individual rights. There are very few in recent memory who have brought the same sense of fair play and nonpartisanship to the chair in the way you have—but, I hasten to say, I do not name anyone in particular. But we all know that not all Speakers have thrown aside their political bias. There are reputed to have been Speakers in the past with close relationships to the leaders of their party, to the point where some might have accused them of doing their party's bidding. But I do not want to be deflected from the issue at hand, which is a motion of no confidence in you.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Chief Opposition Whip is already under a warning.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—Every time a minister or one of our backbenchers rises to his or her feet there are family insults coming from that side.

Registered levy payers will be able to exert their influence through voting rights, appointment of board members, and input to the company's policy development and planning activities.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Accountability</inline></para><para>The bill provides for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the two statutory corporations to the industry owned company. The detail of those arrangements will be included in the contract which will impose certain obligations and accountability requirements on the industry services body. In addition, details of the new industry services body's accountability arrangements to its members and to the Commonwealth will be outlined in its company constitution. </para><para>While the model allows the industry to have a greater say in the management of its affairs, there will also be increased responsibilities. The distancing of government's direct involvement means the industry accepts responsibility for its activities and appreciates there is no automatic recourse to government assistance when the going gets tough. In short, more than ever before, the industry will be responsible for planning its own future, strategically seeking priority outcomes, and managing for risk.</para><para>The package contains a number of accountability arrangements which will be detailed in the company constitution and the contract with the Commonwealth. These are:</para><para>·	comprehensive planning and reporting requirements with copies of plans and reports made available to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry;</para><para>·	regular performance reviews to assess the company's efficiency and effectiveness in meeting planned priorities;</para><para>·	for the chair of the industry company to meet with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry or his nominated delegate on a regular basis to discuss industry issues and government's priorities for R&amp;D; and</para><para>·	a requirement for a mix of producer and specialist skills based directors on the board of the company including a specialist in corporate governance.</para><para>If the company changes its constitution in a way considered unacceptable by government, becomes insolvent or fails to comply with the legislation or contract, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has the ability to temporarily suspend or terminate the payment of statutory levies to the company or rescind his declaration of APL being the industry services body.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Transition and establishment</inline></para><para>The net assets to be transferred to APL are valued at around $8 million and primarily comprise reserves of statutory levies held by the statutory authorities on behalf of levy payers for marketing and R&amp;D programs.  </para><para>In addition the bill provides for recognition of accrued entitlements of employees of the statutory authorities who are transferring to the industry services body. These entitlements relate to annual and long service leave, maternity leave, sick leave, continuity of service and other employment conditions. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Anticipated benefits</inline></para><para>There are a number of strengths associated with this new industry structure. These are to:</para><para>·	provide an appropriate vehicle to promote a through-chain, demand driven, commercial focus for the provision of industry services, which will facilitate the building of strong linkages from producer to consumer;</para><para>·	improve the industry's competitiveness against imports;</para><para>·	underpin the industry's achievements to date and in the latter stages of implementation of the Commonwealth's $24 million industry restructure strategy, and specifically to promote international competitiveness and export development; </para><para>·	remove duplication and ambiguity about responsibilities between the three industry organisations which cause confusion for industry, government and trading partners;</para><para>·	enable the industry organisations to be more flexible and responsive to the changing operating environment and priorities of members; and</para><para>·	establish a single unified, professional and balanced board with the opportunity and capability to strategically develop and implement industry service arrangements.</para><para>This bill paves the way forward for the pork industry to look to the future with a more commercially driven, internationally focused and flexible approach. It will now have the capability to respond quickly, effectively and efficiently to emerging industry challenges. Ultimately this will mean consumers' high expectations of quality Australian pork being consistently satisfied.</para><para>I commend the industry on how it has responded to recent challenges. Everyone knows that there have been very difficult times for the pork industry over recent years. The turnaround in the industry has been quite spectacular and I hope that that prosperity can continue into the future. I believe that the industry leadership has shown remarkable courage and determination to set the industry's path for the future in a manner which gives the industry the opportunity to achieve its potential. In particular, I acknowledge the contribution of Ron Pollard, the president of the industry organisation, who has driven this legislation to reach this stage and has secured the overwhelming and virtually unanimous support of the industry for this package of legislation. I pay tribute to the work of the industry in reaching a stage where it is now putting in place for the future a modern and progressive structure to underpin its future.  </para><para>The industry's unity in bringing this proposal to government is another example of a maturing industry looking to secure its future in the global market. It provides me with great pleasure to be working with the pork industry in implementing these arrangements, and I am particularly impressed with the extensive levels of consultation both throughout the industry, with all stakeholders and with government.</para><para>This bill and the framework that hangs from it creates a turning point for the management of industry affairs, and for the potential for industry growth and development. It will establish a solid foundation for the industry to continue to challenge and secure global opportunities in the pork market. I commend the legislation to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laurie Ferguson</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23138</page.no><id.no>R1177</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>23138</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bruce Scott</inline>, for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McGauran</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23138</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>23138</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 will make a series of minor amendments to four pieces of legislation which relate to aspects of the Communications and the Arts portfolio.</para><para>The bill makes amendments to the Public Lending Right Act 1985 that provides the legislative framework for the Public Lending Right scheme. The Public Lending Right scheme is a cultural program that makes payments to eligible Australian creators and publishers in recognition that income is lost from the free multiple use of their books in public lending libraries. The PLR scheme also has a broader cultural objective whereby the existence of the scheme encourages the creation of books by Australians and the publication of books in Australia. </para><para>A recent evaluation of the Public Lending Right scheme found the scheme to be efficient and effective. However, it recommended strengthening the objectives of the scheme and streamlining and updating some operational procedures of the program. This bill puts these recommendations into effect by incorporating a statement of objectives into the Public Lending Right Act 1985 and making small minor changes to the processes for making final payments following the death of a creator. It also clarifies that a category of prescribed persons defined in the act is intended to apply to those who made an intellectual contribution to the creation of a book.</para><para>The amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997 in this bill will provide immunity to carriers and carriage service providers in situations where they comply with a senior police officer's request to suspend the supply of a carriage service in an emergency situation or where they are complying with a designated disaster plan. It is important that carriers and carriage service providers are not subject to litigation as a direct result of compliance in either situation. There is some concern that the absence of immunity might result in them choosing not to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in emergency situations. </para><para>This bill, through amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974, will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, ACCC, both in tackling cases of anti-competitive behaviour by telecommunications companies and in resolving access disputes through the arbitration process. </para><para>The amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 enable the ACCC to more immediately provide advice to telecommunications companies on remedial action they could take to cease any anti-competitive behaviour. The bill also introduces measures to allow a nominated member to exercise the procedural powers in an access arbitration rather than the whole commission. Procedural powers do not include the ability to make, vary or revoke determinations or give draft determinations. It thereby improves the efficiency of the arbitration process.</para><para>There are a number of other minor consequential amendments included in the bill which update various sections which refer to the Telecommunications Act 1997 to refer to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The bill also updates a reference to the Australian company number to the new Australian business number in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.

Under the criminal code an offence must specifically identify strict liability or absolute liability, as the case may be, or the prosecution will be required to prove fault in relation to each element of the offence. This is necessary to ensure that the strict or absolute liability nature of some provisions is not lost in the transition to the application of the criminal code's general principles. If relevant offences are not adjusted in this manner many will become more difficult for the prosecution to prove, and therefore reduce the protection which was originally intended by the parliament to be provided by the offence.</para><para>The bill will similarly improve the efficient and fair prosecution of offences by clarifying the physical elements of offences and amending inappropriate fault elements. </para><para>This harmonisation of offence-creating and related offences in Veterans' Affairs legislation with the criminal code is an important step in the government's program of legislative reform that will achieve greater consistency and cohesion in Commonwealth criminal law. </para><para>I present a copy of the explanatory memorandum to the House.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Martin Ferguson</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23140</page.no><id.no>R1194</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>23140</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23140</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>23140</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I have great pleasure in introducing the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000.

The Roads to Recovery Program will greatly strengthen the grassroots of our road system and in doing so create job opportunities for a great many Australians.</para><para>For too long local roads have been Australia's forgotten roads—the government's Roads to Recovery Program changes this. This bill demonstrates that the government is serious about the renewal of local roads and recognises they are an essential element of the economic and social infrastructure of Australia's communities—rural, regional and metropolitan.  </para><para>The government is aware that councils, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, are faced with significant problems of maintaining local roads from within existing funding. The condition of local roads was a key issue discussed at the Regional Australia Summit. It was also a problem frequently raised with the Prime Minister during his fact finding tour of regional Australia earlier this year. It is an issue raised with me, I have to say, in all honesty, on a daily basis. The Moree Rural Roads Congress in March 2000 also highlighted the need for additional funding for road and bridge infrastructure in rural and regional areas—a meeting that I was at and the member for Batman was not, coming as he does from suburban Melbourne.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>—Ha, ha!

The bill ensures that funding is tied to ensure every dollar is spent on local roads. The bill also requires local government bodies to maintain their own spending on local roads. Local government bodies must also provide the minister with a proposal for the expenditure of their grant and there will be a requirement for appropriate audit arrangements. Additionally, the Prime Minister has written to all premiers and chief ministers seeking their assurance that they will not reduce their own expenditure on local roads. Today I indicate that the government strongly believes the states and territories must go further. They must commit to matching the Commonwealth's historic local road funding program. They must not just pay lip service to the needs of local government authorities across the nation.

This is good news for local communities and local industry. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has been listening to regional and rural Australia—to local communities—and to local industry. They have made a cogent case for improved funding for local roads as a long-term investment in the future of this country. </para><para>The economic and social importance of local roads is increasing with the expansion and emergence of new rural industries—with higher transport demands, including higher mass limits—and with frequent lack of transport alternatives. Local roads are an essential feeder to other parts of the transport system and between rural, regional and urban areas. They are vital to the sustainability and recovery of rural and regional Australia. Access to education, health care, shops and amenities, as well as markets, overwhelmingly depends on local roads. Like capillaries that carry blood throughout a healthy body, our local roads are the essential network that must be sustained if we are to ensure the health and vitality of our local communities and industries.</para><para>A substantial proportion of the local road network was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s and has reached the end of its economic life, resulting in deteriorating levels of service, in the face of increasing demand and need for higher road standards. The capacity of many rural and regional local councils to meet increasing road needs is also limited, and often compounded by declining population and a falling rating base.</para><para>The local roads funding of the Roads to Recovery Program will help address these needs and concerns. Councils will now have the capacity to improve access to social amenities, to improve safety on local roads, and to address infrastructure impediments impacting on industry development, such as upgrading substandard roads and bridges.</para><para>In keeping with the coalition's social policy of empowerment and partnering, it will be directed at devising local solutions to a national challenge. The three spheres of government represent the same electors and should serve them not on the basis of some assumed hierarchy of importance, but rather who is capable of best delivering services for people.</para><para>Local government will be a key player in developing priorities and service delivery under this program. We are tackling a national challenge with a local solution. And we acknowledge the intimacy of interaction citizens have with their local councils when it comes to local service delivery.</para><para>It is estimated the program will create directly up to 5,000 new jobs in rural and regional Australia, as well as many other jobs from industry expansion, as a result of improved road access.</para><para>The federal government is signalling its intent to end the tyranny of distance in Australia and to develop an integrated transport system. This involves greater connectivity between places of manufacture and agribusiness to markets, inland ports, railheads and the sea highways so vital to our export income. Roads to Recovery also supports broad Commonwealth policy objectives such as the Supermarket to Asia strategy, and its Regional Solutions Program.</para><para>The underlying principles of the Roads to Recovery Program is development of a redefined network of rural roads that will spearhead a regional economic growth recovery and create better transport synergies.</para><para>We must do this if Australia is to make a quantum leap in planning, building and maintaining roads that will serve the nation beyond 2020, and not just rely on an existing network that might not be adequate to future requirements.  Given their lifespan of 20 to 30 years, the roads we plan and build now must take account of the infrastructure needs of industries that may themselves only be in their infancy. </para><para>In the Roads to Recovery Program the government has recognised that the historical methodology for allocating funding between states and territories contains inherent anomalies.  Therefore we have rectified this by establishing a fairer allocation based on historical precedence, length of local roads and population. Allocations between councils within each state are strictly in accordance with formulae adopted by state grants commissions, established and applied under the previous government.</para><para>Any claims that suggest allocations to councils have been manipulated to favour the electorates of government members are, therefore, completely scurrilous.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name></talker><para>—Well, you ought to attempt to understand how it has been done.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I suppose it is inevitable, however, that when confronted with a sound, economically and socially responsible program of benefit to local communities, the only avenue of criticism left will be to make petty jibes about allocations.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum includes the full listing of local councils and their allocation under the program.

That second reading amendment, whilst welcoming the additional road funding, clearly raises one of the most important issues in the Australian community at the moment. That issue goes to the fact that the coalition government broke its election promise going to the impact of GST on petrol prices and that, as a result of that clear promise that has been broken by the Prime Minister and all associated with the coalition government, it is no longer just a question of additional road funding; it is also a question of whether or not ordinary Australians can afford to buy the petrol to enable them to travel those roads around Australia. </para></talk.start><para>I must say that that is an exceptionally important issue when you consider that next year is the International Year of the Volunteer. When I look around Australia on a regular basis, a lot of people in semiretirement or retirement who live from week to week actually put their hands in their pocket to purchase petrol to enable them to carry out community services such as Meals on Wheels or, alternatively, to pick up some of our elderly citizens on a voluntary basis to take them to community events. For those people—and a lot of other people who live from week to week—who, unlike the Prime Minister, actually put their hands in their pockets each week to purchase petrol, there is really a requirement for reasonable roads in Australia but, more importantly, as the member for McEwen knows, there is now a real debate about whether or not they can actually purchase petrol. </para><para>On that very basis, in discussing this bill I am about ensuring that the member for McEwen and others on the coalition side actually have an opportunity, in accord with what they are saying in their electorates at the moment, to vote for relief with respect to petrol prices and the impact of the GST on petrol prices.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—It is no longer acceptable to say one thing in your electorate and then do something entirely different when you get in the white car and catch the plane to Canberra. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Andrews)</inline>—Order!

This debate really brings to a head the debate not only about roads but about whether or not coalition numbers are going to be honest in their electorates and actually, when they come to Canberra, vote with their feet and put up their hands in support of a proposal which is about giving genuine relief to ordinary Australians in electorates such as McEwen through a reduction in the price of petrol by taking the GST spike out of the potential increase in petrol from 1 February next year due to the application of the GST. It is for that very reason that Labor has many concerns about what many in the Australian community regard as an unfair, shabby legislative effort intended to meet those needs. The opposition shares with all taxpayers a contempt for seeing politicians bestow taxpayers' money like it was their own to give.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The amendment that I will move today condemns the government for that very approacha lack of honesty and integrity in government. It is condemned for failing to compensate motorists for higher fuel prices as a result of the GST in spite of its promises, something that the member for McEwen actually speaks about in her electorate but when she comes to Canberra fails to put her hand up for in this House. She says one thing in her electorate and does another thing in Canberra.</para><para>The government are condemned for having no national strategy for infrastructure development, leaving major transport and infrastructure projects and opportunities untapped or not determined in a fair and transparent way. They are condemned for a program that does not respect the infrastructure priorities of local councils and communities. They have pushed the money out into one transport mode, one infrastructure type, in a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing infrastructure needs. They are condemned for five years of neglect of regional infrastructure and development. And they stand condemned for a lack of transparency in the identification of road funding priorities under this bill. That is the nature of the second reading amendment.</para><para>I also challenge what the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services said today, that decisions on road funding should be left to local councils. We have evidence of members on the other side already ringing local councils and seeking to intimidate and direct them about what their local road funding priorities should be. The truth of the matter is that local councils have a capacity, free of political interference from Canberra, to determine their local government priorities.</para><para>In addressing these issues, I say at the outset that this bill smells like pork. If this package is as fair, equitable, generous and flawless as inferred by the minister, why has its presentation and its preparation to this House and the community been so sloppy, slapdash and deceptive? I will tell you why, Mr Deputy Speaker. Because that is part and parcel of the hallmark of the operations of this government, as evidenced by the unfortunate debate in this House today and the unfortunate attack by the government on the integrity and the honesty of the Speaker during this morning's proceedings.</para><para>I inform the House that this bill had its first public viewing less than 24 hours ago. It was only late yesterdayas a result of an approach by me as the shadow minister the previous day in a letter to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to try to expedite proper public consideration of these mattersthat the minister's office actually granted my office an opportunity for a briefing on the bill. The problem was it was only late yesterday, despite my request and the so-called urgency with respect to this bill, that the department and the minister were able to provide a copy of the bill to the opposition and a briefing. The truth is that the substance of the bill was still being scribbled out less than 24 hours ago.  </para><para>At the same meeting, we were told today's timetable and soon found out that much of the detail was being held back or not revealed. The government also revealed at the last minute that every single council in Western Australia and South Australiadespite what it trumpeted earlier this weekwas now receiving less funding than announced by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister on Monday of this week. It was only after 10 o'clock last night that we received the explanatory memorandum from the minister for an important bill that is supposed to distribute $1.6 billion not of the government's money but of taxpayers' money in a transparent way. What sort of shambles is operating on the other side of the House at this very point in time?</para><para>We are told that councils will receive funding quarterly in advance but that the minister will have absolute discretion over when in the four years the funding is allocated. We know what that smacks of: `You do what you are told and promote us and we will bring forward your funding in a highly political way.' Talk about pork-barrelling. It is basically a threat: `If you do what you are told we will bring your funding forward.' That is also reflected in the fact that the very letter advising members of parliament and local councils of the proposed road funding demanded that local council funding actually be diminishedreduced by a requirement that local councils pay for elaborate signs to promote the government. I would have thought that every available dollar and cent should be spent on infrastructure around Australia, if roads are so important, rather than this government wasting taxpayers' money by demanding, in their letter advising members of parliament and local councils, that they had to promote the government. Where are their priorities? Where are their priorities on roads? Where are their priorities on railways and bridges and port developments? Where are their priorities when it comes to fulfilling a very deliberate election promise that the price of petrol would not increase as a result of the application of the GST? That is also central to the debate this morningnot just road funding but whether or not ordinary Australians beyond Kirribilli House, where the occupant never puts his hand in his pocket for petrol, are required to actually pay for petrol on a regular basis.</para><para>When I refer to the nature of quarterly payments being made in advance, I suggest that the minister is about timing his announcements to suit the political preferences of the government, using taxpayers' money in a political way. You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, know that this government are known for ensuring total political discretion on major infrastructure projects—a bit like, for example, their timing for the Sydney Orbital, and the Speedrail maybe. The government say that we cannot complain about how funding has been allocated between electorates because it is Labor's formula. That was another blatant lie from this government. Without this bill and the departmental briefing, it was impossible to determine how they applied the old formula to get the result they did. At the briefing last night in my office they confirmed that the formula had changed. The allocation of money between the states is a totally new formula designed in the minister's office. They could not tell us at the briefing last night how that new formula was designed or modelled, other than to say that it is something to do with historical precedent, population and road lengths. I suggest those factors had nothing to do with it. It was designed to rort the Australian political system to suit the political expediency of the coalition government, especially the National Party. There was no information on how these factors were considered, rated, scaled or measured. So much for transparency, honesty and integrity in government.</para><para>I ask the government right now to put up or shut up on the question of the formula. They should release the formula today and tell the House and the Australian people the truth about the development and application of the formula. I asked them for that last night when they sought to ram this bill through the House, and they could not answer that question. They now have further time to consider that fundamental question, to come into the House this afternoon and answer it—to remove any doubt in Australian electors' minds that this is not only a political fix but also potentially a political rort to suit the needs of the coalition backbench. That is what it is aboutintegrity in government. And they could not tell us the answer to the question. What have they got to hide?  If it is not pork I can smell, then frankly it is a rat. </para><para>The minister says that any accusation that this package favours coalition members and seats is outrageous, but let us look at the facts. Every one of the 17 seats that received $25 million or more belongs to a coalition member. We already have the `Roads of National Party Importance Program'—a program that is not known for its transparency—but now we have also the `Roads for National Party Recovery'. The Howard government cries foul when people question the word of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, but now everyone will be questioning the honesty of the Howard government because the 17 top electorates under this package are all government electorates. No wonder the Howard government refuses to publicly release the formula for public scrutiny. How quick was the Prime Minister to come out and say, `This is not a pork-barrelling exercise'? In fact, the Deputy Prime Minister came out and said, `This will not favour coalition seats.' That is a quote. This desperate Howard-Anderson government, as the Minister for Community Services likes to describe it, has been exposed for what it isa government that is simply not trusted by people in regional Australia. The truth is that the government stubbornly claims to have no money to provide relief for the motorists at the petrol pump, and then announces a local roads program. It has continued to bag the money from the higher fuel prices and the GST—ordinary Australians' hard earned dollars. Now it is selectively sending some of the money back. But as our leader, Kim Beazley, has said on a number of occasions of lateand maybe the member for McEwen ought to explain this to her electoratewhat is the point of having good roads if you cannot afford to drive on them?</para><para>I refer to a cartoon in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline>, a newspaper I do not often get the chance to quote in this House. I believe the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News </inline>had a great cartoon on Tuesday that showed two people driving along a road—I know the Northern Territory roads because I have worked in the Northern Territory extensively over a long period—and one says to the other, `It's great! Now we can get to places where petrol is really expensive.' That is what it is really about in some of those rural remote areas of Australia. Now we can get to places where petrol is really expensive—not Kirribilli but places like Katherine, Borroloola, Gove, Groote Eylandt and Rabbit Flat where it is really expensive. Those drivers were probably a bit too hopeful about how much further they could get because of the road package.</para><para>The Northern Territory, as the member for the Northern Territory will explain later today, gets a raw deal when it comes to the application of this so-called formula developed in the minister's office. I think the drivers might have heard the rhetoric about the package and not seen the detail, as we have. The contempt this government have for the electorate is showing through. They thought they could stare down people's demands for petrol relief. They thought they could stare down, for example, the National Farmers Federation. But the president of the National Farmers Federation clearly said this week:</para><quote><para>The road package doesn't settle the problem with respect to the broken promise and the application of the GST to petrol prices.</para></quote><para>They obviously have not heard the concerns expressed all around Australia, including in the electorate of Menzies and not just in the member for McEwen's electorate. They thought they knew best. They could only see the solutions as an either/or situation, but it is now clear they have made the wrong call. The <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> summed it up on Tuesday when it said: </para><quote><para>... if Mr Howard hopes that Australians will accept this program as a political trade-off for cheaper fuel, he has underestimated the level of anger about fuel prices.</para></quote><para>I have seen the reaction of the Bundaberg president of Queensland Cane Harvest. Quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">News Mail</inline> of Bundaberg yesterday was Mrs Sandra Waulk, who said:</para><quote><para>... harvesters would not accept the funding as a trade-off for rising fuel prices. We can survive on bad roads but we are not going to survive on the current fuel prices.</para></quote><para>Motoring and farming groups are not giving up either. The national president of the Farmers Federation, Ian Donges, has already said in Canberra in welcoming the road package that it was `not going to change their views on petrol prices. That is a separate issue and we will continue to talk about it.'</para><para>The government must realise therefore that these concerns are not coming from inner city or outer metropolitan areas. These serious reservations and riders about the scope of this major government announcementremember we are talking about $1.6 billion of taxpayers' money announced in one hitdo not come from the inner city or outer metro areas. They have come from the rural and regional heartland. The biggest beneficiaries of the program are the ones still not happy. I suppose they are the ones described as whingers by a member of the coalition government only a matter of a week and a half agofarmers in regional Australia described as whingers by a frontbench member of the coalition government. I am waiting for the member for McEwen to attack that person. The member unnecessarily and without any proper right attacked our hardworking farming community and described them as whingers. Yes, they are from the rural and regional heartland and the problem is that the Minister for Transport does not even listen to people in the country areas whom he tries to claim as his own. The reaction to this package has shown just how out of touch he is. Perhaps that comes from living in upper Deakin or Red Hill for too long, whichever yuppie inner city suburb he resides in. I suggest he has been living there for too long and I now understand, because of the pressure on his own electorate, why he is actually moving back to his electorate. It is because he fears the electoral backlash at the forthcoming federal election. He has neglected living standards, infrastructure and services in regional Australia for the last five years and people will not be conned.</para><para>The slapdash way this bill has been presented is further evidence that the minister did not take care with the decision. The first copy of the bill surfaced only last nightnot the real detail and not the answers to obvious questionsand now he wants to bung it through, if not today then on Monday, the first sitting day of next week. This is indicative of how the minister responded to community calls for some leadership and for transport infrastructure strategies, and also how he responded to the call for some backbone on fixing the Prime Minister's broken promise on petrol. He has panicked, gone weak at the knees and rushed and offered a knee-jerk response to only part of the problem.</para><para>Let us go to the issue of the infrastructure strategy. Everyone recognises that our local roads need attention. Nobody on either side of the House disputes that. Local road funding, as we all know, has been a key issue for a long time. People, I suppose, are entitled to ask this afternoon why it has taken until a year before the next election for the Howard government to act. People are entitled to be a little bit suspicious. After all, for the last five years the Howard government has told local councils that local roads are not the Commonwealth's responsibility.</para><para>This is a project that falls well short of a long-term infrastructure plan that regional Australia has been crying out for. Our nation has serious infrastructure needs. These are hard issues that we must sort through, such as how we work in partnership with the private sector and how we work with the local communities to give them a greater voice in their future. We know that that takes leadership, commitment and strength. It takes a fresh approach to how we plan for and develop our infrastructure.</para><para>In the same way we need to plan and develop our transport in this country. It is time that the minister did more than talk about national integrated transport planning. He has had long enough to deliver. We have heard nothing on how our railways can maximise the potential to ease the burden on the roadsprojects like the dedicated freight line through Sydney. That is a project that has money allocated to it, but where is it? The minister will again try to blame the New South Wales government for that, I suppose. </para><para>It is the responsibility of government, through strong, thoughtful leadership, to bring these projects forward and to get them under way now, not to just sit back and wait for the right political opportunity. This government has to face up to leadership questions and the challenge of leadership to bring the respective parties together in partnerships, drawing on the expertise of government, industry and communities.</para><para>Therefore, Labor announced last Friday a national infrastructure advisory council, an obvious and achievable structure to share that leadership. Labor's infrastructure council will advise a Labor government on strategic planning needs, data deficiencies, strategies for coordination within and between governments and how we move forward on public-private partnerships. Unfortunately, the Deputy Prime Minister has rejected it. He says the parties will not be able to reach agreement. Frankly, the role of leadership is to bring people together. It is not good enough to say we cannot handle the tough issues of infrastructure planning coordination. We have avoided them for too long. Everyone in the infrastructure community, local government and regional backbenchers agrees with Labor on the infrastructure council. The Deputy Prime Minister is on his own.</para><para>There are a number of elements to an infrastructure policy—as opposed to an election policy. That is the distinction the Howard government is yet to learn. One of these must be increased government investment. The only thing we can welcome about this package is the recognition of that. It has been totally neglected for five years. Everyone in this place knows that the infrastructure challenge is about more than investment. There is little dispute that infrastructure is critical to the development of our cities and regions and we know that many of our regions are lacking significantly. Infrastructure creates jobs and enhances business competitiveness and directly contributes to our quality of life as we access new opportunities, services and markets more rapidly than before.</para><para>There are important issues before the House. We all know that, but the problem is that the government is selective in working out what it is prepared to attend to. The Australian taxpayer demands that we spend our infrastructure money honestly. That is the message from a range of organisations. Without an overarching policy framework and with ad hoc announcements we will continue to be swamped by the broader effects of the market. I suggest the time has come for the government to make some hard decisions, not just on questions of local road funding and petrol prices but also on such important matters as the Scoresby bypass in Melbourne, where the Victorian government has actually offered to enter into a road of national significance agreement to try to assist its development, and also the development of the Western Sydney Orbital. The Prime Minister seems to claim that he knows all about this. He suggests that he knows the money is in the budget for the Western Sydney Orbitalhe has been telling us allbut he has not told us why construction has not commenced or how long his transport minister has been sitting on the feasibility study. The study is done, the money is in the budget but the first sod has not been turned. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services should have taken his tie off and turned some dirt on either the Scoresby road or the Western Sydney Orbital rather than engaging in his cheap stunt at Canberra Airport earlier this week in announcing the Roads to Recovery package. Maybe this government is relying too much on its finance minister for strategic infrastructure advice. I would not. He has a record for getting it wrong when it comes to private partnerships. Just go to Sydney at the moment and try to get on the train from Mascot to the CBD and think about the waste of public money because he got it wrong. </para><para>At last year's regional summit, the Prime Minister proclaimed his support for nation building by promising the Alice Springs-Darwin railway without any talk of an infrastructure strategy. One thing is clear from all of this: our infrastructure investments are being driven by short-term politics, not by any long-term plan. A renewed commitment to infrastructure is a key priority identified by last year's regional summit. The summit delegates also stressed that it is just not about a few announcements on the Alice-Darwin railway or on local roads; it is about the need for an integrated, developed national strategy. That is important in the infrastructure community and it is important to the public at large. It also requires that we be transparent in setting and meeting our priorities so as to maintain public support for infrastructure investment, because people have had enough of pork-barrelling, political decisions and the waste of taxpayers' money, as happens on all too many government policies at the moment.</para><para>It requires stronger planning and coordination and more transparent planning and regulatory processes. Labor's infrastructure agenda will be driven by good economics, effective governments and our belief that all Australians should have the opportunity to participate in the economic and social life of our nation. It is about governing for all Australians, not some Australians based on the Howard government Sydney-centric approach that emanates from Kirribilli.</para><para>It is time that we made these hard decisions. Thirteen months ago the government invited people from across regional Australia to Canberra for a regional summit. It was promised that a report would be produced in October 2000, but it has not turned up. The government also promised a whole of government approach. It has not turned up. All we saw was an ad hoc announcement when the political heat was on. With the government having neglected living standards, infrastructure and services in regional Australia for the past five years, I know from the feedback this week that people will not be conned by this package. That does not say that expenditure on local roads is not important, but people have seen through this quick political fix to take pressure off on another front.</para><para>Labor will not deny this bill a second reading, because we support money going to rural roads, but there is no way we can point to it as a solution to Australia's infrastructure needs. There is no way it can be seen as a solution to Australia's transport needs and there is no way on earth that we see this as an alternative to petrol excise relief, and neither will the Australian public.</para><para>On that note, I wish to move the second reading amendment standing in my name. It is about welcoming the additional road expenditure but calls on this government to front up and take as a fundamental approach action to remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001. I ask the honourable member for McEwen to put up her hand on this occasion and do what she can for her local electorate. I move:</para><motion><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes the importance of the additional road funding, calls for the development of a national infrastructure strategy including a national transport plan; and<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>as a fundamental part of this approach<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>calls on the Government to remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001.</para></motion><para>(<inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline>)</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Horne, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Horne</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>23148</page.no><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name><name.id>JT4</name.id><electorate>McEwen</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For almost the past half hour, we have been listening to the honourable member for Batman. I was listening very carefully to what he said. In that entire half hour, I did not hear one positive response from him to probably the largest and best road funding package for local roads right throughout this country that we have seen in decades. Possibly it is the largest road funding package ever. I am pretty sure that I wrote down very carefully exactly what the honourable member for Batman said. This legislation provides $1.6 billion for road funding, $1.2 billion of which is going to local roads right across our country. He referred to that as an `unfair, shabby legislative effort'. He went on to say that this was pork-barrellingthat there were more coalition seats receiving funding than Labor Party seats. The fact is that there more of us representing very large areas of regional Australia. </para></talk.start><para>The member for Batman also said that nothing had been done for rail. He very carefully chose to omit the diesel fuel rebate. He asked: where are the government's priorities on roads? He had half an hour in which to concentrate on that because the priority is with this Roads to Recovery legislation, which represents a 75 per cent increase to local road funding from the Commonwealth. The government is actually showing that. We have 148 members of this House representing every community across our nation. I am sure that each and every one of the 148 of us who represent all of those communities have at some stage received representation about the state of local roads in our electorates. Presumably, there may be an exception to that because the member for Batman does not seem to know much about the need for local roads and how excellent a package this is for local road funding.</para><para>Many of the representations that we have all received have come from people concerned about the safety of a local road, concerned that one of their local roads is so bad that a local school bus cannot travel down it. Just recently, I was at the Ruffy Primary School in my electorate and parents with children at that school were concerned that Boat Hole Road, a crucial link in the school bus route, was unsafe for the school bus to travel on. This is just one small example, but a very important example, of how the current state of local roads affects the daily lives of people. I am going to refer to other examples a little later on if I have time, but that example is an important reason for just why this $1.6 billion Roads to Recovery funding program is so important not just to my electorate of McEwen but right across our whole nation. </para><para>This $1.6 billion funding is vitally important both for social and economic reasons. ABS data shows that the average age of Australian roads has increased from 16.3 years in 1983-84 to 18.6 years in 1995-96 and growing older. I might add that during that period those opposite never produced a package of road funding like this one to deal with the problems of the ageing road infrastructure. These figures that I have given are an average and I, like most members of this House, can readily identify many roads that are much older than the average and in fact are at the very end of their lifespan. They have been allowed to age and deteriorate because there has been a massive underinvestment in local roads for at least the past decade, largely because the states have abrogated their responsibility and because local governments simply have not had access to the level of funding needed to maintain the vast network of local roads and to keep them in good repair. This has had serious implications for communities because it is roads that link people with goods and services for work, for everyday essentials, for health, for education and for social and recreational purposes.</para><para>In the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services on rural and regional infrastructure, which I chaired, evidence was provided that poor roads increase the running costs of vehicles, length and travel time; influence the quality of goods being transported over them usually to our ports and airports; restrict access by tourists—and for those of us in regional areas, increasingly tourism is a very important and growing industry, and it is these local roads which are impinging on the development of tourism in many areas—and reduce access for local communities to supplies and services. So many of them are simply unsafe. I must mention here that the report I just mentioned made recommendations to government about the need to increase funding for roads. So as well as speaking here in this debate as the representative of my electorate of McEwen, I am also pleased with this road funding package on behalf of my committee.</para><para>The benefits of road funding to generating employment in regions and assisting in the growth of industry are substantial. I want to refer to, and quote from, the report that I have just spoken about. A number of studies have been conducted over recent years both here in Australia and overseas and they have all established a very clear connection between judiciously targeted investment in roads and economic development. In their submission, the Australian Automobile Association summarised some of the findings from these studies. They said: </para><quote><para>There is a significant positive relationship between investment in road and other infrastructure and private sector output.</para></quote><para>They said that for every one per cent increase in investment in road infrastructure there occurs at the same time a corresponding increase in private sector output. Their study also said:</para><quote><para>An additional $1 billion invested in roads would yield a long run annual increase in GDP ranging from $810 million for urban arterials to $270 million for rural arterials and $110 million for local roads. </para><para>The economic stimulation that this investment would produce would lead to a growth in employment of between 2,400 jobs for local roads and 19,000 jobs for urban arterials.</para></quote><para>The Automobile Association also pointed out that the returns from investing in roads are higher than those for most other types of economic and social infrastructure. This means in real terms that new jobs will be created in my electorate throughout the shires of Delatite, Murrindindi, Mitchell, Strathbogie, Yarra Ranges, Whittlesea, Hume and Nillumbik. Conversely, it has also been documented that the benefits of industry and employment growth are lost without spending on road infrastructure. I want to give you just a quick example from my own electorate. The Shire of Delatite made a submission to our committee's inquiry and were talking about the expanding timber industry. They said:</para><quote><para>Industry analysts estimate that, in the absence of adequate road maintenance in Delatite Shire, transport costs in the timber industry will rise by up to 20 per cent. As up to 50 per cent of the cost of timber is made up of transport costs, a rise in costs of this magnitude will reduce the competitiveness of existing participants in the industry and reduce the incentive to make further investments in the industry.</para></quote><para>There of course we are talking about jobs. This legislation, by providing $1.2 billion for local roads, will ensure that these benefits for industry and employment are captured but are captured importantly for our local region. I realise that I have got very little time left in this debate in order to let everyone have a say, so I will just mention very briefly two areas—the Tolmie Bridge in the Delatite shire and Kirwans Bridge in the shire of Strathbogie. The lack of investment in road infrastructure there has actually meant that people living in these communities have extremely poor access. The road conditions are hazardous, and it poses an emergency risk in many cases. </para><para>In stark contrast to the reaction that we heard here by the member for Batman, I have contacted every one of my shires, and I can tell you they are absolutely ecstatic about this. This morning I did a radio interview at Alexandra and spoke to the CEO of the Shire of Murrindindi, who cannot wait for the money to flow. So when the member for Batman asks: what is the need for the urgency to get this legislation through the parliament? The answer to that question is that we want to get the funding through to local government as quickly as possible so that they can start on this massive job of repairing these local roads and bringing them up to scratch. I would love to talk in this debate for much longer, but I know that my time has run out. So I will simply say in conclusion: I thoroughly commend this legislation to the House on behalf of all of the people I represent in my electorate of McEwen. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>23150</page.no><name role="metadata">Horne, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HORNE</name><name.id>UU5</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for McEwen identified what I consider to be one of the problems with this legislation when she talked about time and the fact that she has had very little time to speak on the <inline ref="R1194">Roads to Recovery Bill 2000</inline>. This legislation, I believe, shows one of the unfortunate aspects of this chamber: that is, it is an adversarial chamber of government and opposition, when everyone in this chamber believes that more money needs to be spent on roads. I know that you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, in a former government both advocated that more money should be spent on the Pacific Highway, and we were quite ecstatic when it did happen, and we are very proud of the fact that it is being constructed today. </para></talk.start><para>Despite what has been stated by senators and some former members of this House, I certainly have not rejected the proposal of funding for roads in Australia under the Roads to Recovery program, nor would I. Having served as a deputy shire president in a small country shire and then as a shire president of Port Stephens, one of the fastest growing areas in Australia, I know only too well how difficult it is to get sufficient funding to build the roads that are needed by Australia's expanding society. However, what I have done and what I will continue to do is question the priorities of this government and the fact that this government see that this is the only way to spend part of the bonus windfall that they have received from being the highest fuel taxing government in Australia's history. I say that quite advisedly because I know that when this government came to power in 1996 the excise on petrol was 34.183c. It rose to 44.8c on 30 June this year and immediately, with the advent of the GST, the Treasurer dropped it back 6.7c to 38.81c a litre, as it is now. It is still higher than when they came to power, plus the GST. This is the only response this government can give to the people of Australia who have had to put up with deteriorating road conditions and increasing fuel prices and increasing fuel taxes. </para><para>Anyone who saw the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on Tuesday of this week would have seen the Prime Minister standing there, the lollipop man with the stop/go sign. That epitomised what this government have done to road funding in five years. In five years they have slashed the funding for regional roads. They have slashed the funding for the Pacific Highway. The program that they delight in telling us about is the black spot funding program. They love to tell us about that because it allows the Deputy Prime Minister to come into my electorate on the odd occasion, as he did last April, and announce $277,000 for a black spot. That was done in April. The funding was released by the budget in May. Have we seen the road fixed? The answer is no, and I would invite him to come back. I also remind him what happened on that day. I challenged him to match the state government for funding for one specific road, Buckets Way. He said, `I would love to be in a position to if only the funding was there.' Deputy Prime Minister, under this program the funding is there, but you still have not responded to the challenge because there is not enough money in this program for the local government areas concerned to pay the $62 million to reconstruct the Buckets Way. I look forward to continuing my comments after question time.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>STATEMENT BY MR SPEAKER</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>23151</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>23151</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For the information of the House and in response to a variety of inquiries on the matter, I wish to clarify the circumstances in which I recommitted a vote to the House this morning.

The two key performance indicators relating to breaching are designed to ensure that (a) Centrelink and Job Network members have a common understanding of what reasonable behaviour is and (b) Centrelink will not breach anyone without following due process and ensuring that natural justice applies. Let me point out that Centrelink is able to not meet the breaching KPIs and still get more money, or it could meet the breaching KPIs and not get more money. The simple fact is that, yet again, there are no targets. The number of breaches is not set by the government; it is set by job seeker behaviour. What this government is on about is ensuring that people obey the rules, and what the opposition obviously seem to want is the old days when almost any excuse would do.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Illegal Drug Use: Diversion Program</title><page.no>23152</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>23152</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Prime Minister.

It gives me an opportunity to report to the House on the considerable progress that has been made since the COAG meeting in April of last year to adopt a national approach to illicit drug diversion. Diversion means that drug users can either commit to treatment and rehabilitation or take the consequences of their action in the criminal justice system. When this national approach to diversion was announced by the government, it received widespread support in the Australian community. We allocated $220 million to this initiative, including funds for treatment, education, law enforcement and research. In November of last year, I launched a detailed national diversion policy framework following its endorsement by all state and territory governments. The approach is built on a partnership between governments, community organisations, health professionals and local communities. It is a very good example of the social coalition at work.</para></talk.start><para>In December 1999, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Tasmanian Premier jointly launched the first diversion agreement. In May of this year, I announced a Commonwealth-New South Wales diversion agreement with the New South Wales Premier, and I launched a similar agreement with the Victorian Premier in August of this year. The Commonwealth expects to launch an agreement with Western Australia in a matter of days and to conclude agreements very shortly with both South Australia and Queensland. Can I record my immense gratitude for the bipartisan approach that has been adopted by state governments working in partnership with the federal government to try to make significant inroads into this dreadful social scourge of drug abuse.</para><para>Can I say in passing that the national drug statistics released yesterday contained the very pleasing news that there has been a significant drop in heroin overdose deaths in New South Wales to a figure of 296 in 1999-2000 from 491 the year before. That may be only some kind of statistical interruption to a pattern that has caused a lot of concern over the years. We all hope it is not. I take the opportunity of congratulating all concerned in that, both those working for New South Wales agencies and also those working for the Commonwealth.</para><para>One of the dangers of this debate is for there to be a sense of hopelessness that nothing can be done and that everything that has been tried to date is a failure and is of no use. That is a mistake. There is a wide area of agreement in the community on what ought to be done to tackle the problem. The areas of disagreement on such issues as heroin trials and heroin injecting rooms, although they are significant, mask the fact that in most areas there is enthusiastic cooperation across the political divide between all people concerned in trying to bring about a reduction in drug abuse in the community. I do not think it is a cause that any of us should resile from. We should continue the campaign, and there are some signs that in some areas that campaign is beginning to bear fruit. Certainly the diversion programs are a good illustration of that, and I thank the premiers of the states of various political complexions for their cooperation in the public interest in tackling this very serious problem. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink: Job Seekers</title><page.no>23153</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>23153</page.no><name role="metadata">Kernot, Cheryl, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KERNOT</name><name.id>XW4</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Employment Services.

I can inform the House that the September quarter current account figures show significant improvement in Australia's current account position, registering a deficit of $5.5 billion or only around 3.4 per cent of GDP. As I have previously informed the House, the September figures are boosted, of course, by the Olympics, but what they show is that the volume of exports grew 3.8 per cent in the September quarter. Elaborately transformed manufactured exports rose 5.1 per cent in the quarter, rural commodities exports rose 5.6 per cent in the quarter and services exports rose 14.4 per cent in the quarter. So this shows a return to strong growth in exports to a round trend following two years below trend coming out of the Asian financial economic crisis.</para></talk.start><para>Notwithstanding that strong growth in exports of 3.8 per cent in the September quarter, the volume of imports grew only slightly at 0.4 per cent. As a result of this, net exports will contribute 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth in the September quarter when we get it. Today's outcome is a significant improvement in Australia's current account. The government is forecasting a significant decline in the current account through the year to 4 ¼ per cent from the 5.4 per cent which was recorded last year. Most importantly, net exports will make a contribution of about one percentage point to Australia's GDP growth.</para><para>I do not think we should get complacent about the current account deficit, and it is something that we must keep a very firm policy handle on. One of the reasons why it is important to run budget surpluses is to build up savings. Can you imagine where Australia would be today if we had not paid off $50 billion of Labor's debt, which would have just gone on to the debt figures and would have made things that much worse. But the government can say that, since it was elected, it has turned away from Labor's wanton fiscal irresponsibility of $10.3 billion deficits and $80 billion rack-ups of debt over five budgets and has made a positive contribution. I think, now that the government has been successful in that, people can give it credit.</para><para>I would not normally mention him as an economic adviser, but I was rather taken by the comments on the Graham Richardson show, made by the man himself, Mr Graham Richardson.

He went on to a completely different subject. If you want to ask a question about foreign debt, you ask a question about foreign debt. If you want to ask a question about credit card debt, which is a separate subject, we are happy to answer that too. But I think it is important, if I come to the question of foreign debt, to put some facts on the table. The first is that Australia's foreign debt when the government came to office was 38.7 per cent of GDP and it is now 46 per cent. In other words, it has stabilised over 40 per cent.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>—Stabilised?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked his question and the Treasurer has the call.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>—Some mothers do have `em, so I think we ought to put it into context. When we came to office, foreign debt was 38.7 per cent of GDP—which, admittedly, is too high. In 1983, when Labor came to office, foreign debt as a percentage of GDP was 14 per cent. Over those 13 years, the foreign debt as a proportion of GDP went from 14 per cent to 38 per cent. Just to put the number on it, because the member for Melbourne does not seem to be able to work it out, under the Labor Party the increase of foreign debt to GDP was 668 per cent. As I said, under the coalition it increased 24.7 per cent—so 24.7 per cent compared with 668.8 per cent. I said at the time—and I will say it now—that probably the most irresponsible period of Australian economic management was from 1983 to 1996. Not only was Australia plunged into awful recession, with budgets in deficit and a build-up of $80 billion worth of debt; but also, if you want to look at it in terms of foreign debt, as a percentage of GDP it increased by 668.8 per cent. So the good news is that we have arrested the acceleration of increase in foreign debt, which was started by the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second good point is that the debt servicing ratio has fallen and is now at one of its lowest levels ever. The debt servicing ratio—the amount of exports required to pay the interest on net foreign debt—is now 9.8 per cent. So the percentage of your exports which you are required to pay in relation to foreign debt is 9.8 per cent compared with its peak under the Labor Party of 20 per cent in the September quarter of 1990. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that the Labor Party boasted that it would produce a recession as a consequence of its mismanagement in 1990. </para><para>The last point I want to make about foreign debt is that this government can make this claim: it has not added a dollar to foreign debt, because this government has not borrowed a dollar since it came to office. In fact, having paid back $50 billion of Labor Party debt, what that means is that, whatever it is now, it would be at least $50 billion higher had the Labor Party still been in office. That would be the case, even leaving aside the fact that they would still have been running deficit budgets right into 2000-01. The Labor Party may not be able to acknowledge, it but as even Graham Richardson said—Graham Richardson, their ideological mentor; the man who taught them all of their tricks; the man who knew even more about electoral matters than the member for Lilley himself—this is `equivocally good news, the best trade result Australia had in decades, and I mean decades'.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>23155</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23155</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

I attended the first National Rural Roads Congress in Moree earlier this year. That was a landmark event in highlighting the importance of local roads not just to economies but also in local social benefits. It brought together some of the best thinkers on road infrastructure in this country. I should note in that circumstance that I did not see the member for Batman there. The congress revealed that rural roads support the social fabric of rural communities and regions, and the efficiency of local roads makes a very significant contribution—and I think this is important—to education and health standards in rural communities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Interestingly, a survey conducted by the Country Women's Association of Australia, the CWA, in conjunction with the Office of the Status of Women, found that, when women were asked their priorities for government spending in rural areas, 69 per cent believed that roads should be the priority—a quite surprising figure; indeed, one that one would not normally have expected to have been the case. The reason given was that improved rural roads were most important to women of all ages, in places of all sizes, whether in remote localities or large country towns, because, as they explained, there is an intrinsic relationship between such things as good roads and a good education. Indeed, the inadequacy of rural roads is a disadvantage to attracting teachers to rural areas; it reduces attendance at schools, in some cases quite dramatically; it forces parents to send children to boarding school at an early age; and it forces families to relocate to larger centres in the interests of their children's education. </para><para>An Australian Local Government Association survey into the effects of poor access in wet weather on school attendance of Australian children showed that one-third of the nation's rural and regional council areas are affected. Surprisingly—and, I would have to say, of some concern as well—the survey also demonstrated that, in around a third of our rural councils, school buses still operate on roads that are closed to heavy traffic during and following wet weather. So there can be no doubt that poor roads contribute to a reduction in educational opportunities—at a time when those educational opportunities are more important than ever to all Australian children, particularly those in some of the more remote parts of the country.  </para><para>In the survey, 25 per cent of councils indicated that poor road access had serious implications for the delivery of health services. Councils indicated that on average there were five instances each year when it was not possible to get a patient to a hospital by road in the event of an emergency. These points touch on this very real issue of the social benefits provided by rural roads to health, to education, to the normal running of a decent social life and to interaction with people in your community. In that circumstance, I have to say that it is just impossible to fathom the Leader of the Opposition's belief—it really is—that the federal government's $1.2 billion injection into local roads is unnecessary or trivial.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Illegal Immigration: Woomera Detention Centre</title><page.no>23156</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>23156</page.no><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name><name.id>6J4</name.id><electorate>Bowman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.

He does not mind making life difficult for them. As I have said in the House on many occasions, the Leader of the Opposition has form in this area. His strategy at the last election, which we remember—engineered by Pezzullo and Angley, as the team was then—cost him his shadow minister, who now sits up there like a vulture on the back bench, hanging around just waiting to see what happens.

His great line was that this was going to be totally skewed towards rural electorates. As soon as we talked about road funding, without any thought as to how the government might do it, he raced in immediately and said, `Oh, this is going to be entirely for National Party electorates. It's going to be entirely for rural electorates.' The reality is that this money is being distributed in accordance with a Labor Party formula: it is being distributed in accordance with the formula established by state grants commissions in the early 1990s when the Keating government was in office here in Canberra. So, once the state gets the money, it is then distributed not in accordance with who holds the electorate, but in accordance with the formula worked out; a formula worked out by state grants commissions. That has left the Leader of the Opposition, who regards road funding as trivial and unnecessary, in an absolutely ridiculous position. There is not a member opposite who does not want this road funding for their electorate. There is not a council anywhere in Australia who is not grateful to this federal government, because we are providing a 75 per cent increase.</para><para>Might I observe that next week the annual meeting of the Local Government Association of Australia will be held here in Canberra.

As the House draws to a close for the year, it is timely to look back on the introduction of a significant extension of the safety net for the benefit of Australian workers. I thank the member for his question because he and members on our side of the House have been strong supporters of putting in place a scheme to ensure that, when workers find themselves out of a job and without their entitlements, there is assistance in their hour of need. We also amended the Corporations Law to deal with people who have been in breach of the Corporations Law. In terms of practical help, the fact is that, when you lose your job and do not get your entitlements, rather than having to wait on the possible chance of some recovery two or three years down the track it is very important that support be provided to workers in that situation as quickly as can be achieved.</para></talk.start><para>I am pleased to say to the House that, since the introduction of the scheme and in respect of insolvencies starting on 1 January this year, 1,125 employees in 70 insolvencies have been helped. In the most recent case, for example, which was Victoria Knitting Mills Proprietary Ltd in New South Wales, 19 employees were helped with $70,000 to go towards their entitlements. If the New South Wales state Labor government had supported those employees and likewise matched us on a dollar for dollar basis those employees would be getting nearly 80 per cent of their entitlements. That is real assistance when people need it.</para><para>I have been asked whether there are any alternative policies. The fact is that the Labor Party has not only opposed this policy; it has opposed supporting workers in their hour of need. Furthermore, it has used what little political influence it has to encourage the state governments not to support our policy because it is a coalition idea. For the basest possible political motives you have turned your back on workers in their hour of need. Are there any alternative policies? There are no alternative policies. The things that you have said, to the extent that they are coherent, would cost a packet, have no international precedent and would impose costs on good businesses to pay for bad businesses. Even the ACTU has called on the Labor Party to support the scheme that is in operation. It is the only national scheme.</para><para>As we go to Christmas, it is a national disgrace that the Labor Party turns its back on workers when they need a bit of help. I conclude by saying that the scheme has not happened by chance. It has happened because for 13 years when the Labor Party was in office it never lifted a finger to help workers in this situation. It took a Howard led government to ensure workers were helped. I conclude by paying a tribute to the people within my own department who have worked very hard to make the scheme a reality and who I know are dedicated to ensuring that we help workers when they need it. It is about time the Labor Party stood up to be counted when it comes to helping workers.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>23160</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>23160</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

When we came to government there were no gap cover schemes available or operating in Australia. The gap, along with price, is one of the two biggest disincentives people have to taking out private health insurance. We have been able to address price with the 30 per cent rebate and from having had two years where health fund premium increases have been very low.</para></talk.start><para>I have just received some very good news from the Private Health Insurance Administrative Council. We have never before kept figures on gaps. I have asked PHIAC to do so, and they have given me their first report. In the September quarter, nearly two million medical services were provided in hospital with no gap whatsoever; that is, 60 per cent of all in-hospital services around Australia were on a no-gap basis in the September quarter. About 12 months ago, the best estimate we could have was less than 10 per cent of in-hospital services with no gap; in the June quarter, around 50 per cent. So this number is going up exponentially.</para><para>In Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia, 70 per cent of in-hospital services are on a no-gap basis; no state has less than half of its hospital services on a no-gap basis. Queensland and Tasmania doubled the amount of no-gap services in just one quarter. We estimate that it will plateau at about 70 per cent of services on a no-gap basis before the recent changes to gap cover schemes that passed through the parliament in August come into place. Those will start to show in the March and June quarters next year, and we believe that we can approach 80 per cent of all hospital services in Australia with no gaps whatsoever.</para><para>The good news is that this has come at no increased cost to premiums. Funds representing 70 per cent of all members in Australia have already advised me that they will not be applying for premium increases next year—that is, they will be at least zero for 70 per cent of members covered, and I hope the final number will be much closer to 100 per cent. So this new gap cover scheme that, as of the last quarter, provided 60 per cent coverage across Australia is at no increase to premiums whatsoever. </para><para>The honourable member asked me if there were any alternative policies to assist Australians who have private health insurance.

The fact is that we have listed every local government area in the country. Many of them do indeed overlap federal electorate boundaries. What is so amazing about that? Surely everyone knows that they have local government areas that overlap. Unlike you, and unlike what some of the state ministers have suggested we do, we have not gone into the business of telling local governments where they will spend that money, that it must be allocated within the boundaries of such and such a federal electorate. We have not gone down that road. Quite simply, every member, including those opposite, has a simple list—and I have not noticed any of them sending it back; none of them will want to deny the money—pointing to the councils which fall within their electorates or, in the case of councils which overlap with other electorates, pointing to the sums of money that each of those councils will receive direct from the Commonwealth government. I would have thought that that was perfectly easy to disaggregate and perfectly easy for responsible members everywhere to accurately reflect in this very widely and very well received program. Of course, it remains the fact that the ALP leader has refused to endorse the package, to commit himself to it. He still believes that this a boondoggle and unnecessary. In addition to that, they have done nothing to join us in what I would have thought would have been a spirit of commonsense, a commitment to economic and social reform by calling on the state governments to match what we are doing.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Corporations Law: Commonwealth Responsibility</title><page.no>23164</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>23164</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation.

When it comes to the Corporations Law, the Commonwealth has the same objectives today as it did when an agreement was made with the states in 1990. We want Australia's one million companies to have one rule of law, whether they be in Bendigo or Bathurst; we want Australia's millions of company employees to have the same protection under company law whether they are based in Fremantle or in Fairfield; we want Australian industries such as building and construction, transport and storage, tourism and health, to have the same single law applied for companies across Australia; and, when it comes to Australia's seven million shareholders, we want them to have the same information in the same prospectus with the same investment returns whether they live in Launceston or Fitzroy Crossing.</para></talk.start><para>We ask: why are the states determined to now put in place a new Corporations Law scheme that could end up with six different laws applying across Australia? Why are they prepared to do it? The states with their current proposal want the ability to cherry pick any new corporate law scheme to suit their individual purposes. At a time when trillions of investment dollars move into companies around the world each day, we have Premier Beattie wanting the 90,000 companies in Queensland to face investment uncertainty as a result of some political stunts. In Victoria, where the member for Menzies is based, Premier Bracks wants 174,000 companies to worry more about political stunts on industrial relations than the certainty of incorporation or the cost of issuing different prospectuses with different laws right around Australia.</para><para>The Commonwealth has bent over backwards to try to accommodate the states and their concerns in relation to the referral of powers. We have put in place every practical, workable safeguard they have needed to protect the intention of the referral. We have gone further in the corporations agreement to protect state rights than ever before, and the time has come for commonsense to prevail. The Commonwealth stands ready to continue to negotiate with the states in good faith but, ultimately, if the states are not willing to trade, we are left with no option but to implement our own laws based on our own powers. One hundred years ago the states could not agree on a railway gauge across Australia. Today the Corporations Law is as significant.

It seems that it is the unwillingness for sawmill waste to be used in these renewable energy plants that is causing a problem for Labor and the Democrats. They would prefer to see this waste burnt or lost altogether than it to be used in any kind of constructive way. It would be a tragedy if this important legislation, this pro-environment legislation, this legislation that is about recycling and renewable energy, was to be blocked by Labor and the Democrats.</para><para>There are a lot of concerns in communities like my own and the Northern Rivers that this proposal could be lost.

So many people in the Labor Party want this passed as well. I ask the member for Paterson: what is his approach to this issue? One of these plants, as he pointed out earlier, is proposed for his electorate. Is he prepared to sacrifice those regional jobs over some silly deal about green preferences? We have heard a fair bit about Labor Party preference deals lately. This is a deal about green preferences that is prepared to sacrifice country jobs.

If a term causes offence, it is up to the occupier of the chair to determine whether or not it is appropriate that that term should be withdrawn, depending on the nature of the term. That is not a new rule. You will find that my predecessors made similar rulings, and I am happy to check the ruling and come back to the member for Burke. But to answer his question as briefly as I can, obviously I will require all unparliamentary terms to be withdrawn and, as is often the case during my stewardship of this chair, I have asked members who have used terms that are not unparliamentary but that I have deemed to be undesirable to simply exercise a little more restraint. </para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Standing Order 78</title><page.no>23168</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>23168</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Keefe, Neil, MP</name><name role="display">Mr O'KEEFE</name><name.id>CE4</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, may I ask a further question of you in respect of that, and I appreciate the fact that you are going to come back to me on it.

It is not an issue about point scoring, as no doubt the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs would like to make people think. This goes to the very question of whether Minister Ruddock has the capacity to manage his portfolio. Let us put aside the minister's inaction and his blinkered attitude to date on the numerous allegations that have been made with respect to the alleged incidents at the Woomera Detention Centre. On this occasion, I would implore the minister to put aside his pride, to put aside his blind adherence to bureaucratic processes and to start to think seriously about the numerous allegations that are surfacing with respect to the incidents at the Woomera Detention Centre on a day-to-day basis. The people who are making these allegations are brave, credible people who obviously feel so strongly about what has happened that they are prepared to put their credibility on the line and, if you are to believe some of them, even expose themselves to possible retribution. I am aware that there are many others who would be prepared to come forward and tell similar stories if it were not for the confidentiality clauses in terms of their employment and the fact that they are concerned about what could happen to them.</para></talk.start><para>The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs defends these allegations by saying that there are avenues available for people with complaints. He says that they should report matters to the police or to Family and Youth Services in South Australia. If he really thinks that—and he again said that today here in this House—he is living in fairyland. Minister, if this were one allegation, I could understand your view. Of course then you go to the appropriate place where you can complain. If it were two allegations, again you would go to one of these state instrumentalities or to some other organisation. Even if it were three, I put it to you that maybe your answer would be appropriate. But, Minister, we are now at a point where there seem to be allegations of systemic abuses at the Woomera Detention Centre. People are frightened of retribution and are not making reports. Given what we are hearing about the culture at Woomera, is it any wonder that they are frightened of making these reports? </para><para>To date the opposition, believing that the minister has erred badly in his handling of these issues, has pursued these matters in the parliament. For instance, the minister has had to be dragged in, kicking and screaming, to establish a limited inquiry with very limited terms of reference. Indeed, he acted only when the media broke the story. Even then, it was eight months after a document—evidently an incident report was made. He found out about it supposedly eight months later. I believe him that he found out about it eight months later, but I say to the minister: someone has let you down badly. The fact is that you made this decision to have these limited terms of inquiry only after you were forced into it by the fact that the media reported the alleged rape of a 12-year-old boy. Then, having found that document, having been made aware of that document, you decided that you would call for a limited inquiry.</para><para>We were also led to believe during the week that the minister had not received a letter dated 18 April that was sent by a Mary Lindsay by fax to Mr Smith, the director of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Adelaide. In that letter, Mary Lindsay specifically made the assertion that she had heard that there had been some problems with respect to a young boy. Again, I accept that the minister did not see that letter until the day that I tabled it in this House, which was a couple of days ago. But, Minister, what was the result of that inadvertence? What was the result of whoever it was, either the department or one of the officers in your own office, not giving you that information? Somebody either covered up this incident report or, for some reason, did not give it to you. What was the result of that? It is not just one of those matters where you can say, `Oh well, these things happen.' The result is that a 12-year-old boy was left in the environment where he was being sexually abused, and in the custody of the person allegedly abusing him, for another eight months. This is what we are talking about here. This is why I started off my MPI by saying that this is not about whether I am having a go at the minister or whether the minister is trying to protect somebody. The fact is that this is about real people. In fact, this is about a little child who is 12 years old. The result of this inaction, this inadvertence, this cover-up—call it what you will—is that this young kid was left in the hands of the person who allegedly raped him for an extra eight months. I am not blaming you for that, Minister—not personally. But I am saying that something is terribly wrong and needs to be looked at.</para><para>I think those of you who are involved in any sense in, say, family law or in problems between husbands and wives will know that, if any allegations at all are made to a judge that one party or the other is somehow molesting one of the children, immediately the benefit of the doubt is given for the welfare of that child. That child is taken away and put in some sort of custody. You do not take risks. In other words, I would presume that, if that incident report of the time had been made known to the South Australian Police and to the authorities, most probably they would have given it the benefit of the doubt and they would probably have put that young child in protective custody, where I understand that he was taken last Monday week.</para><para>Even after all of this, even after the minister has been made aware of all these facts—reading about it in the newspapers on a day-to-day basis, even after this—the minister calls<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>some sort of a press briefing and extols the virtues of, and heaps praise on, Australasian Correctional Management and says that they are doing a wonderful job under the circumstances. In fact, journalists rang me to say, `You've got no idea how effusive the minister was in heaping praise on Australasian Correctional Management.' The fact is: why are these people all coming out? We will pursue these issues at a later time, Minister. But for now, what is at issue is the minister's ability to handle the situation. He must, if he has any idea of doing the right thing, set up an inquiry with full powers, including compulsion and protection of witnesses. Even though the results of that inquiry may be embarrassing to you, Minister, to other people and perhaps to your government, it is the right thing to do. It is not just the opposition calling for this; it is a lot of people out there in the community. I just want to read into the record a few of the editorials that I have seen today.

Later it says: </para><quote><para>The public must have confidence in the operation of the Woomera centre, run by the Australasian Correctional Centre Management. The public needs reassurance that the policy of privatising such a function as immigration detention is working and the principle of detaining asylum seekers is sound. For that, a wider and more powerful inquiry is needed. Anything less will simply store up trouble for the Government. As well, of course, an incomplete inquiry may also leave at risk the health and wellbeing of people in custody for whom the Government ultimately is responsible.</para></quote><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>'s article is spot-on, mainly because it is talking about the people—and I am talking here about the possibility of the problems that we have with under-age children. There is little doubt now that there is a major crisis in the management of Australia's immigration detention centres, and in particular the Woomera centre, by Australasian Correctional Management. ACM contracts, for instance, stipulate the provision of clothing, yet the company went to St Vincent de Paul seeking free garments, disadvantaging both the charity's needy clients as well as the detainees. I will not have the time to read it today but there was a very good article in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> by political reporter Suzie O'Brien reporting that: `The company managing the Woomera detention centre approached charity groups last year for free clothing for detainees.' It goes on and says at the end:</para><quote><para>But Mr Ruddock acknowledged it was contracted to provide complete service including food, clothing and shelter.</para></quote><para>So we have a situation here where these people are going with the begging bowl to St Vincent de Paul trying to get free clothes which they are getting paid for by this government—and this government says that they are fantastic. It just beggars belief that this minister is that gullible that he would actually believe that. </para><para>On the matter of ACM's failure to provide properly trained medical staff to treat detainees, we saw in yesterday's lead story on the ABC news where a nurse who worked at the centre said that psychiatric nurses—or people who were supposedly psychiatric nurses but did not have the appropriate qualifications—were giving out poison S4 prescription drugs; administering them. It is just unbelievable, Minister, that you say that there is nothing wrong. </para><para>I want to make this point before I close: I know that there is not a lot of sympathy out there in the Australian community for people who jump queues, who come here unlawfully. I know that. And I know now that for some time this minister has believed that his treatment—demonising a lot of these people, giving them these temporary protection visas and not giving them any services, et cetera—might have been popular out in the Australian community. He may well have been right at that time. But I put it to you, Minister, that the Australian public has a heart: they do not like to read reports about young children being abused and they do not like to see human beings being treated in this way. </para><para>Now that you have the opportunity to renegotiate your contract with Australasian Correctional Management, I put it to you that you should look seriously at their performance.

I will just deal with the issue of agendas. I have been thinking very seriously about why these issues are being raised in the way they are and why the opposition is pursuing them in the way in which it is. The opposition makes it clear that it sees mandatory detention as an important public policy. I think the reason for this shadow minister taking that view is that he believes it would be electorally unpopular were he to do anything else. I do not know that it is in his heart to keep before him the reasons why these policies are pursued. The reasons why these policies are pursued are to ensure that there is a system of integrity in relation to the way in which people enter Australia and stay here and to ensure that we are able to look after the most needy people in our refugee and humanitarian program. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Why? The shadow minister made it clear the other day in answer to an interjection. His agenda is to unwind the privatisation, as he sees it, of the detention system. He made it very clear that that is what his agenda is. He asks why other people should have any other agenda. I do not want to speculate as to what all the agendas might be. But, when I know that something like 63 nurses have been at Woomera and one or two people are pursuing matters and have pursued them over a long period of time, I ask myself whether they do have any other agenda. Have they sought other positions and been disappointed? Are there issues of the character we see so often in the industrial movement where people believe that, if you pursue a matter in this way, you can get a particular outcome?</para><para>The evidence will be seen in terms of the nature of the allegations that are being made—and I will deal with those in detail in a moment. The shadow minister said that I had been dragged kicking and screaming in relation to the establishment of the Flood review. The reason that I established the Flood review was that, on the evening of the day before I made the announcement, I learned that there was a document that should have been before Family and Community Services, which they said was germane to their inquiries but which was not before them at that time—and I certainly believe that the procedure is deficient and in need of examination. That is why the inquiry has been launched.</para><para>But I will go to the substantial issues that have been raised, because I think it is important to characterise the allegations that have been made to date in terms of all of the statements in the press that I have read and all of the statements from the member opposite.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sciacca</name></talker><para>—There are a lot more to come.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—He says that there are a lot more to come.

An allegation relating to the boy was referred to the South Australia Police. They investigated the matter and found no basis upon which charges could be laid or the boy removed into care. It was also referred to the South Australian Family and Youth Services, which conducted a joint investigation with the South Australia Police. Again, the outcome was no charges. The matter was reopened two weeks ago and the investigation remains current—and, quite frankly, it is the only matter that is presently under investigation. While I do not know the result of that inquiry, I suggest that it would be far better for the honourable member to wait until it is available.

Then there are the statements about unqualified nurses treating patients: 63 nurses have been employed at Woomera, 52 have been confirmed as registered in South Australia and checks are being made on the balance. When they advertise they ask for registered nurses. Some of those that come forward are from interstate and there is a short interregnum before people get their qualifications transferred to the relevant state in which they are working. But unregistered nurses can still perform medical tasks provided they do not contravene the registration requirements.

I make these points because, if you look at the evidence and you go through it, there have been reports and they have been investigated.

There is some information that has come to me from the head of the firm Macpherson and Kelley that employed her when she was in Woomera. She is one of the principals informing the member opposite. I will read from the letter because the letter understandably deals with the issues that are germane to this very question. He said:</para><quote><para>It is, I think, relevant for you to know that Ms Lindsay was contracted by my firm between April 4 and 12 to assist us with Taskforce 32 at Woomera. That was the first and last occasion on which we have used her services. I was present at the Woomera IRPC during the processing of this taskforce and although Ms Lindsay had complaints about the inability of detainees to communicate with their families she did not then, nor at any time later, mention to me any concern about the sexual or other abuse of children in the centre. </para><para>I understand that Ms Lindsay took it upon herself to speak to the DIMA manager at the Centre on that occasion about improving the facilities for detainees to communicate with their families. She contacted me after the taskforce and informed me it was her intention to write to you about these concerns. I wrote to you at that time disassociating my firm from any comments she may have made concerning conditions at Woomera IRPC on the basis that she was not authorised by my firm to make comments that had not first been cleared by me. </para><para>To the best of my knowledge Ms Lindsay did not raise any concerns about maltreatment of children with any of the other members of the team which handled Taskforce 32. Had she done so we would have immediately taken the matter up with the DIMA manager at the Centre ... Until the current allegations arose in the media none of us at Macpherson + Kelley had received any information (from detainees or from any other source) about child abuse at Woomera or any other immigration detention centre. </para><para>I note also that the letter allegedly written by Ms Lindsay claims that she heard about the alleged sexual abuse `last Friday' which Mr Sciacca calculated was April 14. This was two days after Ms Lindsay's return to Adelaide and consequently the source of this information is to be questioned. She also apparently noted that other “reps” at the camps had genuine concerns about children being sexually abused yet on bringing these concerns to the notice of “heads of firms” they had been advised not to get involved. As I have mentioned, no such report was made to me at any time. </para><para>I also note with interest that Ms Lindsay's claims to have expressed her grave concerns to the head of ACM at Woomera when she heard about a `similar case' involving a young boy. In my opinion it is not likely that Ms Lindsay spoke to an ACM officer or anyone else about such a matter given that she did not mention it to me, and admits that she did not become aware of the matter until April 14 when she was back in Adelaide.</para></quote><para>I mention those matters because this goes to the credibility of the sources that the member wants. There are motives involved in this—the member has admitted that he has a motive. Why does he want this sort of inquiry? Because he wants to parade a whole host of unsubstantiated allegations in the public arena for the purposes of discrediting a whole lot of professional people whose careers and futures depend upon them carrying out their obligations professionally and appropriately. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Nehl, Garry (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Nehl)</inline>—Before I call the next speaker in the discussion, I noted during the address of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that he tabled several documents for which he should have sought leave.

Behind the issue that the House is considering today is one very important concern. It is a concern that I am sure that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs does not take lightly—nor should he. The minister proudly wears his Amnesty International badge, a badge whose symbol is barbed wire. Yet at any given time he is responsible for the wellbeing of thousands of people who have been deprived of their liberty—people who have not committed a crime, people who have been forced here by circumstances that few of us here could even begin to understand, people who have sought shelter from oppression, people who have sought sanctuary in Australia and people, we should not forget, of whom 90 per cent will become permanent residents of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The minister has a responsibility to those people. He has a responsibility for their wellbeing, he has a responsibility for their safety and he has a responsibility to ensure that they are treated fairly in having their case heard before the tribunals. The fact that he wears the badge of Amnesty International makes those responsibilities personal as well as legal. When you deprive a person of their liberty—when you lock them away behind barbed wire—you take away the ability for them to help themselves, you take away their rights to access help and you make them totally dependent on you for their care. You cannot pass the buck—if something happens to them while they are in your care, you are responsible.</para><para>That has to be the principle under which the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs operates. You have to be open about it; you have to be accountable. You have to be accountable to the parliament and the people of Australia and, because the people you are dealing with are not citizens of Australia, you have to be accountable to the international bodies. Accountability means being open. It means allowing the people of Australia and the world access to what is going on behind the barbed wire of the detention centres. Accountability is not something you can contract out with a commercial-in-confidence clause. It is not something that you can hand over to a public relations firm. These are the snivelling excuses that a coward hides behind. And when it comes to being accountable you cannot get away with a whitewash investigation.</para><para>In Australia the standard for accountability is a judicial inquiry. Only the judiciary has the credibility to conduct an inquiry into matters which may involve the serious breaches alleged to have occurred. Anything less will be seen as a whitewash. If that happens, Australia's immigration practices will be rightly seen as a sham by the international community. But any investigation of alleged incidents must be seen against a backdrop of the development of detention centres—or, to give them their quaint title, `immigration reception processing centres'. It is true that such centres have been a reality of immigration policies throughout the term of many successive governments, but this government and this minister have taken the development of detention centres way beyond anything we have seen in this country before.</para><para>Why is it that we now have thousands of people detained in the most remote parts of Australia—thousands of kilometres from the tribunals which will hear their case, far from the legal representatives who will argue their case and far from the cities in which 90 per cent of them will eventually settle? It is part of a deliberate policy designed to pander to a racist minority in the Australian electorate. In a government driven by opinion polls the comments coming out of the focus groups provide the basis for this government's policy. This minister, despite his appeal to the principles of Amnesty International, is the willing servant of the government in implementing this policy. </para><para>I am sure members will be familiar with the solution proposed by some citizens to deal with people seeking refuge in Australia. There are those who would send out the Navy to sink the boats and drown their occupants before they reached our shores. The minister does not go that far, but this government's policies are the nearest thing. When it comes to people arriving in Australia without the required authority this policy makes life so difficult and uncomfortable that it is a deterrent to anyone considering it. Having visited—along with the member for Hindmarsh—a number of detention centres, including those in Port Headland Broome, Curtin, Darwin and Villawood, I would have to say that they would be best described as deterrent centres rather than detention centres. So while the great majority of people detained in those centres have committed no crime, while they have not been sentenced as punishment, the government has to use the centres as a deterrent to those who would seek to come to Australia.</para><para>While the department put together videos—we all remember the videos that the department put together—showing sharks, crocodiles, snakes and spiders, the real deterrent, it hopes, is that word will get back to the countries from which asylum seekers come describing the detention centres as horror camps. If that is what the minister intended, then for some he may have succeeded. As anyone who has spoken to refugees would know, they have to put up with much worse. Many have already risked their lives in unsafe and overcrowded boats to get here, so just how far will the minister go to deter asylum seekers? What horrors can he dream up that will cause asylum seekers to avoid Australia? Given the sorts of responses he must get from his opinion polling, he probably thinks he can get away with anything. But I wonder if those same Australians would see things differently if they or a member of their family were to be treated by a foreign government in the same way that this government treats asylum seekers.</para><para>Some years ago I had the misfortune to have my passport and travel documents stolen while I was overseas. I can tell you that it can be quite frightening trying to convince officials that you are a tourist. Fortunately, I was able to get my passport back and continue on my journey. I was grateful that the people I dealt with were helpful, but I can imagine the difficulty I might have faced, because there are some people in the world who would not have allowed it. Listen to this, Minister: those thoughts crossed my mind when I visited a detention centre recently. I noticed a young woman, about the same age as my daughter, who had arrived in Australia by air, not by boat, without documents. When I saw the conditions in which she was being detained—and the member for Hindmarsh saw them as well—I could not help but think that if this were happening to the daughter of an Australian citizen there would be a great outcry against this uncivilised treatment of one of our own. And this really is the whole point of this debate. While we set out to deter asylum seekers, we create conditions which are totally unacceptable in a civilised world. For some this is justified, but that justification amounts to nothing less than racism. We are prepared to treat others in ways that we would condemn if they were suffered by one of our own. To avoid such accusations we must make it clear to Australians and to the world that when we deprive people of their liberty we do so only on reasonable grounds and that, having detained them, we apply the highest standards of care. To show that we are accountable, we need to have our system open to credible investigation: no cover-ups and no public relations firms putting the big spin on events. We need to examine any allegation openly. In short, we need to have a judicial inquiry into these events in our immigration reception processing centres.</para><para>In the short time that I have, I say to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs as a mother to a father, to a grandfather: I would not like to see what happened to that 12-year-old boy happen to any child of mine of yours; you would not like to see that happen either. So, please, on behalf of this government, allow a full judicial inquiry. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>23178</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I address some of the shameful allegations by the shadow minister for immigration, Mr Sciacca, I should like to refer to the speech by the member for Fowler, who—did I hear it right?—just condemned the facilities that she said she had visited.

But now she is backing up this shadow minister at the table, the shadow minister who shamelessly has brought forward totally and utterly unsubstantiated allegations. He has brought this country into disrepute on the basis of nothing that has been proved. If you went into the community right now, you would hear beliefs in the community based solely on what this shameless shadow minister has done for purely political reasons.

But worse than that, this shadow minister made specific allegations in this parliament against the detention centres. He made an allegation about a 15-year-old boy. He raised that question again today: an allegation that a 15-year-old boy had been sexually mistreated and raped. And yet that has already been investigated by the South Australia Police and by South Australian Family and Youth Services, and they said there was no reason for action.</para><para>He has raised a case that has been investigated and thrown out. What else has he raised? He has raised the story of the 12-year-old boy. That has already been investigated but, as the minister said, it has been returned to the South Australia Police to be reinvestigated, having already been investigated by FAYS and SAPOL. Then there was the allegation that a brothel had been run. That was an allegation by the shadow minister with absolutely no evidence, and no proof has come up. Let us now take the shadow minister's own words:</para><quote><para>No baby food at Woomera until July this year, if young infants were not breast feeding, they were given cabbage and rice. Many would not eat because it was so horrible.</para></quote><para>Let us look at what is actually happening. </para><quote><para>Babies are either breast fed or bottle fed.

The committee has recommended that the proposed development proceed. The proposed development, estimated to cost $11.5 million, will comprise 50 detached and semidetached dwellings. The project is needed to partially meet overall Defence needs for additional Defence Housing Authority dwellings in Canberra and to meet the imminent expansion of the Australian Defence College. Defence intends to co-locate its three single service command and staff colleges at the Australian Defence College.</para></talk.start></continue><para>While the committee supports the proposed development, the inquiry raised a number of process related issues that need to be addressed. The inquiry highlighted a number of deficiencies in the liaison process between the Department of Defence and the Defence Housing Authority, particularly in relation to the Australian Defence College. The committee has recommended that, at the earliest opportunity, the Department of Defence make DHA a party to all discussions which may impact on Australian Defence Force personnel housing requirements. The committee received evidence challenging the sincerity and adequacy of the consultation process engaged in by the Defence Housing Authority. The committee is strongly of the view that it is essential for all Commonwealth agencies sponsoring public works to consult with the wider community. Such involvement gives legitimacy to a proposed public work. In relation to the Stirling project, I simply note that it would have been better if DHA's community consultation process had been more transparent.</para><para>The second report is in relation to Carey Street, Darwin. Members may recall that the committee in its 10th report did not approve the development by the Defence Housing Authority of 90 apartments in Darwin. The committee recommended that the Defence Housing Authority report to the committee when it had complied with all the recommendations contained in its report. The committee has received a response from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence on its recommendations and advice as to Defence Housing Authority planned actions. The committee has resolved that DHA proceed with the issue and evaluation of tenders and obtain an updated market appraisal; the committee accept DHA's response in respect of recommendation 6; and that the construction of the proposed work not proceed until the committee's recommendations—with the exception of recommendation 6—have been met. I will report again to members in relation to this matter. The committee welcomes DHA's responses to its recommendations and trusts that, in relation to future projects, the inquiry will serve to assist DHA to achieve improved levels of transparency and accountability. </para><para>The third report is in relation to ABC, Perth. This report that I have tabled relates to the development of new accommodation for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Perth. The proposed development is estimated to cost $25.7 million. It will replace the ABC's existing facilities, which it has occupied for more than 40 years. The proposed facilities will comprise a two-level office and technical zone, with undercover parking; an acoustic zone; an area for technical workshops and stores; a communication tower; and parking for radio and television outside-broadcast vehicles. The committee found existing facilities to be poorly configured, inflexible and outmoded. In many instances, substandard buildings resulted in dysfunctional, inflexible and potentially dangerous facilities. The committee is of the view that the new facilities will allow for improved operational efficiencies and will enhance the ABC's capabilities. The committee has concluded that the project should proceed. Moreover, we see that the construction of the proposed facilities represents value for money. The facilities offer the potential to provide long-term benefits to the ABC and its current and potential clients.</para><para>The ABC's existing facilities accommodate not only the ABC but also the Western Australian Symphony Orchestra, more commonly referred to as WASO. Unfortunately, the site for the new development does not include accommodation for WASO. The future location of the orchestra proved to be the most contentious issue of this inquiry. While the committee was of the view that it would be physically possible for the ABC to include accommodation for WASO in the proposed development, it found that this would significantly impact on the way the site functioned as an ABC facility; also, that the ABC would suffer a significant financial penalty for WASO to be considered in the final preferred development option<inline>.</inline></para><para>The committee examined this matter in some detail. We found that there had been ad hoc consultation by the ABC prior to formally advising WASO that it intended to sell the current premises and relocate. We also found a lack of credibility in the rationale for the level of assistance that the ABC had factored into project cost estimates and financial analysis to assist with the fit-out of alternative WASO accommodation. The committee welcomed advice from the Western Australian government that there is a compelling argument for a tripartite arrangement whereby the University of Western Australia, the federal government and the Western Australian government contribute to the relocation of WASO.</para><para>The committee is of the view that the treatment of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra represents a precedent in relation to the level of funding for the relocation of ABC orchestras generally. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Western Australian Symphony Orchestra receive from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation relocation funding commensurate with that received by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and that federal, state and relevant local governments consider funding options for the permanent housing of the Western Australian Symphony Orchestra in the proposed Music Access Centre, in an arrangement with the University of Western Australia, on land to be provided by the University of Western Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>The third report I have tabled relates to a proposed work at the head office building of the Reserve Bank of Australia at 65 Martin Place in Sydney. The Reserve Bank wishes to reconfigure its head office building and free up 7,000 square metres of underutilised floor space for commercial lease. This equates to six floors of standard commercial office space. The project is the result of a steady decline in staff located at the head office since the early 1980s, which is due to the use of improved technology and organisational changes. The cost of the project is estimated at $21.5 million. Revenue generated from tenants will be approximately $3.5 million a year. Resulting profits will return to consolidated revenue. </para><para>The committee welcomes the commitment of the Reserve Bank to this entrepreneurial project. The committee looks forward to examining other building proposals that display similar initiative. The Public Works Committee has consistently paid attention to heritage and environmental issues. They must continue to be given priority of concern in any works proposal submitted to the committee—they can never be an afterthought. Features of cultural and historical significance attached to major public buildings should be, as far as practicable, preserved and bequeathed to future generations. </para><para>The Reserve Bank's building forms a part of the Martin Place `heritage precinct' that is included on the Register of the National Estate. The committee also understands that the building is described on the Central Sydney Heritage Local Environmental Plan as being `of historical importance for its ability to exemplify a postwar cultural shift within the banking industry'. Some of the features of interest raised by the National Trust of Australia and the City of Sydney are a squash court, the bank's staff cafeteria and a shooting range. While sympathetic to the preservation of heritage items, the committee was not convinced how features such as the bank's squash court warranted preservation. However, the committee has recommended that, before work proceeds, the Reserve Bank photograph and carefully document all relevant features. I commend these reports to the House.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Works Committee</title><page.no>23182</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Approval of Work</title><page.no>23182</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>23182</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: RAAF Base Edinburgh, South Australia.</para></motion><para>The Department of Defence proposes to undertake a redevelopment in the technical area at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide, South Australia. This base is the home of one of the frontline combat capabilities of the Royal Australian Air Force, the Maritime Patrol Group, which operates the P3 Orion maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. The Maritime Patrol Group conducts a range of operational and surveillance roles, including its prominent search and rescue activities, and comprises both operational and support units that provide logistic support and maintenance support to keep the aircraft operational. The base also provides flight line and technical support for the Aircraft Research and Development Unit. The role of this unit is to extend the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force aerospace systems. Tasks undertaken are mainly in the advanced technology area and entail applied research, engineering development, test and evaluation and electronic warfare operational support. The proposed scope of the works is in direct support of this role. </para><para>New facilities are required in the base technical area to accommodate administrative and technical personnel at the Aircraft Research and Development Unit. This unit is currently located in dispersed facilities that were constructed in the 1940s, are not suitable for the function, are remote from their aircraft hangars and are in urgent need of replacement. In addition, it is proposed to provide aircraft shelters for six aircraft, provide additional electrical power in an existing aircraft hangar, provide some additional workshop and shelter facilities, and refurbish a test rig facility. The progression of this element of the works will enable the disposal of Defence property and will lead to efficiencies by co-locating the unit near its hangar and its main client base. Also proposed are new logistics facilities comprising office accommodation and warehousing for a number of logistics units that support the Maritime Patrol Group and the base. These facilities are to be sited in the technical area of the base in close proximity to the hangar flight line and will replace existing dispersed, inefficient and poorly located facilities, some of which do not meet modern standards. </para><para>The units to benefit from these new facilities are the Maritime Patrol Logistics Management Squadron, 92 Wing Logistics Operation and Joint Logistics Unit—South. The Joint Logistics Unit—South, which also supports other Defence elements in South Australia, is a part of an Australia-wide support organisation. The procurement, stock control and warehousing functions of this organisation are currently being market tested as part of the commercial support program of the Department of Defence under the Defence Integrated Distribution System project. The outcome of the market testing is to be considered by the government later this year.</para><para>Because Joint Logistics Unit-South provides critical support to the Maritime Patrol Group, the market testing tender specified government furnished facilities on RAAF Base Edinburgh. Nevertheless, there may be an option for the successful contractor to provide these facilities. This would reduce the capital cost of the project. In keeping with the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, the Department of Defence has agreed to defer the affected elements of the Joint Logistics Unit-South requirements from the proposed logistics facilities until the outcome of the market testing is known.</para><para>To avoid unduly delaying the other elements of this important project, the Department of Defence intends to tender the construction works with an option to include or exclude elements of the works that may be affected by the logistics market testing. An upgrading of the engineering services infrastructure, mainly in the technical area of the base, is proposed. The basic engineering services at RAAF Base Edinburgh date from the time each area was developed, generally in the 1940s and 1950s. Although some improvements have taken place, the systems are in need of replacement as they have reached their capacity, they are increasingly unreliable and major repairs and replacement of deteriorated systems are necessary. It is also proposed to demolish and/or remove facilities in the area to be developed.</para><para>The estimated cost of the proposal identified in the reference motion was $37.7 million. This estimate was based on December 1999 prices. With the project not expected to be completed until April 2003, this figure needs to be increased to an outturn estimate of approximately $39.9 million. It should also be noted that there is a potential for reduction in capital investment costs should a non-government owned facilities option be progressed for the logistics element currently being market tested. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will start mid-next year and be completed by April 2003. In its report, the committee has recommended that this project proceed subject to the implementation of the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Defence agrees with the recommendations of the committee. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23183</page.no><id.no>R1194</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23183</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>23183</page.no><name role="metadata">Horne, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HORNE</name><name.id>UU5</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to finish my comments on the <inline ref="R1194">Roads to Recovery Bill 2000</inline>, and I must thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the commercial during question time when he was, above all, quite happy to quote me and indicate how hard I have fought for road funding. I do know how important it is but, again, I keep coming back to this question: is this the best result that Australia could have had? The answer is a resounding no. I was earlier pointing out how this government has overseen the highest fuel taxes ever in Australia. At the same time that it has been prepared to collect that funding, it has slashed road funding, particularly for regional and local roads.</para></talk.start><para>I am quite happy to turn to black spot funding, because it is something that is often thrown up by this government. They always come back to black spot funding. It was our program and, sure, we took it away. Bob Collins was the minister back in 1994, I believe, when we took it away. Why did we take it away? I guess the government should go and have a yarn to people like Jeff Kennett, the Hon. John Fahey, who was then Premier of New South Wales, or maybe Mr Borbidge, who was Premier of Queensland. They know that when they received road funding from the federal government they would spend it on anything but roads and then they would come to the federal government and say, `Give us some black spot funding.' We did that, and they were simply relying on the black spot funding. So along came the Howard government in 1996 and they reinstated black spot funding, but did they reinstate any other form of funding? The answer is definitely no. </para><para>I also remember quite vividly and passionately Laurie Brereton and Michael Knight visiting Raymond Terrace. It was a historic agreement in November 1995 when the federal government and the state government of New South Wales agreed to reconstruct the Pacific Highway. That is something that is also thrown up in this parliament by the Deputy Prime Minister, but what he does not tell us is that, at the time that Laurie Brereton offered that money and offered to participate in that program five years ago, the federal government was putting in $750 million. What is it putting in today? $600 million. This is a government that has pulled $150 million out of the Pacific Highway funding and many parts of it have stalled. Mind you, it does not stop the Deputy Prime Minister from announcing the money. I think he has announced the Chinderah to Yelgun bypass about 16 times. </para><para>I can also recall the then minister for transport, the Hon. Mark Vaile, going to a public meeting in Karuah in early 1998. At that public meeting there was some debate about whether or not the town of Karuah should be bypassed. The then minister for transport said, `I know there are a few people here who are friendly to my side of politics and who don't want the town to be bypassed, so I'm pulling the funding out.' It is ironic that this week four lanes of continuous divided highway from Sydney to Karuah will be completed. They have not even started work on the Karuah bypass yet. It will be another four years before that work is done.</para><para>I use these as examples to show the sorts of games that this government has played with transport, the sorts of games that this government has played with roads. It is all very well for the Deputy Prime Minister to come in here and beat his breast now about school kids and buses on country roads being unsafe. Where has he been for the last five years? Is he going to tell us that this is something new? Is he going to tell us this is something that has just happened? I can assure him, as a representative of one of those electorates in which my kids went to school and travelled over those sorts of roads, that they have been around for years, they have been around for generations, because we never built the proper roads in the first place. It is nothing new. So do not come in here now and preach to those people who have had to live and put up with it.</para><para>I indicated that this legislation should be about roads, about the vital infrastructure that this country needs. It is not. It is about a government that is trying to convince the people of rural and regional Australia that it cares about them. It wants those people to forget the last five years of neglect. It wants those people to ignore the fact that they are paying the highest prices for fuel that they have ever paid. It wants the people of Australia to forget that they are paying the highest fuel taxes they have ever paid. This is the only response that the government is prepared to give them. $1.2 billion sounds a fantastic sum. It is a big sum of money. Where does it come from? Over the same period, how much will the government take out of the pockets of the fuel consumers? It will take over $2 billion. In other words, at the end of the four-year period, when this road building program is under way or completed—it should be completed by then—the government will still be in credit with fuel taxes it has taken from the Australian people, and we will still not have the road network that we really need as a modern country going into the next millennium.</para><para>This government has failed Australia with its carte blanche acceptance of high fuel prices without its ability to think what we can do. I will give you an example. I have attended a few hearings of the caucus committee that is going around Australia talking to people who are adversely affected by high fuel prices. One group particularly that have a grudge—and I believe they justly have a grudge—spent a couple of thousand dollars converting their petrol consuming car to LP gas or went out and paid an extra $800 to get one of these new Falcons that only uses LP gas. When they first came out LP gas was worth about 40c a litre around my area; people are now paying 59.9c or more. I had one couple convince me that they are now running their gas-altered car on petrol because they think it is probably cheaper. They wonder why they spent the $2,000.  </para><para>But where this government has missed the point is that Australia essentially is self-sufficient in LP gas. Australia has developed technology—and there is a whole industry out there of mechanics that fit LP gas converters to cars. LP gas actually gives our nation an advantage as far as fuel is concerned. But the shame of the Howard-Costello-Anderson government is that it is the government that put a tax on it. Up until 1 July this year, there was no tax on LP gas. I would have thought that the government might have come in here and said, `We are going to do the right thing. We are going to let the world know that we are pretty resourceful and pretty cunning and we are going to take the tax off it.' I tell you what: I would support it. I would support it and I would love that to be included in the amendment. I might have to go and have a word with the member for Batman about that.</para><para>What about our trucking industry? We hear lots about the trucking industry. Again, the Deputy Prime Minister stands up and tells us how things are going so swimmingly for truck owners and drivers and operators. He must be talking to a different group from the group I talk to. I have plenty of them in my electorate. They know that, despite the 24c a litre rebate they are getting, they are still paying more for their diesel today than they were paying on 30 June, before the GST came in. This was traditionally an industry made up of small business people. To the government that claims to be the representative of small business people: what are you doing to the trucking industry? Within another couple of years the trucking industry will be made up of three or four major operators and that is all. The owner-driver operators, the small organisations—the husband and wife organisations—will be gone. Where will your competition policy be then? It will not exist. What does this legislation do about it? Absolutely nothing. </para><para>Why isn't there a code of conduct included in this legislation for our trucking industry? They have been negotiating long enough, and this government simply turns a deaf ear to it and ignores the need. That is why this piece of legislation really is a con job. It is all about trying to convince the people of Australia out there: `We care about roads; come and vote for us.' I will give you another example to show that. In a question on Monday from me to the Prime Minister I mentioned the adverse effects of fuel prices on Meals on Wheels, and I am sure every member of this House would agree that that is a vital service to ageing members of many of our communities. The Prime Minister answered and spoke about local councils. He said:</para><quote><para>... but the fact that they have extra money to spend on roads means that there will be less pressure on other areas of the budget, including the provision of many charitable and welfare services. As a result, it is a good deal all round. </para></quote><para>When we have a look at the conditions that apply to this money being given out to local governments, what do we find? Clause 7 states, under `funding conditions', that they must use the grants for expenditure on roads, that they must account for their expenditure properly—that is fair enough—and that they must maintain their existing road expenditures. The whole point is: what the Prime Minister told me on Monday is completely false. It will not bring any relief anywhere for the councils at all because they have to maintain their funding for roads as if they were not getting this money. So there will be no relief. There will be no added services like the Prime Minister said. Let us have a look at some of the other things because this is what this legislation really is all about. This legislation says: </para><quote><para>It is expected that these conditions will cover the following administrative aspects of the program:</para><para>Proposal</para><para>A local government body is to provide the Minister with a proposal for the expenditure of the grant.  </para></quote><para>In other words, big brother is watching. Centralised government will be telling the local government authorities, `Yes, that is acceptable. No, it is not,' because you have to submit it to the minister to get it approved. I would have thought in this day and age government was all about allowing local communities to determine their priorities. Not with this piece of legislation it is not. But how about this one, because this is the one I like—I hope they are going to put a picture of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business maybe walking his dog on it: </para><quote><para>The conditions will ensure that the Commonwealth receives appropriate recognition for its contribution to the roads concerned.  The conditions will require that the local government body must erect signs acknowledging the Commonwealth funding along the road works being funded from the grants.</para></quote><para>I hope it is not on the side of the road. I hope it is not a danger to travellers. But I guess it will have to be a minimum size and I guess it will have to have the coat of arms and all the rest of it on it. Obviously, it is about parading that this federal government gave some money to roads. Are they going to have to put it on every pothole? It will cost you more money for signs than it will for tar patching. What a ridiculous statement! But that says it all and that is what this government is about. It is not about building a decent road network. It is about being out there and getting the accolades for putting more taxpayers' money in the government's pocket and giving them less back and building a road system that, at the end of four years, despite $1.2 billion, will still be inadequate. That is the charade that the government expects us to accept.</para><para>As I said when I started, I always welcome funding for roads because I know we do not get enough. If this government thinks it has gone far enough with this legislation, it really does not understand the needs of rural and regional Australia. It really does not understand what the people out there are asking the government to do.

I drive approximately 100,000 kilometres plus per year over the roads for the electorates that I have represented and currently represent. Because of that movement over those roads, I have seen the state of our roads for that period of time and know what is required to get those roads up to standard. It was interesting to hear the comments of the member for Paterson who at no stage during his contribution to this House made any reference to not wanting the money that he was given by the government, nor indeed did he make any reference to the need for New South Wales, as an example, to make a similar contribution to road funding as the Commonwealth has done.</para></talk.start><para>The issue of the state of the roads was well recognised when I was a member of the Greiner government that was elected in 1988. At that time the Greiner government introduced a 3 x 3 tax at the bowser for road funding, 60 per cent of which went into rural roads in New South Wales and was graciously and gratefully received by the local shires and the local councils. The road infrastructure that they had in their shires at that time was as it is today, breaking down at an astronomical rate because the roads had been laid down for 50 or 60 years, five or six decades. They needed an enormous injection of funds to bring them up to scratch and make them safe for motorists. It is interesting to note that since the Carr Labor government came in, they have reversed that formula. They increased the state petrol tax to 4c a litre for four years and reversed it to the extent where the 60 per cent portion of it went to the metropolitan area at the expense of rural roads. It was not long before there were visible signs of the progress that had been made in catching up on the repair to those roads had started to fall back again. </para><para>About a fortnight ago, I released a press release with regard to the announcement of the $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery program. I cautioned the government to ensure that that road funding was distributed fairly, equitably and based on a needs priority. I said in that press release, as a rural based member who regularly travels on roads within the electorate of Hume, that I am well aware of the atrocious state of local roads, which have rapidly deteriorated following unusual, constant wet weather. I also said, more importantly, that these conditions have accelerated the breakdown of road infrastructure to the point where roads are becoming extremely dangerous and beyond the capacity of local government resources to maintain, let alone reconstruct. In relation to the distribution of this special road package, which is in addition to the annual local roads grants, the shires association and the shires right throughout Australia are very grateful for the contribution that has been made.</para><para>In the electorate of Hume over the four-year period that this package covers, there will be $21.65 million allocated to 14 shires. That is an average of about $1.43 million in annual grants over those 14 shires or an annual grant to each shire of $388,000. That is a significant contribution, and it has been acknowledged in some memos that I have received from shires and, indeed, from the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales, for example through their G division. I received this facsimile yesterday from the chairman of the G division of the shires association, who I know required about $50 million or $60 million to repair and reconstruct roads within the G division of the shires association. The chairman, Mayor Paul Braybrooks of Cootamundra Shire, said:</para><quote><para>Dear Mr Schultz,</para><para>Re: Funding for local roads</para><para>Please accept G division's appreciation for your efforts in representing the needs of rural areas for local road funding and for the recently announced Roads to Recovery Program. Enclosed herewith please find a copy of a letter to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson MP, expressing the division's appreciation and requesting a meeting to directly convey such to him.</para><para>Yours sincerely,</para><para>Paul Braybrooks</para></quote><para>It is well known in this place and outside this place that I sometimes do not make too many favourable comments with regard to my coalition partners on some issues, but I have to say that the way in which this road funding has been handled is exemplary, exemplary inasmuch as it has met the concerns that I raised with regard to fairly and equitably distributing the funding. I will quote from the letter that I received, as everybody did, from the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, on 27 November, when the funding formula was released and the amount of funding for each individual shire was released. In the second sentence of the third paragraph, he said:</para><quote><para>We are now in a stronger budgetary position that allows the Government to return a dividend to the whole community through this substantial investment in local road infrastructure.</para><para>The Federal Government has chosen to invest in the local road network because we understand its importance to the Australian economy and to the social amenity of all Australians. The Roads to Recovery Programme will provide a substantial investment boost to local roads, allowing widespread upgrading and maintenance work to be undertaken and providing additional employment opportunities in local communities.</para></quote><para>What he said in that letter to me was absolutely right. Of course, he did not say that just by chance, because he has had an opportunity over the past 12 months to read the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services headed <inline font-style="italic">Time running out: shaping regional Australia's future</inline>. And wouldn't you know it? Paragraph 75 on page 146 of that document said:</para><quote><para>`Roads are the lifeline for rural and remote Australia'. This statement in Austroad's 1997 report encapsulates the importance of roads to regional Australia. In brief, roads play a very significant role in the social and economic life of the nation. They are a vital element in the transport chain on which Australia's international competitiveness depends. With the loss of many services from small towns and the need to travel to regional centres for shopping and services, there is also now a greater dependence on road infrastructure than before. </para></quote><para>That report goes on in relation to responsibility for roads and talks about all three levels of government sharing the responsibility. That in itself is a true indication of what actually happens, and it is one of the reasons why I am amazed that the member for Paterson did not call upon the New South Wales state government to match the funding that the federal government have given in addition to the funding that they allegedly still supply to local government. The sad reality of it is that, at the last budget, the New South Wales government removed $111 million from road funding in rural New South Wales. That gives you an indication of the commitment that they have, despite all the rhetoric that comes from them and despite the rhetoric that comes from Country Labor about its commitment to rural New South Wales. It also proves that they have absolutely no knowledge of how vital the restructuring of our road system is to the people out there who need to get their produce to market and to country people who drive considerable distances to get to work safely.</para><para>I would also like to make the point that it is, in my view, very important for me to talk in this chamber about the need for rural road funding in shires right across Australia but, more specifically, about the need for additional funds in the Hume electorate, which I represent—an electorate which some of my parliamentary colleagues covet prematurely before the redistributed boundaries take effect. But, in the Hume electorate alone, there is a need for approximately $70 million just to get all of the roads in those 14 shires in a rural electorate up to a standard that you, I and everybody else would expect to be safe for the community, whether it is for businesspeople or ordinary people on the street from those communities and from those many small villages, towns and cities in rural Australia who need to carry on driving over those roads to get to their places of work and to deliver their produce.</para><para>I welcome the announcement by both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister on this very worthwhile and gratefully accepted road package. I thank them for listening to the concerns that I have raised on behalf of my constituency and, indeed, on behalf of the constituencies of all of the members across Australia, regardless of their political persuasion, for the fair, equitable distribution on the basis of needs for each of those groups of shires that needed some additional funding. In closing, I look forward with anticipation to a decent contribution to the repair of the road infrastructure in New South Wales by the New South Wales Labor government and I hope and sincerely request that they will make a contribution to match the federal coalition government's contribution to roads as quickly as possible in the interests of road safety for everybody in New South Wales.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>23188</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate for one reason in particular, and that is to point out to the government, to the Deputy Prime Minister in particular, the contradictions and the inequity within the way in which this funding package has been put together and distributed. </para></talk.start><para>I was impressed this afternoon when I heard the Deputy Prime Minister during question time regale us with the social benefits that accrue to the community as a result of better roads. He made a number of points. Included among them was the importance of road infrastructure to improving educational outcomes for people who live in rural communities. He also made the point about the importance of road infrastructure for improving health outcomes for people who live in rural communities. Frankly, I agree with him. But the plain fact is that in the context of the Northern Territory this money will go next to nowhere towards improving or providing social benefits to people who live in the Northern Territory. I say that knowing full well that the $20 million which the Northern Territory is to receive is going to be welcomed by those 70-odd community councils and local government councils that will receive funding. The fact of the matter is that the average distribution of these funds to rural communities outside of Darwin and Alice Springs will be around $10,000 per community over four years. The sum of $2,500 per year is the average amount that local government authorities will get in the Northern Territory. </para><para>You have to ask yourself: does that sound fair or reasonable? I have before me a list of those 17 or 18 electorates that received the bulk of the funding. It comes as no surprise that the electorate to receive the most funding was of course that of the member for O'Connor. The member for Gwydir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, was the second or third highest beneficiary of this money. I make this observation: we have heard a lot today about the way in which this money has been distributed. We have not seen the formula that has been used. We have heard about population, we have heard about road length and we have heard about historical circumstances. Let me ask you this question: what strikes you as peculiar? In the case of the electorate of Gwydir, its area is 114,000 square kilometres. It has 72,930 voters on the roll and at the 1996 census had a population of 111,146 people. That electorate received $42,386,389. I did two simple calculations. I divided the population into that amount and got the following amount: $381 per head, $581 per voter and $372 per kilometre. </para><para>What I did then was use those figures and apply them to the Northern Territory. What we discover when we apply those figures to the Northern Territory—using the population ratio, the population figures of the Northern Territory, bearing in mind that the population of the Northern Territory is 190,000 and there are 105,000 voters—is that, if you use the population criterion alone, the Northern Territory could expect to receive something in the vicinity of $72,457,000. We got $20 million. If you use the voting population we could have expected to have received $61,053,000. If we use the area figures on their own, the Northern Territory could have expected to have received $409 million. The fact is we got 20. The fact is that the most isolated people in Australia, those people who need road access most, live in my electorate. </para><para>They are the people who have been disowned by this government. The people the government have made it very clear they have no concern for are the people who live in my electorate. I am not alone in saying this. I have in front of me an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline>, dated 29 November. The headline is `$20 million for NT roads is just nonsense'. You would expect me to be saying that, and I have done it. But you would not expect the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Development, Mick Palmer, to be saying it, but he has. He said—and I quote here from this extract:</para><quote><para>It is extremely disappointing; it is just nonsense.</para></quote><para>It is nonsense for a number of reasons. Unlike the member for Gwydir, the National Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister, who sits in the cabinet room and, with his colleagues, orchestrates where this dough goes, unlike the member for O'Connor, also a minister who sits in on the deliberations of where these moneys go, we are in a situation where the formula concocted by the government has created a very unequitable distribution of these resources. It means $1.2 billion of taxpayers' money flushed down the drain, effectively, in terms of my electorate because it will do nothing—nothing—to materially advance the state of the road infrastructure in the Northern Territory.</para><para>Let us make it very clear: not only does this package not do that but also it does nothing to alleviate the problem of high fuel prices—and high fuel prices are something I have experience of. I want to use the example of a couple of communities. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may or may not know where the community of Numbulwar is. You may or may not know where the community of Ngukurr is. They are both in the Northern Territory. I am sure the Deputy Prime Minister has no damn idea where either of those communities is. But those communities, between them, have roughly 3,000 people and there is a road length of some 156 kilometres. They join the Roper Highway, and the Roper Highway goes to Katherine. These two communities are in south-east Arnhem Land. For around six months of each year, they are inaccessible by road. Why are they inaccessible by road? Because, of course, in the wet season the rivers flood. What do these communities need to ensure that they get all-year-round access? They need a bridge: a bridge across either the Wilton River or the Roper River, or both. Also, they need roadworks done to give them an all-weather seal on the road. </para><para>The cost of just bringing the road up to a reasonable standard is $3 million. Understand this, Mr Deputy Speaker: the community of Numbulwar will received $282,000 over four years out of this program; the Yugul Mangi Community Council will receive around $307,000. These two communities also have local roads they have to look after. The connecting roads between these two communities are not their responsibility; they are the responsibility of either the Northern Territory government or the federal government. But nothing in terms of the contribution being made out of this road money will assist in the development of an all-weather road for these two communities. Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what this means. The people at Numbulwar pay $1.83 per litre for diesel. I understand that it has been estimated that, if they had an all-weather road to Numbulwar, their freight costs would come down by something like 70 per cent. The reason for this, of course, is that during the wet season, for most of six months of the year, they have to barge from Darwin.</para><para>I hear the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister, come in here and proselytise about the importance of rural communities. I accept that they are extremely important. My heart goes out to all those farmers in northern New South Wales who have been ravaged by floods. But understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, the communities in my electorate are not made up of farmers; predominantly, they are Aboriginal communities. They have the lowest incomes of all Australians, they have the lowest level of infrastructure support of all Australians, yet they pay the highest costs in Australia for fuel and transport—and their roads are miserable.</para><para>But what do we get from this government? We get a maldistribution of these resources to the extent that $42 million goes to the electorate of Gwydir. I will go back and use the figures for the electorate of the member for O'Connor. If we use the population ratio of the Northern Territory for the seat of Gwydir, the seat of Gwydir would receive $13.8 million, not $42 million. I would think, in terms of my own communities, that is a far better distribution of the resources. Give us the $42 million in the Northern Territory and, Mr Anderson, you take $14 million—because, on any measure of disadvantage, on any measure of inequity, the people who are most disadvantaged in this whole process are the people who live in rural communities in the Northern Territory. Yet not one jot of notice is taken of that issue by this government.</para><para>If this government wants to illustrate that it is actually working for all Australians, the Deputy Prime Minister would go back to the formula which he has created in his little mind back in his office here in Parliament House and come up with something which is fair and reasonable. He would come up with something which says of that $1.2 billion, `We accept that the electorates of Kalgoorlie and the Northern Territory, just by their nature, must get the lion's share of these resources which are being made available.' But we do not find that at all. While the electorate of Kalgoorlie is high up on the list, as it should be, where does the Northern Territory rate in the hit parade of those communities, those electorates, which will receive money from this government for this purpose, for these roads? It is almost off the screen. The persons responsible for making these decisions are, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues.</para><para>So when I hear the Deputy Prime Minister talk about the social benefits that can be garnered from improving roads in rural and remote areas, I say to him: yes, I agree. Of course I agree that if you can get kids to school across roads it is very important. But did you know that in the community of Umbukumba on Groote Eylandt there are no teachers resident? They live something like 70 kilometres away from Alyangula and Angurugu—two other communities—on a dirt road. It is not an all-weather dirt road. This program will not provide them with sufficient resources to fix their roads. As a result, there are often times when neither teachers nor nurses can visit that community. So the kids go without education on those days and the community goes without the benefit of the medical service provided by the registered nurses. Is that fair or reasonable? If the Deputy Prime Minister were concerned about improving the social benefits that accrue to people who live in rural areas, he would have allocated this money on a needs basis, not on some airy-fairy formula made up in his office based on historical circumstances. I think the historical circumstance he was talking about was who won the last bloody election. Given they won the last election, he said, `We will make a determination of what the priorities will be on the sort of formula we will create for ourselves.' The Leader of the Opposition has been 100 per cent on the money about the use of these funds ever since it became clear where they were going to go. </para><para>Because this money has been distributed in this particular way, there is no recognition of the strategic importance of developing infrastructure in regional Australia. We have $400 million from the National Highway Program yet to be distributed. This afternoon I had occasion to talk to a constituent of mine who is the Director of the Australian Trucking Association. I asked him what he thought of this program. He said that they were extremely disappointed. He said that it was a slap in the face for Territorians. He is 100 per cent correct. It is a slap in the face for Territorians. The Northern Territory government is not a friend of mine but is supposedly an ally of the coalition. It has Senator Tambling, who sits in the Senate with the National Party and is a parliamentary secretary. What influence does he have on this government? Clearly none. We have seen that they have made decisions which, as Mr Cooper has said, are a slap in the face for the community of the Northern Territory. Whilst I would like to see some of that $400 million go to upgrading the highway between Katherine and Darwin, Highway 1, I would also like some of that money to go to Highway 1 from Borroloola to Burketown. I bet it will not.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tuckey</name></talker><para>—Of course it won't.

Even if we do, it will not go to addressing the huge need that is clearly obvious in the Northern Territory.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is important that I say all of these things because in 1996, when the Howard government were first elected, they canned the regional road program in the Northern Territory, a regional road program which was based on strategic roads around Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. They canned that program: $15 million over three years—gone. As it happens, the roads which it was earmarked for—the Daly River and Port Keats road covering 128 kilometres at $2 million, serving a population of about 3½ thousand people; the Arnhem Link Road covering 393 kilometres at $5.3 million, serving a population of 3½ thousand people or thereabouts; the Ngukurr-Numbulwar road, which I have spoken of previously; the Angurugu-Umbakumba road, which I have spoken of previously; the Papunya and Kintore Road, which I have spoken of previously—are strategic roads identified by a collection of people, including the Northern Territory government. Aboriginal people through the land council in the Northern Territory require that funding, funding which was identified by the previous Labor government and made available for this purpose, funding which was knocked on the head by the Howard government as soon as they came into office. You cannot believe how aggrieved I am that this money which has been made available across Australia has not been done on a strategic basis, has not been done on a needs basis, to develop the infrastructure that is required in the Northern Territory in terms of roads.</para><para>This is failing the needs of my communities. This is failing the needs of the Northern Territory. This is failing the needs of Australia. This is not done on a strategic basis or on a needs basis; this is done on the whim of the government. You only have to see the distribution of funds to understand that that is a fact. The people who are being most disadvantaged in Australia in terms of access to infrastructure, access to resources, access to good education, access to good health—those things which have been identified as the sorts of social outcomes which the Deputy Prime Minister is trying to achieve—are Aboriginal people who live in remote communities of the Northern Territory. Whilst they will receive some moneys—70 communities will receive smaller amounts of money for their local roads—nothing is being done to make a reasonable fist of doing a strategic analysis of what money should go into roads in the Northern Territory and that money being provided.  </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leo McLeay</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>LEAVE OF ABSENCE</title><type>Leave of Absence</type><page.no>23192</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leo McLeay</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That leave of absence for the remainder of this year be given to the honourable member for Bass (Ms O'Byrne) for maternity purposes.</para></motion></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>23192</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tuckey</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That the House do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginals: Stolen Generations</title><page.no>23192</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>23192</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me great pleasure to use this short time available during the adjournment debate to read to you a letter from a year 8 student from Jabiru Area School in the Northern Territory. This letter has been written by Miranda Tapsell, a 13-year-old girl who attends the Jabiru school. Recently the year 8 students from Jabiru Area School completed a unit of work on argument and persuasion. At the end of the unit, the students had to write a letter to the editor on a topic that interested them or about which they felt strongly. The subject matter was entirely up to them. This student wrote a letter about apologising and the failure of the Prime Minister to say sorry. The views which she expressed in this letter I am sure go to the heart of many arguments which have been had in this place about the necessity for the Prime Minister to apologise on behalf of the government and people of Australia. I would like to read this letter from Miranda Tapsell, entitled `Sorry'. The letter states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Dear Editor</para><para>I am ashamed of the way our Prime Minister, John Howard consistently refuses to say sorry to the Stolen Generation.</para><para>These people have literally been taken away from their family because the government of the day believed that the Aboriginal children of mixed races would have a better education by being removed from parents and relatives. Because of that, hundreds of Indigenous Australians have lost their culture and language. They do not know where they come from and most importantly, many of them do not know who their family is.</para><para>Of course John Howard himself may not feel that he should say sorry because he personally did not do anything. But he is the Prime Minister, the head of the government and he should have the compassion to apologize for the actions of previous governments that have caused this terrible trauma for these innocent victims. Stop and think how you would feel not ever having known your parents because you were taken away from them.</para><para>How would you feel having been told that your parents died a month ago when you had finally found out where they lived? Mr Howard, if you were not the Prime Minister and you were part of the Stolen Generation, you would be in there pouring your heart out on the subject.</para><para>Some citizens of Australia may ask, “What will saying sorry change?”</para><para>Saying sorry always helps. This apology is like any other one.</para><para>On behalf on the Stolen Generation, I beg you to say one simple word that will heal the rift between black and white. Come on, John Howard, make the effort to apologise now.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Miranda Tapsell</para></quote><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have to say that is a heartfelt plea from a young Australian who feels deeply about the subject—a young Australian who clearly understands the hurt being felt by members of the stolen generation and a young Australian who, I know, knows many people who are members of the stolen generation. That heartfelt plea she is making is shared by the majority of Australians, but it is something which our Prime Minister cannot confront. He cannot accept the legitimacy of the demand that he should say sorry on behalf of all of us. I think he will have a very good opportunity next year in the Centenary of Federation when this parliament will sit in Melbourne. I make a plea to the Prime Minister to accept the requests by so many Australians of goodwill for you to apologise on behalf of the people of Australia and use the occasion of that meeting of the parliament in Melbourne on the Centenary of Federation to say sorry. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Work Experience: Dean Little</title><page.no>23193</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>23193</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to read a speech prepared for me by Dean Little, a Year 10 student from St John the Evangelist High School in Nowra, who is sitting in the gallery. He has been doing work experience with me this week in his own time. His first week of work experience with us was performed at the electorate office in Nowra and this apparently infected him with such interest that he has decided to spend another week with his local federal politician. I asked him to prepare a five-minute speech on his work experience and any other topic, and this is what he wants to say:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Work experience this week has been a wonderful insight into the effort that goes on behind the scenes to keep this country running. Before I thought I knew roughly how much work politicians did or didn't do. Now I fully respect and admire them. Politicians put in almost a whole day's work, with little sleep and no time just to sit down to breathe. Politicians are constantly running to meetings or trying to get into the House of Representatives or Senate before they are locked out. I especially admire the dedication MPs have for representing their electorate. During this week, I have enjoyed the many privileges and learning experiences given to me by everyone in the House. I was fortunate enough to meet and shake hands with people that I previously thought were untouchable. I have learnt information that not many others would know, like why the doors behind the Speaker in the House of Reps are so tall and why the clocks are so high. I will cherish this week for a long time indeed.</para><para>Finally, I would like to thank not only the people with whom I have worked but also the people who showed me the way around and the people who taught me the details of government that I did not know. The people in the Library were all too willing to help and the part of the speech you are about to hear would have been 100 times more daunting without their help.</para></quote><para>He says:</para><quote><para>Racism in Australia has been a big issue ever since Federation. The people subject to this most are the Indigenous. At the school I attend in Nowra I hear quite a lot of racism, which I find strange, because the students from whom I hear these remarks don't have a lot of interaction with the Aboriginal community. At our school there are less than a handful of Aboriginal people. Given such little interaction with Aboriginal people how can students who are 14 to 17 years of age make informed racial remarks, especially since they have a negative edge? I feel that my peers are becoming more racist but the racism that is displayed is not true racism. I believe these acts of racism don't sprout from hate or contempt but rather ignorance, greater social acceptance of negative comments and the early learning from parents.</para><para>The main way we can put an end to this in my opinion is by raising awareness and education. Although these acts of indecency are not being conducted in front of our Indigenous students, due to their small numbers, it is still having negative effects. With each joke, comment or racial remark that is negative to our Aboriginal community the children listening feel more superior, because through these jokes etc we are putting the Aboriginals of Australia down and projecting the `Anglo' up higher in the social minds of my peers. With more children having an idea of superiority in their heads more jokes will be told and the situation will snowball.</para><para>The quicker we can start to educate people to understand that even the smallest racist joke is not okay, the quicker we can melt this snowball down. I feel that to start educating my peers we must show them the effects of their actions and also make them realise what they are doing, because society does not condemn such insensitive speech and therefore not all children realise what it is they are doing. I find it quite strange that 0.01% of our genetic make-up is responsible for this entire ruckus and detriment of human rights. You see on page 22 of the September 4th issue of this year's Time Magazine, it writes 0.01 %—the percentage of a person's genes that is reflected in outward appearance (colour of skin, eyes, etc).</para><para>And that is what it boils down to. We all have the same colour blood that runs through our veins so why should colour matter? We are all human, after all.

One of the winners of an award was the Hollywood Private Hospital in Nedlands in my electorate of Curtin. It is a 350-bed private teaching hospital employing some 850 people, and it won the award in the large business category for over 100 employees. Hollywood Private Hospital was cited by the minister as a paramount example of the economic and social virtues of innovative and flexible workplace relations. In fact, Hollywood Private Hospital was the winner of the national gold award for the highest performance overall in these corporate work and family awards. </para></talk.start><para>At the core of the hospital's family friendly policies is a flexible approach to their employment conditions that allows employees to control their working hours to their advantage and to the advantage of their employer. The hospital offers flexitime, job sharing, part-time work, access to single days annual leave, annualised hours and many other initiatives, including arrangements for full-time ward managers to work at the hospital during the school hours of their children and then from home outside school hours. That offers an extremely important consideration for many parents and families. A high proportion of the nurses at Hollywood are employed on a part-time basis; not, as the opposition would have it, because they somehow are economic victims, but rather because that is what they want according to their requirements and that is what they expect from their employer. As the minister described it:</para><quote><para>The hospital gets the skilled and experienced nurses it needs, and the nurses get the hours that they want.</para></quote><para>This is 21st century workplace relations at their best. It is easy to forget that, if those who opposed industrial relations reforms had had their way, these kinds of flexible and innovative arrangements would never have seen the light of day; not because such arrangements are not supported by workers, by management and by business, but because they are opposed by trade union leaders and their delegates in the parliament.</para><para>Only a commitment to flexibility, efficiency and reform on the part of successive Liberal and coalition governments has allowed workplaces to be transformed from calcified battlegrounds into places where efficiency and productivity go hand in hand with family and personal responsibilities. But having achieved great reforms is no guarantee to the community that those reforms will endure, for in my state of Western Australia the Australian Labor Party actively threatens the labour relations achievements of that state. Under the coalition government led by Premier Richard Court, the adult minimum wage in Western Australia has increased by $21.30 to $368 a week. The introduction of the Workplace Agreements Act in 1993 created an alternative industrial relations system that has delivered more flexible and productive arrangements for employers and employees. There has been an increasing acceptance of workplace agreements over awards and industrial agreements—more than 254,000 since their introduction. Employees not previously covered by awards, other than those renumerated by commission or piecework, now have their wage rates protected under the Minimum Conditions of Employment Act 1993, the first of its kind in Australia.</para><para>Pre-strike ballot laws came into effect on 1 January 1998, allowing Western Australian workers to vote democratically on potential strike action, while preserving confidentiality and privacy on the part of workers placed in this situation. The results have been impressive. Western Australia consistently outperforms the other states in most labour market outcomes. It is consistently amongst the best states for job creation, low unemployment and youth unemployment and has had relatively high wages growth. In the past decade there has been a steady decline in industrial disputes and Western Australia's average number of working days lost remains below the national average.</para><para> Yet the twin dangers that federal Labor and Western Australian Labor pose to these achievements is very real. Back in August, the leader of the Labor opposition in Western Australia was steamrolled by his federal colleagues at their national conference into supporting the outlawing of individual agreements, despite his own public admission that these agreements are of benefit to Western Australian workers, particularly in crucial industries like our mining industry. The state Labor leader admitted publicly that he held the cause of Labor Party unity and union amicability as a priority—obviously in higher regard than the interests of Western Australian workers and business. Not that we should have any sympathy for state Labor in Western Australia. They may have thought that they were only being collegiate in backing what had actually been federal Labor policy back in 1998, but they themselves are a threat to good workplace relations in Western Australia. Plainly, Western Australian Labor is cut from the same cloth as that of Queensland Labor-, where Queensland work agreements have been `neutered' by the Labor government, despite their pre-election posturing on a pseudo-commitment to the principle of individual agreements. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Capricornia Electorate: Bowen Basin</title><page.no>23196</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>23196</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have spoken before about the concerns held by people living in the mining communities of the Bowen Basin in my electorate in relation to what they see happening to the communities where they have built their lives and homes. Over the past few years there has been an increasing mood of insecurity fuelled by industrial disputes and downsizing. There has been a lack of trust between the companies and the workers and their families, due to the failure of companies to communicate effectively and openly with their employees. There has been a population decline as a result of redundancies and, more often, the shift of companies to contract labour instead of a permanent work force. Twelve-hour shifts have also encouraged families to move to the coast while dad stays in the mining town for his shifts and comes home on his days off. These factors are having a big impact on the mining communities. Families are anxious about their future and under pressure. The decline in the population is affecting the viability of small businesses, local community organisations and important services such as schools and hospitals. People are sick of feeling as though their communities have been forgotten by governments and that they are simply at the mercy of mining companies. The people I have been talking to in the mining towns want some reassurance that there is a general commitment to the life of their towns so that they can be confident about building their families' futures there. </para></talk.start><para>As a result of this call from the community, the state Minister for Rural Communities gave the go-ahead for a local committee to organise a forum sponsored by the state government. Participants were invited to discuss the problems causing anxiety and anger in the mining towns and spell out how they see their futures and what support is needed to achieve those goals. The `Positive futures in mining communities' forum in Moranbah brought together local councillors and CEOs, state government department representatives, union delegates, community people, mining company representatives and small business owners from across the Bowen Basin. There was an acknowledgment that the coal industry is under more pressure today than in the past, but even in the current environment there is no justification for the constant threats by the companies of imminent disaster which undermine the confidence of these towns. It is now time for communities, companies and governments to agree that these towns do have a future and they deserve the commitment of each of those partners to strengthen that future.</para><para>It is good to see that at least one of the mining companies sees a role for itself in that process. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mercury</inline> of 29 November, in which Ian Dymock from BHP said:</para><quote><para>However, there is a future in the coal business and the communities, and it is great to see everyone participating, the government, the unions, and the local residents to try to, as a community, come up with the answers.</para></quote><para>The state Minister for Mines and Energy, Tony McGrady, announced a significant state government measure. It will now require companies opening new mines to give undertakings about local jobs. Of course, the industrial relations policy announced by the ALP at its recent national conference will also help to bring some security back into the industry from the employees' point of view. </para><para>I want to support the initiative of the people who pushed for the idea of the forum and who worked to make it possible. Lynda Pollock and Joy Deguara I name in particular. Although I know that many others were involved, it was their baby from the start, and it was a success. </para><para>I thought the forum was a valuable exercise and a very positive one. I know how hard groups in the individual mining towns are working to pinpoint opportunities that can diversify the economic base of the towns and promote a positive view of the mining communities. I know there are also groups that are challenging the mining companies to accept their responsibility for the wellbeing of the towns and the people in them. The forum was a chance to support those people in those individual communities, to bring them together, to build partnerships between communities and to get mining companies talking to the communities they work in. I hope that the forum will prove to be a first step towards putting an end to the environment of insecurity and uncertainty that has stifled the mining towns of central Queensland, and that the new relationships created by the forum will provide a strong platform for capturing future opportunities identified at the forum this week.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Labor Party: Queensland</title><page.no>23197</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>23197</page.no><name role="metadata">Macfarlane, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr IAN MACFARLANE</name><name.id>WN6</name.id><electorate>Groom</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—They say a week is a long time in politics. I wonder exactly what the Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, is thinking after the revelations this week at the Shepherdson inquiry into electoral fraud. Just a fortnight ago, Premier Beattie and his deputy, Jim Elder, arrogantly closed state parliament down for the year, packed their bags and set about heading overseas on government business. Premier Beattie flew to Japan and Mr Elder prepared to go to Africa. Mr Beattie made it to Japan; Mr Elder, on the other hand, feigned illness and stayed at home. However, instead of going to the doctor, Mr Elder paid a very discreet visit to the Queensland Criminal Justice Committee. The rest is history, and I am sure the actual events will be embedded in the minds of senior Labor officials for quite some time. I am sure, too, that the specific events of the last two days will leave bitter memories in the minds of many ordinary Queenslanders.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday, state member for Springwood, Grant Musgrove, admitted to witnessing four false electoral enrolment forms. Today, former Deputy Premier and Labor member for Capalaba admitted to enrolling some of his brothers and sisters at his Brisbane home when they did not permanently live there. Mr Elder also said his brother Phillip and then wife Linda were enrolled at his sister's home but did not live there.</para><para>But that is not all. I am led to believe that, in evidence this afternoon, high profile Ipswich Labor councillor, Paul Tully, admitted also to fraudulently filling out enrolment forms. Unfortunately, I suspect the list does not stop there. Already the inquiry has heard evidence about the involvement of a number of other state and federal Labor MPs in electoral fraud. It has also brought to the surface allegations about the $1,400 payment from the honourable member for Lilley to the Australian Democrats.</para><para>These are all very serious allegations and the people of Queensland have a right to be concerned. Worse still, they have a right to be outraged. For well over two years, Premier Beattie has used every opportunity to extol the virtues and integrity of his government. Well, Mr Speaker, the truth speaks for itself, and history will record that the Beattie government was full of fraudsters and rorters. A question mark even hangs over the Premier himself. As we know, Premier Beattie was State Secretary of the Labor Party and has been around the traps for a very long time. It is quite unbelievable to think that he was unaware that his deputy, the chairman of his legal and constitutional review committee, his successor as state secretary and other prominent members of the party were up to no good. I think that if blind Freddy were a member of the Labor Party, with as much involvement and experience as Peter Beattie, even he would have been able to see that there were problems with rorting.</para><para>But Mr Beattie's problems do not end there. Just today, his government was plunged back into minority status with the resignation of Jim Elder and the imminent resignation of Grant Musgrove from the Labor Party. Fortunately for Mr Beattie, Mr Elder and Mr Musgrove have indicated they will continue to support the government in parliament. However, in my view, if the Premier accepted this support, he would be a fraud. To say that he will not tolerate rorters and cheats in his party and then to turn around and accept their support to stay in office is nothing but hypocrisy at its worst. This is a farce. The Premier is saying that he is not only happy to have had the support of rorters to get elected but he is happy to have the support of rorters to stay elected. </para><para>A government for rorters, by rorters, with rorters. If Mr Beattie is serious about cleaning up rorting in his party, he should reject the support of rorters and send a clear signal that criminal behaviour will not be tolerated in the Australian Labor Party. Mr Beattie must also answer the question about how many more elected members of the Labor Party are going to be embroiled in this scandal. Hopefully, for the sake of Queensland people, the Shepherdson inquiry will help in answering this question and restore integrity to the electoral process.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Statement by Mr Speaker</title><page.no>23198</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>23198</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I recognise the member for Fowler, I would just like to make a brief comment to the House following events in the House earlier today and yesterday.

The electorate of Fowler is regarded as the safest Labor seat in Australia, so it is unusual that a Liberal government health minister should promise something for Liverpool Hospital in the electorate Fowler. But Liverpool Hospital serves a much greater area of south-western Sydney, including the marginal seat of Macarthur, held by the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr John Fahey. So when the Minister for Health and Aged Care announced in a press release dated 1998 that he and the member for Macarthur supported the placement of an MRI scanner at Liverpool Hospital, it seemed like a sure thing. The minister said at the time:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>I expect the hospital to have an MRI as soon as possible.</para></quote><para>Well, Mr Speaker, we are still waiting out there in Liverpool. Two years ago, the minister described Liverpool Hospital as:</para><quote><para>The largest new teaching hospital in Australia, located in a rapidly growing area which already serves seven hundred and fifty thousand people.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>Liverpool Hospital has established its case as an underserviced region and is clearly eligible for assistance under the federal adjustment and relocation scheme and, subject to the New South Wales government providing the necessary supporting documentation, I expect the hospital to have an MRI as soon as possible.</para></quote><para>But here we are, two years down the track, and no sign of the scanner.</para><para>Now we all know how the Minister for Health and Aged Care likes to help out his mates when it comes to getting an MRI scanner for them. And his media release gives credit to his mate, the member for Macarthur. The original announcement praised the member saying: </para><quote><para>Mr Fahey, who has worked hard to secure the new technology for the south west Sydney population said his constituents and the people of Sydney will receive enormous benefit from an MRI scanner at Liverpool Hospital.</para></quote><para>Since then or, rather, since the redistribution which makes the seat of Macarthur less safe for him, Mr Fahey has bailed out. He has taken his carpetbag off to the seat of Hume. He does not care about Macarthur any more. There is no sign of the promised MRI scanner and no sign of the hardworking member for Macarthur either. </para><para>But while the member for Macarthur is no longer around, the need for an MRI scanner at Liverpool Hospital remains. Patients at Liverpool Hospital who need an MRI scan are forced to go to a privately operated centre. They are required to pay the difference between the fee charged and the Medicare rebate. Patients can expect to pay up to $500 from their own pocket for essential scans, that is, when the centre is open. When it is not open, this major teaching hospital has to send patients requiring scans to Westmead Hospital. So patients with brain and spinal cord injuries, including road accident victims, face an ambulance trip of 40 minutes each way to access this life saving technology.</para><para>The dedicated work of health professionals at Liverpool Hospital is building its reputation as an excellent teaching hospital. However, without an MRI scanner, Liverpool Hospital cannot achieve its full potential as a teaching hospital. By now, patients at Liverpool Hospital should have had access to an MRI scanner. Instead, they have to pay through the nose for private scans or be shunted all over Sydney to access this service. They have the hardworking member for Macarthur to thank for their wait. John Fahey, thanks for nothing. The people in Macarthur, or Hume, when they cast their vote at the ballot box at the next federal election, will remember what John Fahey has done for them.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>23199</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 6.00 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>23199</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notice was given:</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Theophanous</name></talker><para>—to move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	expresses its concern at the hardship created by the implementation of the Government policy of granting three year temporary visas to refugees arriving without papers, even after they have been accepted as genuine under Australia's refugee determination processes;</para><para>(2)	recognises that the provision in the three year visa which prevents the unification of those persons granted refugee status under the new policy with their spouse and dependent children, is inhumane and unacceptable under international human rights provisions, and is likely to prevent these refugees from seeing their spouses and children for more than the three year period; and</para><para>(3)	calls upon the Government to abolish this excessively punitive provision for those persons granted refugee status and to allow them to sponsor their spouses and dependent children to be with them for as long as they are given protection under Australia's international obligations.</para></motion></interjection></debate></chamber.xscript><maincomm.xscript><business.start><day.start>2000-11-30</day.start><para>—————</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl) </inline>took the chair at 9.40 a.m.</para></business.start><debate><debateinfo><title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title><type>Statements by Members</type><page.no>23200</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hunter Electorate: Allandale Aged Care Facility</title><page.no>23200</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>23200</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This morning I want to raise an issue involving my electorate  and which I have spoken about in this place on a number of occasions. I refer to an aged care facility in Cessnock known as Allandale. Allandale has traditionally been one of Cessnock's major employers and a source of apprenticeships and all sorts of training in the electorate. It was established in 1962 and has operated as an aged care facility for most of that time. For all of that time it has been owned and operated by the New South Wales state government.</para></talk.start><para>The CEO of the Hunter Area Health Service, Professor Katherine McGrath, is determined that that should not be the case any longer and is determined to privatise Allandale. I do not take an ideological approach to privatisation. In fact, I think privatisation should always be considered on a case by case basis. If governments can make out a case for privatisation, so be it, particularly in circumstances where a huge injection of capital is required to keep the facility viable or competitive. Professor Katherine McGrath has not made out a case for privatising Allandale, and I am very concerned about the implications of privatisation for residents of the facility and their families. In particular, for those who work at the facility, I think employment numbers will decline significantly. I do not think there is anything in it for the Cessnock community.</para><para>Professor Katherine McGrath says that the privatisation of Allandale is about enhancing the standard of care at Allandale and, indeed, attracting a greater amount of Commonwealth funding. As you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the early nineties the Commonwealth agreed to take over all funding responsibilities for aged care because of concerns regarding inconsistencies in standards of care across the country. It was also agreed that the Commonwealth would not pay the capital component of bed funding for those homes that were operated by the state government. In other words, the New South Wales government has a lesser ability than a private provider to attract Commonwealth funds.</para><para>Professor Katherine McGrath's plan to privatise Allandale is no more than an exercise in shifting costs from the New South Wales government to the Commonwealth. It is about saving her budget $3.5 million each year. Professor McGrath says that if she can make savings of $3.5 million in relation to Allandale each year, that represents more money that she has available to put into acute care. I say that if Katherine McGrath has identified shortfalls in acute care funding she should take her case to the government and secure additional funding. She should not be seeking, at the expense of the local community, to embark upon a cost shifting exercise by privatising Allandale. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Conference of Members of Parliament of Italian Origin</title><page.no>23200</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23200</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to say how privileged and honoured I was to attend the conference of members of parliament of Italian origin, along with the member for Bowman and the member for Prospect, in Rome last week.

We have democracy, we have freedom and we have the ability to speak about any subject without fearing for our lives. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Canberra Electorate: Art Exhibition</title><page.no>23201</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>23201</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellis, Annette, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ELLIS</name><name.id>5K6</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the privileges of our jobs as federal members is to have the opportunity to be out in our electorates and to see the wonderful level of community that occurs within our own electorates. I had that experience again last Saturday when I was asked to open a particular art exhibition. The special part of this art exhibition was the participants.</para></talk.start><para>The art exhibition was called <inline font-style="italic">A Good Red </inline>and could in fact have been interpreted in many ways—maybe that we were showing paintings of bottles of red wine. That was not the case. The art exhibition was held at the Tuggeranong Community Arts Centre in the southern part of my electorate—one of the most well-used community facilities one could ever wish to visit. I take this opportunity to commend everyone concerned—Evol McLeod and her whole team at the Tuggeranong Community Arts Centre—for the wonderful and vibrant use that the centre is experiencing through members of the community.</para><para>Let me get back to the art exhibition. Katherine Alexander is a local arts teacher who has made it her task to involve as many people in the community as possible in art. On Saturday there were 35 artists exhibiting over 70 works of art at the Tuggeranong Community Arts Centre. The uniqueness of it was that none of these 35 people believed that they were artists. This was the first time that any one of them had had a piece of their work hung in a public place. In many cases, the piece of work hung was the first thing they had ever done. These art classes have all been under the auspices of Katherine Alexander and two of our local colleges that have assisted her in running these art classes.</para><para>The thrill for me was to see the 200 or 300 people there all connected in some way with these 35 artists and the joy they got out of seeing the achievement these 35 people had reached by actually going to an art class, learning something about expressing themselves, actually exposing themselves by putting their efforts into a piece of art and then being convinced that they should display it publicly for other people to see. The age range of these 35 people was from the early 20s to the late 70s. Some of them had learnt art despite having had a stroke or having had to face some other problem or difficulty. </para><para>As federal members of the parliament, we sometimes need to reground ourselves by going to a function like this and actually connecting with the efforts that individuals put into their own development within our community. I say to Katherine Alexander and to every one of those 35 artists—I believe they are artists; these people are very good; I could not draw a circle if you paid me—that they deserve encouragement and congratulations. I also congratulate the Tuggeranong Community Arts Centre for putting on the display.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Labor Party: Queensland</title><page.no>23202</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>23202</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have been mesmerised, shocked, horrified, maybe even transfixed, as has the Australian community, by the continuing revelations of institutionalised electoral corruption, false enrolment and voter fraud being disclosed through the proceedings of the Shepherdson inquiry in Queensland.

So the member for Dickson launched Grant Musgrove's campaign for the seat of Springwood, which he won by a very small margin, and no doubt the member for Springwood has admitted that he has been a party to voter fraud and to false enrolment. The member for Dickson really ought to explain whether she was aware at the time she launched that campaign that the member for Springwood was indeed participating in such nefarious activities.</para><para>Premier Beattie is the one constant throughout all this.

I am sure many members have joined this scheme and have benefited from it in the same way that I have. The Adopt a Politician scheme was developed to assist members of parliament and community leaders to be more aware of the problems that families who have children with a disability experience on a day to day basis. I have certainly enjoyed my 12 months of getting to know the Cassey family much better. Heather, Ray, Joanne, Stuart and Jack have been kind in letting me into their family circle and in helping me develop a better understanding of the difficulties that they face. </para></talk.start><para>Stuart, who has an acquired brain injury, has many challenges that he needs to face for the rest of his life. Yesterday, Stuart celebrated his 17th birthday. An average young Australian male would be celebrating getting ready to leave school, getting his driver's licence and perhaps going on to university. Sadly, these are not the exciting adventures that Stuart is looking forward to. He will be going back to Corpus Christie College next year, but he is going to need the ongoing support of his family and the community for the rest of his life.</para><para>One of the groups that has offered support to the Cassey family and others is a group called Teen Spirit. Stuart's mum, Heather, has played a key role in the development of this group. Their major goal is to provide school holiday activities for children with disabilities, because these kids cannot go to the movies by themselves or take on activities without supervision. The group has been fundraising and seeking ways of making sure that their kids have good school holidays the way the rest of the community does. In the previous 12 months they have had success in getting some funding, but unfortunately it soon runs out. It is one of the issues that we need to have a good look at to make sure that groups like Teen Spirit, which have a really important role—they do good work—get the support they need.</para><para>One of the successes of groups like Teen Spirit is letting children with disabilities not only make friendships outside the schools or the areas they attend but also develop friendships with children who do not have a disability. You see all the children forming friendships, and children who do not have a disability develop a greater understanding and sympathy for the problems that these young people are experiencing. I congratulate Heather for the great work she has done and wish Stuart a happy 17th birthday—one day late. I am sure that all members will enjoy this program. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>McPherson Electorate: Paralympics</title><page.no>23203</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>23203</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last month Australia hosted one of the most inspiring sporting events ever staged—the 11th Paralympic Games. As a parliamentarian for the Paralympics, I was proud to support this pinnacle event and witness the way in which the human spirit is able to triumph over physical adversity in an awe-inspiring spectacle. I have also taken an interest in the Paralympic Games on a more personal level in my electorate. I have already spoken in this place of the Gold Coast's local swimming champion Shane Walsh and the challenges he overcame to make it to the Paralympic Games. I am proud to be able to report that Shane Walsh delivered the goods for his community and his country. Shane was a member of the Australian men's 4 x 100 metres relay team that scooped silver at the games. He was also placed fifth in the 50-metres freestyle and seventh in the 100-metres freestyle. </para></talk.start><para>I met up with Shane shortly after he returned from the games and naturally he is thrilled at his medal win. Although Shane deserves every ounce of credit for the countless hours he spent training at the Bond University pool, he is the first to admit that no-one can achieve such a feat alone. So, on behalf of Shane Walsh and myself, I would like to put on the parliamentary record our immense gratitude and respect for the residents, businesses and community organisations that believed in Shane's dream and helped him achieve it. The first donor to come on board to help out our home-grown hero was local developer Nifsan Gold Seal Homes. I would particularly like to thank the general manager, Ian McLean, and the quality control manager, Ken Philips, for donating the price of an airfare to Sydney so that Shane was able to have a loved one there to support him. </para><para>The following businesses and individuals also helped Shane achieve his goal: Bob Binks from Surfside Ford, John Gardner from Strand Resorts, Roger and Lyn Campbell from Palm Beach Super Cycle, Glen Ferguson from Credit Union Australia, Tracey Douglas from Connect the Coast, the Gold Coast Coalition for Aged Persons Physical Activities, Tricare, David Travers and his team at the Landmark Parkroyal in Sydney, Mr and Mrs Richards from IM-Press Promotions, Diane Smerdon from Palm Beach, Lana Robertson from Elanora, Jim Sherry, the Lewis family from Burleigh Heads and an anonymous donor of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce. Although I could speak for hours on the way in which each one of these people made a difference to Shane achieving his goal in Sydney, there is not the time.

But what do those two words mean? Christmas is the single most celebrated and happy feast day of all the Christian churches. Whether Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox, all Christian faiths recognise the ultimate significance and joy that is in the very word `Christmas'.</para></talk.start><para>The origin of the date of 25 December is unknown, but it is by tradition attributed to an adaptation of the old pagan Festival of Light. Some think of Christmas as presents, Christmas trees, Santa Claus, mistletoe, yule logs, wassail bowls and a roast turkey dinner on Christmas Day. The use of a Christmas tree is of relatively recent origin—first appearing in Strasbourg, France, in the 17th century. The celebration of the coming of Santa Claus is actually a tradition introduced by Dutch settlers in the United States who knew him as Sinterklaas, although his feast day is actually 6 December. St Nicholas was born in Patara around AD 280 in Asia Minor and became Bishop of Myra, now Demre, in Turkey. He attended the first council of Nicea in 325 AD.</para><para>These traditions are all diversions from the ultimate purpose of Christmas and why it is celebrated. For the two billion Christians around the world, Christmas is about the birth of Jesus Christ. It is timely to recite the relevant truths contained in just one of the four gospels that corroborate the testimony that is the very basis of the feast day of Christmas. I cite the gospel of St Luke, chapter 2, verses 8 to 13, which describes the account of that momentous event of the birth of Jesus Christ. It says:</para><quote><para>And in that region (of Bethlehem) there were shepherds out in the</para><para>field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</para><para>And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the</para><para>Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear.</para><para>And the angel said to them,</para><para>“Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you tidings of a great joy</para><para>which will come to all the people;</para><para>for to you is born this day in the city of David</para><para>a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. </para><para>And this will be a sign for you; you will find a babe wrapped in</para><para>swaddling clothes and lying in a manger”.</para><para>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly</para><para>host praising God saying:</para><para>“Glory to God in the highest, and on</para><para>earth peace among men of good will”.</para></quote><para>Bible historian Jules Lebreton notes in his text <inline font-style="italic">The Life and Teaching of Jesus Christ</inline> that, using certain milestone dates such as the death of Herod, being 4 BC, the baptism of John, the date of the enrolment by Quirinius, the Governor of Syria, et cetera, we can estimate the most likely actual birthday of Jesus Christ to be 12 March, 4 BC. But the feast day of Christmas transcends mere empirical analysis. Contemporary society seeks to reduce the celebration to an eclectic festivity of consumerism, encroachment and hijacking by other festivals and events, and an outright denial of the truth that is Christmas—the celebration of Jesus Christ, Saviour of the World.</para><para>The truth in the gospels is a testimony of Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. It is solely for this reason that Christmas is Christmas. The gospels are not chronologies; they are oral traditions put to writing long after the events they describe. They lack factual details. Some seek to discard them for this very reason. Subsequent documents in history attempt to destroy the very meaning and existence not only of Christmas but of the pre-eminent position of Christ himself. If there is a reason why the testimony is to be believed, then it is to be found in the humility of the scene. This is not the story of a great king performing fantastic deeds and miraculous works. What the nativity of Jesus is about, as Bible historian Jules Lebreton further notes in his text:</para><quote><para>We do not find, in the (Gospel) pages, those puerile and fantastic fantasies that show that the imagination has been at work ... From his birth on, we find the same surroundings of poverty and humility—a hired stable, a handful of straw, swaddling clothes ... It is not this kind of magnificence that would have been imagined by the mind of a man.</para></quote><para>In concluding this reflection on Christmas, I can find no other words that best describe the true meaning of Christmas than those of the great theologian Saint Augustine in his famous <inline font-style="italic">Sermon on the nativity</inline>:</para><quote><para>Hear what you already know; reflect upon what you have heard; love what you believe; proclaim what you love.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">A division having been called in the House of Representatives</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 10.02 a.m. to 10.26 a.m.</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Nehl, Garry (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Nehl)</inline>—A quorum not being present, the chair will be resumed at 10.28 a.m.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 10.26 a.m. to 10.28 a.m.</inline></para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Nehl, Garry (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—A quorum not being present, the Main Committee stands adjourned until a day and hour to be announced by the Deputy Speaker.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 10.26 a.m.</inline></para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>23206</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Marriage Celebrants and Ministers of Religion</title><page.no>23206</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1751)</subtitle><id.no>1751</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23206</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 August 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) For each Statistical Local Area (SLA), (a) how many authorised community based civil marriage celebrants are located in that area, (b) how many ministers of religion of recognised denominations who are registered under Division 1 of Part VI of the Marriage Act are located in that area, (c) how many state or territory government civil celebrants are located in that area and (d) what is the population of that area.</para><para>	(2) How does he determine whether there is a need for civil celebrants in a particular area.</para><para>	(3) In respect of the special needs category of authorised civil marriage celebrants, (a) how many community based civil marriage celebrants are currently authorised in this category and (b) in respect of each celebrant so authorised, what is the relevant special needs community.</para><para>	(4) How many community based authorised civil marriage celebrants are there and how many of these celebrants possess a relevant civil marriage celebrant qualification.</para><para>	(5) How many written complaints were made to his Department about community based civil marriage celebrants in 1999-2000.</para><para>	(6) How many complaints were resolved with no formal action taken against the relevant celebrant.</para><para>	(7) How many members does each association of civil celebrants recognised by him have.</para><para>	(8) When will the review which was announced in April 1997 be complete.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23206</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Williams</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) (a) A Statistical Local Area (SLA) as defined by the Australian Standard Geographical Classification is the base spatial unit used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to collect and disseminate statistics.

The crude rate of marriages per 1000 head of population is 6.0 overall in Australia but this varies from 4.6 in the NT to 6.4 in NSW and Queensland.  In 1999, community based civil marriage celebrants performed 43.6% of all marriages in Australia though the percentage varied from 41.4% in Victoria to 51.8% in Tasmania.  Where possible, this data is compared with the actual number of weddings reported by existing celebrants in the area.  </para><para>	The workload guide for a civil marriage celebrant living in an urban area is 100 weddings per year if the celebrant has other employment and 200 weddings if the celebrant has no other employment.</para><para>	In rural areas, celebrant workload is less relevant for assessing need than it is in urban areas because total demand is usually low.  Factors considered in deciding if more celebrants are required in a rural area include the need to provide communities with access to a choice of celebrants, the need to provide back-up for existing celebrants, distance to an alternative celebrant, difficulties travelling because of terrain and whether the people living in the area see themselves as a distinct community.</para><para>	(3) (a) There are 60 authorised civil marriage celebrants currently classified as authorised primarily to meet special needs of groups within the community.</para><para>	(b) A list of the above celebrants has been sent by mail to Mr McClelland.</para><para>	(4) There are 1676 authorised civil marriage celebrants.

It has involved a careful examination of every aspect of the civil marriage celebrant program including the continued relevance of parts of the Act and a survey of the views of all stakeholders.</para><para>	There are a number of problems with the present system.  First, as a general rule, no new celebrants can be appointed where statistics reveal that there are sufficient numbers of existing celebrants.  This is particularly the case in metropolitan areas where a large number of celebrants reside.  Second, while celebrants are appointed on the basis of regional need, there is no requirement for those celebrants to remain in those regions.  Celebrants occasionally change their residence resulting in a skewing of areas of need.  Finally, there is a large degree of discrepancy in the standard of celebrants' services.</para><para>	A large number of celebrants was appointed by the Labor Government rapidly in 1994 and early 1995, when limited standards were applied to applications.  Currently, the only statutory requirement is that a celebrant be a “fit and proper” person to perform the role.</para><para>	The review is addressing all these issues and is expected to be finalised in 2001.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Prime Minister's Portfolio</title><page.no>23208</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1763)</subtitle><id.no>1763</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23208</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hatton</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 August 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Is the Minister's Department and agencies within the Minister's portfolio compliant in respect of the Goods and Services Tax.</para><para>	(2) What action did the Minister's Department and agencies within the Minister's portfolio take to ensure that they were GST ready by 1 July 2000.</para><para>	(3) Is the Minister able to guarantee that no agency within the Minister's portfolio will suffer negative impacts on its budget or services due to the GST; if not, or if the guarantee was subsequently proved incorrect, would the Minister be prepared to resign.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23208</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	I am advised by my department and portfolio agencies as follows:</para><para>	(1) In June 2000, the chief executives of all agencies within my portfolio were asked to provide me, or the relevant Ministers Assisting, with written confirmation that they would be able to comply with The New Tax System from 1 July 2000.
