It is too technical and too formal. What happened was barbaric, brutal mass murder without justification. It is seen as that by the people of Australia and it is seen as that by the people of the world. It is a terrible reminder that terrorism can strike anyone anywhere at any time. Nobody anywhere in the world is immune from terrorism. It is a reminder that, in this time of a borderless world, with a particularly mobile young population, Australia can scarcely imagine that it can be in any way immune from such horrible attacks.</para><para>I know that the thoughts of everyone in this parliamentâand, indeed, the thoughts of millions of Australiansâare with those of our fellow country men and women who still do not know whether their daughter or their son or their brother or their sister or their lover or their mother or their father or their mate is alive or dead. The agony of waiting at the end of a mobile telephone for a call is an anxiety that we can only begin to think about and try in our own inadequate way to share, and we hope that that effort is of some comfort to them. I know that the hearts of every man and woman in this parliament will go out to them and to those who know the worst already, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who are coping with injuries, many of them horrendous burns as a result of the flames that followed the bombing of the nightclub.</para><para>At present, the best advice I have is that there is a total of 181 dead. Very few of these have been identified. According to advice from the Indonesian authorities and our consulate-general in Bali, 14 Australians are now confirmed among the dead and at least 113 Australians have been hospitalised following the attacks. We are still trying to establish the precise number of people evacuated to Australia, but the best advice is that it is in the order of 67 to 70. There are still 220 Australians unaccounted for. It should not be automatically assumed that all of those are dead but, given the very high percentage of Australians who were in the nightclub at the time of the bombing, we should as a nation prepare ourselves for the very real likelihood that the death toll of Australians will climb significantly when the final tally and identity of the fatalities are known.</para><para>As the House and, I am sure, the nation will be aware, a major rescue and medical evacuation operation has been under way since news of the attack came through. On behalf of this parliament and of all the Australian people, I want to express our gratitude to and admiration for the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, particularly the Royal Australian Air Force; and the doctors, nurses and paramedics, many of whom have worked in very difficult circumstances. I also record my thanks to the various state governments that have offered help, to Qantas and to many other private individuals who have provided help and assistance. The willingness of the government to provide evacuation facilities for all Australians and, indeed, others in need of medical attention remains. No expense will be spared and no limitation will be placed upon our willingness to do that. </para><para>This foul deedâthis wicked, evil act of terroristsâhas claimed the lives of not only Australians but many of the innocent people of Bali, a beautiful, hitherto peaceful part of Indonesia. Bali is much loved by so many Australians. In many cases, it is the first place that young Australians visit. Many of us will feel the poignancy of this attack coinciding with the end of the football season in Australia. So many of the young people in that club that night were members of Australian rules football teams, rugby league teams and rugby union teams. They were having a bit of fun at the end of a hard season. It is that connection with the everyday occurrences of life which we know so well and embrace so lovingly, that cruel conjunction, which makes something such as this that much more despicable and something that all Australians will utterly repudiate to the depths of their being.</para><para>We must remember, though, that this will have an enormous impact on the people of Indonesia and the economy of Bali. The Indonesian economy is a fragile economy. It relies very heavily on tourism. Those who did this are no friends of Indonesia. Those who did this sought to inflict misery on and deliver hatred to not only the people of Australia and the people of the other nations who lost their sons and daughters but also the people and the government of Indonesia. We must understand essentially what has happened. This is a vile crime which has claimed the lives of an as yet uncounted number of Australians on Indonesian soil.</para><para>All of us have a right to feel a sense of deep anger and a deep determination to do everything we can, as a nation and as a community, working with the government and the people of Indonesia, to bring to justice those who are responsible for this crime. We owe it to those who died, we owe it to those who have been injured and we also owe it to a proper sense of justice. Nothing can excuse this behaviour. No causeâhowever explained, however advocated, however twisted, however spunâcan possibly justify the indiscriminate, unprovoked slaughter of innocent people. That is what has occurred here. We must do all we can, as a nation and as a community, to mete out a proper responseâa measured, sober, effective responseâwhich brings to justice, if we can, those who are responsible.</para><para>It is necessary, in the course of this, for us to cooperate with the government and the people of Indonesia. Yesterday I spoke by telephone to President Megawati. She expressed her horror at what had occurred. She agreed with me that, on all the evidence available to us, this was clearly the act of terrorists. There can be no other explanation. Both of us agreed that every effort should be made to bring those responsible for this act to justice.</para><para>In that context, the House will be aware that a number of Australian Federal Police and some ASIO officers have already gone to Bali. I can also announce that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, and the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, will travel to Indonesia either tonight or tomorrow morning. They will go first to Bali to visit a number of those who are still hospitalised there and will then go on to Jakarta for discussions with the Indonesian government regarding cooperation between our two governments in the pursuit of those who have been responsible for this outrage. They will do that against the background of the memorandum of understanding against terrorism which was signed in Jakarta during my visit earlier this year. They will be accompanied on their visit by Mr Mick Keelty, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, and also by Mr Dennis Richardson, the head of ASIO. Their mission will be to maximise cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in pursuit of the murderers. Their mission will be to emphasise, by their presence and by what they convey on behalf of the Australian government, the willingness of Australia to offer all available resources to assist the Indonesian authorities in tracking down those responsible. </para><para>I can also inform the House that this morning the National Security Committee of cabinet met in the wake of this outrage. We discussed the proposal that the two ministers travel to Jakarta. We also decided to institute a review of the adequacy of domestic terrorist legislation. It is inevitable that, in the wake of what occurred in Bali over the weekend, the thoughts of Australians will turn to the potential vulnerability of our own soil, our own mainland, to a possible terrorist attack. There is no point in ignoring that. I do the Australian people no service if I pretend that, in some way, it cannot happen on the Australian mainland. In a sense, this is sequential. I do not think any of us believed that something like 11 September 2001 would happen until it really happened. We might have intellectualised afterwards and said, `Oh yes, we thought that might happen,' but in our hearts we did not really believe it was going to happen. </para><para>Equally, I do not think many Australians contemplated that what happened at the weekend in Bali would in fact occur. It is therefore very important that we disabuse ourselves for all time of any notion that something like that cannot happen in one of our cities and on our own mainland. We must dedicate and commit ourselves to doing all we can to guard against such an event. We therefore need to again assess the adequacy of our domestic law. I know it has been only recently reviewed, but further events have occurred and we are required as a matter of responsibility to almost 20 million Australians to do that. It is also necessary that we review the adequacy, which I have asked be done, of our counter-terrorism capacity. Once again, that was the subject of significant review after 11 September 2001, and major augmentation of the assets followed as a result of that review. It is therefore timely that those assets and that capacity also be reviewed.</para><para>I do not say these things lightly or with any sense of overdramatising the situation, but we are living in different circumstances and different times. That has been the case since 11 September last year. It is dramatically more so the case now, because what happened at the weekend claimed our own in great numbers, was on our own doorstep and touched us in a way that we would not have thought possible a week ago or even three days ago. It has been the case that all the world, including Australia, has been more vulnerable to potential terrorist attacks since 11 September last year. </para><para>In relation to the events in Bali, it is obvious that the Australian government has been concerned for some considerable time about the existence of extremist groups in the region, especially in Indonesia, with links to al-Qaeda and the real possibility of terrorist attacks against Western interests. That has been not only a concern of the Australian government but also a constant concern of the government of the United States. That concern, and the concern of our American friends, has been regularly communicated to the Indonesian authorities. It was one of the reasons that lay behind the negotiation of the memorandum of understanding on terrorism, to which I referred a moment ago. </para><para>I can inform the House that the intelligence available to the government highlighted the general threat environment but was at no time specific about Saturday night's attack in Bali. Indeed, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's travel advice reflected the heightened level of concern which followed the terrorist attacks in September last year. It was very much against the background of the general threat disclosed by intelligence that the government issued its alert in early September about the possible threat to Australian interests in the region around 11 September 2002.</para><para>It is apparent from the words of the motion and from what has been said over the last 36 hours and what is self-evident from an examination of the realities that confront Australia and the rest of the civilised world today that the war against terrorism must go on in an uncompromising and unconditional fashion. Any other course of action would be folly. Retreat from the war against terrorism will not purchase for the retreaters immunity against the attacks of the terrorists. That has been the experience of the last year; that has been the experience of mankind throughout history. You will not escape the reach of terrorism by imagining that if you roll yourself into a little ball you will not be noticed, because terrorism is not dispensed according to some hierarchy of disdain; it is dispensed in an indiscriminate, evil, hateful fashion. Those who imagine that it is dispensed according to a hierarchy of disdain do not understand history and are deluding themselves. </para><para>The war against terrorism is not, as has frequently been said in this place, a war against Islam. People of good Islamic faith will abhor what happened in Bali. They will find it as despicable to the tenets of their faith as Christians, Jews and many others will find it despicable to the tenets of their faiths. It is therefore important that we reaffirm again our commitment to a tolerant Australian communityâan Australian community that, while embracing all, is an Australian community bound together by the common values of openness, individual liberty and individual freedom. We fight terrorism because we love freedom; we fight terrorism because we want to preserve the way of life that this country has; we fight terrorism because we share the values of other countries that are in the war against terrorism; and we fight terrorism because it is intrinsically evil and you do not seek to covenant with evil and you do not seek to reach an accommodation with those who would destroy your sons and daughters and take away the security and the stability of this country.</para><para>In the hours that have followed this terrible outrageâthis dark day for the people of Australiaâthere have been many expressions of concern from world leaders. I spoke at length this morning to President Bush of the United States and I received a call last night from British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark. Her Majesty The Queen has sent a message of sympathy and condolence and I have received messages from many world leaders. All of them have a common theme and a common resonance, and that is that, in the world in which we live, our problems are the problems of others and the problems of others are so often ours as well. We live in a globalised world. We live in a world in which the young, in particular, are more footloose and more mobile than even their mobile parents and grandparents, and there is no escape in those circumstances from the reaches and the ravages of terror.</para><para>I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for the constructive way in which we have been able together to discuss these challenges to our country. Our country belongs to all of us, and this is a challenge to the fabric of this country and what it stands for. The Leader of the Opposition wrote to me and suggested that we might have a national day of mourning in relation to the events, and I am very happy to support that proposition. I propose that next Sunday be observed as a national day of mourning. It is of course sadly the case that we do not know the full extent of the horror that has overtaken our peopleâthe precise death toll may not be known for several daysâand it does seem that a national day of mourning next Sunday would be appropriate, and perhaps at some later stage it would also be appropriate to have a national memorial service. </para><para>In different ways, different communities in different parts of our country will mourn the abrupt and brutal deaths of so many and reflect on their own lives. In our own way we must try to offer comfort, care and hope to the bereaved friends, lovers and relatives. It is a very sad time for our country but it is a timeâas always in cases like thisâthat has brought forth heroism, decency and goodness. Already stories are emerging of people assisting others at enormous risk to themselves, as are stories of the dedication of the staff of the hospitals and the commitment of so many. We think also of the lovely people of Bali who have been such friends to so many Australians of so many generations on so many occasions. We extend our thanks, our warmth and our affection to them. </para><para>I am saddened beyond words of proper description by what has happened. I hope I speak for all Australians in sending my and their love to those who are grieving and in expressing the fierce determination to do everything I and we can to bring to justice those who have done such evil things to our people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>7501</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join with the Prime Minister in support for this motionâa motion that has the agreement of the House and that sends our sympathy on a day of great tragedy for all of Australia. It is a motion that expresses our grief and sympathy; it demonstrates our commitment to assist those returning home and those who are doing the grieving. But, importantly, it is a motion that reaffirms our resolve, out of this incident, to ensure that every effort is used to stamp out terrorism. This was a brutal act. It was a calculated, brutal act against innocent Australians as well as innocent residents of Indonesia and citizens from around the world. It sheets home stronger to us because it would appear that so many Australians are involved. I fear that it will be our single blackest day since World War II. I say that knowing that since that time there have been terrible incidents in our history, in which many lives have been lostâbut never so many, it would seem, in one day.</para></talk.start><para>If one looks at all the reports and pictures in the newspapers, the common thread that one sees is young Australians on holiday, young Australians who were over there to enjoy themselves and young Australians, victims of this, who have been cut down in the prime of their lives. Australians identify very much with Bali. Many of us have been there. Practically all of us know someone who has been there, and that is why, when we think of this incident, we are left with the impression: it could have been me. In that sense, I think we get something of a better understanding as to what Americans must have felt on September 11 in particular: it could have been them. It is true that in those circumstances Australian lives were lost, and it was not so long ago, on the anniversary of that September 11 attack, that this House remembered them. But I think that those circumstances come together not only to give us a greater sense of grief but also to heighten the sense of vulnerability that we all face.</para><para>Young Australians on holidays, young people everywhere: the location where this bomb was detonatedâoutside a nightclubâwas the sort of place that many would gravitate to just to enjoy themselves. The result was not just a loss of life; it was a loss of innocence and it was also, as the Prime Minister has remarked, very much a loss of mateship. A lot of people were there in groups, many of them football teams. We have heard the stories of the Kingsley Football Club from Western Australia. The member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, raised with me last night how he could assist in trying to get more information concerning them. The Platypi rugby union football club from Forbes were over there and, tragically, it would seem so many people have not yet been located. They had arrived eight hours earlier and had headed straight for the nightclub. These are the stories that no doubt will continue to unfold over the coming days, weeks and months.</para><para>This will be an incident that does not go away. It is one of those circumstances in which we as a nation need to grieve and we need to extend our sympathy, but most of all we need to stand united to demonstrate our resolve. There were other football clubs over there, including AFL clubs. Players from the team I supportâthe KangaroosâMick Martyn and Jason McCartney, happened to be across the road at another bar when the explosion happened. They were knocked to the floor. Thankfully, they are on their way home. Jason will require medical treatment in the Darwin Hospital. He, interestingly enoughâjust to show the character of the circumstancesâgave up a seat on an earlier plane for someone whom he considered more deserving of it. I think that demonstrates how we pull together in these times of great crisis. </para><para>I join with the Prime Minister and say that, in determining our resolve to pursue the terrorists, we have to be certain that it is only the terrorists that we pursue. This bombing is a crime against the teachings of all religions, Islam amongst them. This is the work of criminals and fanatics; it is not the work of people of faith. I note that Islamic leaders have been very strong in their condemnation of this action. Let us not, in the circumstance of our grief and in the search for rationale or reason in this, make scapegoats of others. This requires a proper assessment of the facts. It requires the cooperation with other countries that the Prime Minister has talked about. But, most of all, we need to make a clear-headed judgment as to the way in which the perpetrators of these crimes are to be brought to justice.</para><para>The Prime Minister has indicated that he is looking at a review of our counter-terrorism capacity. I welcome that. In the circumstances in which our forces are fighting the war against terrorism in another theatre, I think it is appropriate to make an assessment of our vulnerability. I note, from the advice we have had, that this attack has not been identified as being directed against Australia per se and it has not led to a heightened security level for this country. But we do have to be vigilant. We have to understand that this happened on our doorstep and that it happened in a location where those who engineered it, those who planned it, would have known many Australiansâas well as people of many different nationalitiesâwould be. So I do welcome the indication from the Prime Minister in relation to the counter-terrorism capacity.</para><para>I also remain open to his suggestion in relation to the antiterrorist legislation, but I know that, because of cooperation on both sides of the House, we did finally get strong antiterrorism legislation through this place some months ago, and I noted that the Prime Minister, in his address to the National Press Club on the anniversary of September 11, considered that we had got the balance right. I still am of that view but, in the spirit of dealing with this situation and in the circumstances we face, I am prepared to look again, with the opposition, at proposals the Prime Minister might want to put forward. However, I believe it is critical in this that we target the terrorists and only the terrorists and that we do not expose innocent people to unnecessary scrutiny.</para><para>There are some other issues I would ask that the Prime Minister take on board, because it is true that the people who were responsible for this need to be brought to justice. It is a threat that cannot go unchecked and unchallenged. I welcome the fact that Australian Federal Police officers and ASIO officers have gone to Bali to assist the Indonesians with their investigation, and I welcome the fact that the government is sending two ministers to Bali as well as to Jakarta to talk further with the Indonesians. No stone can be left unturned in hunting down the perpetrators of this crime and bringing them to justice, but that will not happen just by us calling for it. Australians must give the toughest response possible. As a fundamental first step, Australia and Indonesia must join together in the common fight against terrorism. I noted, Mr Prime Minister, from your discussions with me yesterday, that you had spoken with President Megawati of Indonesia, and you indicated in your conversations that Indonesia has agreed to work with us at every level. I welcome that. But fighting terrorismâdealing with the threat of terrorismâwill require a comprehensive and coordinated approach across the entire South-East Asian region.</para><para>We have noted your comments on what needs to be done now with our regional partners, and we support those but, as you undertake these steps and as your foreign minister visits Jakarta, we would ask you to consider another idea as well. In this country for more than a year now we have supported the global campaign against terrorism. We have stood united on that, we have endorsed it in this House and we have supported legislation. It is right that we have done so, because it is a common humanity that we have to defend here. But the challenge of terrorism lies within our immediate regionâand the events in Bali demonstrate just how close. Both the region and the international community will be looking to Australia this time for leadership, because this is our part of the world. </para><para>Given the gravity of what we have seen over the last 24 hours, could we suggest in a bipartisan spirit that you initiate a regional summit on the elimination of terrorism in South-East Asia. In our view, it would be appropriate that such a summit be convened at a heads of government level in the region itself. It should include the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore. Its first brief should be to establish how our governments can work together to identify and bring to justice those responsible for the most recent barbaric act in Bali. Beyond that immediate task, a second function of such a summit should be to establish the regional institutional machinery necessary for the ongoing campaign against terrorism in our region. It will not be done with a single meeting; it will not be done as a consequence of any single statement of regional leaders. But it will be done if in the immediate period ahead our governments are prepared to work together with absolute determination, united in the aftermath of the events in Bali. A regional summit on terrorism could help to bring to justice those responsible in Bali and could develop a strategy for our region to combat terrorism as well.</para><para>The most effective form of prevention, of course, is having good intelligence about the terrorists and their operations. One of the lessons of this horrific event is that Australia will need the best available intelligence on terrorist groups in the region. I have noted your commentsâcomments that we have had expressed to us in other quartersâregarding the concern about terrorist groups operating in Indonesia and insufficient attention being paid to them. We need to redouble the efforts as a consequence of this.</para><para>Indonesia now knows it has terrorist groups operating in its territory. We know the consequences of the way they operateâonly too graphically and tragically, with the events in the last 36 hours. We also know that our intelligence capacity is first-rate, and it stands ready to work, assist and cooperate with similar organisations in other countries. It is a difficult and dangerous business, but more and more these events demonstrate how absolutely necessary that intelligence capacity is for our security. The information that needs to be gathered on these groups will often be fragmentary and unclear. We know that ASIO and other Australian agencies have already received increased funding for those purposes, but we believe more work may be needed, to make sure that everything is being done that can be done.</para><para>So, Prime Minister, on this very sad return of the parliament whereby we all return with heavy hearts because of the magnitude of the problem, it is a day for expressing our grief and sympathy for the families of the victims involved. It is our commitment to them and their loved ones to do everything we can not just to assist the return of the injured and the identification of the victims but to ensure together that the perpetrators of this are brought to justice and that we stiffen our resolve to fight terrorism in our region. It is not appropriate just to express the grief without saying to those families that we have learnt from this. It is a timely reminder which demonstrates the vulnerability of a nation which has prided itself on its easygoing nature and its ability to move freelyâa nation that in the course of the last 36 hours has become all too concerned about, and must become concerned about, its vulnerability. </para><para>Unless we as a parliament are saying to these people that we are committed, we understand their concern and we are prepared to work together, I think we let them down again. They are already suffering enough at the moment. I think we have got to give them hope that as a parliament in a united, bipartisan way we will not just do everything possible to track down the perpetrators of this dreadful action but we will resolve to strengthen our fight against terrorism and make the region safe again. A coalition was formed as a consequence of September 11; I believe a similar coalition needs to be built again in the context of October 12 this year. It is our region. Australia needs to take a leading role, and the opposition stands prepared to work with your government to achieve that outcome.</para><para>In conclusion, on behalf of all of us in this parliament, but in particular the Labor Party, I express our heartfelt sympathies to the families who are grieving so terribly at the moment. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them. If we can assist in any way in helping them find out further information, we stand ready to do to. The fact that the parliament today has suspended its normal proceedings to debate this motion is a demonstration of how seriously we as a nation treat it. But it is a seriousness that goes beyond the events of Saturday nightâit is a seriousness that goes to our future, our security and our living in peace with our neighbours. That will happen only if we resolve collectively to fight terrorism and to do it together. We on this side of the House stand ready to work with the government to achieve that objective. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>7504</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, on this very concerning occasion I rise to support the Prime Minister's motion. The car bomb attack in Bali was a terrible act of calculated murder, of evil of unparalleled proportions in terms of our experience in this part of the world. It turned a tranquil holiday destination into a place of terror. It is right, as the two previous speakers have done, that we extend our deepest sympathy and our support to the families of the Australians who were victims of the attack. We know that at least 14 Australians were killed, with 113 injured, and it may very well be that this will prove to have been the greatest peacetime loss of Australian life overseas. In total, it is believed now that more than 180 people from many countries around the world were killed. We offer their families and their loved ones our sympathy. </para></talk.start><para>The Australians who were killed or injured were a representative sample of our young people: they were young footballers and netball players and families from the suburbs. The effects of the attack will reverberate across our country. Many Australians will know someone who was a victim of the attacks or was on the island. There were some 12,000 or so Australians at that very popular tourist destination over the weekend. I think all of us will recall for the rest of our lives our reaction of horror when we heard the news on a warm Sunday and heard Australian voices, the voices of our people, crying out in pain.</para><para>The Australian government has been doing everything possible to assist the victims of the attack. A Medivac aircraft carrying five critically injured people landed in Perth early this morning. Four RAAF Hercules aircraft with medical teams have been dedicated to evacuating victims from Bali. The Department of Foreign Affairs I understand has received more than 10,000 calls on its consular hotline. We are working closely, as the Prime Minister has outlined, with Indonesia to investigate the attack and bring the terrorists to justice. I believe that the Australian people will rightly and understandably expect that no stone will be left unturned in the effort to bring those responsible to justice. To that end, Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will depart with our full support tonight on his mission to Indonesia, and I know he has the full support of all in this parliament and across the nation.</para><para>I want to particularly take the opportunity to thank Qantas for its assistance. That airline has agreed to operate five additional flights between Bali and Australia. It has announced that customers will be able to cancel their travel plans without penalty. It has also announced a $500 compassionate return fare to Bali. </para><para>The terrorist attack in Bali demonstrates again the lessons of September 11 last year. It shows that all people and all countries are vulnerable and that the war against terrorism will be a long and drawn-out campaign. I do want to say that I think it would be cowardly and naive to think that this attack is not part of a pattern that began last September and continued with the recent attacks in Kuwait and on the French tanker <inline font-style="italic">Limburg</inline>. These attacks were planned and they were calculated, which makes them all the more evil. They were carried out by people who I think, incomprehensively to us, are proud of their skills; people who have woken up in the morning and gone to sleep at night knowing that they were about to commit an atrocityâmurder on a scale that we might have hoped we had left behind in the 20th century. I do want to say for my own part, to this House and to all Australians, that I believe that we have to accept and face the reality that many of these are people who would not stop at car bombs and aircraft if they had access to more terrible weapons. They would use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, were they able to obtain them, without hesitation. It is imperative that we make sure that terrorist fanatics can never have access to these weapons of mass destruction. </para><para>The potential for, horrendously, not hundreds, perhaps not thousands but tens of thousands of people to be murdered by weapons of mass destruction is too horrific for us to contemplate. If it were to happen, the people of the world would rightly condemn all the leaders who had acted as if the threat of terrorism did not exist or had tried to pretend that it would go away. So I can only say that, spurred on by what has happened in Bali, we must press on with our fight against terrorism in the region and against terrorism globally. We must play our part because a safe and peaceful world is the best memorial we can raise to the Australians who were killed and injured in what surely will become known as the 12 October terrorist attacks. I commend this motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>7505</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to join with the previous speakers, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister, in supporting this motion. Of course, what we are all doing here today most of allâbecause many of us here are parentsâis thinking about what so many families right across our nation are facing, being confronted with that terrible uncertainty. We know of the numbers who have been killed but we know there are very many people who are yet to be identified. We cannot imagine, really, how it feels to be separated from those young peopleâmost of them are young peopleâand the anguish and fear that so many of those parents would be feeling. It is a horrific toll of death and destruction, and we are all thinking today of those people. But there are also many who have been very severely injured and traumatised as a result of this terrorist attack.</para></talk.start><para>I want to add my tribute to the others that have been offered, particularly to the doctors, nurses and emergency workers here in Australiaâas we know, people are being brought back to Darwin and to Perth and, I am sure, to other hospitals as the days go byâand also to the many health and emergency workers in Bali who undoubtedly are saving lives and, given the terrible burns that people have experienced, will be relieving shocking pain and suffering. To the RAAF air crews and medical staff who have gone back to Bali and to the Qantas crews who are doing a wonderful job ferrying people home: I think it is summed up in the words of one parent I saw today when he said, `Please get them home.'</para><para>Of course, it is not only Australians who have been attracted to this well-known holiday destination. There are people from many countries around the world who are also mourning their dead today. As we here this afternoon are talking about this, we know that there are planes going all over the world with injured and distraught people. As a nation we are doing our bit, but all of usâ those of us here in the parliament today and anybody listeningâshould also respond to the call from the Red Cross. We know that there is a desperate need for blood, so anybody who possibly can should make a donation.</para><para>We know that the Balinese people, too, are suffering. Many of them have lost their loved ones in the bombing on Saturday night. Many of them have also lost their livelihoods, which were based on the island's thriving tourist industry and which have been destroyed by what can only be called a gutless attack on the innocent.</para><para>It was not meant to be like this. For so many decades Bali has been that friendly, tropical island holiday destination for thousands and thousands of Australians. We think of it as a place where our children like to go to play, surf and have fun. My parents lived and worked in Indonesia for seven years, and I, like so many other young Australians, went to Bali and did all of those things. The attack is all the more shocking because Bali is a place that many of us feel that friendlyconnection with. It is grotesque that it could happen in such an idyllic place, and it is a horrible reminder of what international terrorism really means. While our immediate task is to care for and account for all Australians on Bali, we also have to set about tracking down the perpetrators of this despicable and, as I say, gutless attack and bring these people to justice. I know we in Australia will use all necessary means at our disposal to identify those responsible and make sure that they are held responsible and answerable for, as others have rightly called them, these criminal acts. </para><para>Just as the global war on terrorism requires the international community to act in concert to succeed, so does our response to this attack in Bali demand the cooperation between countries, particularly those in our Asia-Pacific region. We do, as the Leader of the Opposition said, welcome the review of our security and intelligence arrangements. Of course these things are critical. We know, in particular, how important it is to have strong security and intelligence relationships with Indonesia. We know that that must also extend to other countries in the region because, whoever may be found to be responsible for the Bali attack, there is no doubt that it presents a threat to the security and stability of our region as a whole. That is why it is so important that Australia streng-thens its security and intelligence relationships within our region to eliminate this common curse.</para><para>For more than 50 years our country has pursued a close relationship with our geographic neighbours in Asia and the South Pacific. At the end of the day, the level of cooperation between countries needed to successfully tackle a common problemâwhether it be terrorism, people-smuggling, money laundering, drug running, illegal armsdealing or whateverârelies on political will. Success hinges on whether or not countries share the predisposition and determination to address a common problem, and that only comes from a trusting relationship. This terrorist attack in our neighbourhood requires an urgent reappraisal of the relationships we have with other countries in our region and the work that needs to be done to ensure the security of us all. Of course security, particularly for people as they travel around this region, as has been said by others, will become the only way in which we can guarantee peace to those people whom we all hold so dear. I strongly support the motion before the House.</para><para>Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI thank the House.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>7506</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr HOWARD (BennelongâPrime Minister) (3.03 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That the House do now adjourn.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>7506</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 3.03 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>7506</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KL6</name.id><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Andren</name></talker><para> to present a bill for an act to provide for the assessment and collection of a levy on the use of plastic bags at retail points of sale.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KL6</name.id><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Andren</name></talker><para> to present a bill for an act relating to the establishment of a fund for the purpose of education about plastic bag damage to the environment, and for related purposes.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Katter</name></talker><para> to present a bill for an act to amend the <inline font-style="italic">Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000</inline> to regulate the amount of renewable fuel in motor vehicle fuel, and for related purposes.</para></talk.start></interjection></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>7507</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Family Payments</title><page.no>7507</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 359)</subtitle><id.no>359</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7507</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Jackson</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 15 May 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How many families and individuals in the electoral division of Hasluck have received a (a) Family Tax Benefit debt notice and (b) Child Care Benefit debt notice.</para><para>(2)	How many child care centres in the electoral division of Hasluck have received a debt notice arising from the old Child Care Assistance Scheme.</para><para>(3)	What steps is the Government taking to guarantee that families will not be penalised by the current income self assessment regime where their incomes fluctuate through no fault of their own, because they carry out varying amounts of overtime in their employment, or their employment is commission based, or where one of the partners returns to the workforce after raising children.</para><para>(4)	Is the Minister aware that on pages 3 and 4 of the <inline font-style="italic">Estimating your Income </inline>booklet produced by the Family Assistance Office, the suggestions for estimating income for the year ahead include (a) knowing whether the recipient or his or her partner will receive termination or insurance payments or (b) predicting whether a partner will recommence work;

The Marine Protected Areas Program targets those agencies best positioned to contribute to the program objectives, that is, the State and Territory agencies that declare and manage marine protected areas. The program does not advertise publicly but maintains a profile with relevant State and NT agencies through the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council Task Force on Marine Protected Areas. Relevant State and NT Ministers submit proposals to the Commonwealth Environment Minister. Officers in the Department of the Environment and Heritage assess these proposals, and then detailed advice about the proposal(s) is submitted to the Minister for a decision on funding.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Declaration of Aquatic Reserves in Hawkesbury and Batemans bioregions</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>$55,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>$25,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Identification and negotiation of marine protected area options for Macquarie Island</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>$5,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>The Marine Protected Areas Program funds projects in several ways:Under the Coasts and Clean Seas component of the Natural Heritage Trust, the Program funded projects that supported the declaration of marine protected areas in State and Territory jurisdictions.

score, a measure of the errors in prediction of mean sea level pressure, over the Australian region. The values shown are 12-month running means.</inline></para><para>(2)	The long-term trends show an improvement in both temperature and rainfall forecasting. The percentage of accurate rainfall forecasts has increased from about 70% to 75%.</para><para>The temperature statistics are presented in terms of significant errors and mean absolute errors. There is a long-term improvement in both the maximum and minimum temperature forecast performance as well as a substantial reduction in the number of large errors in temperature forecasts, particularly for maximum temperature. The downward trend over time in the S1 skill scores suggests that the operational predictions from the Australian region analysis and prediction system have contributed to the general improvement in forecasting of weather elements.</para><para>Improvements in forecast performance can be explained by a number of factors including:</para><para>(a)	Improved skill of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models (cf. The S1 skill scores);</para><para>(b)	Introduction and updating of automated guidance to forecasters based on algorithms and NWP output;</para><para>(c)	Introduction of strategically-located automatic weather stations to provide an improved observations network;</para><para>(d)	Improved observing systems (particularly weather watch radar and radiosondes);</para><para>(e)	Improved satellite data;</para><para>(f)	Continuing research leading to improved understanding of the science of meteorology and the development of automated guidance tools, along with more detailed case studies allowing better understanding of specific events;</para><para>(g)	Computerised systems allowing for more effective and timely presentation of data to forecasters; and</para><para>(h)	Improvements in training, particularly in ongoing training for operational forecasters.</para><para>(3)	While it is reasonable to look at trends in accuracy at a particular location, care must be exercised in comparing accuracy between locations. This is because there are significant differences in the variability in weather elements from one part of Australia to the next. In cities where the weather is naturally more variable, the forecasting of temperatures and rainfall will be more difficult. For example, it is easier to forecast the maximum temperature at, say, Darwin where the maximum temperature might be consistently around 31 to 33 degrees for most of the year, than in Canberra where there is a significant variation in maximum temperature from day to day. Establishing measures of forecasting skill that are independent of location is a problem that has yet to be effectively solved. It is probably true to say that every location has its own forecasting challenges and while temperature forecasts are problematic at one location, forecasting rainfall or wind or thunderstorms might be a particular problem at another.</para><para>(4)	The following table lists the Budget appropriations in all financial years since 1995 to enable the Bureau of Meteorology to carry out its full range of functions, including observations and data collection; research and development; the provision of weather, climate, hydrological and oceanographic data, information, forecast, warning, investigation and advisory services; and international coordination. These figures do not include annotated appropriations nor variations through Additional Estimates. Because of changes in accounting with the introduction of Accrual Budgeting, the figures are not completely comparable from year to year.

planning committees comprise representatives of government agencies at the Commonwealth, State/Territory and local government levels, and representatives of non-government agencies that provide

Those areas of need are taken into consideration by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) in assessing applications for DIMIA funding, and in the general planning on which services are required.</para><para>(b) In addition, each State/Territory has specifically convened Funding Advisory Committees, comprising Commonwealth and State/Territory representatives (of which some are also members of settlement planning committees). Funding Advisory Committees determine:</para><para>-	whether an application for the Community Settlement Services Scheme would be more appropriately funded by an agency other than DIMIA; and</para><para>-	whether an application for the Community Settlement Services Scheme duplicates existing services.</para><para>Funding Advisory Committees have no role in the assessment of tenders for contracts under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy or the provision of core funding to Migrant Resource Centres/Migrant Service Agencies.</para><para>(5)	Each settlement planning committee is required to report to the Ministerial Council on Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (MCIMA) on achievements against settlement plans and in particular against the National Settlement Priorities, local priorities and the annual National Settlement Project. Each settlement planning committee also reports biannually to the Standing Committee on Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (SCIMA) on the development of, and outcomes from, the National Settlement Project.
