What limited cover is available is generally regarded as too expensive by the market, and remains unsold.</para><para>The withdrawal of terrorism insurance results from a market failureâthe lack of adequate information to price the risks arising from terrorism. The risks are very difficult to assess for insurance purposes, as terrorist events may be infrequent, but are likely to result in significant consequences.</para><para>The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority advises that the potential for a high payout from a low probability event is not a risk that can be managed through increased capital or through increased premiums.</para><para>As such, an adequate supply of terrorism risk insurance does not appear likely to return in the short to medium term in either the domestic or global markets.</para><para>The government is concerned that this lack of comprehensive insurance cover for commercial property or infrastructure may lead to less financing and investment in the Australian property sector and, consequentially, wider economic impacts.</para><para>Commercial property owners, banks, superannuation funds and funds managers have been forced to assume insurance risk as existing policies reached their expiry date and were renewed excluding previously provided terrorism risk cover. These institutions are not set up to manage insurance risk, and in the case of some bodies, notably superannuation funds, are specifically precluded from absorbing such risks.</para><para>In addition, the Australian Bankers Association has advised that there is a risk that financiers will be unprepared to provide finance to some large projects or large-scale infrastructure if terrorism cover is withdrawn and the new assets are exposed to an uninsurable risk. In the United States, such risks have already materialised, with one recent survey estimating that $US15.5 billion worth of construction projects have been suspended because of a lack of comprehensive insurance cover.</para><para>Until such time as the risks from terrorism are considered sufficiently small that insurers are willing to cover them once again or until the industry develops an appropriate method for pricing those risks, government intervention will be needed to fill the gap.</para><para>To ensure comprehensive coverage, terrorism risk cover will also need to be extended to cover business interruption and public liability risks associated with commercial property.</para><para>A number of our OECD counterparts have reached this same conclusion. France, Germany and the United States, for example, each recently established government schemes to address the current problem of lack of commercial insurance for risks arising from terrorism.</para><para>In establishing this scheme to provide reinsurance for terrorism, the government is mindful of the need also to foster the re-emergence of a commercial insurance market in this area. The government therefore will be closely monitoring developments in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets both domestically and globally. The government intends to wind down its scheme and ultimately withdraw from the market once adequate commercial provision of terrorism risk insurance has re-emerged.</para><para>The government scheme is set out in the bill, which I have just presented to the parliament. I present the explanatory memorandum, and I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Zahra</inline>) adjourned. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTED INFORMATION) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10262</page.no><id.no>R1710</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>10262</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruddock</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10262</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>10262</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to give more effective protection to confidential information.</para><para>Law enforcement and intelligence agencies often provide confidential information to my department for the purposes of making a decision to refuse a visa application or to cancel an existing visa on character grounds.</para><para>Currently, section 503A of the act protects information that is communicated to an `authorised migration officer' by a `gazetted agency' where that information is communicated on the condition that it be treated as confidential, and is used to make a character decision.</para><para>Most gazetted agencies are overseas intelligence and law enforcement agencies. If they cannot be sure that the information they provide, and its source, is adequately protected then they will not continue to provide us with this valuable information.</para><para>Australia relies on this information to ensure the integrity of our visa processing systems and policies.

Those offences were based on existing Commonwealth constitutional powers. As the Commonwealth Constitution does not give the Commonwealth parliament power to make laws with respect to terrorism as such, the offences rely on a patchwork of existing constitutional powers.</para><para>The patchwork of existing Commonwealth constitutional powers is extensive, but it is also complex. It is impossible to rule out unforeseen gaps in the coverage offered by offences based on existing powers. Arguments about possible gaps could be exploited by people trying to avoid prosecution. The reference of powers by the states and the enactment of this bill will rule out these kinds of arguments. It will ensure comprehensive national application of the federal counter-terrorism offences.</para><para>The bill will re-enact part 5.3 of the Criminal Code, which contains the terrorism offences enacted in June and amended in October this year, so that it attracts the support of the state references of power. The bill will, in effect, re-enact the terrorist act offences in division 101, the terrorist organisations offences in division 102, and the financing of terrorism offences in division 103. Once re-enacted, terrorism offences will be capable of operating throughout Australia, without any potential limitations arising from existing limits on Commonwealth constitutional powers. The government is committed to ensuring that our laws are as watertight as possible. This bill and the referral of powers by the states will do just that.</para><para>They will rule out arguments about potential gaps in the Commonwealth's powers in certain specific circumstances. The states will have referred powers to the Commonwealth, so that there can be no question over the legitimacy of the counter-terrorism laws.</para><para>The bill does not affect the substance of the current offences. The re-enacted offences will be in the same terms as the current offences, but for the constitutional `reading down' provisions. The government has already taken action under the current provisions. Regulations have been made specifying organisations as `terrorist organisations' for the purpose of the terrorist organisation offences. The bill includes transitional provisions so that these regulations will continue to have effect after commencement of the new provisions. </para><para>In addition to referring the `text' of the federal legislation, the states are also referring the power to amend the legislation. The bill reflects the Commonwealth's agreement with the states and territories that future amendments will not be made without the approval of a majority of the states and territories and of at least four states. An intergovernmental agreement is also being developed to support this understanding.</para><para>The bill includes provisions to prevent any inadvertent displacement of state laws. It allows for the concurrent operation of state offences that might deal with similar activity. It also includes a regulation-making mechanism to `roll-back' aspects of the provisions to accommodate certain specified state and territory legislation if that should prove necessary or appropriate.</para><para>The new Commonwealth provisions will commence on a date to be proclaimed.</para><para>This is to ensure that all states have enough time to complete their references.</para><para>I welcome the action already taken by the states to implement the agreement reached at the April 2002 Leaders Summit. References of power have been passed, or are awaiting assent, in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia. Reference legislation has been introduced in the Western Australian parliament.</para><para>Victoria is yet to introduce, but has indicated it will do so.</para><para>Since the September 11 attacks, the Howard government has acted swiftly to introduce new policy measures and legislation, and to provide more resources for our security and intelligence agencies to bolster Australia's ability to combat terrorism.</para><para>The recent attacks in Bali have strengthened our resolve to put these measures in place as a matter of urgency.</para><para>The Commonwealth appreciates the states' efforts in responding quickly to the national need, and I look forward to the commencement of the legislation as soon as possible.</para><para>This bill is part of a counter-terrorism legislative package that delivers on the Howard government's commitment to ensure we are in the best possible position to protect Australians against the evils of terrorism.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House. There is no reason why the House should not pass this bill as a matter of urgency.

The function of the register is chiefly there to record protected wine names and terms, both Australian and those of other wine producing countries. However, no provisions were included at that time which allowed amendment of registered names if an error occurred in making the entry or indeed if entries became obsolete. The proposed amendments will rectify this. </para><para>Apart from the Australia-EU wine agreement, Australia is pursuing other agreements in relation to wine. As a member of the New World Wine Producers Forum Australia signed, in December 2001, a mutual acceptance agreement on winemaking practices and is currently working with this group on a further treaty on wine labelling. As a result of its strong focus to improve wine trading arrangements it is likely that Australia, in the future, may need to modify some of its domestic wine laws to enact commitments made with other wine producing countries. The inclusion of a new power into section 8, and the addition of a regulatory power under Section 46(1) will put in place the legislative framework to allow this to occur.</para><para>The final matter is that of the prosecution of export breaches under the act. The act sets no prescribed time limit which means that section 15B of the Crimes Act 1914 operates, which only prescribes a one-year time period in which to bring a prosecution. This time frame is not suitable for exports. The process of export operations can be quite lengthy and a breach may not be evident until well after the commencement period has expired and especially so in the case of wine which can handle a lengthy storage period prior to being opened. Thus the evidence can be available for a considerable period of time, much longer than the year period allowed for the bringing of a prosecution. The proposed amendment therefore extends this period to seven years, which is consistent with current record keeping obligations under the act. Section 39U of the act requires wine manufacturers to keep records for seven years for each wine they make.</para><para>The purpose of the amendment to the Export Control Act 1982 is to express a contrary intention for the purposes of section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. The amendment will enable the orders made under the Act to apply, adopt or incorporate with or without modification the Codex Alimentarius issued by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation or the Food Standards Code published under the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 as in force at a particular time or as in force from time to time.</para><para>Currently, where orders apply to these standards, the references to the standards in the orders must be interpreted as references to the standards in force at the time the orders were made. If the standards change after the orders are made, the orders must be remade to incorporate the changed standards. This amendment will ensure that such references can be read as references to the current versions of the standards and will avoid the necessity of amending the orders whenever the standards change.</para><para>The amendments to the National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992âthe actâclarify the activities that can be carried out under the act for which payments can be made out of the National Residue Survey Reserve and bring the act into line with other Commonwealth legislation on the protection of personal information.</para><para>Previously, the National Residue Survey has only monitored and reported on the level of contaminants in raw food products, animal feeds and fibre products that have been produced in Australia, or produced from animals or plants produced in Australia.</para><para>The amendments to section 8 of the act will allow the National Residue Survey to test all inputs to the production of Australia's raw food, feed and fibre products, including soil, water and imported animal feeds. This will ensure that Australia maintains its high reputation as a supplier of a clean green product on its domestic and international markets.</para><para>The amendments to section 11 of the act dealing with the release of National Residue Survey information bring the act into line with other Commonwealth legislation that contains personal information. This will ensure that any personal information released to a relevant authority or appropriate person for the purpose of monitoring or regulation of residues and contaminants is used for that specified purpose only. </para><para>The purpose of the amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908âthe actâis to make the act compliant with the Criminal Code 1995âthe code. A key feature of the code is the emphasis on the structuring of offences to provide clarity and certainty in relation to the scope and effect of each offence, and to give consistency as to how criminal offences are to be interpreted by the courts. The Attorney-General's Department has identified that several offence provisions in the act require revision to make them fully compliant with the code. The amendments will: </para><para>Â·	update section 5 of the act dealing with interpretation by removing references to provisions that have been repealed in the Crimes Act 1914 and substituting equivalent sections of the code;</para><para>Â·	restructure and redraft certain offences to clarify the fault elements that are to apply for the relevant offences; and whether provisos in offence provisions, indicated by words such as `unless' or `except', are elements of the offence or a defence to the offence.</para><para>The proposed amendment to the Dairy Industry Legislation Amendment Act 2002 is to correct a misdescribed amendment.

The National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRS) has been established under Commonwealth legislation, and is underpinned by an administrative partnership with my state and territory agricultural counterparts.</para><para>The NRS has achieved remarkable gains in understanding the hazard and risks of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and influencing their management and use within the community, especially through rigorous scientific decision making and better use of labels as a platform for safe and effective use.</para><para>As the NRS has developed, it has become apparent that a number of improvements could be made to the scheme to make it more efficient and effective.

In order to raise the main stream revenue for the continued operation of the WEA it is proposed that a charge will be applied to all exports of wheat, commencing during the first half of next year. This would be implemented through regulations under the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999.</para><para>The bill's main purpose is to provide for the appropriation to the WEA of moneys paid to the Commonwealth as the wheat export charge amounts.</para><para>With the privatisation of wheat marketing and financing arrangements in 1999 through the grower controlled company AWB Ltd, the regulatory and monitoring activities associated with the single desk for export wheat were passed to the WEA, which operates under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. AWB (International) Ltd (AWBI), the wholly owned subsidiary of AWB Ltd responsible for maximising net returns to growers through export sales and pooling, was granted the single desk export right for wheat which had been held by the former Australian Wheat Board.</para><para>The government has repeatedly confirmed its support for the wheat single desk while ever there is a benefit to Australian wheat growers and the nation's export performance. At the same time it is recognised that there needs to be flexibility to allow other exporters to take advantage of market opportunities. This is an important function of the WEA through its consent system, which allows for both long-term (12 month) and short-term (three month) consents. These principles as they apply to this function of the WEA will be spelt out in the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 through an amendment included in the current bill. </para><para>The other key functions of the WEA are monitoring AWBI's export performance, reporting on the benefits to growers and conducting a review before 2004 of AWBI's use of its export rights. The opportunity has been taken with this bill to make a number of minor amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to improve the operational efficiency of the WEA and to strengthen its powers to monitor compliance by exporters.</para><para>It is appropriate that the wheat industry rather than the government should fund the WEA since wheat growers are the main beneficiaries of the WEA and the single desk. Although the government receives a monitoring report each year from the WEA on AWBI's performance, it is growers and the industry which receive the potential benefits from that performance. A separate report is made available annually by the WEA to all growers so that they can make an assessment of the value of the management of the single desk to their interests.</para><para>Industry funding is consistent with the situation prior to 1999, when growers paid for the regulatory aspects of the single desk through pool administration costs. Similarly, the $6 million interim `seed funding' for the WEA came essentially from grower money held in reserves of the former Australian Wheat Board. This initial resource is expected to be fully utilised by WEA around the end of its 2002-03 financial year, which is why a new, ongoing funding arrangement is required if the WEA is to continue to undertake its statutory functions.</para><para>An export charge on wheat, combined with the introduction of application fees for consents through separate regulations not related to this bill, provides an equitable and simple means to ensure that those who benefit from the services of the WEA will meet its costs. To the extent that the charge is deducted from pool returns by AWBI, or from grower sales to exporters, only those growers who produce wheat for export, rather than those servicing the domestic market, will be funding the WEA. Consideration will be given to allowing growers some say in recommending an appropriate level of charge to meet the reasonable budget requirements of the WEA.</para><para>The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 already provides for the introduction by regulation of an application fee for consents. It is intended to activate these provisions from next year, even if the fee is only for a token amount. This will ensure that the WEA's costs related to processing consent applications will be recovered, at least partly, from those who directly benefit from the availability of export consents. A fee will also discourage non-genuine applications which could disrupt the WEA's administration and raise its costs unnecessarily.</para><para>The WEA's monitoring role and annual report to growers are important means to ensure the management of the single desk delivers the potential benefits available. These findings will feed into the 2004 review, which the WEA is required to conduct under the wheat legislation. That review will examine AWBI's use of its single desk rights and not the existence of the single desk itself. It will provide a basis for growers to decide whether or not the current arrangements should remain or be modified. If need be, they can bring forward a case for the government's consideration.</para><para>This bill, when combined with proposed export charge and consent application fee regulations, reflects the government's commitment to the future of the wheat industry and the single desk.

The government also provided an indemnity to the provisional liquidator of UMP/AMIL to allow certain claims to be paid in full.</para><para>This bill gives effect to the balance of the Prime Minister's announcements of 31 May and 23 October 2002.</para><para>The government is committed to ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of the market for medical indemnity cover. Prudential regulation provides the highest level of certainty that financial promises made by financial institutions to their customers will be met. </para><para>Medical indemnity providers essentially operate as insurance companies. However, medical indemnity providers have not been subject to regulation because they formally offer coverage subject to discretion such that any claim by a medical practitioner against the provider can be denied in any circumstance.</para><para>However, medical defence organisations rarely deny a claimâindicating that there is no reason to treat these entities differently to insurance companies.</para><para>In addition, in the case of medical indemnity cover, a long period of time can elapse between an adverse incident taking place and the point at which a claim is made against the provider. This poses a much higher risk to consumers than some other forms of insurance, because consumers cannot be sure what the financial position of the provider might be at the time at which a claim is lodged, as it may be many years in the future. In addition, insurers face uncertainty in deciding how much to set aside to meet claims.</para><para>In this context, it is essential that medical indemnity providers not only provide affordable cover to practitioners but that medical practitioners and their patients have a reasonable degree of certainty that their claims will ultimately be met.</para><para>Under this bill, medical practitioners and their patients will have a reasonable degree of certainty that their claims will ultimately be met, through the move to contracts of insurance. The current system of unlimited, discretionary cover has resulted in considerable uncertainty to doctors as to the extent to which a claim for indemnity will be met. In practice, `unlimited' cover is limited by the capital available to the medical defence organisation. The experience of UMP has clearly demonstrated that doctors are not prepared to provide unlimited capital to their medical defence organisations to fund unlimited claims.</para><para>In contrast, insurance companies are prevented from providing unlimited cover, in recognition that no company has access to unlimited capital.</para><para>This bill therefore provides that, from 1 July 2003, medical indemnity cover will be provided by means of a contract of insurance from an authorised insurer. Authorised insurers are subject to prudential regulation by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).</para><para>The bill also provides for the transition of medical indemnity providers to the new regime over five years from 1 July 2003 to allow medical indemnity providers to meet prudential capital requirements.</para><para>The bill also provides for doctors to receive greater certainty in insurance coverage by prescribing minimum standards for medical indemnity cover. Providers of claims-made cover will be required to provide retroactive and run-off cover to ensure that all doctors have access to continuous cover.</para><para>The bill does not prohibit the provision of claims-incurred cover for doctors. However, it is essential that, if this type of cover is offered, medical indemnity providers will be required to hold appropriate capital, reserves and reinsurance against the risk of claims.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Zahra</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10270</page.no><id.no>R1731</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>10270</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10270</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>10270</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This bill is consequent to the <inline ref="R1730">Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002</inline>.</para><para>The main purposes of the consequential amendments bill is to require MDOs to provide data to APRA, and to prevent MDOs with discretionary liabilities from becoming authorised insurers.

Under the new arrangements superannuation will be treated as property of a marriage and will be able to be divided as part of a property settlement. The new family law regime will enable separating parties or the Family Court to value a member's superannuation interest and make an agreement or order for the superannuation to be split.</para><para>The bill provides for a framework within the relevant scheme for dealing with an agreement made by separating parties or a Family Court order that provides in the context of an overall property settlement for an amount of the member's superannuation to be allocated and paid to the member's former spouse. </para><para>The framework will enable a separate superannuation benefit account to be established for the member's former spouse where the scheme is advised that an amount of the member's superannuation is to be allocated to their former spouse. The bill will either amend the relevant acts or allow ministerial orders to be made to provide for indexation of the former spouse's separate benefit before payment and the payment of that benefit. The benefit will either be paid as a pension or lump sum in such form and circumstances as the scheme rules permit.</para><para>The bill will also amend the relevant acts or allow ministerial orders to be made to provide for a reduction in the benefit paid to or in respect of the member.</para><para>To put in place the framework, amendments are proposed to seven acts: the Defence Act 1903, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990.</para><para>As the majority of the rules for the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, established under the Superannuation Act 1990, and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, established under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, are included in trust deeds made under those acts, most of the proposed changes to those schemes will be made through amending trust deeds.</para><para>The bill proposes that the new superannuation arrangements will apply to superannuation agreements or Family Court orders received after the commencement of the relevant amendments to the legislation, as well as those agreements or Family Court orders received before that time but after 28 December 2002 where no benefit has become payable to the member. In all other cases the default arrangements under the family law regime will apply.</para><para>The bill also proposes to amend the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990 to include a regulation making power to amend those acts from time to time in order to ensure that the schemes continue to comply with the family law regime.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Financial Impact</inline></para><para>The proposed amendments in relation to the Commonwealth civilian superannuation schemes will result in a minor bringing forward of benefit payments in those schemes.

The bills will implement the seventh stage of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, known as `Streamlined Lodgments and Compliance' or CLERP 7.</para><para>The CLERP 7 reforms are intended to simplify document lodgment and compliance procedures for companies under the Corporations Act 2001. The bills will provide a user-pays system of servicing by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and facilitate a more efficient and competitive business environment. In particular, this bill will improve the efficiency of corporate regulation and reduce regulatory burdens on business. </para><para>The ASIC changes will be of particular benefit to small business. Around one million proprietary companies will no longer need to provide ASIC with an annual return, significantly reducing paperwork. A streamlined approach will be adopted to enable companies to update ASIC's database.</para><para>Small business will also benefit from reduced business costs and charges and from being able to access more reliable, accurate and timely information. The quality and integrity of ASIC's register of companies will be protected by the use of the extract of particulars. The extract of particulars, setting out a company's details as recorded on the register, will be issued to all companies together with an annual fee invoice. This will be done electronically, except where a company lodges in paper form.</para><para>Companies would still need to notify ASIC of certain basic changes in company details as they occur. However, if there are no changes, no paperwork will need to be lodged. In practice, this will reduce the compliance burdens for a large number of small businesses that typically do not notify ASIC of changes during the course of the year.</para><para>The measures will not only reduce the paper compliance burden for business but also assist ASIC by reducing the volume of returns requiring processing, while maintaining the quality and integrity of its company database.</para><para>The CLERP 7 reforms include proposed modifications to the Corporations Act fee system. The Corporations (Review Fees) Bill 2002 will permit a fee known as a `review fee' to be imposed.</para><para>Under the bills, companies will no longer lodge an annual return with ASIC. An annual review fee will replace the present annual return fee. The review fee will be payable two months after the anniversary of a company's registration or on an alternative date nominated by the company and approved by ASIC.</para><para>The Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill 2002 will modify the regulation making power under the Corporations Act to expand the range of fees that may be prescribed. However, the government announced in the 2002 budget that the annual fee for proprietary companies would remain capped at $200 until 30 June 2004.</para><para>The CLERP 7 proposals have received broad support from the business community. They take account of consultation with the business community and other stakeholders following the release of the CLERP 7 discussion paper in February 2000. The reforms presented by these bills are the product of an extensive process of consultation that has been widely applauded by both business and consumer representatives.</para><para>In that regard, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration would like to thank the government's Business Regulation Advisory Group for their participation in the consultation process.</para><para>The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill also contains some miscellaneous amendments to the Corporations Act and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, the ASIC Act. The bill will repeal section 201C of the Corporations Act to remove the prohibition on the election or re-election of directors of a public companyâor a subsidiary of a public companyâwho have reached 72 years of age. The bill will amend the Corporations Act to remove charges over uncertificated securities from the application of the charges provisions of the Corporations Act chapter 2K. </para><para>The bill will also make minor, miscellaneous amendments to the ASIC Act to increase the financial cap in paragraph 137(1)(a) of that act from $250,000 to $1 million before ministerial approval is required for ASIC to enter into contracts and to enable another member of ASIC or a senior employee of ASIC to attend meetings of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, CAMAC, in place of the chairperson of ASIC.</para><para>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration has consulted the relevant state and Northern Territory ministers about these amendments in accordance with the Corporations Agreement and has obtained the approval of the Ministerial Council for Corporations for those amendments in the bills for which the council's approval is required under that agreement.

As a result, the government has paid out over $20 million. The government has maintained at all times, whilst granting financial assistance, that financial assistance provided would be recouped by the Commonwealth through a levy on the industry made in accordance with the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993, the levy act.</para><para>As a result of this experience, the government has identified a number of inefficiencies in the current framework for the collection of levies to fund the financial assistance.</para><para>Firstly, the levy act currently requires that separate levies must be collected for each grant of financial assistanceâthat is, a separate levy for nearly 380 grants. This is clearly inefficient for both the party responsible for collection of the levies, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and for the trustees of funds who must make arrangements to pay 380 separate levies.</para><para>Secondly, the current levy amount imposed on a fund is a proportion of a fund's assets, in line with the determined applicable levy rate. However, the levy act does not allow for the specification of either a ceiling or a floor on the total imposed on superannuation funds.</para><para>The recent circumstances have identified that large-scale collection of levies to recoup financial assistance is impractical. Three hundred and eighty separate levies would place a large compliance burden on all superannuation funds. The lack of ability to set a floor or ceiling for each levy would exacerbate the problem, as it would generate a large number of very small levy amounts, less than 20c in aggregate, from some funds, and very large amounts, over $400,000 in aggregate, from other funds.</para><para>All but one of the grants of financial assistance have been to funds that held less than approximately $1.5 million in assets. Approximately 81 per cent of regulated funds have assets of $1.5 million or less. Ability to set a floor and a ceiling on levy amounts imposed would more equitably share the burden of financial assistance, particularly given that currently the levy burden would fall most heavily on larger public offer funds, even though recent events have suggested funds with less than $1.5 million present a greater regulatory burden for APRA.</para><para>To address these inefficiencies, this bill introduces a provision to amend the levy act to allow for the specifying of a minimum and maximum levy payable in respect of any levies imposed.</para><para>This will not only ensure that a reasonable limit is imposed on the maximum levy amount payable but additionally ensure that all superannuation funds, with the exception of self-managed superannuation funds, contribute appropriately to the funding of financial assistance. It is imperative that all regulated superannuation funds contribute to financial assistance.</para><para>It also introduces a provision to enable aggregate amounts of financial assistance to be collected in one levy, rather than individually. Imposing only one levy to collect the aggregate of all financial assistance granted in a particular financial year will ensure that the levy process is simplistic and would reduce compliance costs for all superannuation funds, rather than subjecting superannuation funds to levies to deal with 380 individual levies.</para><para>The government is proposing to make regulations pursuant to the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993 to recoup financial assistance prior to the end of the financial year. I call on all honourable members to ensure that the levy can take into account these changes and reduce the administrative and cost burden which would eventuate under the current provisions. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snowdon</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10276</page.no><id.no>R1708</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>10276</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10276</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10276</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R1708">Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002</inline> contains amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978. </para><para>The purpose of the bill is to make amendments to the anti-dumping and countervailing provisions of the Customs Act, an amendment to exempt air security officers from the passenger movement charge and minor and technical amendments to international trade modernisation elements of customs legislation. </para><para>The proposed antidumping and countervailing amendments have three major purposes. </para><para>The first is to provide greater clarity and certainty in respect to the treatment of `economies in transition'. </para><para>The second will amend the provisions governing the processing of final duty assessment applications and calculation of refunds of dumping duties. </para><para>The third purpose will be to make amendments to more accurately reflect the provisions of the World Trade Organisation antidumping agreement. </para><para>Economies in transition are those that are moving from being centrally planned to a free market model.</para><para>While in transition, such economies are subject to provisions which enable Customs to inquire into the existence of price control in the market for those goods that are the subject of a dumping application.</para><para>Since the introduction of the `price control' concept in 1999, it has become apparent that there is uncertainty as to whether this includes both direct and indirect forms of government control over prices.</para><para>To overcome the uncertainty it is proposed to replace the term `price control' with `price influence' as this more accurately reflects the Australian government's intention, as set out in ministerial guidelines issued in December 2000.</para><para>The bill will also introduce a clear requirement that exporters are to cooperate by providing the information necessary to assist in determining the presence or absence of price influence.</para><para>If an exporter either fails to provide the necessary information or provides less than adequate information then a recommendation will be made to the minister that a price influence situation be found to exist.</para><para>The amendments to the duty assessment scheme are to provide greater certainty and a more effective means of administering the scheme by inserting into the Customs Act discrete steps that will apply in screening duty assessment applications and in processing duty assessment applications after lodgment.</para><para>The new scheme will also allow Customs to reject or terminate duty assessment applications at several stages before or during the consideration of the applications.</para><para>Technical amendments of a minor nature will be made to the provisions on cumulation, accelerated review and continuation of dumping measures to bring Australia's legislation into conformity with the World Trade Organisation agreement.</para><para>The bill contains an amendment to the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act to exempt air security officers who travel on an international flight for the purpose of enhancing the security of the aircraft from paying the passenger movement charge.</para><para>The final set of amendments in this bill addresses minor omissions in the Customs Act related to the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001.

Earlier in the year, the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 15 May 2002. The amendments the government has circulated to this bill arise from the recommendations of that Senate committee, and Labor welcomes those changes. </para></talk.start><para>I will turn firstly to the contents of the bill. The bill makes the following changes to the Migration Act. First, the bill clarifies the immigration status of non-citizen children born in the migration zoneâthat is, born on the Australian mainland or born in non-excised parts of Australia. Obviously, children are born in Australia to non-citizens who are here in a variety of circumstances, such as on a tourist visa, a temporary entry visa, a student visa and the like. Children can also be born to non-citizens who are not immigration cleared. This applies to detained persons, including asylum seekers, who have not been taken to be immigration cleared until their claim has been processed and a visa has been issued. </para><para>Under the current Migration Act, there is no specific provision as to the immigration status of a child born in these various circumstances. Conceptually under the act, a child who is born to a person here on a valid visa is not immigration cleared and would not be immigration cleared until separately processed. Clearly, as a matter of practice, there are not separate immigration clearance procedures for newborn babies, and the child is assumed to have the same status as his or her parents. This amendment clarifies this matter by providing that, at the moment of birth, a child is immigration cleared if a parent was immigration cleared on last entry into Australia. Put simply, if a parent is immigration cleared and lawfully here, the child will be seen, by virtue of this amendment and as a matter of law, to be immigration cleared and lawfully here as well. If a child is born to a person who does not hold a substantive visa and who has not been immigration cleared, such as an asylum seeker in detention, this amendment provides that the child is not immigration cleared and the child's immigration status will then be dealt with in a substantive visa application process.</para><para>Second, the bill clarifies issues relating to the cancellation of special purpose visas. Special purpose visas are used for classes of individuals, such as aircraft crews, crews of visiting vessels and members of foreign armed forces visiting for the purposes of exercises or training. Given that a person qualifies for a visa because of his or her membership of the relevant class of person, if information comes to light about the undesirability of a particular individual within that class, it is necessary to have a process to cancel the visa and to cancel it expeditiously. Currently, section 33 of the Migration Act provides that the minister may cancel such a visa if it is undesirable for the non-citizen holder to travel to and enter Australia or remain in Australia. The visa ceases to be in effect at the end of the day on which the declaration is made.  </para><para>It is not clear under the current act whether or not the rules of natural justice apply to such a cancellation and, consequently, whether the individual has a right to be heard in these circumstances. The bill makes it clear that the rules of natural justice do not apply to such a visa cancellation and that the person involved has no right to be heard. This is a sensible clarification. Australia does not owe hearing rights to non-citizens in such circumstances. In addition, there are considerable logistical difficulties with offering such hearing rights to individuals, such as seafarers who may have deserted vessels. The amendment also provides that the declaration to cancel the visa comes into effect immediately.</para><para>Third, the bill deals with restrictions on bridging visa holders for onshore applications for visas. Section 48 of the Migration Act provides that a person who has been in Australia and who has made an application for a visa and been unsuccessful can then apply for only a limited number of visa types. This is obviously to prevent people lodging countless applications specifically to remain in the country. There has been some avoidance of the intent of this provision. Specifically, people are travelling overseas a short distanceâfor example, to Aucklandâand then returning and seeking to make a whole new round of onshore applications. The bill proposes to stop this practice by providing that, for the purposes of this section, a non-citizen holding a bridging visa who leaves and re-enters the migration zone is taken to have been continuously in the migration zone despite that travel. It should be noted that, through the amendments the government has circulated to this bill, there is a clarification that the force of this provision does not prevent a person on a bridging visa from lodging a visa application offshore.</para><para>Fourth, the bill deals with the imposition of strict liability for people-smuggling offences. Section 233(1)(a) of the Migration Act makes it an offence punishable by imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of 1,000 penalty units to participate in `the bringing or coming to Australia of a non-citizen under circumstances from which it might reasonably have been inferred that the non-citizen intended to enter Australia in contravention of the Migration Act'. The provision says nothing about the state of mind of the accused in relation to the circumstances under which the non-citizen is brought to or comes to Australia.</para><para>As part of the post <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>raft of legislation passed by the parliament in September 2001, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 came into effect. The act added the following third point to the matters that the prosecution has to prove in any prosecution under section 233(1)(a) of the Migration Act:</para><quote><para>... the accused was aware of a substantial risk that the non-citizen intended to enter Australia in contravention of the Migration Act and, having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, he or she was not justified in taking that risk.</para></quote><para>The application of the criminal code act was not meant to change the nature of offences. The explanatory memorandum of that act stated that the relevant offences would continue to have the same meaning and apply in the same way they did prior to the application of the criminal code. This bill therefore corrects the anomaly which arises because the application of the Criminal Code has had an unintended effect. Prior to the government's amendments, the bill also dealt with the application of strict liability to section 241(1) of the Migration Act, which deals with offences in relation to de facto spouses. This provision is not being proceeded with at this stage, largely as a result of recommendations from the Senate legislation committee. The government has indicated its intention to draft a clearer provision and to include it in future legislation.</para><para>Labor supports these changes to the Migration Act and therefore supports this bill. But, given the non-controversial nature of this bill, the principal debate before this House is not about the technical provisions which I have spoken about; it is a debate about children in detention which arises squarely from the amendments that have been circulated by me, which I will move and which the member for Gellibrand, in her capacity as Labor's shadow minister for children and youth, will second at the consideration in detail stage. These amendments, if adopted, would amend the power to detain under the Migration Act so that the government would be compelled to do two things. First, it would be compelled to place unaccompanied children into appropriate foster or community care arrangements rather than hold such children in high-security detention facilities like Woomera, Baxter, Port Hedland, Villawood, Maribyrnong and the like. Second, it would compel the government to rehouse children who are currently here with their families in high-security detention in accommodation like that used for the alternative detention trial at Woomera. </para><para>I think it is necessary to draw the attention of the House to some of the details of that trial. I have seen it. That government trial consists of four ordinary houses in which women and children have been allowed to liveâthat is, male family members have been excluded. It is a group of four houses on a block. The arrangement is secured in two senses. First, one house is allocated for security staffâthat is, it is staffed 24 hours a day by guards who maintain a continuous security presence in the facility. Second, the perimeter of the block around the four houses is secured by a light beam which, if broken, sounds an alarm. In question time yesterday, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs implied, in my view, that these facilities were not secure. That is simply not the case. On the issue of security, you do not have to take my word for it. It would be better to look at the scoreboard, which shows that no-one has ever absconded from the alternative detention trial at Woomera. That is a situation we can contrast with the Woomera detention facility itself, where absconding has become a matter of routine. So the alternative detention trial houses are secured by guards and a light beam at the perimeter. No-one has ever absconded. That is not true of other high-security facilities like the Woomera facility itself.</para><para>It should also be noted that Labor's amendment would compel the government to house whole family groups in this kind of accommodation, including male members such as fathers and brothers. So far, under the government's trial, that has not occurred and the trial has been limited to women and children. As I have said in this House before, and as I have conveyed in writing to all members of this House, there is no credible argument against Labor's amendment. There can be no argument for detaining unaccompanied children in high-security detention. I think we need to remind ourselves in this debate that at one point, under the Howard government, there was an unaccompanied eight-year-old in Woomera. There is no argument for not housing families in accommodation like that of the Woomera alternative detention trial. As I said, I have seen it. The nature of that detention is clearly better for families than being in high-security compounds like Woomera. In truth, no argument about absconding and security exists. Once again, do not take my word for it. That this model would be an adequate way to house families, including fathers and teenage sons, has been endorsed by the minister's own hand-picked Immigration Detention Advisory Group.</para><para>Why are these amendments before this House today? This is a further and important step in Labor's yearlong campaign to free children from behind the razor wire. This campaign started on Australia Day, when our leader, Simon Crean, the member for Hotham, called for children to be freed in his Australia Day address. It is a campaign we will continue, and it is a campaign which has already met with some success. Last week in this House the minister for immigration made a major ministerial statement about children in detention. In using the word `major', I am taking a little bit of licence. It was a very lengthy ministerial statement, but when one studied it in detail there were actually three paragraphs that related to the question of children in detention. Nevertheless, those three paragraphs are important. Those important three paragraphs provide that the migration series instructions which guide the work of departmental officials in relation to detention and other matters will be changed so that unaccompanied children are not held in high-security detention facilities. Instead, the standing directive will be to, if possible, move them to foster or community care arrangements. </para><para>The other change contained in the ministerial statement was that the Howard government would seek to negotiate with the South Australian government, the Rann Labor government, to access further housing stock which would enable it to house women and children in accommodation like that used in the Woomera alternative detention trial. Put simply, the ministerial statement last week was about getting unaccompanied children out of detention and about seeking an agreement with the South Australian government to expand the Woomera alternative detention trial, but under the same conditions that that trial is currently used, meaning that it would not include male family membersâcertainly not adult males, in terms of fathers, and not teenage boys.</para><para>Why was that statement made at all? One is entitled to ask that question. The answer isâand this is a matter of public record; any cursory scanning of the newspapers over the past week or so would verify thisâthat the ministerial statement was made only because it was clear that a number of Liberal moderates had advised the minister for immigration that they would vote for Labor's amendment, which I have outlined today, unless the government moved on the question of children in detention. Amongst the names one sees in the newspaperâand perhaps there are some more Liberal moderates; I do not want to insult anybody by exclusionâare the member for Kooyong, the member for Cook, the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Pearce, who have been seen to run a campaign internally, threatening the minister that he would face the embarrassment of them crossing the floor and voting for Labor's amendment unless he moved on the question of children in detention. That is the only reason the ministerial statement was made last week: because of Labor's campaign to get children out of detention and because of the fact that this amendment was coming up before the parliament.</para><para>It is quite clear that Liberal moderates have forced this statement. They have forced it against the better judgment of the minister. The minister on 8 May this year, when asked about relaxing mandatory detention arrangements for women and childrenâasked about the very thing that he has now doneâsaid this:</para><quote><para>You're simply saying to people all you have to do is bring a child with you, turn up in Australia and you have obtained a migration outcome regardless of whether you have an entitlement or not.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>âIt is still relevant.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name></talker><para>âThe minister just verified that it is still relevant. What we know, therefore, is that the minister, in his perfect world, would not have made any changes to detention arrangements last week. He would have maintained high-security detention as the model for all comersâunaccompanied children, families with children, women with children and what have youâbut he has been forced to move by Liberal moderates who have been shamed into moving by Labor's amendment. The minister has made a ministerial statement and has posited changes in detention arrangements against his better judgment. That is one thing we know about last week's ministerial statement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other thing we know about last week's ministerial statement is that it was incredibly rushed. The reason it only contains three paragraphs about the issue the ministerial statement was supposedly about, which is children in detentionâin a sea of self-congratulation about its migration policy, there are these three paragraphs about children in detentionâis that the government has not as yet come to an arrangement with the South Australian government about access to appropriate housing stock. I have been in this House since 1998; I understand that my period of service in this House pales into insignificance compared with the minister's. But, on the basis of my service in this House, it seems to me that one normally makes a ministerial statement when one has something to announce. It seems to me to followânot to make too controversial a propositionâthat you normally make a ministerial statement when you have something to announce. Minister Ruddock made a ministerial statement to tell us that he was having discussions about something he may or may not be in a position to later announce when he has come to whatever agreement he might come to with the South Australian government. </para><para>So we know about the ministerial statement made last week against Minister Ruddock's better judgment. In terms of timing, it was made last week not because it was ready to goâbecause the government does not have any operative arrangements with the South Australian governmentâbut because it had to beat into this place today's amendment. The whole thing was about making sure that Liberal moderates did not vote for today's amendment. So that is where we are.</para><para>The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs made reference in question time yesterday to Labor using our good offices to assist with discussions with the South Australian government. I assure the House and the minister that, if he requires Labor's assistance to help him with his workload as minister for immigration, we of course stand ready to assist. I have had a number of discussions with the South Australian government about matters related to Woomera, particularly matters related to children in detention. I have met in that regard with the minister for community services and with the minister for education. I am quite willing to keep assisting the minister with striking an appropriate arrangement with the South Australian government. One could not get a better offer of bipartisanship than offering to do the minister's work for him. We will of course in the coming months, if it is necessary, do what we can to assist this minister to put some content into his ministerial statement and to actually get some housing stock which can be used for the purpose that the ministerial statement says it will be used.</para><para>On the one hand, the ministerial statement made last weekâdespite the fact that it was rushed, that it would not have happened if it had not been for Labor's amendment and that it was made against the minister's better judgmentârepresents a major advance and a major change for this government. It is the first time in many years of pursuing an absolutely inflexible detention model, and of deriding as lunatic and in league with people smugglers anybody who suggested there should be flexibility in the detention model, that the government have taken a step forward and agreed with, or at least partially agreed with, the proposition that it is not a good thing to have unaccompanied children in high-security detention facilities and that it is not a good thing to have children, even in family groups, in high-security detention facilities. </para><para>We welcome last week's ministerial statement as a step forward. It is a major backdown, given where the government have been. It stands against their rhetoric that any change in detention arrangements would be an opening of the floodgates. It stands against their rhetoric criticising, vilifying and branding as lunatic and as being in league with people smugglers anybody, whether they be from Labor or from refugee advocacy groups, who has the temerity to suggest that perhaps there is a better way for our detention arrangements. We welcome that.</para><para>The Liberal moderates, who I have no doubt are following this debate closely, need to think again about whether or not they are going to support Labor's amendment. I understand they have done a pretty remarkable thingâthat is, they have got the minister for immigration to move on detention arrangements, and I am not underestimating how difficult an internal battle that would have beenâbut I say to those Liberal moderates: when we come to vote today, have a think about the following. These changes in detention arrangements arise from migration series instructions. They are not law. There is no compulsion. They are a guideline to direct activity. Minister Ruddock was good enough to correspond with me to indicate why he thought my amendment was not right. I have had cause to study that letter quite closely. One of the reasons he thinks his ministerial statement is better, and that my amendment is not appropriate, is that he wants to maintain a fair bit of discretion in this area. He says in his letter to me things like:</para><quote><para>Rather than simplifying decision-making processes, as Labor professes to support, your proposed amendments would introduce blanket requirements that would remove my discretion in deciding on the most appropriate place of detention for certain unlawful non-citizens. </para></quote><para>Too right it would; absolutely. That is what it aims to do. It is aims to ensure that, in terms of a compulsion under the law, the minister has no discretion to determine where kids get held. It is not a question of discretion: will I place this unaccompanied eight-year-old in line with the migration series instructions or will I exercise my discretion in some other way? It is supposed to take away that discretion. We want to take away that discretion, because we want to be absolutely certain that there will never again be a time in this country when there will be an unaccompanied eight-year-old in Woomera. That is why we want an amendment to the Migration Act. Minister Ruddock wants to retain some discretion. Why? We know he does not actually believe in the detention changes he announced last week.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>âWe know why that occurred with the eight-year old. The eight-year-old was with family and the view was that it was quite inappropriate to take the child away from the family.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name></talker><para>âI am coming to the question of whole family groups in a minute, Minister, so it is useful that you have raised it with me. This letter verifies that the minister wants to retain some discretion. I ask the Liberal moderates who have fought hard for this change: how certain are you that it is going to be effective when it does not have the force of law? How certain are you that it is going to be effective when the principal argument the minister puts against it is that he still needs some discretion? That is point 1. Point 2, in terms of the Liberal moderates who are going to vote for Labor's amendment, is that our amendment deals with whole family groups. In the interjection from the minister, he indicated that there is an issue about separating families. We do not think you should separate families. Our amendment deals with whole family groups. It does so deliberately.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Lingiari is in the chamber and, with the constituency he represents, he would know this better than I. This nation has learnt, to its very great cost, what one can do if one separates familiesâand particularly if one separates children from parentsâand what even people of goodwill can do unwittingly. A lot of the stolen children generation occurred because people of goodwill acted unwittingly. Not all of them did, but there was a component of that. We know the terrible misery that can be inflicted, generation after generation, if one smashes up family groups. That is why Labor's amendment deals with keeping family groups together.</para><para>I would say to Liberal moderates, who are the kind of people who would have shed tears watching the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> video and reading the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report and who would worry about the scar on this nation's soul and on some of its people from the stolen children generation: if you believe, as I do, that a father has a right equal to that of a mother to be with children and that a brother's participation in a family is as important as a sister's then you must support Labor's amendment. The ministerial statement of last week does not give you that; it does not give you whole family groups. It does not put fathers with families. It does not put brothers with families. If you care about that then you need to take the extra step, come in here at voting time and vote for Labor's amendment. I cannot put that point too strongly. It seems to me that everything we know from human experience is that, if you can keep families together, you should.</para><para>The Prime Minister is on the recordâin quite a different context: over the use of IVF technology for women without partners, and particularly women who are lesbiansâas having put the view that his model, his image and his ideal of a family group means having a mother and a father. If he believes that, why would he have a detention policy that does not reflect that? Labor's amendment does. I say to those Liberal moderates, `I know you have already done a lot of work, I know you have done it against opposition, I know that it has been difficult and I know that there has been advance, but there is more work to do, and that work can only be done by voting for Labor's amendment.' This will not end today. Today, in this House, we will support our amendment. I anticipate that even if some Liberal moderates cross the floor we will be defeated. We will support our amendment in the Senate. I anticipate that in the Senate, with the support of the minor parties, we will carry it. We will bring it back to this House and we will support it again.  </para><para>So we are saying to Liberal moderates, `Understand this: you are embarking on a path where every few months between now and the next election you will have to decide, as a matter of conscience, yet again, whether or not you are going to support Labor's amendment.' I am sure that the minister will say parts of this bill are urgent, parts of it are vital and they have to be dealt with now. They are largely technical amendments but, if there is any part of this bill that that argument truly applies to, then I will move it as a private member's bill and Labor will vote for it. So if there is any part of it that you need urgently, let me know. I will move it as a private member's bill, Labor will vote for it and you can have it. But you cannot have this bill in total until you vote for Labor's amendment to get children out of detention. You will face that choice routinely over the coming few years. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Randall</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10284</page.no><id.no>R1601</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report from Main Committee</title><page.no>10284</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from Main Committee without amendment; certified copy of the bill presented.</para><para>Ordered that this bill be considered forthwith.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>10284</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr VAILE (LyneâMinister for Trade) (11.25 a.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10284</page.no><id.no>R1506</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10284</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>10284</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. We know that the purpose of this omnibus bill is to amend the Migration Act 1958. The bill purports to do the following: it changes aspects of the Australian legal regime in relation to visas, it creates the deputy principal member position for the Migration Review Tribunal, it harmonises the Criminal Code and relevant offences under the act, and it makes minor technical amendments. There are six major elements of this bill and I will briefly allude to them before beginning to examine the amendments moved by the Labor Party in relation to the bill.</para></talk.start><para>The first main provision of this bill is the immigration clearance status of non-citizen children born in Australia; the second is the taking of securities; the third is special purpose visas; the fourth is membership of the Migration Review Tribunal; the fifth is Criminal Code harmonisation; and, finally, the sixth major provision is the minor amendments which can be considered in detail. I will return to them later if we have time. As the opposition spokesman in this area has said, basically there is support for this legislation in relation to the major schedules, much of it is good legislation and, as a result, Labor will be supporting this bill except for the amendments they have moved. The amendments moved by the Labor Party are very interesting because they address the very thorny issue, for the Labor Party, of detention. Here comes Mr Baird, one of the major focuses for the opposition spokesman on this area. But I am sure he has a mind of his own.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>âI'm damned sure he doesn't agree with you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name></talker><para>âYou have not heard what I have had to say yet; it is very interesting that you are a mind-reader. It is very interesting to look at the historical context of the amendments which have been moved by the opposition on the detention of children and on family arrangements. I want to go back to the pre-election period, when I was running for the seat of Canning against the incumbent member. Interestingly, the issue of border protection and security became one of the main focuses of the election. I want to make it clear that I was out doorknocking at that time, and it was pretty evident that the Labor Party initially opposed border protection legislation. The issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> certainly focused people's minds on this issue, and then the Labor Party tried to reposition itself. We know that it cost the former leader, Mr Beazley, the election because of the poor decision he made regarding the first raft of border protection legislation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The public are smart. They can tell there is an opportunistic shift. When I was out doorknocking, people volunteered their views on this matter quite readily. They could see that the Labor Party were falling in line with the government, largely because the polling was telling the Labor Party where they were going with this. In several debates on radio and in the media with me, my opponent kept making this point, `We are one with the government regarding this matter.' She said, `There is not a cigarette paper's difference between us and the government on this issue of migration.' That included mandatory detention.</para><para>The greatest hypocrisy came from the member for Fremantle. The member for Fremantle, this week and last week, has pulled the rug out from under her leader and the opposition spokesman on this issue by saying she cannot support the legislation that will go through today, which the Labor Party has said it will support. The behaviour of the member for Grayndler, the member for Denison and Senator George Campbellâwho stood at the back of the press conference clappingâis symptomatic of the endemic rift in the Labor Party on this issue. No matter how much the Labor Party tries to paper over the cracks, it has a big problemânot only with members in the organisation but also with its parliamentary members and their constituencies.</para><para>The member for Fremantle's hypocrisy is unbelievable. She was the Premier of Western Australia when mandatory detentionâthe three strikes legislationâwas introduced. She was also the Premier of Western Australia when the Port Hedland detention facility was running. The Port Hedland detention centre was one of the tougher regimes, where people jumped off the roof, with some becoming paraplegics as a result. Where was Carmen Lawrence's conscience then? She has suddenly found a conscience. She is trying to pull the rug out from underneath her leader, and she is doing it with the blessing of a section of the Labor Party. The Labor Party know this, and they are embarrassed about it because they are divided on this issue.</para><para>The member for Lalor, the opposition spokesperson on this matter, wants to make some issue about four dissidents on the government side, and she has called them Liberal `moderates'. I do not think anyone wants to be called `moderate' in this world, but it is a term that has been slapped on them by the opposition. With regard to the so-called four `moderates', I was in last week's party room meetingâalong with you, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsayâand it was not raised. The difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party on this issue is that, once we have negotiated a position in our party room and in our forum, we stick to it. We do not go out and white-ant our leader or our ministerâwe speak with one voice.</para><para>I guarantee the member for Lalor that, today, not one person will cross the floor. If someone does, I will buy her a $100 lotto Quickpick. That is how confident I am that it will not happen. I wish she would demonstrate her confidence and offer me the same inducement. The bottom line is that, when the Liberal Party act on these issues, we act as one because we are one voice in relation to this. The Australian public want us to do the right thing regarding the integrity of our migration system.</para><para>Let us examine some of the elements of the issue. The member for Lalor said she wants two things: to compel the government to foster out unaccompanied children to families, and to provide familiesâwith the exception of males over 18 years of ageâ with houses outside of detention centres. She went further and said that she would like to see all families repatriated into communities. This again shows the sheer hypocrisy of the Labor Party. Simon Crean has said that the Labor Party believes in detention, yet the watering down of this policy would mean that no-one would end up in detention. If the policy were not to split families, the only people who would be left in detention would be a handful of older men. If you were a creative smuggler, what would you do from now on? You would make sure you smuggled families. It is as simple as that. </para><para>If the Labor Party were in government, smugglers would only need to smuggle families, because the Labor Party would house them in the community, with a marvellous electric beam surrounding Baxter which no-one could cross. If you believe in that sort of security, you believe in the tooth fairy. We know what security is like out there in the electorate at the moment. My office has been broken into five times in the last five weeks. The police got there within 10 minutes, but they were not there when it happened. Where was the security outside Woomera when the people broke out? You can talk about using a magic electric beam for security, but at what cost at the end of the day?</para><para>There is a very simple solution to this whole problem, and that is for the Labor Party to expedite our processing of people in detention so that they do not go through the huge raft of court appeals that they do in this country. We have had legislation before which proposed that the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal should be the non-legalistic avenues for appeal and that these people should not be going through every level of court appeal in this country, right through to the High Court, at the taxpayers' expense. If the Labor Party were serious, they would help us tidy up this issueâbut they are not serious.</para><para>One of the reasons that there is an opportunity to repatriate selected children and families is that there have been no new boat arrivals for well over 12 months. What does that say about the government's policy on this issue? It says that it is working. It is working, and the Australian public know it is working. The problem that the Labor Party have is that they have no credibility on this issue in the electorate. With regard to Simon Crean's leadership and the Labor Party's direction, Paul Kelly, the national affairs editor for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, said in an article yesterday that the Australian people do not believe that the Labor Party can securely manage this country with respect to border protection, the war on terrorism and, particularly, migration and illegal entry. The Labor Party still have not convinced the electorate that they have the will and the wherewithal to protect Australia in this area.</para><para>The coy trick that the Labor Party are trying to pull today with these amendments will not stack up with the public because the public know that the Labor Party say one thing in opposition and then another thing in governmentâone thing before an election and another thing after. The Carmen Lawrences of this world say: `We're with you. We say nothing, we do nothing and we feel ashamed, but we are not going to do anything,' and after the election they break out and say, `No, no, no.' Just to show how genuine they are, before the election former senators Barney Cooney and Jim McKiernan said, `The legislation can go through but, if we happen to win government, we'll change it.' They are not here, but that was the sentiment of the Labor Party at that timeâ`We'll opportunistically support the government's border protection and migration legislation but, should we become the government, we'll change it all and water it down.'</para><para>In my electorate of Canning, I have little or no call on mandatory detention of children and families. In fact, people come up to me and say, `You tell that John Howard and Philip Ruddock that, if they ever back off on this, they have lost me'âthis is Mr and Mrs Joe Public in the shopping centres. The public want us to show some resolve on this issueâand as a government we have. One of the reasons that we are here and the opposition are over there on the other side of this parliament is that the Australian people believe us. They believe John Howard and Philip Ruddock. They did not believe Kim Beazley, they do not believe Simon Crean and they do not believe that the Labor Party can run a decent migration program and protect this country. The argument that, through these amendments, the Labor Party can fix the system is just not going to wash with the Australian public. </para><para>Labor have no credibility in the migration debate. They cannot get traction on any issue. When you see the sorts of questions that are thrown up in question time, you know that they are begging for today to finish because they have run out of steam. At the end of the day, they are trying to do a quick soft-shoe shuffle through this legislation to try to appease a number of groups. If you are out there trying to please everyoneâwhich is what the Labor Party are trying to do on thisâyou will please no-one. You have the opposition spokesman and their leader saying one thing and then you have elements of the party in the lay organisation saying another. Carmen Lawrence says that she will take this legislation to the Labor Party national conference next year and get it overturnedâthat is how confident she is. Commentators reckon there is a chance she could even become the Labor Party national president over this issue. So where is the Labor Party on this issue? They are not with their political leadership on this. That is the problem Labor have.</para><para>The issue of housing families out in the community is something the Australian people just will not wear. The statistics show that, if you allow these people to be housed out in the community and do not send the signal that you are strong on detaining illegal immigrantsâand they are illegal immigrants; people who, in most cases, have been assessed and found not to be refugeesâthey then do not present themselves for removal. We know that that is the case. We know that that has been the case in other countries. We know that, in Britain, when a determination is made and these people live out in the community, they cannot find themâthe same as we cannot find the people who escaped from Woomera. Where are all those people? If they were genuine refugees, they would be presenting themselves for assessment. But, noâthey evaporate into the community, with the help of some of the socialistic elements of this country. They then become a burden on the community and do not ever give anything back. </para><para>You can see why some of these people should be removed. These are the people who bash guards at Port Hedland. These are the people who, when they get a determination against them, trash their facilityâas happened in Christmas Island just the other day. Why would you want these sorts of people as Australian citizens? Compare this with what happened during the war with the Italian prisoners of war who were interned on farms in an area where I was brought up in the wheat belt of Western Australia. They worked and, when they were able, they went back to Italy. Many of them migrated back here and are farmers in that district today. They are the sorts of people we want in this country, not people who are going to trash the joint and act like thugs and criminals. At the end of the day, they have painted themselves into a corner.</para><para>In this debate, the minister does have flexibility. You do not think the people who would have been `handpicked'âas the member opposite saidâfor houses around Woomera were picked through a lottery or something like that, do you? These people would have been screened rather well to ensure that they were appropriate people to be housed outside the facility on a trial basis. The ability of the minister to have some jurisdiction and flexibility in this issue is paramount. You cannot just have a blanket law which says, `Out they all go,' and allow those with dubious status, military training in other countries and that sort of thing to be on the loose in the community.</para><para>At the end of the day, it is good that this legislation is being supported by the Labor Party in general. Their amendments are just tokenism because they know the Australian people do not support them. Please, if you really feel so strongly, let us have another election on this, because the sentiment in my electorate tells us that, at the end of the day, they want a government that is actually going to be decisive. Philip Ruddock, the minister, has hero status in my electorate. They say to me, `We just hope that guy doesn't get crook, because he is the sort of person we want to stay in the job because he's doing such a fine job with the integrity of the migration system in this country. We want him to actually stay in the post because we feel secure and comfortable with a government that is actually doing the job'âas our government is. The minister, Philip Ruddock, should be congratulated. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>10288</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>.

Just scurry out. The bill is a non-controversial omnibus bill. It seeks to amend and clarify the Migration Act 1958 in five major areas. It clarifies certain visa related matters by providing that a non-citizen child born in Australia is immigration cleared for the purposes of his or her birth entry if at least one of his or her parents is immigration cleared. This provision is backdated to 1 September 1994. The bill ensures that a special purpose visa ceases to be in effect immediately, rather than at the end of the day, if the minister declares it is undesirable for the non-citizen to travel to and enter Australia or remain in Australia, putting it beyond doubt that the rules of natural justice do not apply to the making of such a declaration. It ensures that a non-citizen who leaves and re-enters Australia on a bridging visa that allows such travel is subject to the section 48 bar on further applications. It ensures that certain offence provisions operate as they did prior to the application of the Criminal Code. Lastly, it applies strict liability to an offence against subsection 241(1) of assisting people to falsely appear to be de facto spouses for the purpose of the regulations so that one of them can get a stay visa.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is not my intention to go through the detail of all of those proposals, because that was adequately done by the shadow minister. I do want to reflect on the Labor Party's amendments because they are, as the shadow minister pointed out, what this debate should be about. Our amendments will ensure that unaccompanied minors must be placed as quickly as possible in community care arrangements as determined by state government child protection agencies and that accompanied minors, with their families, must be placed as quickly as possible in a detention model like the Woomera alternate detention trial. </para><para>I want to comment briefly, if I may, on the contribution of the member for Canning, because he railed against a light beam. Firstly, he clearly does not understand what the Woomera alternate detention trial isâone which the minister foreshadowed in his statement to the parliament last week he was prepared to extendâbecause the Woomera detention trial provides for women with children to be placed in residential accommodation with perimeter fencing and this beam of light. The beam of light is just that: a beam of light. It does not cause harm. But, clearly, the residents of these facilities understand that, if they cross that beam of light, they have transgressed and they have effectively fled from the accommodation. What the member said, of course, was that this was an absurdity. `Who in their right mind could believe that people would be detained by a beam of light?' That is, in effect, what he said. What he might want to do is inform himself of what the current provisions are in the alternate detention trial at Woomera. He might want to go to the minister and ask him for a briefing on what the alternate detention trial means, what the security requirements are in relation to that detention trial and how well it has worked. Because, as the shadow minister has said, there is not one example of an individual or group attempting to flee from this type of accommodation. That is precisely why the Labor amendments should be supported.</para><para>It is worthwhile again stating, as the shadow minister did, that the minister, in responding clearly to backbench concerns about the plight of children in detention, has made it very clear that it is his intention at some point to change the way in which they deal with families in detention. It is worth noting that, on 2 December, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reported:</para><quote><para>Mr Ruddock is believed to have initially resisted the move because it was impractical, but dropped his objections under pressure from Mr Howard, who is concerned that some MPs may vote for Labor's amendments as a matter of conscience. </para></quote><para>I note that the shadow minister invited those dissident Liberal MPsâthe members for Cook, Pearce, Hindmarsh and Kooyongâto sit with us on this side of the chamber later today, when this legislation is voted upon, to support the Labor Party's amendmentsâto act upon their conscience. Because it is clear, as the shadow minister pointed out, that the protection which is offered by these amendments is legislatively based to be far stronger than those proposals which would be, in effect, a directive to the immigration department.</para><para>I note that this `About-face on detention cent-res policy', which is the headline on the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article of 2 December, named four pro-m-inent people, three of whom are members of this chamber. They are: the member for Kooyong; Mr Pyne, the member for Sturt; Bruce Baird, the member for Cook; and Sen-ator Marise Payne. I am not aware that any of those people have come into this chamber to make a personal explanation to refute this article. So what it says to me is that there is clearly a great deal of concernâas pointed out by the shadow ministerâwithin the Liberal Party, at the highest level of government, about the possibility that people in the Liberal Party might actually act on their conscience. I would say to those people that they ought to take that opportunity to act on their conscience when this legislation is voted upon later this after-noon. I could spend the whole of the time avail-able to me berating the contribution made by the member for Canning, but I will not.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Gillard</name></talker><para>âChristmas is coming; we haven't got enough time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>âThat is right; Christmas is coming and we do not have enough time. But I do want to say one thing. The member for Canning railed against the Labor Party for not assisting with expediting the processes dealing with asylum seekers. What the shadow minister has made plain to the minister and the government is that there is a standing offer to facilitate the passage of any legislation which comes into this chamber to facilitate and expedite processing procedures. There has not been one occasion when such measures have been brought into this place that the Labor Party have sought to block them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I suggest that the member for Canningâand, I presume, other members of the government backbenchâactually finds out the detail of what discussions have taken place, what has actually been said by Labor Party members in this chamber and what the Labor Party policy means. It is very clear, from the undertakings which have been given by the shadow minister, that, should the minister come into this placeâshould he be afraid of supporting our amendment todayâwith his own proposals to amend his legislation to give effect, in a similar way, to the proposals put forward by the Labor Party then we would support them. But he will not. That is the point that those dissident members, those members with a heart and conscience, within the Liberal Party ought to be contemplating.</para><para>Whilst we have heard from the member for Canning and will, no doubt, hear from others about the way in which the community is behind the attitude and policies of the government in relation to detention, frankly, I do not think that the community does support the proposal to keep children behind wire. When the Labor Party took the decision on Australia Day last yearâas pointed out by the shadow ministerâthat we would remove the children from behind wire, there was derision from within the ranks of the Liberal Party. It is now clear that there are people with a conscience in the Liberal Party who accept now that this is a policy which they ought to be supporting and which they would like the Liberal Party to support. It was not just out of some political desire that we were making these statements and it was not because we wanted to win support within the community necessarilyâalthough we believed that the community would support us in removing children from behind wire.</para><para>The fact is that it is not an appropriate way to deal with children or their families. There is a range of commentators who are expert in their own right in the emotional and psychological trauma which is caused to children and their families by such detention. For my sins, I am an ex-school teacher. I have to say that one of the joys of being a school teacher is working with young people and seeing them develop and be nourished. It is a great opportunity and it is a great job because you can see people growing. When you know that their families are behind them and giving them support, you can see them flourish in such a way that it gives you a great deal of pride. And they achieve greatness in their own ways. </para><para>What we know about the way in which the government treats children in detention is that it stultifies their growth. It imposes extreme psychological stress upon them and their families. I would like to refer to an article by Rebecca Holmes in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser </inline>on 2 July this year. In this article she quotes Ros Powrie from the Australian Association for Infant Mental Health in relation to the issue of children in detention. She says that parents unable to provide life's essentials felt disempowered. The article says:</para><quote><para>âThe institutional effect on parents undermines their authority and their ability to care for their children,â Dr Powrie told the inquiry. âThey cannot provide for their children's emotional needs when they are in a situation of deprivation themselves.â</para></quote><para>This is why the government should be picking up the amendments being proposed by the Labor Partyânot because it is politically cute; not because it is, somehow or other, manifestly popular within the community, but because it is the right thing to do.</para><para>I am a parent with four children. I cannot imagine any circumstance where I could, with my partner, properly look after our children in the situation which we know detainees are being held in in detention centres around Australia. Some are being held for lengthy periods of time. Any parent, including the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, knows what it means. If you have bought up children and if you have seen what psychological stress children are being placed under in these detention centres, how could you not have pity for them? How could you not seek to find the quickest way possible to end their suffering in terms of the pressures that they are under and the results of that pressure?</para><para>I would also like to refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>on 17 July 2000. The article quotes Chris Sidoti, the federal Human Rights Commissioner. It says:</para><quote><para>Detaining refugee children is a gross violation of human rights and âfar worseâ than mandatory sentencing for juveniles, federal Human Rights Commissioner Chris Sidoti will argue today.</para></quote><para>This was in a context in which mandatory sentencing was a topic of hot debate, because mandatory sentencing existed in the Northern Territory. Chris Sidoti was quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>âThe numbers of children detained, the length of their detention and the fact that they are not accused, let alone convicted, of any crime make the commonwealth's actions in relation to child asylum seekers far worse than that of Western Australia and the Northern Territory in relation to juvenile offendersâ ...</para></quote><para>That speaks for itself. I am proud to say that, on coming to office last year, one the first actions of the ALP government in the Northern Territory was to end the mandatory detention of juveniles.</para><para>I could go on at length about the advice from commentators and professionals about this matter, but I want now to go to the Labor Party's policy. Before I commend that policy to the community, I want to express my deep appreciation to the shadow minister at the table, Julia Gillard, and to the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, for the guts and determination they have shown in developing this policyâa policy which is well accepted by those who know about these things in the wider community, and I will come to those endorsements in a moment. Despite the criticism and the asinine comments from the government and critics within the media, the Labor Party now has a well thought out, cogent policy which provides the way ahead for the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers in Australia. It has only happened because of the shadow minister's diligenceâher ability to be able to sit down and talk with and consult communities right around Australia, both inside and outside the Labor Party, and to be able to debate and nurture discussion within the Labor Party about these issues. The shadow minister knows that she and I have disagreed on aspects of this policy on its way through, but, on balance, we have a very good piece of public policy. </para><para>It is true that there are critics, but it is worthwhile pointing out some of the people who endorse the policy of the Labor Party. It also needs to be understood that members of the government, particularly those people who feel concerned about the way in which the government is treating children and their families, should read the Labor Party's policy, particularly those sections of the policy dealing with freeing children and with detention, because the Labor Party makes it very clear that it is committed, via the amendments proposed today, to dealing appropriately and humanely with children and their families.</para><para>I want to refer to a document produced by Australians for Just Refugee Programs Inc., entitled `Labor leaves the Government exposed with cruel policies', and then refer to some of the members of this organisation. The document says:</para><quote><para>It is a mark of how poor the Government's current programs are, that we acknowledge the following features as enormous improvements: </para></quote><para>That is, features of the Labor Party's policyâ</para><quote><para>Â·	A commitment to process 90% of asylum seekers within 90 days, with public scrutiny and review of any detention longer than that.</para><para>Â·	Abolition of the Refugee Review Tribunals, replaced with independent procedures for processing, review and monitoring of conditions.</para><para>Â·	Ending discrimination in the treatment of refugees according to how they arrive, particularly by providing support and security to those currently on temporary protection visas.</para><para>Â·	Ending the Pacific dumping of asylum seekers, and providing central processing on Australian soil, with those achieving refugee status settled in Australia.</para><para>Â·	Taking the pressure off Sydney and promoting refugee resettlement in welcoming regions of Australia.</para><para>Â·	Commitment to use humanitarian aid and international diplomacy to lead the world in reaching lasting solutions, not leaving the western world in worst practice.</para><para>Â·	Commitment to public debate based on fact is not vilification.</para><para>Â·	An end to the punitive and indefinite nature of detention, and setting standards which will be managed by an independent Inspector General.</para></quote><para>This is not a cheer squad for the Labor Party. Let me identify some of members of this august organisation: Professor Peter Baume AO, a former member of this chamber and the Hon. Fred Chaney AO, former senator and member of this chamberâboth former government ministers; Malcolm Fraser AC, former Liberal Prime Minister; the Hon. Nick Greiner AC, former Liberal Premier of New South Wales; John Hewson AM, former opposition leader in this chamber and a member of the Liberal Party; and Ian Macphee AO, Liberal Party member and former minister. This is not a cheer squad for the Labor Party. This gives light to those people on the government benches who believe that they need the support of other people in order to take a firm stand and follow their conscience and their convictions by supporting the Labor amendments this afternoon. There is support in the wider community for the Labor Party's position. There are a lot of people in the Liberal Party who now support Labor's position, and I invite those people with a conscience within the government to support the Labor amendments when they are voted on this afternoon.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>10291</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am delighted to speak on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. The previous speaker, the member for Lingiari, talked about the opposition coming up with `a well thought out, cogent policy which provides the way ahead'. One year later they come up with a policy and what happens? A shadow minister resigns from the front bench. That is the quality of the opposition's policy and what it is doing to the opposition. It is a divided opposition that does not know where it is going and, as reflected in the last election, unless it comes up with policies that are widely accepted by the Australian community, they are going to be on that side of the chamber for some time to come. It is a pleasure to speak in the debate on this bill because this issue is important to the people in my electorate of Ryan. It has raised a lot of interest in the community. I have received a lot of calls, letters and correspondence that overwhelmingly support the government's position. That is why at the last election the people of Ryan returned the seat to a Liberal member.  </para></talk.start><para>I want to speak on a few of the provisions of this bill. This bill seeks to clarify visa related issues and to provide that non-citizen children born in Australia are immigration cleared for the purposes of their birth entry. It is important to clarify the immigration status of non-citizen children born in Australia because it has significant implications for a person's entitlements under the act. Another important provision authorises the taking of security for compliance with conditions to be imposed on a visa before a visa is granted. There are also important provisions concerning non-citizens who leave and re-enter Australia while on bridging visas. The section 48 bar will prevent such travel. We do not want the laws of this country abused. The provisions in this bill will play a big part in preventing abuse of certain existing provisions that are meant to limit the class of visa for people applying to come into this country. This bill also deals with the time limits, in terms of immigration clearance, imposed on non-citizens seeking revocation of the automatic cancellation of student visas and ensuring that decisions that do not revoke the cancellation are not reviewable. </para><para>One of the less controversial provisions in the bill is the creation of a deputy principal member position for the Migration Review Tribunal. I would like to think that the opposition supports that provision. It ensures that certain offence provisions operate as they did prior to the commencement of the Criminal Code. There are a couple of technical amendments that bring the bill into line with the Commonwealth Criminal Code of 1995. </para><para>As the Australian people appreciate, the coalition government are very committed to maintaining Australia's immigration program. It is important that we have the confidence of the Australian people in the security and integrity of our immigration program. We are going to run this program in the interests of the people of Australia. It is very important that the people of Australia appreciate that the program that regulates entry into Australia is managed efficiently and that the scarce resources of the Commonwealth government are being applied efficiently so that those who come into this country come in in the proper way, they come in legitimately and they do not abuse the Australian government's and people's reception and welcoming of them. This is a very generous country; it has played a big part in welcoming people. But, at the same time, we clearly have to do this to promote the national interest. The amendments in this bill will enhance the integrity of the act and ensure that certain provisions in the act operate as originally intended. </para><para>One of the important things about legislation is that it should provide certainty. This bill and the amendments therein will contribute to that very strongly. I find it somewhat amusing that members opposite speak with professed authority against this bill, considering that a year ago the people of Australia voted very strongly and decisively to return the government when the opposition were all over the place and had no idea where they stood. The result speaks for itself. This government was returned with the full confidence of the Australian people. It is quite amusing that, one year on, the opposition has come up with a policy that has created more division and more frustration within their party. I know that the shadow minister responsible for this portfolio has a very strong, sincere and genuine interest in the field. I certainly respect her position on it. It is unfortunate that I have to disagree with much of her personal position on this bill. In terms of integrity, I know that she certainly has a very genuine interest in the field. </para><para>It is very important that, when parliaments pass legislation, it is compatible with the national interest, the democratic process and the wishes of the people. It is not a case of pandering to certain special interest groups and lobby groups. What we are about is passing laws that are in the best interests of the country. Clearly, the government are doing that. That is why we were returned to government; that is why we have, and will continue to have, significant representation in the parliament.  </para><para>One of the steps the government and Minister Ruddock have taken is the restructuring of the immigration program. This has played an important part in gaining the confidence of the Australian people. We do not want people abusing the process. We do not want rorters coming in here. We do not want people smugglers having significant weight in deciding who comes into this country simply through the payment of money to them. One of the results of this government's migration policies has been the balancing and rebalancing of the economic and social benefits of immigration and the strengthening of our borders. The balance in our immigration intake is very important. </para><para>The Australian public are not to be underestimated. They know where we stand. Decisive, strong policy is expected from the government. Policies that follow that position and are implemented will earn the respect and regard of the public. The government take a strong stand against people who come here illegally and stay illegally. We are talking about not only people who come into this country illegally but also people who come into this country legally and stay illegally. They have an obligation to meet legal requirements. If they come into the country legally then they should stay for the time allowed and not a day longer. If they wish to come in again then they need to fulfil the legal requirements that this parliament has set down.</para><para>I want to say a few words about my own background. That is why I have a particular interest in this field and why I am speaking to this bill. Like my colleagues on both sides of the chamber, I know that there are migrants in this parliament. I am one of them. I have been an Australian for over two decades. It is a great privilege to be an Australian. Those of us who are migrants consider it a great privilege to be Australian and to make a contribution to this country in our respective ways. </para><para>This legislation reflects the policy and the philosophy of the government of doing the right thing by this country. It is very important that legislation passed by this parliament reflects the values of this country: tolerance, harmony and a multicultural disposition. This country is very tolerant, welcoming and respectful to individuals who come from different parts of the world, who have different backgrounds and who make a contribution to this country once they come here. But they come here in the proper way. They come here through the front door, compatible with the laws of this country. It is also important to say that those who bide their time and do the right thingâthose who apply to come here by following the proper processesâare respected by this parliament when it passes laws compatible with that position.</para><para>I take the opportunity to commend the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The minister is doing a terrific job in his portfolio, and that can be seen in the community. Last week I had the pleasure of hosting a special morning tea for the minister in the Ryan electorate, at the St Lucia Bowling Club. He was overwhelmed with interest and support at the club. I was absolutely flabbergasted by the response from the community in terms of those who wanted to come along; it was an incredible turnout. Many residents had the opportunity to meet him, to talk to him, to see him in the flesh and to see that he is a very compassionate man who is doing a terrific job for the country and who has an enormous area of responsibility.</para><para>I quote one of the members of the bowls club, Mr Wayne George, who put this on the bowls club's web page in response to the minister's visit:</para><quote><para>Mr. Ruddock gave the assembled audience the views and reasoning of his Government on several subjects, one being of most interest was that of illegal immigration, detention of illegal immigrants and the prevention of terrorists entering Australia illegally.</para><para>The Minister shed his television image and projected himself in a completely different light to which we are accustomed to seeing him. His 30 years in Federal Parliament has turned him into a very articulate orator and he showed himself to be a humorous, warm hearted person, the interests of the citizens of Australia being his prime objective. </para></quote><para>I say that again:</para><quote><para>... the interests of the citizens of Australia being his prime objective.</para></quote><para>I thank Mr Wayne George for putting that up on the St Lucia bowls club web site and for very kindly letting me know he had done so. He communicated that that had gone out to all the members and the community. I also thank the president of the St Lucia Bowling Club, Mr Ross Humphreys, for the warm hospitality we received.</para><para>This bill and its amendments are very important. I certainly encourage those opposite to support it. We pass laws in this country for the national interest, not for minority groups. It is regrettable that in the real world we sometimes have the situation where people are separated from their families but, at the end of the day, this government is about passing laws and regulations that are in the interests of this country and its citizens. This government passes laws and implements policies for the people's benefit but also with an eye to people's feelings and emotions.</para><para>One of the important things that the government does is take care of the people who are in detention centres. It is important to look after their basic day-to-day needs, such as food. Safety is paramount: their physical safety and, to a large degree, their emotional and mental safetyâas much as is practical. There are also education services. The environment in which they are placed is not a five-star hotelâwe all know thatâbut, at the end of the day, this government is doing what is right for the people of this country. Putting in place policies that may seem, on the face of it, unfortunate is the heavy onus on government. With the minister's heavy portfolio responsibilities, I am sure he has a very personal interest in knowing that his department and this government are regulating and putting in place very important policies that are consistent with the standards of the overwhelming majority of Australians.</para><para>The opposition are saying that their views and policies are accepted by the wider community. I would be very surprised if that were so. If they think the latest initiatives that they have come up with match the position of the broader community, then they are not in touch with what the overwhelming majority of our fellow Australians think. It is our job as members of this parliament and the job of the executive and the minister, when we come up with policies, to be in sync with the views of the people of Australia. The government are doing that; that is why we are in government. The opposition have a long way to go. They cannot even come up with policies that keep their frontbench satisfied, as we saw last Thursday with the resignation of a shadow minister. That is a reflection of the opposition's position and the turmoil withinâand this is just one area of policy, a very important area. If they want to make progress in this parliament, then they certainly have a lot of work to do. They have to get out and talk to the people of Australia, not just to certain groups that have access to their doors.</para><para>That said, I again want to pay tribute to the integrity of the shadow minister. I know that she has a very genuine personal interest in this. Unfortunately, her policy position is not in sync with the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. Just ask the Australian people, shadow minister, and you will get their views. Go out there and talk to them about what they want from government in terms of policy on immigration and people coming into this country. We are a very tolerant and welcoming country. Our history and the track record of our country show that. Many new Australians have become members of this parliament, and that in itself says a lot about the majesty of our democracy and the great country in which we live. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>10294</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appreciate the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> and I will be taking this opportunity to further expound on areas of migration policy. This particular bill was introduced into the House on 13 March 2002. On 20 March 2002 the Senate referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 15 May 2002. The bill makes a number of changes to the Migration Act 1958, and it was determined by that committee that the changes should be fully examined. </para></talk.start><para>The explanatory memorandum to this bill describes it as an omnibus bill dealing with the following matters. It clarifies certain visa related matters by providing that a non-citizen child born in Australia is immigration cleared for the purposes of his or her birth entry if at least one of his or her parents is immigration cleared. That provision is backdated to 1 September 1994. The bill ensures that a special purpose visa ceases to be in effect immediately rather than at the end of that day if the minister declares that it is undesirable for the non-citizen to travel to, enter or remain in Australia. This provision puts it beyond doubt that the rules of natural justice do not apply to the making of such a declaration. The bill ensures that a non-citizen who leaves and re-enters Australia on a bridging visa that allows such travel is subject to the section 48 bar on further applications. It also deals with ensuring that certain offence provisions operate as they did prior to the application of the Criminal Code, and it apples strict liability to one such offence: an offence against section 241(1) of assisting people to falsely appear to be de facto spouses for the purposes of the regulations so that one spouse can get a stay visa.  </para><para>The member for Lalor has detailed the bill quite eloquently. In the member for Lalor's contribution to this debate, she foreshadowed Labor's amendment. We will be insisting on our amendment, which will require that unaccompanied minors be placed as quickly as possible in community care arrangementsâas determined by state government child protection agenciesâand that accompanied minors with their families be placed as quickly as possible into detention on a model such as the Woomera alternate detention trial. </para><para>The Howard government's claims that asylum seekers threw children overboard were untrue. The Howard government's policies in this area, and in particular the so-called Pacific solution, are no solutions at all. Labor offer the Australian people real solutions in this area. On Australia Day, Labor leader Simon Crean announced that a Labor government would ensure that children were not kept behind razor wire in formal detention centres. In April, Labor agreed to four major steps for Labor in government and, in the meantime, we have urged the government to take these steps as well. The four steps are: to mothball the Woomera Detention Centre, as recommended by the Immigration Detention Advisory Group; to put the public sector back in control of detention centres; to lift the shroud of secrecy and allow media into detention centres; and to enter into a proper time limited safe haven arrangement for asylum seekers from Afghanistan and extend the voluntary repatriation arrangements. </para><para>Members of the government have taken quite some time outlining the difficult processes that the Labor Party has gone through this past year. I join the member for Lingiari in congratulating the shadow minister at the table and Labor leader Simon Crean for coming up with a policy recommendation which is humane, which addresses the concerns a lot of us had and which we are quite comfortable in promoting and supporting in our community. As I said, it was a difficult decision. The member for Ryan talked about consultation, but he is not party to our party discussions and would not know that the shadow minister and all of us in our caucus consulted widely and effectively to come up with Labor's policy, which was announced just last week. </para><para>Last week, on 5 December, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lalor released Labor's policy for asylum seekers and refugees. The policy is good. It addresses the treatment of asylum seekers with dignity and the protection of Australia's borders. It also proposes a new processing system. We outlined a number of additional ways refugees will be treated in an Australian way. Labor will run a fast, fair and transparent processing regime that determines 90 per cent of claims in 90 days. Genuine refugees will be quickly identified and released, while failed claimants will be quickly returned. Labor will administer better health checks and ASIO security checks. Those people whose claims have merit and who are ASIO security cleared, health cleared and who pose no risks will be able to live in hostel style accommodation. Labor will create an independent inspector-general of detention who will monitor detention conditions and resolve complaints. Labor will have an expert committee that will review or make recommendations on any case in which a person is detained for more than 90 days. </para><para>There are refugees in Australia who, under current laws, may be here for a lifetime but who will never be eligible for family reunion. Labor will not maintain such a system. Labor will replace this system with a short-term temporary protection visa, after the expiry of which a genuine refugee can access a permanent protection visa. We will facilitate the settling of genuine refugees in parts of Australia where they will be welcome and are needed. Regional communities that want to increase their population through having refugees settle there will be able to do so under Labor's regional settlement plan and will receive targeted resources to assist them. I will be encouraging the release of appropriate funding for infrastructure support so that Lake Macquarie and Newcastle can make good their recent resolutions to welcome refugee families into our local communities. It is essential that migrants have access to health services, English language lessons, orientation services, interpreting and translating services, Job Network information, training assistance, social services, referral services and advice. It is essential that we employ flexible support programs that ensure such services are available where they are needed. We need to encourage local government organisations, non-profit organisations, educational institutions and community groups to establish formal or informal support networks that work in conjunction with government agencies. In other words, we must recognise that regional migration is a win-win situation.</para><para>One of the main aspects of Labor's policy is to propose a fairer worldwide system for refugees by having the world adopt one processing system for refugee claims. Under a Labor government, Australia would lead by example to pilot a processing regime which, we will advocate, should be adopted globally. Christmas Island will be the prime asylum seeker processing and detention facility. We will monitor the return of failed asylum seekersâsomething which my branch members have been calling on the government to do for quite some time. We will increase the funding to the UNHCR to $25 million per annum in order to better assist those who live and often die in refugee camps overseas. We will boost aid to address the issues that cause people to move, such as poverty, natural disasters, conflict and environmental degradation. We will increase aid to countries of first asylum to facilitate the development of a system of return of asylum seekers.</para><para>Another proposal in Labor's recently announced policy is to introduce a US style green card to crack down on illegal workers, to ensure that they are not stealing Australian jobs and undermining the pay and conditions of Australian workers. We will smash people-smuggling rings through tougher policing, including stationing more AFP officers in Indonesia, and we will impose harsher penalties for people smugglers. We will focus on eradicating people-trafficking for the purposes of sexual or other exploitation, as well as people-smuggling. We will better protect our airports and seaports. These steps are in addition to our recently announced $600 million Australian coastguard proposal.</para><para>I am pleased to have had the opportunity over this past week to inform my constituents of this policyâa policy which I wholeheartedly support. In our policy, Labor vows to provide short-term temporary protection visas which are not ongoing, as they have been over the years. Since October 1999, refugee claimants who arrive in Australia without authorisation have been granted not permanent protection visas but three-year temporary protection visas which significantly limit their entitlements to settlement services and other welfare support. Since October 1999, over 7,500 people have been granted a temporary protection visa. They have come predominantly from Afghanistan and Iraq, with smaller groups from Iran, Sri Lanka and other `usual suspect' countries that engage in the persecution of their citizens.</para><para>In 2000 the Refugee Council of Australia raised many concerns about temporary protection visas, and since then those concerns have been confirmed. Labor's policy goes a long way to addressing those concerns. The Refugee Council of Australia's concerns about temporary protection visas included the issue of long-term welfare dependency. People who are refugees are desperate to get work and to support their families. Under the restrictions of the temporary protection visa, these people have not been able to do that, including during the regime of detention. The lack of family reunion opportunities under a temporary protection visa was another main concern of the Refugee Council of Australia. As I said, those visas have been ongoing under this government. Labor vow to make temporary protection visas short term and limited. </para><para>We have had endorsements of our policy over the last week or so from Australians for Just Refugee Programs Inc. Howard Glenn, National Director of the A Just Australia campaign, said:</para><quote><para>We welcome a policy that shows much greater regard to respect, decency and traditional Australian generosity to those in need, while still advancing Australia's national interests, security and international standing.</para><para>The policy is a major shift. It will be welcomed as an improvement by much of the constituency that has come together under our banner. It still suffers from the fear and insecurity in the community that the Government has whipped upâtoo little compassion and too much sense of threat.</para></quote><para>The Brotherhood of St Laurence welcomed the revised ALP policy `as a significant shift towards more humane treatment of vulnerable people that addresses major concerns with current policies'. The Refugee Council of Australia welcomed the announcement of the new ALP refugee policy. David Bitel, President of the Refugee Council, said:</para><quote><para>At last we have seen a break away from the bipartisan approach to refugee policy that has stultified creative thinking and has led to the development of policies and practices that have been the subject of considerable criticism from within Australia and internationally.</para></quote><para>In outlining and detailing Labor's amendments to this bill to get children out from behind the razor wire, the member for Lalor referred to the minister's and the Prime Minister's backflip on this issue last week, under pressure from the small `l' liberals. To emphasise that backflip, in August, when the Prime Minister was questioned about the proposal of the government's immigration detention advisory group to expand the Woomera alternative detention trial to family groups, he responded: </para><quote><para>We have tried the idea of having them out in the community with their mothers and the reaction has been that they don't want to be separated from their fathers. And if you put the whole family out the danger is they just melt into the community ...</para><para>...				...				...</para><para>... our view remains that if you go beyond having your mother and children then you do run the risk that people abscond ...</para></quote><para>In responding to that statement from the Prime Minister, the member for Lalor said:</para><quote><para>The Woomera Alternate Detention Trial consist of four former defence force homes on a block. The perimeter is secured and security personnel are always present in an work from one of the houses. Up to 25 women and children have lived in the other houses.</para><para>Labor has been campaigning for six months to get the children out from behind the razor wire by building on and enhancing this trial program.</para></quote><para>That is why we will be insisting on our amendment. To reiterate, the amendment that we are moving, supporting and insisting on amends the power to detain under the Migration Act, so that unaccompanied minors must be placed as quickly as possible in the community care arrangements as determined by state government child protection agencies, and accompanied minors with their families must be placed as quickly as possible in a detention model like the Woomera alternative detention trial.</para><para>I would like to take just a couple of moments to reflect on refugees and, in particular, on the World Refugee Day for 2002, which focused on women and children. There are approximately 50 million uprooted people around the worldârefugees who have sought safety in another country and people displaced within their own country. Between 75 and 80 per cent of them are women and children. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees cares for about 21.8 million of these people, and around half of them are women and girls.</para><para>As this is the last day of the parliament sitting for 2002 and we are talking about refugees, I would like to take the opportunity to urge the Prime Minister and members of the government to take the next month or so to reflect on the ravages of war and on any Australian contribution which may be requested following the weapons inspectors carrying out their operations in Iraq. The majority of people who flee their homes do so because of war, and the proportion of war victims who are civilians has leapt in recent decades from five per cent to over 90 per cent of casualties. Eighty per cent of casualties by small arms are women and children, who far outnumber any military casualties. I ask the Prime Minister to reflect on the fact that, if Australia agrees to support America in a war against Iraq, it is not the Prime Minister's children who will be going, and it is not my children who will be going; it is the children of our constituents, of the people whom we are elected to represent here. We are elected to represent their interests, and I know that the interests of my constituents do not involve sending their children halfway around the world to a war which Australia has no right to be a part of. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>10298</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. </inline>The principal purpose of this omnibus bill is to amend the Migration Act 1958 and, in effect, change some of the aspects of the Australian legal regime with regard to visas and providing greater clarity. In addition, it will create a new positionâone that is much neededâfor the Migration Review Tribunal: a deputy principal member. It will also remove some of the ambiguities surrounding certain offence provisions. One of the principal areas of change that the bill is directed towards relates to immigration clearance of non-citizen children born in Australia. If a non-citizen enters Australia at a prescribed place or port and provides evidence of their identity and a visa, then that leaves them with the permission of the clearance officerâunless it is directed to an immigration detentionâand then that person is said to have immigration clearance. The other instance where a non-citizen can have immigration clearance is when they are initially refused or bypass immigration clearance but are subsequently granted a substantive visa.</para></talk.start><para>Contained within Australian migration legislation is a clear distinction between immigration clearance and entry and, effectively, between non-citizens who are lawful and those who have immigration clearance. Under the migration regulations 1994, a non-citizen's access to a visa can be affected by an immigration clearance. Consequently, having immigration clearance has also had an impact on non-citizens' entitlements as defined under the Migration Act 1958. Immigration clearance affects immigration detention. If an unlawful non-citizen arrives in a migration zone without a visa, they must be detained. A non-citizen with immigration clearance can also be detained if they are likely to evade or not cooperate with immigration officers. It also affects non-citizens' access to visas in relation to rules in safe third countries. As well as the cancellation of visas, it does not apply if the visa holder has a permanent visa and has had immigration clearance.</para><para>One of the objectives of this bill is to clarify an anomaly that currently exists between the notion of birth entry and the requirement that entry must be at a port or a prescribed place. This is an area that was raised by the International Commission of Jurists in their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and revolved around the immigration clearance definition of a child as being covered by the visa of his or her parents when born to a person who is not immigration cleared. A child who is born in Australia but who does not have citizenship is taken to hold the visa on a similar basis to his or her parents. In effect, the birth entry of a non-citizen child appears to offend section 43 of the act as it stands. Therefore, the change proposed for subsection 173(2) would be to state that these non-citizen children are not to be taken by virtue of their birth to have entered Australia in a way that contravenes section 43.</para><para>At the outset of my discussion on this bill, I spoke of the change in the membership of the Migration Review Tribunal. The deputy principal member would be placed between the principal member and senior members of the tribunal. Immigration is a very significant feature of the Australian way of life and the way that we live, eat, work and play. The proposed changes as contained in this bill will assist to clarify and provide greater certainty for the volume of people who arrive in this country. In addition, the bill clarifies the circumstances surrounding the birth of children in migration zones and their status as reflected by the visa status of their parents. Another feature of the bill is the harmonisation of the Criminal Code in relation to migration. As the minister stated in his second reading speech: </para><quote><para>Schedule 5 to the bill ensures that certain offence provisions in the act operate as they did prior to the commencement of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.</para></quote><para>The act currently contains offences that relate to the unlawful entry of non-citizens. While non-citizens can arrive in Australia without a visa and not commit an offence, it is an offence for a person to be involved in bringing non-citizens into this country. The changes to the act are contained in the bill and they provide a clearer framework in relation to the evidential burden with regard to exceptions to some people for smuggling offences, particularly in relation to the reversed onus of proof and strict liability.</para><para>I would like to speak about some of the amendments the opposition intend to move. One of those is an amendment to section 196 of the act and is both quite unnecessary and pretty much nonsensical. Section 196(1) reads: </para><quote><para>An unlawful non-citizen ... must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is: </para><para>(a) removed ...</para><para>(b) deported ... or </para><para>(c) granted a visa.</para></quote><para>The amendment calls for a further exemption to immigration detention if a person is `(d) released in accordance with section 198'. Section 198 is the removal power. Section 196 already provides for release from immigration detention in these circumstances. They also propose to amend the bill to create a section 197D in relation to unaccompanied minors. That amendment deals with unaccompanied minors, of whom the minister is the guardian, and would require the minister to release them from immigration detention. The minister in this instance would have no discretion as to appropriate welfare arrangements for these children, and it is really important that their welfare considerations be brought into this. They would effectively be barred from consideration for placement in, for example, the Woomera Residential Housing Project, where a close female relative would be caring for them.</para><para>Also, amendment 197D is very inconsistent with the framework of the Migration Actâthe very act that Labor introduced in 1994. In the act, every non-citizen in mainland Australia must be lawful or held in immigration detention until they are removed or granted a visa. The proposed amendment does not indicate that unaccompanied minors are to be granted a visa, nor when such arrangements are to commence or cease. Within the current legislative framework, the government is already able to make appropriate care arrangements for unaccompanied minors. This amendment is unnecessary. All it does is make the system much more inflexible.</para><para>I want to talk about the programs that currently exist. The opposition has talked frequently about placing women and children in alternative arrangements, and that is something that this government has been doing for a very long time. There is no doubt that, after a period of unprecedented boat arrivals in 1999 and 2000, there was a huge and unexpected increase in minors arriving in Australia. The focus of this government's policy has been not only on meeting the day-to-day needs of those minorsâtheir basic needs, such as accommodation, nutritious food, physical and mental health services, and educationâbut also on practical issues. There have been many cases of unaccompanied minors arriving here, and procedures for handling those arrivals have been improved. On 3 December 2002, the government formally announced that it would be in the best interests of unaccompanied minors that they be transferred to an alternative place of detention in the community or, if eligible, be released on a bridging visa as soon as possible after arriving at a detention centre. Until that occurs, it is essential that unaccompanied minors' needs be assessed and met. The minister is to be praised for the work he has been doing in this area. Long before the Woomera project was announced, many of my colleagues and I on the backbench committee spoke to him frequently about alternative projects for women and children, and I am glad to see that he has taken those up. </para><para>I would like to talk about the policies on unaccompanied minors in immigration detention centres. The government has worked very hard in this area developing a number of policies, and they have been operating since 11 January 2002. The comprehensive policy that was announced deals with the duty of care and the responsibility of detention centre providers and DIMIA managers to unaccompanied minors. It also looks at a whole range of welfare and care issues with unaccompanied minors. This particular policy looks at the transfer and reception of minors, individual management plans, mentoring from within the detainee community and such things as family tracing. It looks at their health and medical treatment, their visa application assistance and legal representation. It has also looked at recent allegations of abuse and neglect, as well as release from detention on bridging visas and alternative places of detention. The government has also been responsible for ensuring that the level of care and conditions be met in caring for unaccompanied minors. It also accepts the policy on unaccompanied minors and alternative places of detention et cetera.</para><para>I want speak about some of the very good arrangements that are in place, particularly at the Woomera Residential Housing Project. The minister announced that the government would expand the criteria for the eligibility of women and children who participated in the alternative detention arrangements. This means that women and children may now be eligible for participation in this project while their cases are being considered by the Refugee Review Tribunal or the courts, and that is a very good thing. In terms of places of detention for detainees with special needs, which includes women and children, within the framework of mandatory detention and the Migration Act the government has been doing some very good work in continuing to take innovative approaches to looking after women and children in detention centres. The minister recently released the formal guidelines and they are working well out there in the community.</para><para>In the Woomera project, women and children have volunteered to be considered for the alternative detention arrangements trial; they are living in a housing environment within the township. In March 2002, a report on the effectiveness of the trial was conducted and provided to the minister. It found that it was rather costly but that it had been a success. I was very pleased, as a member of that backbench committee and as chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, to see that that trial had been done in Woomera and that it was operating well. The minister has also looked at extending the alternative detention arrangements for women and children, and community consultation will take place in Woomera concerning the expansion of that housing project. He has also spoken to the South Australian government about options for the development of a residential housing project in Port Augusta or Whyalla, and community consultations will take place if agreement in principle is achieved with Premier Rann. It is good to see that those things are happening. The minister is to be applauded for the work he has done on these housing projects, and I am very pleased to see that there is a good possibility that they will be extended.</para><para>I know the opposition speak about keeping family units intact, but at the moment I think it would be very difficult to look at the inclusion of fathers in this particular program for security reasons and the increased risk that families would abscond. There is a very real risk of that and there is also the possibility that it would be inappropriate culturally, amongst some detainees, for men to be detained in a residential environment along with unrelated women. It is an issue that really needs to be considered. It is really good to see that some state governments are doing their bit in ensuring that children in detention centres are able to take part in educationâbut some state governments, unfortunately, are not. It is good to see that a number of children are attending government schools in the community. The minister has had a very active involvement, particularly with the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, to ensure that detainee children are able to attend public schools. That is a terrific thing. For many of those detainee children, access to schools in the community will be very beneficial. On 21 November 2002, there were approximately 139 children in detention and 100 of them were of school age. Forty-nine are currently attending government or non-government schools in the community, and that is a good very thing indeed. </para><para>There are states that have been less than cooperative and they have been doing everything they can to ensure that this does not occur. I note that the minister has been working very closely with the South Australian government. It was hoped that they would be cooperative and that some sort of arrangement or memorandum of understanding would take place. But, sadly, the Premier's decision is a great disappointment for those children in the Baxter complex. I have to applaud the minister's work. It is important to note that a number of detainee children are in mainstream schools; it is not a new development for this government. The opposition claim it is something new that they have thought up, but this has been going on since 1998. Some primary school age children have been at Maribyrnong as early as 1998. Some have been attending Catholic schools under local arrangements for detainee children from Curtin detention centre from as early as February 2001. That number increased to 13 children prior to Curtin's closure. Most of the detainee children at Port Hedland commenced at the local Catholic school in April this year. Twelve unaccompanied minors in alternative places of detention, under the care of the South Australian Department of Human Services, attend schools in the community in Adelaide. That is a very good thing to see.</para><para>The amendments the opposition are putting up are likely to increase litigation not decrease it, as people will seek to establish that they are unaccompanied minors to enable their mandatory release from detention centres, especially in circumstances where they arrive without documentation. There are many cases where we have had that happen recently. There also does not seem to be a mechanism that will ensure that the child agrees to the placement or that their best interests are considered. There are also legal obligations: to place them in foster care, without qualification, would be inconsistent with the government's obligation to certain unaccompanied minors. The minister would be held increasingly liable for any harm that would occur to a child who was released under section 197D. Again, this relates to the issue of increased litigation. There are also health and security risks. Some of the opposition's policies, particularly regarding their 90-day rules, would be impossible to implement in terms of health checks which are comprehensive and can take a considerable amount of time. Many cases are currently being held up in tribunals because of the difficulty of making sure that we have adequate health checks.</para><para>Under this proposed amendment, there is also no clear authority to supervise the removal of children from Australia. Under the proposed amendment to section 197E, there would be a requirement that all family members be accommodated with the child in the same conditions as apply to the Woomera residential project. This would considerably reduce the flexibility under the current legislative framework to address the specific needs of detainees. The government has used a variety of different alternative detention arrangements to tailor the needs of individual families and of individuals, but what the opposition is proposing would introduce a `one size fits all' approach. Clearly, there are families with different circumstances and different needs, and so that would not serve their purposes at all. The proposed amendment to section 197E would become a pull factor by encouraging adults to bring children with them when considering unlawfully entering Australia. The proposed amendment also assumes that the risk of absconding from low-security detention arrangements is the same for all families, whatever their circumstances.</para><para>There are some other problems with the proposed amendment. It does not take into account the practical limitations and the high cost of such arrangements if they are to be implemented in Australian cities, nor does it take into account that sufficient appropriate accommodation would be very difficult to identify and find. There would be no distinction between short-term compliance places, many of which are in cities, and longer-term detainees. So there are a number of factors that the opposition really does need to consider and there are a lot of ambiguities. It is also not clear which family members the opposition wants this to extend to. Are the opposition talking about immediate family members? Are the opposition talking about extended family members? That really needs to be considered. I support the government's approach. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>10302</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> and the manner in which it impacts specifically on special purpose visas and the maritime industry. In doing so, I take this opportunity to expose the Howard government's blatant favouritism for foreign ships off our coast and the impact that has on the employment of Australians. Special purpose visas are issued to seafarers on foreign vessels engaged in international voyages. Given the global nature of the trade, that is understood and accepted because this visa type is a practical mechanism to accommodate the international workplace and the movement of seafarers. I argue very rigorously that the original intent of these visas is being subverted to meet the Howard government's short-sighted, ideologically based approach to Australia's shipping policy. The truth of the matter isâand the industry knows this on both the employers' and the workers' sideâthat the Howard government has a strong preference for foreign ships and foreign workers, to the detriment of Australian workers and their families and to the detriment of our domestic transport task.</para></talk.start><para>As the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister calls it, this shipping policy is supposedly aimed at liberalising the coastal trade. I argue that it is more aimed at destroying Australian jobs and training opportunities and, in doing so, propping up foreign shipping companies and the unfair competitive advantage given to them by a range of tax measures and the substandard wages and conditions of employment imposed by the operators of these foreign shipping vessels. This is simply a code for a commitment to reduce shipping costs by giving foreign shipping operators major concessions not enjoyed by the Australian shipping industry and not enjoyed by Australian workers and their families. Put simply, the government is misusing a range of legislative instruments as part of this liberalisation strategy. </para><para>The cabotage provisions of the Navigation Act are, without a doubt, being bypassed through the useâor, more correctly, the misuseâof single voyage and continuing voyage permits. As everybody in the shipping industry knows, these permits are historically intended to be used when no Australian ship is available. But that test is loose. It is about integrity and honesty in the application of the historic principle that applied to the issue of single voyage and continuous voyage permitsâwell-founded and understood principles which have been largely ignored by the Howard government since the 1996 election. This is not my view only: more importantly, independent statistics bear this out beyond any doubt. </para><para>Let us take a few examples of those statistics. Let us place the facts before the House. In 1995-96, 421 single voyage permits were issued. Alternatively, in 1997-98, with a change of government, under the Howard government the number of single voyage permits jumped from 421 to 779. Clearly, this was a policy decision pursued by the Howard government which was aimed at making sure that foreign vesselsâwith major tax concessions granted by foreign governments, exploiting ordinary seafarers who pursue an international employment opportunityâwere being brought in to undermine Australian shipping companies and destroy Australian jobs. As far as I am concerned, that is un-Australian and the Howard government stands condemned.</para><para>I also know for a fact that there are serious concerns about the manner in which some of these visas are being issued within the department of immigration. It raises serious issues about failures by the Howard government, under the guise of shipping policy, to pay adequate attention to the all-important issue of checking character, especially in the context of the current major fears about international terrorism. </para><para>Let us move on. We have difficulties not only with single voyage permits but also with what are known as continuing voyage permits. What do the facts show? Prior to 1996 not one continuous voyage permit was issued. In 1999-2000 this jumped to 73 permits. These continuing voyage permits are issued and re-issued for periods of six months. It gets worseâthe figures continue to rise. Total cargo moved under single and continuing voyage permits rose by 32 per cent in the year 2000-01. I know, from talking to operators in the transport industry, including the road and rail sectors, that not only is this government policy denying Australian seafarers opportunities for employment; it is undermining employment in the road and rail sectors of the Australian land transport industry. So the policy in terms of employment and all the opportunities that are associated with that, to the great advantage of Australia, has been reduced by the Howard government to one aimed at destroying the Australian shipping industry and the livelihood of workers who have pursued work in that industry for many years, many of whom also operate in regional Australia in land and rail transport.</para><para>The operators of these vessels are using the permit system to bypass the requirement to be a licensed ship to operate in the coastal trade in Australia. Let us put it fairly and squarely. This bypassing of security and responsibility in the context of the current major debate about terrorism and so-called border protection is being engineered by the Howard government for vested interests, not in the national interest. The responsibility of this parliament is always to front up to the issue of what is in the nation's best interests.</para><para>This takes me to the second critical area. Legislative instruments are being misused and manipulated to suit the Howard shipping policy with respect to immigration law, which is central to the debate before the House this afternoon in the form of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. When we come to the issue of migration law, most members on this side of the House understand the importance of character checks and health checks, but for the Howard government the importance of those issues does not extend to its shipping policy. That is a shame, as the shadow minister for immigration and multicultural affairs says. Time and again we see ministers, from the Prime Minister down, stand at the dispatch box and give lectures to the Australian community about the importance of maintaining the integrity of the immigration system in Australiaâan orderly process supposedly in the nation's best interests. Why do the nation's best interests not extend to shipping policy in Australia under the Howard government? </para><para>The special purpose visa provisions are being misusedâand everyone knows it, including the department of immigration, which unfortunately is not able to stand up to the department of transportâbecause of the desire by the government to prop up the non-performing minister for transport. Change should occur with respect to the issuing of these visas to foreign crews and foreign ships coming into Australia. I encourage the minister for immigration to take a stand on these issues, because he is prepared to consider change aimed at maintaining the security of the migration system in Australia. There is one fundamental flaw in that system when it goes to the operation of the shipping industry in Australia. Foreign crews do not need to make an application for a special purpose visa, and there is no department record of who they are issued to. We are supposedly so vitally concerned about character and health checks that to get a special purpose visa a foreign crew member merely has to beâsurprise, surprise!âon the crew list. This crew list is far more important than a mere list of speakers in a House debate. This crew list of people coming to Australia without proper character checks throws up serious questions about the integrity of the migration system in Australia and, far more importantly at this point, about whether we are bringing in terrorists from overseas who can do damage to Australia's national interests. In this regard I quote an answer to a question on notice from the member for Stirling. In this answer the minister for immigration advised as follows:.  </para><quote><para>Provided a crew member is on the crew list of a ship engaged in commercial trade or carriage of passengers that enters Australia at a proclaimed port, the crew member will be taken to hold a Special Purpose Visa.</para></quote><para>I should clarify at this point that a special purpose visa gives the holder full access to Australia through that port, through that point of entry. They are free to leave the vessel and they are free to move around in the Australian community. The minister has also advised that crew lists are transmitted to the Australian Customs Service, which supposedly undertakes checking against Customs and DIMIA alert lists.</para><para>For the right reasons, because it is in Australia's national interests, the opposition clearly and squarely has strong reservations about that advice. There are serious questions about the checking processes, or the lack of adequate checking processes, for these crew lists. If we are genuinely concerned about taking on the international fight against terrorism and also maintaining our borders, it is about time that this glaring difficulty in the Australian system is fronted up to by the Howard government. National interests must always come before the ideological short-term views of the Howard government in its approach to shipping policy in Australia. Everyone out there knows that the procedures are so open that you could drive a truck through them. The Howard government talks tough on border security when there is an election but will not address obvious flaws, problems and weaknesses, because it does not suit its policy to favour foreign ship operators.</para><para>Special purpose visas do not attract a charge. Every other visa category issued has a charge attached but not special purpose visas, because they are a special deal to back up the shipping industry, which is what special purpose visas are about. Special purpose visas are not evidenced as most other visas are and holders are subject to streamlined immigration clearance procedures. A non-citizen can hold a special purpose visa and another substantive visa at the same time. Interestingly, this is not possible with any other visa category. The immigration laws are being undermined to prop up a shipping policy that favours foreign operators over Australian shipping companies and workers. It is not a level playing field.</para><para>Foreign seafarers are not subject to all the normal migration processes that apply to other people working in Australia. If a non-citizen wants to come to Australia to work in another domestic industry, such as farming, they must apply for a work visa. The fundamental tests that are applied relate to the skills shortage list: no Australian worker should be available to fill the position; wages and conditions must be in line with the awards system; the applicant must have English language skills; and the employer must undertake training. These tests are part and parcel of bringing in overseas workers, under the right conditions, to be employed in Australia. These are the tests that apply to other industries: why not the Australian shipping industry?</para><para>In essence, this is a government that talks tough on border protection but is not acting on maritime security or in Australia's national interests. The risks associated with the situation are realâlet us not kid ourselves. In the past three years alone, 177 foreign crew jumped ship in Australia, and the Howard government suggests it is not a problem. Where is the action to stop that in a determined way and close that gaping hole in our border? Over one month ago, the United States' houses of parliament endorsed far-reaching new maritime security provisions, but the Howard government again has sat idle. This is a bit like its lack of attention over the last 12 months to aviation security, but I suppose the announcements of yesterday are better late than never. As I said, we have had the same problem on aviation and airport security. I remind the House that the Audit Office sent a warning shot in respect of aviation security back in 1998. Only yesterday the government acted. Border protection is something you talk about when you are in a little bit of political strife; it is not something you do in the nation's best interests.</para><para>The bill before us provides an opportunity to clamp down on special purpose visas in the interests of Australian security, but it has not happened. The government has no credibility on maritime security and the bill confirms that. Instead we have a government that approaches maritime security not on the basis of what is in the nation's best interests but on the basis of an ideological class war, because it is blinded by ideology. When I raised the issue of ship jumpers in the House earlier this week, what was the response from the minister? Not to say, `I'll examine that problem and do something', but merely to resort, as he always does, to union bashing. It is a disgrace. It is time the Howard government stopped tolerating lax immigration laws to prop up a campaign for cheaper shipping costs at the expense of Australian workers and their families. </para><para>In conclusion, I strongly support the amendment to be moved by the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Lalor, with regard to taking children and families out from behind the razor wire. The Leader of the Opposition took the lead on this matter in his Australia Day speech this year. The shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition are to be congratulated for taking tough decisions based on our national interests by way of the amendment to be moved by the member for Lalor today. I call on the government to take the same approach to maritime security. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>10305</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in the House today to speak on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. This is a very important bill, as throughout our history migrants have contributed to the success of this nation. I note that the member for Ryan mentioned his migrant background, and I would certainly like to commend him on the contribution that he has made to our country, both before entering politics and as a member of the coalition government.</para></talk.start><para>Our migrants have provided a wealth of skills and have created the cultural diversity which we enjoy today. Our migrants have been engineers, builders, chefs, teachers, doctors and farmers. They have contributed to all areas of our society. This government have maintained a balanced migration policy under the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The government balance the need for a skilled migration program, a family reunion program and a compassionate immigration program for purposes such as refugee intake.</para><para>The government have taken a firm stance on the issue of illegal immigration, and certainly this government have championed the cause for those people who seek to come to this country legally. They have certainly worked very hard to ensure that those who seek to come to this country legally are not disadvantaged at the hands of those who seek to come to the country illegallyâthose who seek to jump the queue and overtake people who have been waiting for quite some time for the opportunity to come to this wonderful country.</para><para>The government have upheld our sovereign right to determine who comes to this country and under what conditions. That is something that has attracted the overwhelming support of the people of Australia. Certainly at the last election they showed at the ballot box their overwhelming endorsement for the current stance of this government: for the idea that people who come to this country legally should have precedence over those who seek to come to the country illegally, and for the idea that this country should have the right to choose who comes to join us and work in this very fine land.</para><para>The opposition, by contrast, have flip-flopped repeatedly. They flip and they flopâwe never seem to know where they are coming from. They are jumping from one place to another and it is very uncertain, very hard to pin them downâuntil recently, when something really amazing happened. After a year in opposition they released a policy. Out of that policy void that is the ALP, finally something appeared. Very interesting indeed. They finally released a policy. But what does this policy do? What is the actual effect of this policy? It weakens our stance on people-smuggling. It sends a signal that Australia is going to be open for business and that it is going to be a destination for people smugglers again, under the ALP. It sends a signal that a Labor government would unwind the current government's firm but effective stance on illegal immigration. </para><para>We all know that the member for Fremantle does not support the current policy as espoused by the opposition, and we are not sure about the member for Grayndler. It is a bit of a case of `We heard what he said but we did not know what he meant'. It is a bit unclear where he stands. The very strong and united stance of this government is a stark contrast to the disunity and uncertainty of the opposition. I am sure there are plenty of members opposite who do not support the policy that has been recently released, yet we just do not hear from them. They have been silent, but there is certainly a great degree of uncertainty.</para><para>The bill currently before the House makes certain amendments to the Migration Act 1958. The purpose of these amendments is to improve the integrity of the act and to ensure that the act operates as intended. The bill aims to clarify certain visa related matters, to create a deputy principal member position on the Migration Review Tribunal, to remove ambiguity surrounding certain offence provisions and to correct certain technical errors in the act. I would like to consider several of the schedules within the bill at this point.</para><para>Schedule 1 to the bill amends the act to clarify the immigration status of non-citizen children born in Australia. Despite what the opposition might say, the interests of children are of paramount importance to Minister Ruddock; and my National Party colleague Larry Anthony, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is very interested in the welfare of children. Schedule 1 gives effect to that concern. Under the proposed changes, these children are taken to have entered Australia at birth. The schedule expressly provides that these non-citizen children are immigration cleared for the purposes of their entry at birth.</para><para>It is important to clarify this status, because it has significant implications for a person's entitlements under the Migration Act with regard to their ability to access bridging visas. Under the act, the usual way a visa holder must enter Australia is through a port or on a pre-cleared flight, but obviously the act does not take into account the possibility of people entering Australia by virtue of birth. Schedule 1 puts beyond doubt that any visas taken to have been granted to non-citizen children at birth do not cease to be in effect because of the way these children entered Australia.</para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill addresses issues which arose in the Tutugri case, which was heard in the Federal Court. The amendments to schedule 2 clearly authorise the taking of security for compliance with conditions to be imposed on a visa before a visa is granted. Schedule 3 of the bill makes two amendments to the act relating to special purpose visas. The first amendment deals with the cessation of a special purpose visa where the minister has made a declaration that it is undesirable for a person to travel to, enter or remain in Australia. The amendment will allow the minister to specify a time when such a declaration is to take effect. The second amendment in schedule 3 to the bill puts it beyond doubt that the rules of natural justice do not apply to making such a declaration by the minister. </para><para>Schedule 4 to the bill creates a deputy principal member position on the Migration Review Tribunal. Schedule 5 to the bill ensures that certain offence provisions in the act operate as they did prior to the commencement of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.</para><para>Schedule 6 to the bill makes several amendments to the act. These amendments, firstly, will prevent non-citizens from evading the intended operation of section 48 by travelling overseas on a bridging visa. Subsection 48(1) of the Migration Act provides that a non-citizen who does not hold a substantive visa and who, after last entering Australia, was refused a visa may only apply for a prescribed class of visa. Currently, a non-citizen who leaves and re-enters Australia on a bridging visa is able to circumvent this bar on subsequent visa applications because, on re-entering Australia, he or she has not had a visa refused after last entering Australia. It should be noted that it was never intended that these bridging visa holders would not be subject to the section 48 bar.</para><para>Secondly, schedule 6 to the bill amends the act to clarify that a non-citizen's bridging visa ceases to be in effect the moment his or her substantive visa is cancelled. Schedule 6 to the bill also amends the act to allow a time limit to be imposed on a non-citizen in immigration clearance seeking revocation of an automatic cancellation of his or her student visa. Schedule 6 also clarifies that the decision not to revoke the automatic cancellation of a non-citizen's student visa that is made while a person is in immigration clearance is not merits reviewable. </para><para>I would like to spend a moment talking about the opposition's proposed amendments. I am pleased to note that the opposition has generally supported the bill in its current form. However, I have some difficulty with the opposition's amendments. The degree of support that these amendments have from the opposition seems a bit uncertain. The opposition's position seems a bit unclear: some members are supporting it, but we are not so sure of the position of others, such as the member for Fremantle. The proposed amendments, as I understand them, would cause some considerable complexity with administration of the overall system; they would certainly, I believe, result in increased litigation. After observing the length of time taken with and the great expense to the community of longwinded litigation for asylum seekers, many of whomâin fact, most of whom, it seemsâultimately have their right to stay in Australia revoked, it seems rather peculiar that we would be seeking to make this system more complex rather than simpler and easier to administer.</para><para>In summary, I believe that this bill is a good bill. It will enhance the effectiveness of our immigration legislation. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>10307</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are here today debating the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. The length of time this bill has actually taken to make it onto the agenda is curious. This bill was first discussed many months ago. I have been waiting for it to come up for debate again because I have been very eager to hear the shadow minister for immigration introduce the amendments, which she has foreshadowed, about getting children out of detention. It is quite plain that the delay associated with this bill has been due to these very amendments that the shadow minister has foreshadowed.</para></talk.start><para>The government has serious problems in its own ranks with keeping people in line on this issue of children in detention. We saw last week some very moderate announcementsâI think rather pathetic announcementsâabout the changes that the government proposes to make in the area of children in detention. The reason for even these puny changes having been made is that the Prime Minister has found it very hard to keep some of his more compassionate members in line on this issue. We have all heard reports in the media and in the corridors here of people telling the Prime Minister that, if the shadow minister's recommendation that children should be taken out of detention were put, they would be forced to cross the floor and vote for that. That has delayed this legislation and has forced the Prime Minister to act in the small way in which he has, saying that from now on unaccompanied children will not be locked up in desert detention centres and that women and children will be facilitated out of detention centres.</para><para>While of course anything is welcome in this area, these measures are incredibly disappointing. I know that those in the Liberal Party who worked for so long to get these small changes were really arguing for a lot more. I presume that they will continue to agitate within the government for greater change because these measures are manifestly inadequate. Certainly, it is important that any unaccompanied children arriving from now on not be held indefinitely in detention centres, as they have been up till now. But we are not seeing a lot of new arrivals at the moment. We still have kids locked up in detention centres, though, and we have to deal with those kids, many of whom have been in detention for many months now. The other part of the policy that is inadequate is that families who have made the traumatic journey to Australia do not deserve to be separated; they deserve to be able to live as a family unit. Indeed, our policy released last week allows family units to stay togetherâand that is a very important measure.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, our policy is that any unaccompanied children under 14 be placed in the care of foster families as soon as their health checks are complete, and unaccompanied youths between 14 and 18 be released into appropriate community care as soon as their health checks are complete. Unaccompanied children have been a real focus of community concern, and rightly so. The stories about the sorts of psychological and emotional trauma that these children have gone through and the effect that it is having on them have been harrowing. There have been accounts in newspapers about such things as adolescent girls becoming incontinent due to the stress of being in detention while perhaps also caring for younger siblings, and children witnessing others self-harming and, in some cases, harming themselves. All these stories are particularly affecting when we remember that unaccompanied children do not even have their parents to explain to them what is going on, why they are in detention. </para><para>There is of course a real contradiction in the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs being responsible for keeping these kids locked up and also being their legal guardian. You have to ask yourself about the ability and the sincerity of a guardian who thinks it is okay to keep kids locked up in Woomera and also thinks it is okay to have kids, unaccompanied minors, on Manus Island and Nauru, for example. The latest figures I have indicate that there are 38 children on Manus Island and 149 children on Nauru as at October this year, and that about 30 of those were unaccompanied minors. Children living in the harsh environment on Manus Island and Nauru is a horrifying thought. It is horrifying to think that there any children living there at all, but to think of unaccompanied minors living there, trying to eke out an existence for themselves, is really very disturbing. Labor have said that those unaccompanied minors would not be detained. To avoid that conflict of interest I mentioned, we have also said that the children's commissioner we are proposing would be the legal guardian of unaccompanied children. </para><para>The other thing that I think has been very warmly welcomed in Labor's policy is that high-security detention will be used only very briefly on arrival, and that high-security detention for family groups will not be in the desert hellholes at other camps that we hear about. We are talking about detention facilities based on the alternative detention trial at Woomera where families will be able to live in ordinary homes that will be secured at the perimeter and have security presence. </para><para>Children living in those homes will be able to go to school. I think that that is a very important step forward. We know that in some of the detention centres very few of the children are going to school. In fact, even where they have been allowed to go to school, it has often been discouraged by guards who have told children and parents that their children will face racism if they go to the local schools. </para><para>The ability for families to cook their own meals, to have some privacy and to have as normal a family life as possible is vital in keeping these children in the best possible condition psychologically and emotionally. Some of the reports that have come out of the detention centres where ACM has been very strict about things like mealtimes might not seem a lot to a casual observer. However, anyone who has young children knows that they do not eat at set meal times and that they want snacks between meals. And if you are breastfeeding, you cannot eat once at seven o'clock in the morning and not again till lunchtime, then have dinner at five o'clock and have nothing else until seven o'clock again the next morning. You have to eat small, regular meals to keep your milk supply up. This has meant that breastfeedingâwhich is so important for the health of children and vital in an environment where there are other physical strains on children, particularly on young babies, such as the heat in some of these detention centresâhas been discouraged because breastfeeding mothers simply cannot get the calories required to produce breast milk. They are not able to have the regular meals that they need to keep their supply up.</para><para>Living in an alternative detention style of accommodation where people have control over their own meal times and what they cook and eat is a very important step in maintaining the health of children. It also provides a more home-like environment in which the detention period can be a lot less stressful. Of course, Labor are talking about making the detention very short whenever we can.  </para><para>Children being able to attend the local schools is also very important. Our experience is that the vast majority of people who arrive in Australia in this manner are found to have general claims to refuge. That means that we want to start to make good Australian citizens of these people as soon as we possibly can. That cannot happen without help to learn English. It cannot happen without children being able to go to local schools. It cannot happen without their parents being able to find work as quickly as possible. We have made suggestions that will facilitate all of these things. </para><para>I know that there are many students in my electorate who have watched reports on television of children in detention and have read about them in the newspapers. In particular, students at Newtown Primary School have been speaking to me not just this year but also last year about this very issue: how can they encourage the government to make a difference and allow these children to live in the community? They were very concerned about one of their classmates whose family were temporary protection visa holders in regard to the fees that these children were forced to pay to attend the local public school. I was very impressed by the welcoming attitude of the students, the warmth they showed these kids and the support they wanted to show for their cause. I always think that if adults paid a little bit more attention to how children treated each other in these circumstances, we would probably live in a kinder and gentler world. The benefit that children experience from going into a school environment like that is absolutely incomparable. </para><para>I mentioned earlier the latest figures I had for the number of children in detention on Manus Island and Nauru. In October 2002, a total of 309 children were in detention in Australia. Anyone who has examined this issue would know that those children are suffering to a greater or lesser extent and that the detention environment is not appropriate for them. On Monday, I received a petition from more than 8,500 citizens calling for children to be released from detention. These members of the community have been following this issue and as concerned Australiansâsome of them parents, some of them notâthey want to send a message to the government that children should not be in detention. Some of the reasons are very apparent when we look at the sort of evidence that came out of the Senate inquiry and has come out through the media. There does not seem to be any quality management strategy for immigration detention centres. It is common in other areas like aged care, disability services and family services to put a quality management strategy in place. There seems to be no evidence of that in detention centres.</para><para>ACM repeatedly fails to deliver on the contract they have signed with the government. For example, they contract to ensure that children receive an education and people receive adequate nutrition, and to provide a safe environment. In all of these areas, ACM have repeatedly failed to meet their obligations. Yet we have a government that is getting ready to call for tenders for the management of detention facilities in Australia. ACM, of course, will retender to provide those services. Having failed to meet even the low standards included in the contract this time around, I am at an absolute loss as to how ACM intend to meet what the minister says are going to be higher standards in the next contract round. They have not met the standards that exist now; yet we are saying that in our warmer and fuzzier approach next time, they are somehow going to meet those standards. It beggars belief.</para><para>Centres should be returned to public management. Labor have said we will do that on returning to government. There needs to be public scrutiny of what is happening in these places. I do not understand, when we are dealing with traumatised people who have made a long and dangerous journey here, why the government does not contract the management of detention centres outâif it must contract them outâto a community services organisation that can just pay some other organisation to provide the security services? We seem to put the emphasis on jailing people and, as a second thought, think about how we are going to feed them, care for them, teach their children and provide all of the human services necessary. Why don't we think first about looking after the people for whom we are responsible once they arrive here? No matter what we think about the way they arrivedâwe have heard many people from the government talk about `queue jumpers' and all the other pejoratives that they useâwe are responsible for their welfare, particularly in the case of children. Why don't we provide for that welfare and think secondarily about the security, instead of placing that at the centre of how we deal with asylum seekers? </para><para>Every few months, there is a story about a child who has been physically or sexually abused in one of these centres. We know that it happens. We know that it has been happening for years. What do we do about it? The minister for immigration is the legal guardian of these children. Yet we had the case on 18 January 2002 where a five-year-old boy detainee in Curtin was allegedly raped by three other detainees. The local doctor was allowed to delay medical examination of the boy for up to a week and the local police apparently said the five-year-old boy had instigated sex with three adult detainees. This is horrifying. What were the outcomes of the obviously unsatisfactory finding by the police? Did DIMIA castigate the police and question their investigation of the case? Did DIMIA contact the officers who investigated the case? We do not know. These centres are managed in a way that is so secretive and so inadequate that questions like this arise constantly. The welfare of the children, whom we as a community are responsible for, is being left in the hands of people who obviously are inadequately policing the standards that they have agreed to.</para><para>To conclude, if we accept, as a community, that it is our responsibility to care for children while they are being held in detention, it stuns me that we do not provide even such basic health care as immunisation. The reason that we do not immunise them is because of the cost involved. We are talking about a very small cost to the Australian health budget. Instead of accepting that many of these children will be accepted into Australia as genuine refugees and starting off their health care immediately, we delay it until the last possible moment, hoping that we can get away with not even providing basic health care.</para><para>The constant reports of the psychological damage being done to children in detention are disturbing. It is even more disturbing to think that we are not providing the sort of care that they need. Even if the government decides to keep them incarcerated, do we not have a responsibility to start to deal with the damage that we are inflicting on these children? No, there is no measure, ability or desire to do that.</para><para>The child protection services in Western Australia found that there are proven cases of maltreatment in centres. What has the minister done to begin to address these problems? If we know that these children have been abused or neglected in detention centres, what are we doing to stop that happening in the future? Is it going to be written into the new contracts that are being negotiated at the moment? We have no information about this. The contracting out means that all of this is enveloped in commercial-in-confidence claims. Thus, I am very pleased that the shadow minister will later have the opportunity to move a substantive amendment to this legislation for getting children out from behind the razor wire. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>10310</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> bill is a non-controversial omnibus bill and, as a consequence, Labor are quite happy to support it. But we are moving a very substantial amendment relating to children in detention. The amendmentâto be moved by the shadow minister for immigration and population, the member for Lalorâwould modify the legal power to detain asylum seekers so that children are not held in high-security detention for long periods of time. The amendment would ensure that unaccompanied children are placed in foster or community care arrangements and that families with children will be allowed to live in accommodation like the Woomera alternative detention trial after meeting certain criteria. This amendment is designed to meet the needs of children without endangering the health and security of Australians.  </para></talk.start><para>The amendment was foreshadowed by the shadow immigration minister with members of the government. A number of those members, to their credit, saw great merit in this amendment, to the extent that they expressed grave concerns about any proposition from the government in the party room that it oppose the amendment. As a consequence, the government has been forced to move some small way, and it made an announcement to that effect just the other day. But it is truly sad that the government responded to this amendment not on the basis of any sense of responsibility for children in detention, not on any humanitarian basis, but because it was worried that members of the government might cross the floor. </para><para>It would not be the first time government members crossed the floor. I would encourage those members who are contemplating crossing the floor to do so. The trend was set in 1988 by the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, who crossed the floor when a motion was put in this parliament reaffirming bipartisan support for the end of the White Australia Policy and an immigration policy that did not discriminate on race. The Prime Minister, who was then in opposition, voted against that motion, but the current minister for immigration could not bring himself to vote against such a decent motion and therefore crossed the floor and voted with Labor. He was joined by Mr Ian McPhee, the then member for Goldstein, whoâfor his commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy, to the end of the White Australia Policy and to accolades in the motion that were poured on the Holt government for getting rid of the White Australia Policyâgot his comeuppance and was disendorsed. He was replaced by the current member for Goldstein from the far right of the Liberal Party, as the so-called wets were cleansed from the Liberal Partyâparticularly those who voted with Labor in support of an immigration policy that did not discriminate on the basis of race. Others to cross the floor were Steele Hall from South Australia and Peter Baume. Ian Wilson, I am reliably informed, abstained on that day. The point I am making is that on immigration issues, when it comes to decency and to displays of humanitarianism, members of the Liberal Party have crossed the floor and joined Labor. I would urge that they do that again here in consideration of the amendment that the member for Lalor will be moving. </para><para>Who could seriously argue that there is anything other than decency associated with the idea of getting unaccompanied children out of detention? This is the most reasonable, decent amendment that you could imagine in this parliament. Yet we face the spectre of dozens and dozens of government members voting against it. On this occasion I would like to see a true display of bipartisanship such that we did not even need a division, such that everyone on the government side agreed with the position that we will be putting in respect of that amendment. Alas, I fear that that will not be the case; I fear that we will be confronted with the situation where dozens of government members will be voting against an amendment that gets unaccompanied children out from behind the razor wire. </para><para>As we head into Christmas, I hope they contemplate the consequences of doing thatâof voting against an amendment that gives new hope to young children locked up behind the razor wire in detention centres in this country. Why wouldn't you support that sort of motion? We will soon find out. I do urge all members to have a look at the debate in 1998, to recognise that it is possible, that the responsible thing for members of the Liberal Party to do is to cross the floor when a question of basic decency is put in this parliament. That question of basic decency will be put in this parliament in this debate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>âI have waited a long timeâ</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âMinister!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>âIn 30 years I have never seen one of you cross the floor. </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe minister is defying the chair. </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>âI will be looking forward to the immigration minister crossing the floor with us, but I will take my own advice: I will not be holding my breath.

They have a six-level system for threat assessment. In the case of the British, they were at the third level of their six levels.

On 28 September 2001, the Australian threat assessment for Indonesia was increased to `high' for threats against Australian interests in Indonesia. This is the highest level in Australia's four-level system. The point I make here is that the British make judgments about British interests, not Australian interests. We do not make judgments about British interests, we make judgments about Australian interests. Britain had their threat assessment at the third level; we had our threat assessment at the highest level. So it is clear that our judgments, in particular our intelligence community's judgments, of the threat level against Australians was substantially higher than the judgments the British made.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>âI am talking about the threat assessments, not the travel advisories.

Even the Leader of the Opposition is able to work that out.

I am advised that, of these, 81 died in Bali, six died in Australia and one died in Singapore. Given the horrific nature of the explosion and the terrible injuries and disfigurement inflicted upon so many of the victims and the expectations at the time, it is truly remarkable that all of the victims have now been identified. It speaks volumes for the work of the forensic people, the doctors, the dentists and the officers of the Australian Federal Police as well as their colleagues in the medical profession and the police in Indonesia. </para></talk.start><para>When you have lost so much, the relative comfort of being able to identify your loved one is very important. The fact that all of these victims have been identified will be of immense comfort and reassurance to so many of our fellow Australians. I therefore take the opportunity of recording on behalf of all members of the House our gratitude to those Australians who worked so well to achieve this outcome. I am pleased to say that many of them are remaining in Indonesia to help identify the non-Australian victims of the atrocity who are yet to be identified. They will continue to work in conjunction with the Indonesian authorities to identify the remaining non-Australian victims.</para><para>I also take the opportunity of congratulating the Indonesian police on the excellent progress that has been made so far in apprehending and bringing to justice those who, in the words of the foreign minister, knew when this terrible event was to occur. The cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police has been quite remarkable. I record the gratitude of Australians to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty, and his officers, particularly Mr Graham Ashton, who has been the head of the police contingent in Bali, and through them to the men and women of the Australian Federal Police. It is a great tribute to their professionalism. The arrangement for that cooperation was put in place two days after 12 October as a result of the visit to Jakarta by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Customs. Had it not been for that arrangement being put in place so speedily, perhaps the outcome would have been different.</para><para>In the wake of this awful tragedy that con-tinues to haunt our country and continues to leave so many people saddened, grief-strick-en and traumatised, we can see aspects of superb professionalism and individual courage. Given the very stressful conditions in which people worked in that makeshift morgue, I say again that I am filled with admiration for those forensic people. I met a number of them, as did the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister, when we went to Bali five days after 12 October. Their dedication and persistence in the most stressful of all circumstances is quite remarkable. We can but again express our compassion, warmth and affection for our fellow Australians who have lost so much in this disaster and, amidst that, record our admiration for the superb professionalism, camaraderie and cooperation, which are hallmarks of an Australian response to an attack upon Australians and an attack upon the interests of this country. </para></answer><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>10315</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn indulgence, Mr Speaker, I join with the Prime Minister in extending my thanks for the fantastic effort that has been put in by all of those who have been involved with the thankless and horrendous task of identifying the remains of those Australians killed in Bali.

In addition to that, the Australian economy is suffering a very severe drought, with agricultural production falling 12.2 per cent in the September quarter alone. Notwithstanding that, the Australian non-farm economy has continued very strongly, with business investment, household consumption and rising incomes. The Secretary-General of the OECD, in talking of the Australian economy today, said this:</para><quote><para>âAustralia is one of the stars in the OECD galaxy,â he said. </para><para>âIt's evident that Australia has been able to be very resilient and responsive to downturns in the economy ...</para><para>âAnd even with the consequences of the drought this year, Australia will certainly be amongst the leaders.â </para></quote><para>The labour force figures were released today and, as I have said in the House on a number of occasions, they bounce around from month to month and we would be foolish to read too much into any monthly figures. But, notwithstanding a slight rise in the headline unemployment rate from six per cent to 6.1 per cent, the November figures showed strong employment growth. The overall rise in employment was due to a large increase in full-time employment, which for the month was up by 57,300 jobs. Again I say that it is foolish to read too much into one month's record but we can actually see that there were rises in employment in November and see that, notwithstanding the international economy and notwithstanding the drought, unemployment only rose to 6.1 per cent. There was strong jobs growth. These are the lowest unemployment ratesâas we have saidâsince Labor's recession in the early 1990s.</para><para>The OECD Secretary-General, Mr Johnston, also said that Australia should not rest on its laurels and should work on improving its unemployment rate. He suggested that labour market reform was still important. We would agree with that; labour market reform is still important. The point about these unemployment figures is that they could be lower than they are if Australia were able to engage in further labour market reform. And it is not because this government is resting on its laurels; this government is actively working on reforming Australia's labour markets.

I have not seen the letter myself, but I am sure a copy of it was made available to the paper; and that is fine, because I was able to get in advance a bit of an idea of what the Premier was going to say to me. The Premier has asked for the Commonwealth to provide more money for drought relief in Queensland. It is a fairly familiar request and a fairly familiar mantra from a number of premiers at this particular time.</para></talk.start><para>The drought is having a severe effect on many parts of Australia. In response to that the Commonwealth in different ways has now committed over $1 billion to dealing with the drought, including the recent additional package of measures totalling $368 million over three years. I am particularly interested in the call from the Premier of Queensland to provide some more money. I have had some research done and I am informed that, to date, the states of Australia have committed a total of about $60 million for drought relief.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government members</inline>âWhat, $60 million from all of them?</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âYes, $60 million from all of the states as against over $1 billion from the Commonwealth. It gets even more interesting when you analyse it on a state by state basis. In the case of Queensland, $6 million has been put into this year budget for drought relief. This is from the man who is saying to me, `Give us more money.' I say to him: `Why don't you give your Queensland electorate some more money. Premier Beattie, charity starts at home. Do something for Queenslanders instead of asking the Commonwealth, which has already been very supportive, to do even more.' While he has been given $6 million, the Commonwealth has already committed $20 million to the Darling Downs area of Queensland alone. So, for one area of Queensland, there is a commitment of $20 million from the Commonwealth, while for the whole of Queensland, only $6 million has been committed by the Queensland state government. Yet the Premier of Queensland has got the gall to write to me and say that the Commonwealth should be providing more money. For the whole state of Queensland, under all of our programsâand this does not include any notional distribution of the Farm Management Deposits scheme moneyâ$100 million is going to be available from the Commonwealth help to Queenslanders against $6 million from the Queensland government. </para></talk.start></continue><para>But he is not Robinson Crusoe. We go south of the border into eastern daylight saving time in New South Wales and what do we find? We find that the Premier of New South Wales has been pretty vocalâhe is on the air almost every night saying, `The Commonwealth should give more,' but he has put in place what could only be called a very tiny package. He has put in $16 million, only 28 of the 48 rural lands protection boards get any moneyâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>âWhy did it take so long?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âListen to this, Mr Speakerâthe Leader of the Opposition interjects, `Wait so long.' He must have known what I was about to say, because farmers in New South Wales have got to wait six months following a drought declaration before they get anything of nothing. That is fundamentally the policy that operates in New South Wales. The Commonwealth, under our commitments, will be spending $350 million for farmers in New South Wales, against $16 million from the New South Wales government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us journey further south into the great state of Victoria. After a lot of fanfare, the Premier of Victoria has produced a package of $27 million. That's good? That is $21 million more than the Premier of Queensland produced, so he ought to get a real pat on the back. By comparison, we expect to spend over $100 million in the state of Victoria.</para><para>Let us go across the Nullarbor. Let us go over to that great state of Western Australia, so well represented on this side of the House by some absolutely magnificent members. In Western Australia they announced a package for the whole of the state. You may well have thought it would be a big packageâit is a very big state. But what did they announce? It was $6.8 million. But listen to this: to be eligible, a farmer in Western Australia cannot have received any Commonwealth interest subsidies. In other words, they give nothing and then they penalise people for receiving any Commonwealth largesse. I think they should almost be taken to the High Court for that. I think it is a breach of the principle of federalism. I think it is outrageous. Fancy picking on somebody because they got some Commonwealth money. What are we going to spend in Western Australia? We were spending $30 million.</para><para>In South AustraliaâI do not want to leave South Australia out; the foreign minister will never speak to me again if I leave South Australia outâyou have a package of $5 million announced by the South Australian government. You know what we are going to be committing to South Australia on current estimates? Three times that amount: $15 million. I conclude by saying that I have rarely seen, in the 6Â½ years I have been Prime Minister, a grosser example of the hypocrisy of state governments and a refusal by state governments to accept their responsibilities. The Commonwealth has been generous; the Commonwealth has done the right thing. We feel for the farmers of Australia, we care about the farmers of Australia and we are willing to put the dollars of the Australian people in the pockets of farmers who need that help.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Water Management</title><page.no>10320</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>10320</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister.

Very significantly, as a result of the views put to me by the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party and by many Liberals and Nationals representing rural seats around Australiaâand not least in New South Walesâwe have a very firm view on this. This firm view is that we are putting the states on notice that that competition payment money has to be made available to help farmers who lose property rights when water entitlements are either eliminated or diminished. We hold to the principle that if people lose a property right they should be compensated. Property rights are conferred by the states under the Constitution; they are not conferred by the Commonwealth. We want two things in this area. We want the establishment of a regime all over Australia where a property water right granted in New South Wales is recognised and enforceable in the other parts of Australia, and vice versa. We also want to establish the principle that if you have your water entitlement diminished or eliminated you are entitled to compensation. It was always intended that those competition payments would, amongst other things, be available to assist the process of adjustment of water rights.</para></talk.start><para>It is also interesting, when you go back and examine the files, to remember that the competition payments arrangements were negotiated by a federal Labor government and a large number of state coalition governments. So it will be a bit hard for Labor to argue that there was something wrong with the science when these agreements were negotiated. You not only find what I have just said in relation to what this money should be available for, but you also find, very interestingly, that one of the reasons for the competition payments when they were thought of in 1995 was the absence of a growth tax in the hands of the states of Australia. The argument behind the competition payments was that, if you reformed your economy and made it more competitive, there would be greater economic activity, you would collect more revenue, and the states ought to be compensated because they did not have a growth tax. So, bit by bitâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tanner</name></talker><para>âYou would be collecting a lot more revenue!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âNo, the additional revenue is going to the states via the GST, my friend.

So I want to assure not only the member who asked me the question but also my colleagues on this side of the Houseâand indeed all interested membersâthat we are going to press ahead on this issue. We are committed to water reform. We do believe the competition payments should be available for that. We will continue to argue that case and we will continue to push the cause of nationally acceptable and enforceable water rights. It is a matter of ordinary Australian justice for Australian farmers that if they lose their water rights they ought to get compensation. As far as I am concerned, the first cab off the rank for that compensation is those competition payments.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs</title><page.no>10320</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10320</page.no><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name><name.id>HV5</name.id><electorate>Grey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Despite substantial efforts being made by this country, this government, and by New Zealand and others to try to improve the situation in the Solomon Islands, progress has been slow. There is still a long way to go to stabilise the Solomon Islands and get the government's authority asserted more effectively, through a stronger law and order situation. It is important that we have ongoing engagement in Vanuatu and do what we can to assist Vanuatu through what is a relatively difficult period.

There are issues of concern in the region that we are doing our best to addressâimportantly, with New Zealand. At the end of this visit, I will be going to New Zealand for the six-monthly consultation with the New Zealand government and, in particular, my friend and counterpart Phil Goff.

The budget initially provided funding of $240 million, based upon estimated arrivals of 4,500 people. That estimate has been reduced to 2,500, but if the number of new arrivals remains at current low levels, there will be further savings this financial year. That follows on from savings last year of something of the order of $47 million. So, at this stage, the funding required to process 2,500 unauthorised arrivals and to manage people currently held in offshore processing centres is estimated at $165 million.

By a factor of five or 10, they have spent more questions, more time and more energy on unworthily trying to attack the character and the decency of a minister than they have on anything else. That will not be lost on the Australian people. They have muckraked. They have unfairly attacked the character of a minister who is doing a first-class job. There is no evidence to support any of the allegations. They have been comprehensively refuted.

One of the major changes the government put in place to ensure the tax system works on a better basis was the new tax system, with the Australian Business Number and the coverage of the goods and services tax. The Australian national auditor endorsed in March this year a tax office figure saying that this had resulted in over $3 billion in revenue in three years collected from the black economy. Giving the tax office the tools and introducing a broad based consumption tax are already generating important measures in relation to the black economy. The government has recently increased resources to the tax office to assist it in bringing further areas of the black economy into the tax system. A key priority for the tax office remains big business and high-wealth individuals and, in the past five years, its extensive audit program on the big end of business has netted an extra $2.64 billion for the community. In addition, this year one in 10 businesses will be subject to some form of audit and more than 135,000 people will be required to confirm their tax deductions.</para></talk.start></continue><para>For the first time ever, the tax office has put out a compliance plan which has profiled risks in the community and indicated those areas which the tax office will be intensely scrutinising, including aggressive tax planning, the cash economy, work related and rental property expenses, correct reporting of capital gains and losses, illegal tobacco and fuel substitution. In addition, the government is announcing today new section 109UB of the Income Tax Assessment Act to improve the effectiveness of the deemed dividend rules so as to more effectively prevent beneficiaries accessing trust income that has borne tax only at the company tax rate. The commissioner's plan, the compliance program, which was released yesterdayâand I will table a copy in the Houseâis a first. It indicates those areas where the commissioner will be taking extensive steps in addition to those already in place, and it indicates that the tax office will be taking those high-profile and high-risk areas and ensuring that there is adequate scrutiny to assure the community that tax is being paid on a fair basis. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI call the Leader of the Opposition.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Murphy</name></talker><para>âWhy don't youâ</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Lowe would be aware that the Leader of the Opposition had been recognised and called.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title><page.no>10327</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>10327</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister, and it follows the answer he gave to the last question.

I should point out to the House that by international standards Australia does have a good and tightly targeted social security system, but I also have to say that well-intentioned and mostly ad hoc changes prior to 1996 mean that still, for far too many people, work is more trouble than it is worth and for too many Australians there is too much focus on what they cannot do rather than on what they can do. This government has already taken very significant steps to improve incentives to work. In the new tax system, effective marginal tax rates on all incomes under $60,000 were reduced by between three and 13 per cent. I congratulate the Treasurer for the outstanding work he has done to improve work incentives. The Working Credit initiative in last year's budget means that, for those vital first few weeks of employment, people moving from welfare to work get to keep more of their income. Changes to the Job Network mean constant engagement with job seekers such that it should no longer be possible for people to lose their jobs and disappear into the system, only to emerge years later as part of the problem of entrenched, long-term welfare dependency.</para></talk.start><para>Despite all these beneficial changes, there is more work that needs to be done to address the problem of poverty traps in this country. Today, Senator Vanstone and I launched a public discussion paper about the long-term architecture of the social security system. I should stress that this is not about cutting welfare; it is about making work pay. I should also stress that it is a discussion paper, not a policy paper; it is about promoting debate, not about flagging government decision making. I have to say that this is a debate that will test the maturity of our polity. Even today, there were people out there in the media trying to discover potential victims and prepare a future scare campaign. I think it is important that in this debate, above all else, we have less focus on `What's in it for me?' and more focus on `What's in it for Australia?'</para><para>I have been asked about alternative policy.

There has never been any doubt in the past that questions that go to the enforcement of the ministerial code of conduct are questions properly asked of the Prime Minister. The ministerial code of conduct, as explicitly quoted in the question, is that ministers need to be honest in their dealings with the public. I think it is beyond question that if ministers are behaving in a manner that is not acceptable publicly and would be a matter of public odium, then it is proper that the Prime Minister might be asked about the standards within his government.

As well as that, the Howard government introduced significant measures to promote venture capital funding in Australia. A revamped Invest Australia attracted some 55 new investments last financial year. There were economic boosts such as the $2 billion extra expenditure on the gas (LNG) train and pipeline at the Burrup Peninsula. Who could forget the $25 billion contract for LNG to China.

It is important in this last question time for the year that we turn our attention back to issues that people are really concerned aboutâissues that affect their lives, particularly the lives of young Australians. I know that all members of the House will be pleased to see recent advice from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre that fatal heroin overdoses in the 15 to 44 age range fell by 58 per cent in 2001, following a fall of 24 per cent in the year 2000. These figures are very encouraging. I do not claim that we have turned the corner in fighting the drug menace, but I do claim that the policies that we have pursuedâwith the full cooperation, I am happy to say, of state Labor governmentsâhave begun to make a contribution to turning around in a favourable way the fight against the drug scourge. Since 1997, at a federal level, we have committed $625 million to our Tough on Drugs strategy, which balances law enforcement and anti-drug trafficking efforts with drug treatment and education programs.</para></talk.start><para>The reduction in heroin overdose deaths is not the only positive sign. Over the last three years there has been a 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people reporting use of illicit drugs. Almost six tonnes of illicit drugs have been seized since the Tough on Drugs campaign started. These seizures and associated arrests have contributed to the disruption of major heroin importation and distribution networks. In the year from July 2000 to June 2001, there were 30,000 treatments provided for drug users by Tough on Drugs funded treatment servicesâup from around 19,000 in the previous year. As the parliamentary secretary and my colleague the member for Adelaide confirmed yesterday, a further $64 million will be allocated next year to non-government treatment facilities, in line with our 2001 election commitment. A further major success was the 2001 national illicit drugs campaign. The evaluation of that campaign showed that 78 per cent of parents surveyed spoke more frequently to their children about drugs as a result of the campaign. Our commitment to the COAG Illicit Drug Diversion Initiative is also helping drug users to get off drugs and stay out of the criminal justice system. </para><para>Earlier in question time I was critical of the failure of state premiers in the area of drought relief. In relation to diversion initiatives for drugs, I want to record my thanks to the premiers of Australiaâthe Premiers of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the other statesâfor their willingness to cooperate. They recognise that one of the greatest obligations that we have in public life, whether at a national level or a state level, is to combine across the party divide to deal with massive social problems. There is nothing that terrorises the parents of Australia more than the possibility that their children should become drug addicts. It is the nightmare of all parents of children at a vulnerable age.</para><para>I do not claim that we have all the answers and I do not claim for a moment that we have seen anything other than some promising signs. But policies have been adopted which might over time bring about an improvement. The path to success does not lie in giving in to the drug barons; it does not lie in giving in to the harm minimisation philosophy; it does not lie in heroin injecting rooms; it does not lie in legalising the use of heroin in our community. The path ahead lies in a mix of policies where there is cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. I think the Australian people applaud and support that. On that note, which is so relevant to the lives of the futureâthat is, the young people of AustraliaâMr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>10332</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>10332</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âDoes the member for Perth claim to have been misrepresented?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name></talker><para>âI do.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Perth may proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name></talker><para>âI was misrepresented by the Prime Minister in question time.

In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report.  In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement.  The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity.   In 1996, the Howard Government affirmed the commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.  The Government also undertook to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments.</para><para>The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 27 June 2002.  It also lists reports for which the House has received no government response.   A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.</para><para>The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response.  The Government's response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House.  Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. </para><para>Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations.  A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee.  However, responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee.  Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within 6 months of tabling a report.  The committee monitors the provision of such responses.  The schedule includes reports with policy recommendations.</para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Description of Report</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Date Tabledor Published1</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Date of Government Response2</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Responded in Period Specified3</para></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (House, Standing)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Unlocking the future: The report of the Inquiry into the Reeves Review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>30-08-99</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>No response to date4</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>No</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>We can do it!

This is a government that has one set of rules for ordinary Australians but another set for the friends of the Prime Minister. In the case of the families in Australia struggling under financial pressure, nothing comes; but in the case of the Prime Minister and his mates, anything goes. We have had the Prime Minister this week saying that we are wasting the time of this parliament in asking serious questions about his relationship with individuals, his code of conduct, and his special interests and those of his friends. He would have this parliament not debate them. He certainly will not answer the questions about them.</para></talk.start><para>The last fortnight has highlighted the special deals that this government and the Prime Minister, in particular, will condone. Conflicts of interestâspecial interests. Take the Senator Coonan issue. The Prime Minister today in answer to a questionâwhich he did not answerâwhere I asked whether it was appropriate for a minister responsible for the insurance industry to be pursuing a claim against an insurance company whilst she was a minister and whether it was appropriate for her use the ministerial office and ministerial letterhead argued that it was appropriate. It is totally inappropriate. He has to argue that because the minister herself is compromised again. It was very interesting in his answer that he asked us to consider the totality of Senator Coonan's circumstances.</para><para>Let us consider the totality of Senator Coonan's circumstances. We have the Assistant Treasurer of this country, the minister responsible for revenueâthat is, taxationâhaving knowledge of and participating in a complex arrangement designed to avoid capital gains tax and land tax on the family property at Paradise Avenue, Clareville, which has become known in the press as the `Pittwater property'. We know the land tax was avoided because, when the issue arose in the public domain in November, the residential status attaching to the Pittwater property was changed and the outstanding land tax was paid. In other words, the tax was paid only when we raised the issue. If it had not been raised by us, if it had not been raised in the Senate, if it had not been raised by the member for Werriwa, it would never have been paid. This tidy little arrangement in which the minister for taxation was involved and knew of an arrangement that avoided taxation would have gone unnoticed. Yet the Prime Minister comes in here and says, `What's the case against her?' That is the first part of the case. </para><para>The second part of the case against her is the conflict of interest she is involved in. She is the Assistant Treasurer with ministerial responsibilities for insurance, and in that context she has been promoting the notion of mediation as a mechanism for settling insurance claims, among other things. But, seeing that she has promoted mediation as the mechanism for settlement, what do we find? We find that her son and her husband own 100 per cent of a company involved in mediation services. Not only does that company trade in mediation services, it operates from the minister's home. The Prime Minister's code of conduct clearly says that, if decisions are taken that have impact in terms of a minister's family, they should be declared. She declared them subsequently, but it is inappropriate that they were madeâtotally inappropriate. She divested to her son after it became a public issue. So we have a mediation company and a minister promoting mediation. It is a clear conflict of interest.</para><para>The third part of the case against her is the Prime Minister's failure to say that it was inappropriate for her to use her ministerial letterhead or her ministerial office to pursue a claim. This was no ordinary claim. It is true, in the circumstances, that the claim was made before she was a minister, but do you know what happened after she became a minister?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Roxon</name></talker><para>âIt was settled.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>âIt was settled, but the claim went up 500 per cent. It went up from $60,000 to $330,000, and for what? We are only talking about a conservatory, for heaven's sake; a conservatory being built on the home. This was pursued, as we understand it, by the minister on ministerial letterhead. That was totally inappropriate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Then we have the misleading of the Senate by the senator when she claimed to have no interest in the Pittwater property, when we know that she was listed as the joint developer of that property. She said the property could not be subject to capital gains tax because it was purchased prior to 1985, despite knowing that the house had been constructed in 1994. She tried to tell the House that she had no active interest in promoting the Ipp recommendations on mediation, but an article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> in which she claimed credit for promoting that very thing. This government is prepared to condone those sorts of actions and say that we should not have the ability to ask questions about them in this parliament. These questions go to the heart of ministerial responsibility, they go to the heart of the code of conduct and they go to the heart of probity. No-one wants to see conflicts of interest, least of all by ministers in office, yet we have them in spades in the case of this minister.</para><para>But it does not stop there. The other thing that has come out this week is about former minister Reith. Let us take this for a conflict of interest and something the Prime Minister is also prepared to condone. Last year, on 29 June, the former minister announced his intention to resign from the parliament at the next election. Ten days later, on 9 July, a contract that had been previously tendered forâfor defence procurement operations to the private sectorâwas cancelled. This was 10 days after the former minister announced his intention not to stand again. Having cancelled the original tender process, he offered $1 million to every new tenderer in the second bid. One of those tenderers, Tenix, he now works for. He was working out his arrangement to work for them even while he was minister. Not only did Tenix get the $1 million; it won the contract.</para><para>It won the contract in circumstances that prompted us to pose questions in this parliament as to the circumstances of the change and the original conditions under which the bids were put out. There was no answer from the Prime Minister. Why? Because he was protecting a mateâa mate who protected him before the last election by deliberately withholding the truth from the public about the kids overboard. The Prime Minister owes Peter Reith big-time, and this is an example of where it is being paid out. The same minister retendered another contract earlier in his portfolio for the submarine torpedoes. That contract blew out by $200 million, and the torpedoes do not even fit. We are not supposed to ask questions about that either. The government think that is irrelevant. </para><para>I turn to another issue this week: ethanol. This involves another one of the Prime Minister's mates. Every motorists organisation in this country has been calling for limits on the amount of ethanol that can go into petrol, the manufacturing organisations have called for it, the science around it demonstrates that there are huge risks for motorists, and the Labor Party said months ago that there should be a limit of 10 per cent on the ethanol going into petrol and that it should be disclosed on the petrol bowser. This government has done nothing. Australian motorists are at risk, and the government knows it. But this government is prepared to put a mate of the Prime Minister ahead of the motorists of this country. It is a disgrace. This government says we should not ask questions about these issues. Well, we will, and we will continue to pursue them.</para><para>I go to the further arrogance of this government today. We heard the Prime Minister, in answer to a question, say that the Labor Party were prepared to slug middle-income Australia with higher taxes. Give us a break! This is the highest taxing government in the nation's history. We are saying that, in terms of this matter of public importance, this government has no regard for the families of this country but is prepared to look after its mates. Look at what it has done to the families of this country while it has protected the mates I have just gone through. It taxes families at the highest rate they have ever been taxed. Household debt and credit card debt are at record levels. </para><para>There has been a massive decline in bulk-billing. What does the Prime Minister say? He says that he does not know what we are talking about and that there is no problem with bulk-billing. Go and tell that to the thousands of Australians who cannot find a bulk-biller in their town. Go and tell it to them! I read out one example today. There are thousands of them around the country because this government is driving down bulk-billing. Why? Because it does not really believe in Medicare, and if you take bulk-billing out you destroy Medicare. This Prime Minister has always wanted to destroy Medicare, whatever he says. The government is not only taxing the Australian people more and putting them more into debt; it is withdrawing services and making them pay more for them.</para><para>The government is also, under the minister sitting at the table, about to embark on a regime to deregulate university fees and put university education beyond the reach of ordinary people. We will oppose it. Just as we will restore bulk-billing, we will ensure that in this country education is available to everyone, not just those who can afford it. We also have the circumstances where families are under pressure because they have to make a choice between being good parents or good employees. They are being forced to work longer in this country. The only developed country in the world where people work longer hours than in Australia is South Korea. That is under this government.</para><para>We heard them bragging before about the employment statistics that have come out. Do you know that over the last three years, while something like 680,000 jobs have been created in this country, only 700 of them pay average weekly earnings? No wonder middle-income Australia is being squeezed! The type of economic activity that the government are presiding over is not producing anything other than low-paid jobs, forcing people to be casualised and work longer hours. No wonder they are under pressure. There has to be an end to that, too. That is why we support family-friendly packages built around the notion of paid maternity leave. We will announce those initiatives next year, but we will go further. It is not just a question of supporting working families; we have to support families across the board. For once in this country, we need to have some policies that are actually supporting families, not slugging them. The government have the gall to talk about us putting pressure on families; look what they have done to them.</para><para>Another thing we are committed to is making sure that the tax burden does not fall on middle- and low-income Australians, as this government has seen happen. It is allowing tax minimisation schemes for its wealthy mates, while the real pressure in terms of the tax burden falls on middle- and low-income Australia. We are going to have targeted tax cuts that ensure that that pressure is lifted. This is not a government for the families of Australia; it is only for the mates of the Prime Minister. It is a government of arrogance, it is a government that is out of touch and it is a government of double standards. We have exposed those double standards in the last fortnight and we will continue to expose them. The Australian public deserves better, the families of Australia deserve better, and they will only get it under a Labor government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>10345</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Science and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think the basis of today's matter of public importance was given in the first and opening remarks by the Leader of the Opposition at the National Press Club on Tuesday this week, when he said that it had been a pretty tough year. He said, `It has been a pretty tough year for me'âthe Leader of the Oppositionâand then almost as an afterthought, `It has been a pretty tough year for the nation.' </para></talk.start><para>Australia in the year 2002 is a country that is changing, and changing very quickly. As a nation we crossed the threshold from the 20th to the 21st century. This year, in support of all Australians and in particular Australian families, this government has implemented carefully developed policies that will take Australia into the future, at least for the next quarter of a century. This year, amongst many other things, the government has been able to ensure that Australia's economy continues to grow. The fundamental purpose of that, of course, is to create employment. Unemployment, or not having a job, is the single biggest lifetime cause of poverty. The government has also moved to bring all the states and territories together to remove hand guns from our community. The Howard government has moved, as we have heard today from the Prime Minister, to give not only humane and caring support to the farmers and the communities in drought-stricken Australia but also in excess of $1 billion in support, which is some 20 times the level of support given by state and territory governments.</para><para>This government continues to very much support the choices that are made by Australians, whether they are in health care or indeed in education. The government has also worked assiduously, opposed by the Labor Party at almost every turn, to protect Australia's borders. It wants to make sure that the people who come to this country are people who are eligible to be here, as determined under the laws which the Australian government believes are the appropriate ones for immigration. The Labor Party, under its previous leader and, I suspect, its future leaderâthat is my prediction for 2003; I think the past will be coming back to the futureâthe member for Brand, was divided on whether Australia should take a strong stand in support of Australia's interests in determining who should come to this country. Only this week we had the Australian Labor Party say that it would not support the government in excising from our migration zone those islands that make it easier for people smugglers, already exploiting an overexploited group, to find illegal passage to Australia. So the Australian Labor Party will now go out to Australian families and say, `Yes, we support border protection; we support the government in all of this,' but then come in here and vote against measures that will assist the security of Australia and its families.</para><para>The other important event this year was of course the tragedy in Bali, where not only Australians and Indonesians but human beings from many other parts of the world were injured and killed. This government providedâand I think in this regard we were supported by the Leader of the Oppositionâleadership in effectively and very swiftly responding to the events in Bali and working cooperatively with the Indonesian government. We saw this in the Prime Minister especially. The Prime Minister has also shown his humanity and the strength of his leadership to the families affected and to those of us in Australia who feel a deep sense of insecurity about some of the changes that are happening in our world.</para><para>The best way to protect the interests of Australian families and to protect the nation, from its borders through to its economy, is to make sure that Australia's economic growth continues. The Labor Party's idea of protecting Australian families was to give Australia the recession that apparently we had to have. Thanks to the Howard government's reforms, the Treasurer has firewalled Australia against the Asian economic meltdown. But Labor is still damaging the interests of Australian families. It is interesting that, in the last five years in office, the Labor Party delivered five consecutive budgets that were more than $10 billion in deficit and ran up almost $80 billion in additional government debt.  </para><para>In contrast, the coalition government has reintroduced responsible fiscal management. In fact, by 30 June 2002 this government had repaid more than $60 billion in debt that had been racked up by the Australian Labor Party. That means that Australian families now have a government which has more resources available to it to, among other things, secure us from the threats of terrorism and make sure that our borders are very sound. In fact, this program of debt repayment is now saving the Commonwealth governmentâthat is, the Australian taxpayerâaround $5 billion every year in interest costs. That money can now be dedicated to very vital areas of expenditure, such as health, education and transport.</para><para>It is also worth remembering that in this country todayâand there are Australians who may have some difficulty comprehending some of these figuresâour unemployment rate is 6.1 per cent. A decade ago, Australia's unemployment rate was 11 per cent. Under the Australian Labor Party, more than one million Australians did not have a job. They lost their homes and their businesses. In many families, the marriages and personal relationships were destroyed. The then Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said: `What are you complaining about? This is as good as it gets.' At the same time, Australian familiesâwho today are experiencing home mortgage interest rates of between five and 6Â½ per centâwere paying an interest rate on their mortgages of 17Â½ per cent. This government has just offered interest rate subsidies to small businesses and farmers who are affected by the drought. But just 10 years ago small businesses were paying a 22Â½ per cent interest rate on their overdrafts. It was absolutely disgraceful.</para><para>One of the things that has happened to protect Australian families is that the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, the member for Jagajaga, has chosen not to take an economic portfolio and is instead the shadow minister for education, science and training. I think that is something for which we all ought to be grateful. One of the problems that Australian families have at the moment is that they do not quite know what the Australian Labor Party really stands for. You might remember that the member for Rankin decided he would get a name for himself by personally attacking the Prime Minister; a Prime Minister who is highly respected in this country and beyond. On 8 November this year, he said: </para><quote><para>We owe it to our supporters to be frank.</para></quote><para>He then went on to say:</para><quote><para>Too often Labor statements are heavily qualified, such that the message is lost and the electorate is left wondering what we stand for.</para></quote><para>I think the member for Jagajaga is probably the person who, amongst others, was on the mind of the member for Rankin when he made those remarks. Alan Wood, who writes for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, summarised it very well on 29 October when he said:</para><quote><para>... Labor has to say clearly what it stands for. It seems chronically unable to decide just what it is. Unlike Whitlam, Crean has no vision ...</para></quote><para>On the Labor policy review, Wood went on to say:</para><quote><para>... there are those on Labor's frontbench who have serious doubts. One reason for such doubts is that the policy review is led by Labor's deputy leader, Jenny Macklin, whose inclinations are soft-Left and populist. </para></quote><para>I think the member for Rankin has got it right.</para><para>If honourable members are wondering why the Labor Party, a year after the election, still has no clearly defined policiesâin-cluding for familiesâI can give them an insight. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, who is responsible for developing policy, has made all sorts of commitmentsâfor example, some $1.2 billion for Australian higher education. This is what the member for Rankin is contending with and the problem the Labor Party has. I chanced upon a document, which I read, entitled the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Resourcer</inline>. The edition I have is volume 3, number 2, April 1983. This publication was intended for families, I suspect, and was edited by none other than the member for Jagajaga. One of the advantages of being the editor of a newspaper is that you can decide what you publish. I will read from a section of the publication. Under the headline `Prospects for socialist change' is the text of a speech given by Jenny Macklin to the Marx Centenary Conference held on 16 and 17 April. Keep in mind that this person is the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party and, if there were to be a change of government, she would be the deputy leader of the government. She said:  </para><quote><para>What does the dismantling of capitalism and the building of socialism involve? It is all too clear that spontaneous uprising is not around the corner. Planned insurrection is also only a dream in some people's heads ...</para></quote><para>She goes on to say:</para><quote><para>We are talking about transformation of people's capacities and through that, and at a similar pace, the economic institutions of capital.</para></quote><para>Australian families have every reason to look at the Australian Labor Party with some trepidation, because they are fearful of people with those views getting anywhere near the Treasury portfolio. Of course, that is why the member for Jagajaga is in the shadow portfolio of education, science and training.</para><para>One of the things we need to examine, amongst many others, is health care. We have heard a lot from the Labor Party about people getting access to health care and choice. It ought to be understood that Australians strongly believe, as does this government, that every Australian should make a contribution to the financing of health care and Medicare through their taxes. But, having done so, if they then choose to go into a private hospital for treatment, and choose not take up a place in the public hospital system, they ought to be supported by the government, both morally and financially, in making that choice. This government has supported Australian families by offering a 30 per cent rebate. In other words, the government pays 30 per cent of the cost of their private health insurance, which means that families save anywhere between $600 and $1,200 on their private health insurance. The Labor Party, in saying that it is going to remove this private health insurance support, does not understand that one million families in this country who earn less than $20,000 a yearâthat is, $53 a dayâhave private health insurance. The Labor Party is criticising this government's policy on families. Worse still, it wants to take that support away from families. As Ethel Guyâa great woman who has led the representation of pensioners in Tasmaniaâonce said to me, `A lot of my members'âthat is, poor Australiansâ`go without food to pay their private health insurance.' The Labor Party wants to take that support away from them.</para><para>On 11 September, at the Australian National University, in response to a question about how she was going to fund the grandiose promises that she has made to universities, the member for Jagajaga said, `You can reorder your priorities.' She said this government has been giving too much money to non-government schools. One in five families that earn less than $73 a day have their kids in Catholic and independent schools. The Labor Party wants to say you cannot choose the kind of school that you want for your child, and the Labor Party does not want to support you. I say to the Labor Party, as Albert Einstein once said: `I now know why people like to chop woodâbecause it is so easy to understand the outcome.' The Labor Party does not get the fact that Australian families need support in education and in making a choice. They need support in making choices in health care. They want secure borders. They want Australia to be led by a statesman, not by somebody running around in somebody's rubbish. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>10347</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI find it very strange that the only person the government could put up to talk about its failure to protect and prioritise the interests of Australian families as a matter of public importance is the now Minister for Education, Science and Training, who had the audacity to say recently that our kids are not biologically up to obtaining a full and right education. The minister wants to go back to 1983. I too have been around a long time and, if I had time in this debate, I could tell the minister what he was doing 20 years ago, line by line and clause by clause. But it might embarrass him too much and I will not do that. </para></talk.start><para>I rise with pleasure to support the Leader of the Opposition's motion regarding this government's failure to protect and prioritise the interests of Australian families. In this House we constantly hear rhetoric from the Prime Minister about how his government is family friendly. However, the facts show the true picture. This government is anything but family friendly. It provides constant smokescreens to cover its regressive economic and social policies.</para><para>Firstly, let us look at the issue of paid maternity leave. What is the only party that is committed to implementing a policy that will assist working mothers? It is the Labor Party. The Labor Party supports paid maternity leave. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, has said that it is quite within the government's abilities to provide a form of maternity leave. Might I add that the government is one of only two OECD countries that do not have some form of paid maternity leave. There is no prize for guessing what the other country is. Yes, let us tug our forelock: it is the United Statesâthe government that refuses to sign the ILO's revised Maternity Protection Convention, which calls for a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave. It is quite apparent on this issue that the government would rather pander to the business sector than even contemplate what reforms are required to allow a woman to work and have a family.</para><para>What about child care? I have heard outrageous stories that people now have to fork out $15,000 a year to have their child cared for. How does a normal family afford that? That is nearly half the median wage, yet we had the minister for education telling us what people earn and how they manage. With mortgages hanging over their heads and the increasing costs of feeding, clothing and keeping their children healthy, it is a deplorable situation. Does the government care? Of course it does not. It constantly says it does; it keeps telling us it does. It boasts about its baby bonus, but who does that benefit? A parent who earns over $55,000 in the year prior to the birth of their first child receives an annual refund of $2,500 if they choose to stay at home, while a parent in my electorate who earns $10,000 a year gets $500 if they choose to stay home. Today, in this House, the Treasurer reminded the member for Dunkley to go home and start having a family so that he can get the family bonus and the government can implement its policy. What a disgrace! How pathetic is that? This government lives in a dream world. How is it going to entice women to stay at home? They cannot afford to. This government has put up a pathetic bribe, an absurd piece of rhetoric that is picked up by its shock jock mates in the media and trumpeted as another example of our Prime Minister's commitment to families. But that is what this government is about: propaganda and rhetoricâanything to hide the truth behind its smokescreens.</para><para>This government have paid lip-service to looking after workers' entitlements. Unless you worked for the Prime Minister's brother or for Ansett, you got sod all. The Auditor-General's report into the government's employee entitlements scheme shows not only that the government have no commitment to workers but that they are hopelessly incompetentâand they are the Auditor-General's words, not mine. The truth of the matter is that the government set up this scheme to attempt to quell public anger following the National Textiles fiasco. It was never a genuine attempt to protect entitlements. They have absolutely no commitment to this area. If they did, they would have supported the Labor Party's private member's bill protecting 100 per cent of workers' entitlements.</para><para>We see in this place, year after year, the government putting forward a range of workplace relations bills that are focused on reinstating the old master-servant relationship. That is their real commitment to the workers and their families of this nation. Since the Howard government came into office, the casualisation of our work force has increased at a rapid rate, as has the amount of part--time work. Again, how are families supposed to survive in a climate in which they do not know if they will be working next week? </para><para>Added to this are the recent comments by the Prime Minister suggesting that people should consider working longer. This is a comment from a person who really is out of touch with reality. With constant economic change, people in their middle age are frequently being forced out of their jobs and forced onto Newstart. These are the people who have been hardworking members of our communities for 30 or so years, and they are forced into unemployment. Many of these people lack the skills that are required in the new economy. Without the retraining that we provided through Working Nation, these people are suffering economic and emotional hardships. They are forced to trudge around the streets with a diary, attempting to find a job when they know few employers are even willing to employ them. The Prime Minister says they should work longer. How can they? These people still have family commitments and bills to pay, and they have been used to a steady flow of income, and suddenly and ruthlessly they are forced onto the economic scrap heap. What does the government do? I will tell you what it does: nothing. `That is their problem,' according to the government. `They should be able to retrain.' On what program? This shows how much the government cares.</para><para>The government talks about security. I will tell the Prime Minister what security is all about in this country: it is knowing where that next meal is coming from, it is knowing that you can pay your bills, it is knowing that you have got a roof over your kids' head and that you are going to keep it there. That is security to the families of this nation. We want to be able to protect our kids when they are sick. Yet the Prime Minister, in his former guise as opposition leader, constantly espoused destroying Medicare. He knows he cannot do it, but he will do his best to rip the guts out of it. Bulk-billing has been in constant decline under this government, and in some areasâas our leader has stated in the debate today before the Houseâtrying to find a bulk-billing doctor in some areas is like trying to look for hen's teeth. </para><para>They think that reforming the PBS is done by getting the poor to pay an extra 30 per cent for their medicines instead of getting down to the hard task of reforming the system, which would mean reforming the way their pharmaceutical industry mates do things. The former minister, Michael Wooldridge, was quite willing to put his pharmaceutical industry mates on the PBAC, but they just ignore the consumers and the health care associations. So to prop up these huge multinational companies' profits, this government are willing to compromise the provision of essential medical services. Reform means having intellectual nous and embracing the concerns of all those who are involved in the community, not continuing to pander to sectional interests. That is what this government are about. They pander to their donors and their friends that provide them with the money and the propaganda facilities to con the electorateâand they are the ones looking after them.</para><para>The other disgusting thing about this government is that they have their snouts in the trough. The former member for Flinders was quite willing to use taxpayers' money to fund his family's international telephone bills. I would not think Mr Reith was living on the edge of the poverty line. Can you imagine any of that frontbench ever struggling to survive? They would not know how to. Mr Reith is indicative of this born-to-rule mob: they think that it is their right to be on the Treasury benches. There are a number of former ministers who have thought that fleecing the taxpayer for their own personal gain is the way to go. John Sharp, Jim Short, Michael Wooldridge and Reith, along with Warwick Parer, think it is okay to go to work in the same industry straight after they have left office. They do not believe that they have a conflict of interest; the Prime Minister says they do not.</para><para>The Reith situation regarding Tenix is an example of the arrogance of these people on the government benches. They truly believe they can get away with it. How can anyone truly believe that a minister for defence can announce his retirement, take up a consultancy in the defence industry and end a tender process for the DIDS, when six months later the company that he joins wins the new tender? Don't you think we should be suspicious, especially with a person who has the very dubious track record that he has? Why doesn't the Prime Minister share the view of the Australian people that it is inappropriate for a minister to have knowledge of and participate in contrived living arrangements which minimise tax, to exercise ministerial authority to benefit the business affairs of his or her immediate family, to misuse his or her ministerial power and resources to benefit his or her own private interests, and to not to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? That is what the people want in Australia. </para><para>I will give you a tip, especially to the minister for education: never underestimate the Labor Party. We have been here from the start; you lot have not. What have you been? You have been protectionists, free traders, Liberals for a while, nationalists, United Australia, and back to the Liberals again. The thing is, there is no soul. Like their counterparts in Britain, they do not know where they stand or what to do. Through all of the states and territories in this wonderful country of ours, the state of the Liberal Party is in decline. Even their mates in the business community ran away from them in Victoria when they realised what a pathetic rabble they were.</para><para>We in the Labor Party have survived and will survive. Why? Because we are a party of principle and we are a party of inclusiveness. We care about our community and we want our community to be secure and prosperous, not to have to worry about whether they have a job or whether they can afford to clothe the kids. The government, though, has survived by dividing and conquering. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10350</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to start my remarks by saying how much I regret that we find ourselves in this situation, a couple of weeks out from Christmas and on the last scheduled day of the 2002 sittings in the national parliament of Australia, with the Australian Labor Party abusing the office of the opposition in taking up the time of the House on matters that are so frivolous. I think the other thing that is interesting to note is that the Leader of the Opposition spoke on this MPI for 15 minutes, and throughout that 15 minutes there was not one interjection from the government. The Chief Opposition Whip has just spoken on the MPI for 10 minutes, and throughout that 10 minutes there was not one interjection from the government. So we have heard 25 minutes on this MPI from the opposition, with not one interjection.</para></talk.start><para>The first government speaker was the Minister for Education, Science and Training. He spoke for 15 minutes, and there was interjection after interjection from the Australian Labor Party. I think that demonstrates and reflects the difference between those of us in the government and those in the opposition. We will sit and listen to their view, and we did that for 25 minutes; yet the Minister for Education, Science and Training could not speak without being constantly harangued by the opposition. We listened for 25 minutes, despite the drivel and despite the mealy-mouthed comments, without making one interjection, and the best we can get from the Australian Labor Party is interjection after interjection. What is amazing is that the Australian Labor Party still do not understandâand that is why they are in opposition. That is why the people of Australia rejected them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>âBecause of interjections?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>A8W</name.id><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name></talker><para>âBecause of your behaviour and your nature.

I am offended by the MPI, because I think almost all of us in this House are in a family. I would have thought that, after meeting the people I have met from all sides of this House in the 18 months I have been here, the one thing we all cared about was families. Here we have one side of the House suggesting that the other side does not have the interests of families at heart. I would have thought that each and every person who bothered to run for office in the parliament, who bothered to come to this place, cared about families. I thought the people I have met in this place from both sides of the House in the time I have been here cared about families. I am offended by the MPI, because the government does care about families. It may do things that the opposition does not like or does not agree with, but to suggest that the Australian family is not a priority of this government is just frivolous, it is just wrong and it is a misuse of this place. This is the Australian national parliament, where we should be doing what is to the benefit of Australia and Australians going forward. </para><para>If you want to talk about the interests of Australian families, there are certain things that Australian families need in this world to prosper and to survive. They fall into two key areas, in my view. The first thing they need is economic security. They need to feel secure. They need to feel that they are going to have a life going forward, and they need to be in control of their destiny. They need economic security. What are the things that make up economic security? They are things like home loan interest rates. I am not going to stand here for the next few minutes and throw assertions at the other side that are wrong; I am just going to state some facts. When I did my schooling, I understood that if things were facts you could not argue about them. So let us look at the facts. The last time the Australian Labor Party held my seat of Aston, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, home loan interest rates were 17 per cent. I lived in Aston then. What are interest rates today? They are around six to 6Â½ per cent. That is a fact. What more can a government do in the area of home loan interest rates to support the interests of Australian families than to have economic policies and principles that take the interest rates from 17 per cent to six to 6Â½ per cent?</para><para>Have a look at average earnings. During 13 years of Labor, average earnings in Australia increased by two per cent. That is a fact. In the 6Â½ years of this government, average earnings have increased by 11 per cent. They increased by two per cent in 13 years and 11 per cent in 6Â½ years. That is a fact. Is that not in the interests of Australian families? Let us have a look at economic growth. Madam Deputy Speaker, you will remember that it was back in 1990-91 when we were told by the then Labor Treasurer that we were having the `recession we had to have'. In the 6Â½ years of this government, have we had a recession? I do not think we have. We have not had a recession. As a matter of fact, Australia's growth rate is at 3.8 per cent. It is fact: there has been no recession.</para><para>Have a look at income tax rates. For the first time in Australia's history, as a result of this coalition government's new tax system, over 75 per cent of taxpayers have a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. When the Australian Labor Party was in government, 30 per cent of people fitted into that categoryâthat is, only 30 per cent of people had tax rates of 30 per cent or less. Under this government, it is now 75 per cent. Most people with any sense of intelligence would agree that one of the greatest expenses an individual has across their lifetime is income tax. We, through our tax system, have increased the number of people who pay 30 per cent or less from 30 per cent to 75 per cent. Is that not in the interests of Australian families?</para><para>Let us have a look at inflation. All Australian families are impacted by inflation. Across 13 years of Labor, inflation averaged 5.2 per cent. The 6Â½-year average of this government is 2.4 per cent. That is half of Labor's inflation rate. That means that Australian families have not had the price increases in goods and all sorts of household things. Is that not in the interests of Australian families? Let us have a look at the unemployment rate. In order to help Australians and to help them achieve what they want to achieve, we need to make sure that they can do what they want to do. If they want to work, we need to create an environment that allows them to work. Under Labor, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.9 per cent in December 1992; that was the highest unemployment rate in Australia since the Great Depression. It was when the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister for this countryâ </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gavan O'Connor</name></talker><para>âWhat about the Prime Minister's record?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>A8W</name.id><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name></talker><para>âRemember what I saidâwe listened for 25 minutes without interjection. It was when the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister of Australia that the unemployment rate was in excess of 10 per cent. What is it today? It is 6.1 per cent. In 6Â½ years, this government has created over one million new jobs. Is that not in the interests of Australian families? Here we are in the national parliament of Australia on the last scheduled sitting day, and the best that the Australian Labor Party can do is come into this place with frivolous MPIs that have no basis in fact and talk to us about the interests of Australian families. As I said earlier, I would have thought that each and every person in the Australian parliament cared about Australian families. I think we do all care. I think this is a frivolous MPI; it is an MPI that has no basis, no substance, no factual underlying evidence to support it. Australia is a better country because of this government.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Gambaro)</inline>âOrder!

I have reflected that, for all the imperfections that our country has, the relative absence of division on class and other grounds means that, in a time of crisis, we come together more easily, more spontaneously and more readily than other societies. We are less inhibited in working with each other, we are less in awe of any position held by others and, as a consequence, we have a capacity, I believe, beyond other Western countries, to come together in a quite remarkable fashion. That was very much in evidence in the days that followed what occurred in Bali.</para><para>I have told the House beforeâand I would like to repeat itâof the experience I had of thanking the young aircrew at Richmond RAAF base for the tremendous work they had done in evacuating the injured. When I had the opportunity of doing that, to move around and talk to them, one young womanâobviously still very traumatised, if I could use that expression, by the experience that she had suddenly been confronted withâexpressed her sheer pride in being part of a cooperative effort and having worked for a period of time side by side with the group captain by saying, `We don't care about rank; we are just all pitching in to do something for Australia.' That is a characteristic, of course, of the Australian armed forces. They have an egalitarian spirit which gives them a special capacity.</para><para>Although it was a very sad period in the life of our country and certainly the sadest period that I have experienced as Prime Minister in the last 6Â½ years, it was also an opportunity to experience immense pride and humility that we belong to a country that can respond in that wayâin such an uninhibited outpouring of compassion and willingness to help. Although we have been bloodied and bowed, we have certainly not had our courage or our spirit in any way diminishedâindeed, it has been enhanced. Those who imagine that they can weaken and cower this country by attacks of that kind misunderstand the mood, the temper and the spirit of the Australian people.</para><para>So, most of all, as we come to Christmas, our thoughts are with the people who have suffered so much. We are also determined to reach out to our fellow Australians and to ensure that people of Islamic faith are not discriminated against and do not feel they are a lesser part of the Australian community because their religion is Islam. That should be something that we all endorse and something that we should all practice. The terrorists who murdered our fellow Australians in Bali are no friends of true Islam. The terrorists who struck them down are repugnant to the beliefs of Islam and they do a monstrous obscenity to the religion of Islam in doing what they do in the name of that religion. As we go to the season which celebrates the birth of Christ, we reach out in friendship to people of other religions not only here but also around the world. </para><para>It has also been an important year for Australia in terms of the hosting of international events. We had a very successful Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Coolum at the beginning of the year. It has also been a year of very significant international exchanges between this country and other nations of the world. </para><para>It has been a year in which our country has fallen into the grip of a very severe drought. Although we have had some welcome rain in certain parts of the country, we are a long way from the breaking of that drought. We think particularly of our country folk at this time and we think particularly of the people who have been ravaged by bushfires. Again, we express our admiration to the emergency services and all of those who performed so well and spontaneously in a spirit of camaraderie in the face of the challenge of bushfires.</para><para>For me personally, let me say a few words about a few peopleâsome of whom are here and some of whom are not. Can I first express my thanks to the Deputy Prime Ministerâa finer, more decent man in politics I have not met. He is a person who is a very faithful servant of his electorate and a person who cares very deeply about the people of rural Australia. Matched in his concern for the people of rural Australia, of course, are many members of my own party who have a great affinity with and connection to rural Australia. To you, Deputy Prime Minister: I wish you and Julia a very merry Christmas with your wonderful children and a little bit of respite until you assume the duties of Acting Prime Minister on 1 January. I wish you well during that period, as well, and I hope you have a very enjoyable Christmas.</para><para>To my deputy, the Treasurer and member for Higgins: in my view the country has had no finer Treasurer. To him is owed immense credit and praise for the great economic performance of Australia over the last 6Â½ years. It is a reality that the strength of this economy is acclaimed around the world. It is a talking point; it is not just a Liberal Party PR release to say thatâyou do actually get told when you go to other parts of the world that we are a great economic success story. So to the Treasurer and his wife, Tanya, and their children: I wish you a very merry Christmas. Thank you, Peter and Tanya, for your great friendship and support and contribution over the last year. To Senator Robert Hill and Senator Richard Alston, who do not have the luxury of the numbers in the Senateâand that may be of passing comfort, I know, to our colleagues opposite: you handle your affairs and provide leadership extremely well, and I thank you.</para><para>I thank all of my ministerial colleagues. I thank Jim Lloyd, the member for Robertson; Stewart McArthur; John Forrest; and all the whips in the other place. Very generally, I want to extend my thanks to all my parliamentary colleagues. When you have an election you get some new people, and I want especially to welcome and thank the class of 2001 for their contribution. I guess I will always have a special place in my heart for the class of '96 because that was the class that resulted in a change of where we sit in this chamber. But I would not want the class of '96 to imagine for a moment that I am not equally impressed with the class of 2001. They are a wonderful group and they represent a fine cross-section of the Australian community. I am very nourished and encouraged by the fact that we continue to draw such a wide cross-section of people. I wish them all well. This is the first set of valedictories that they have attended, and I hope they have years of valedictories ahead of them as they represent their electorates in the national parliament.</para><para>I thank you, Mr Speaker, and wish you and your wife, Carolyn, a very merry Christmas. I hope you have some time with your growing family and its addition of grandchildren. I wish you well.</para><para>To the unfailingly professional, courteous and likeable Clerk, Ian Harris, I say thank you. You do the role great honour and you perform it very well. You have the regard and affection of all of us. Bernard Wright had a mishap at his family property and is recovering from a broken sternum. We hope to see him back in the new year. </para><para>I also take this opportunity to thank those outside this parliament. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to a group of people who are not here but who played a very great role in an event that means that I am speaking from the dispatch box again, and that group is the organisation of the Liberal Party and the National Party around Australia. I want to thank the federal president, Shane Stone, for his leadership of the organisation. Very particularly, I extend my thanks to Lynton Crosby, who was the organisational architect of our victories in 1998 and 2001. He has now left the Liberal Party organisation. I wish Lynton and Dawn well. I know that across the political divide there is recognition of professional competence, although it may not be expressed. I think many on the opposite side of the House would recognise and acknowledge Lynton's professional competence and ability, just as in the past I recognised and even publicly acknowledged the professional competence of the shadow Treasurer when he was the national secretary of the Labor Party. I confine it to the national secretaryship, but I meant it then and I mean it as I say it today. I think Lynton did a wonderful job for the Liberal Party of Australia. I think he did a magnificent job and I want to record in this parliament my thanks to him for the calm professionalism he brought to that job.</para><para>I record my thanks to all the other members of the party organisation. We would not be here without the help of our party membership. That applies to the Liberal Party and the National Party, and I know it applies to the Australian Labor Party. None of us should ever forget the debt we owe to our party organisation. Once you start doing that you start to lose contact with reality. So to all of those people I express my thanks.</para><para>I thank my great personal staff. They are too numerous to mention, but I hope that if I name some of them my thanks will flow through them to the rest. There is Arthur Sinodinos, who has been my chief of staff since late 1997. There is Tony Nutt, my principal private secretary, who had a great term of service in the Liberal Party organisation and, as the language goes, knows where more bodies are buried than many other people in the Liberal organisationâparticularly in his home state of Western Australia. I also extend my thanks to Tony O'Leary, who has been a great press secretary and a great adviser in that field for the whole time I have been Prime Minister. I thank Max Moore-Wilton, the secretary of my department. He is an indefatigable worker, a great bureaucrat, a person who gets things done and a person who believes that the role of the Public Service is to give fearless advice and then, the decision of government having been taken, to implement that decision and not second-guess it. I thank him and all of the bureaucracy.</para><para>I particularly want to express my gratitude to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who bore much of the heat and burden of the aftermath of Bali. I single out Ross Tysoe, the consul general, who was confronted with that awful carnage in the early hours of 13 October and had to cope with it. He did that magnificently. I have had the opportunity to thank him personally, but I again want to record my gratitude to him and, through him, to all the other people on the DFAT staff.</para><para>I thank the people who make this place work: the clerks and the attendants. I especially want to mention somebody who is doing it hard at the moment: Ali Kafrawi, the House accountant, who has gone on sick leave as he is very ill. We wish him well. Obviously, his health is not good. I particularly want to single him out as somebody to whom we send our very warm good wishes.</para><para>I want to record the fact that Senator Margaret Reid, who has been a great member of the Liberal Party and a senator for the ACT for 21 years, and who was the first woman president of the Senate, will be retiring. She may be back for two or three days early next year until her replacement, whoever he or she may be, is appointed formally by the Senate. I wish Margaret and Tom well and hope that they enjoy good health and happiness in the many years ahead. </para><para>I thank the Hansard staff and the people who manage the transport. My very warm thanks to the staff at the Lodge and at Kirribilli House, who are very kind and helpful, and my drivers. I felt for one of them very badly, and he would not mind me mentioning his name: Greg Wright. He is my main driver in Sydney and a great follower of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs football club. The poor bloke had to endure the pain of the team being right at the top of the competition, driving someone who is a No. 1 ticket holder for St George, with the other relief driver also a fanatical St George follower, and then right on the death knock, for good and proper reasonsâand I think it was an outstanding example of tough and proper sports administrationâthe team had all their points taken away. He bore it manfully and said, `We'll be back next year,' and I fear he is dead right. All of them do a fantastic job, and they are very gracious to my family.</para><para>On the personal side, I thank the people who work with me. I would like to record very special thanks again to the members of my Australian Federal Police detail, led by Blen Rowley. They are a terrific group of men and women. They go everywhere with me, and we have been in some interesting situations this year and had some interesting and challenging experiences. They really do an absolutely fantastic job. I have great admiration for the Australian Federal Police. They have done a fantastic job in BaliâI mentioned it at question timeâand their colleagues who escort me do a wonderful job.</para><para>Finally, I would like to wish the Leader of the Opposition and his wife, Carol, and their two daughters a very happy Christmas. I hope he has an enjoyable holiday. I extend the same good wishes to Jenny Macklin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and to all their colleagues. I wish them well.</para><para>This is a time when the spiritual roots of this country are important. For those who find comfort in the Christian religion, it is a very important time. For those who do notâthat is their right in a secular society such as oursâmay they nonetheless draw a sense of tranquillity and peace from the season. We all need that. We are all a bit different now from how we were a year ago, because of what has happened. We have all been reminded of what an incredibly lucky country this is but we have also been reminded that, as a nation, you must in a sense make your own luck. We cannot assume that things that have fallen our way so easily and conveniently in the past are going to do so again in the future. It is very much a time to be charitable to each other. We think of those in the community who are not as well off as we are, and there are many. We should try and help them in different ways. We should try, all of us, to embrace that sense of goodwill which is the hallmark of this time of the year.</para><para>Again, my thanks to my colleagues. I should have mentioned both the Leader of the House and his opposite number. Fancy forgetting the Leader of the House! How could you ever forget the Leader of the House? But I did. Something reminded me of him. I thank Tony, who has brought flair and eloquence to the job. I also thank his opposite number, Wayne Swan, for the contribution that he makes. Wayne is a warrior in the Labor Party cause. I had better say no more; I might get into trouble! This is a moment of charity. I thank you all very much and I wish you well. I will say in advance that, if I depart during the Leader of the Opposition's address, it is not through any discourtesy but because it is traditional at this time of the year for me to host a little function at the Lodge for all the departmental secretaries and senior officers. I would not want to keep them waiting for too long. I hope you understand that, Leader of the Opposition. To all of you: I wish you well. I extend across the table to shake the hand of the Leader of the Opposition. I wish you all a very merry Christmas.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>10359</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have pleasure in supporting the motion.

It is an indication that both of us have pressing commitments. I wish the Prime Minister, Janette and the family the very best for Christmas and the festive season. He, like me, holds his family very close and very dearly, and it is an important time for all of us to be together. I wish him and his family all the very best for the season.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I begin by acknowledging that this has been a very tough year for the nation, and parliament has been the focal pointânot just in terms of the debate and the accountability arguments that we think are important in a robust democracy but also as the focus for the day of national mourning. The memorial service for the Bali victims was very moving, and none of us will be able to look back on this year without thinking of the events that led to that service. And that is why, during this festive season, our thoughts go out to the families of those who perished in Bali. Christmas will be a terribly sad time for them in that many of them would have shared it together. The first Christmas from which loved ones are missing is the hardest of the lot. There will be many grief-stricken families, and our hearts really go out to them. The nation came together in the national capital, and again, from the national capital, our sincere best wishes and thoughts go to those families at this difficult time.</para><para>It has also been a difficult year for those who are on the land. They have experienced the worst drought on record. I have previous experience in having to deal, from a portfolio perspective, with the ravages of drought and the hurt of the people. I had that opportunity again when visiting the drought affected areas. As we talk about the need to celebrate, they can really only celebrate when the rains come, and I hope they do. There has been some welcome relief in parts over recent days. We have an obligation as a nation to get behind them and to understand it from the beginning, when it first impacts upon them, and not just when we see its effects in our national accounts figures. There is real suffering out there, and these are elements which we as a nation have to confront. As much as people are hurting at the moment, it will not be the last time, as it is not the first time. Our thoughts go out to them. I acknowledge the assistance that the government has given. We welcome that, but what will be welcome most of all to them, of course, will be the drought-breaking rains.</para><para>At the same time as we talk about the drought we also have to acknowledge the national impact of the bushfires in this country. They have come again, but earlier this time. I was out the other day with some firefighters in the Canberra district who, as volunteers, fought the fires here this time last year. As much as we recognise the great effort that the volunteers have given and will continue to give in serving over Christmas, we remember last Christmas when they were called out on Christmas Day. We hope it is an easy time for them because, if that is the case, it means that families will not be threatened in the same way as they were over the last Christmas periodâinstead of celebrating, they were wondering what was happening to their possessions, their homes and indeed their lives.</para><para>It is also important to acknowledge the Australian troops who are overseas in Bougainville, in the Solomons and in East Timor. Fortunately, the SAS troops in Afghanistan, the 3rd Division, will be returning home. They will arrive next Thursday and will have the opportunity to spend time with their families. But those people serving in the peacekeeping operations in the Middle East and in Africa and our naval personnel in the Gulf will not have the opportunity to spend Christmas and the festive season with their loved ones, and our thoughts go out to them.</para><para>I thank my colleagues on our side of the House. I thank my deputy, Jenny Macklin. She has been a fantastic deputy and has been overseeing our policy development. I genuinely appreciate the loyalty that has been given by her, as I do that of my frontbench and my parliamentary colleagues. I do not single out any particular class because all of them are important, all of them make up the great thing that is the Labor caucusâthe vigour of it, the differences in it and the capacity to resolve those differences. The great thing about the caucus this year has been its capacity to deal with difficult issues, to have our differences, to resolve them and then to accept the decision. To Jenny, Ross and family: I wish you a very merry Christmas. I know that you will be covering for me for a few weeks, but that goes with the job of deputy. To all of my frontbench colleagues and caucus: I wish you the very best also.  </para><para>Of course, I want to pay particular attention to Wayne Swan as the Manager of Opposition Business in the House. It is actually a great job. It gives plenty of opportunity and plenty of scope but it also gives a few headaches in the need to take strategic decisions at the appropriate time. Wayne has been terrific in the task and I genuinely thank him for that. It is an important function in the parliament, and I acknowledge that on the other side that task is equally as important. To you, Tony: I wish you well over Christmas as well. To the whips, Janice and your team, Michael and Harry: you are the ones who make this place flow in an organisational sense. The three of you have performed fantastically in the job and I pay particular tribute to you. All of us on this side of the House appreciate the way in which the whips' office is run. It rules with an iron fist, I might say.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PG6</name.id><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Macklin</name></talker><para>âThe velvet glove.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>âIn the nicest way. It is the velvet glove; that is exactly right. Mr Speaker, I think that yours is a difficult task in the parliament. It has not been without complaint from our side. I am sure it has not been without complaint from the other side too. I make the point that, at the beginning of the year, we made a genuine effort to improve the function of your role by advocating that there be an independent speaker and by being prepared to support you in that regard. We also proposed some important changes to the way in which the parliament functions not just in relation to question time but, importantly, around question time. This would be a better place if those recommendations were adopted. It is a pity that, despite the Prime Minister saying at the beginning of the year that he would take those recommendations on board, they have not been followed up. They should be. The place would run better. Mr Speaker, I wish you and Carolyn the very best over the festive season. We will no doubt continue to have our disagreements, but that is what comes from trying to make a government accountable. In circumstances where we feel the frustration in that role, at various times it will spill over into the way rulings are made and the way the House operates.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to say thanks particularly to the staff of the parliament, to Ian and to Bernard. I wish Bernard well in his recovery. The place is not right without him. I was sorry to hear about his injury, but I know that he is recovering well. The attendants, the staff in the Clerk's office, the Bills and Papers Office, the Table Office, the research staff, the Parliamentary Library and the Serjeant-at-Arms and his office all make the parliament function, and they do a great job. We thank them for all their service over the course of the year. There are the Joint House staff as well, who service us and enable the House to function: the cleaners; the gardeners; the marketing and visitors staff, who do a great job with the schools that come through the place; the security staff, who have had a very difficult time over recent months; the switchboard staff who have to field all the calls; and the Health and Recreation Centre staff. It is good to get down there with them in the morning and practise some sparring in a different capacity. The facility is important to the members. The way in which they carry out their function and the individualism of the place is terrific. To the staff in the dining room who look after us, to Kate and her team, a genuine thanks. They are always pleasant. We turn up at different times of the night, expect to be fed and complain when it is not good enough. The staff do it with grace. We do not complain too often. Kate and her staff do a great job. We thank all the services in the building for the way in which they carry out their duties.</para><para>I want to thank my staff. There are too many to mention, but I will mention Chief of Staff Phil Tardif. He has been with me for a long time now and a more loyal servant you could not find. Karina, my personal assistant, has been with me for practically all the time I have been in the parliament. All of them play a great roleânot just my staff but the staff of the shadow ministry. They are a great and dedicated team, they work well together and they will have plenty to do next year. </para><para>It is the end of a turbulent year, but it has been a year on which we can reflect. Hopefully, we can learn from it and determine to do better next year, not just for ourselves but for the community at large. We are here not for ourselves but to serve the people who elect us. I believe that being a member of parliament is a great and noble cause. To put yourself forward in public office invites criticism and blame but it also gets accolades when you get it right. All of us understand the importance of that role.</para><para>To the constituents, not just in our own electorates, who get in touch with us, I urge them to continue to communicate with us. Many people who send us emails and letters comment about what we are doing, suggest how we can do it differently and congratulate us when we do it right. That is a very important part of the democratic process. Whilst people might think at times that we do not take terribly much notice of what people communicate to us, we do. I certainly do. I place great importance on the views, aspirations and concerns that people have. So, on behalf of the opposition, I wish all Australians the very best over the festive season. I wish them a happy and safe season, one which gives them the opportunity to get together with family and to reflect on not just what this year has held but also what the new one holds for them. It has been a great privilege to serve in this parliament. As leader of the Australian Labor Party, it gives me great pleasure to wish everyone, on behalf of that party, the very best for Christmas and the New Year.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>10362</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support this motion. As he departs, for reasons he has explained, I extend to the Prime Minister and his wife, Janette, Julia's and my best wishes for the Christmas season. I have enjoyed very much being in harness with him over this year. I know that I speak for all members of this place when I say we recognise very much the responsibilities of leadership that fall to him at a tough and uncertain time in Australia's history.</para></talk.start><para>Shortly after Bali, I addressed a group of high school students in my electorate, in Gunnedah. They were concerned and disturbed by what had happened, as are all Australians. I asked them who they felt was responsible for ensuring the security of the nation in the future. They responded, `The government,' not surprisingly. It is of course the Prime Minister who heads that up. That important responsibility falls on his shoulders. I know that he has the very strong support of the Australian people in pursuing that end. I made this comment yesterday, and I make it again today: in the context of the Australian community, given that leadership is about drawing people along with you and taking people with you, it requires a capacity to seek to walkâin the saying that the Irish put to usâa mile in another person's shoes so that you understand their perspective, even if subsequently you do beg to differ. Understanding people and the Australian psyche and mood is very important to leadershipâand the PM does that superbly.</para><para>This year began with recovery workers still clearing the rubble from the World Trade Centre site in New York. It ends with the cruelest drought of all, because it is a drought that interrupts the strongest recovery in rural fortunes that I can remember in my 46 years. It was the Year of the Outback. It began with high hopes, high commodity prices and the celebration of the achievements of rural Australia; it ends ends, quite frankly, in the shattering of hope for many rural families. I only hope that good rains restore that hope very shortly.</para><para>Bali, which has been referred to, changed the way we feel about ourselves. I was interested in and to some extent concerned byâalthough I understand itâthe work done by Clemengers which shows that Australians have reacted to the Bali tragedy by coming to the view that it changes the idea that Australia is a sanctuary, that somehow we are beyond reach, and that we are safe. They say that we have no sanctuary anymore. That is the insidious and evil aspect of a highly mobile force for darkness called terrorism. Just as we move around the world freelyâand younger Australians move around even more freely than Australians did when I was in my early 20s backpacking my way around Europeâunfortunately so do terrorists. In that sense, we are a global community confronted by a global problem, and we all have to be involved in the struggle against it. I know that will weigh heavily on many over Christmas who have lost loved ones. </para><para>I was particularly reminded that that pain does not ease quickly when I was with the member for Hinkler recently at Childers, where we opened the restored backpackers motel. There were parents and loved ones of those who had been lost there, from Australia and other parts of world, some two years after the tragedy, who struck me as being still deeply saddened. In some cases, they were still as emotional as those people that the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and I met in Bali. Our thoughts do go out to those who have lost people they love.</para><para>I thank the Prime Minister and wish him and his wife all the best. I do that on behalf of myself, the National Party and all of those who sit on this side. I know that the Leader of the Opposition has spoken for his party. Mr Speaker, I extend those wishes to you and Carolyn as well. She is in the gallery, if my eyesight does not fail me. You have a difficult task; it is a high office. You are an ambassador in many ways for this parliament and frequently for the nation. You discharge that with great distinction. I would like to thank Mark Vaile, my deputy. It has been fun working with the Prime Minister this year, but it has been fun working with Mark as well. Mark is a great fellow, and I wish him and Wendy all the very best for a good time over Christmas and a chance to recharge the batteries. Mark does an extraordinary amount of travelling. I believe he has assumed a mantle of leadership in his responsibilities as trade minister, not just for this country but for all countries committed to a freer, more open system of trading. That is extraordinarily important to the Australian economy. It is very important to the farming sector in Australia.</para><para>This year we have been reminded of how valuable light is because we have seen darkness. One of the things it is important for us to remember is that, wherever we are not acting appropriately internationally, we ought to be prepared to face that. I believe that the trading practices some supposedly free-enterprise Western societies engage in do discriminate against the less fortunate in the worldânot just Australia's efficient exportersâbecause they restrict opportunities for those people who desperately need trading opportunities to break out of their constricted circumstances. I believe that very strongly. Trade reform benefits the weak, the vulnerable and those who might be drawn into the orbit of people with less than healthy attitudes towards life, society and others.</para><para>I thank the Clerk, Ian Harris, his fellows and their families for their work and wish them all very best. I join with the Prime Minister in thanking the Australian Federal Police for all of their work on behalf of the nation in some of the world's trouble spots and also here at home. I thank the Prime Minister's protective team. In all, the Prime Ministerâcounting his leave at the beginning of the yearâhas left me with the keys no less than eight times this year. During those times, his team have also looked after me. They are a great group of Australians. We have had some fun together as well, out in the backblocksâsometimes at the expense of their state counterparts. One particularly notable occasion was when we were belting along a bush road and the state police lost their car on a gravel road. There was immense rivalry and ribaldry, which continues to this day, between the state and the Federal Police over that particular issue.</para><para>I would like also to thank my principal adviser, Peter Langhorne. Three members of my staff have recently left: Jenny Morris, Jessica Maine and Rhonda Le Nevez. Rhonda has taken up a posting with her husband overseas, with DFAT. I thank, too, the Federal President of the National Party, Helen Dickie, and Andrew Hall, the Federal Director. I acknowledge the hard work that they do and the role they play in ensuring that I speak here and that I have a team and a party behind me. I certainly wish all of them, as I wish all of my Liberal colleagues, all the very best for Christmas. I thank my wife, Julia. All of our partners wear the pain and difficulty that our lives in this occupation can bring. As in the cliched and hackneyed old saying, they keep the home fires burning. We appreciate that very much, I know. I do thank Julia and acknowledge what she has put up with for my sake in recent times. </para><para>In the context of the drought, I also thank my farm manager. Those of you who know me would recognise how passionately committed I am to my own place. He has had the very difficult task of keeping it togetherâas so many farmers haveâover the years, and he is a fine Australian. I acknowledge the very valuable role he has performed in enabling me, as much as anything else, to keep doing what I do.</para><para>To the Leader of the Opposition and to the Deputy Leader of the Oppositionâshe and I have something of an understanding of the challenge of the role that deputyship brings with it, and we have quipped about it from time to timeâI extend the greetings of the season. I wish them, in a personal sense, all the very best and, in a political sense, not too much of the best. Nonetheless, it is important for us to have a good opposition to take up the fight and to highlight the issues. That would be a good objective for next year. Christmas is a chance to spend some time with our families and to look beyond the events of the year to one that occurred a very long time ago beneath a star outside an inn. Mr Speaker, I wish you and all honourable members the very best for Christmas and a prosperous and happy 2003.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>10364</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased to join with the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in wishing all members of the parliament, both in the House and in the Senate, and everybody who works here the very best for Christmas and the new year. It is at this time of year, when most of us are going off and enjoying a break with our families, that I am sure we would all want to extend our thoughts and sympathies to those families around Australia who will have an empty place at the table on Christmas Day. The tragic loss of life in Bali has been keenly felt by all Australians but no more than by those who lost loved ones in that terrible event. We know that that sense of loss and grief will be particularly bad at this time of year, and our hearts go out to them.</para></talk.start><para>The Deputy Prime Minister talked about the people in Bali, the young people who lost their lives and the impact that that may have, particularly on young people. On a happier note, one of the things I take great heart in is seeing the way young people can bounce back from these terrible events. From my personal experience, it is wonderful to see young people heading off at this timeâone of my own children is about to head off overseas for this university breakâand to see the way they are able to take on the challenges of the world and not be deterred by the actions of terrorists who we know have done so much damage. We know there are going to be a lot of other people who are suffering over Christmas. Some of them are families who still have people in hospital, and our thoughts go out to all of them.</para><para>It is also important for us to think about those who will be working over this time, particularly those people in our hospitals who will be dedicating their time and care not only to the people who were injured in Bali but also to the many others who, whether through accident or illness, will spend Christmas in hospital. Our thanks go out to all of the people who are prepared to give up their Christmas Day and not spend the time with their families, as we will all enjoy doing. There are a lot of other people who will be working over the Christmas period, and all of us rely on their hard work. There is an army of unsung heroesâthe people who actually keep things operating while we all try to have a holiday. Whether they be people delivering things such as gifts or flowers, people cleaning and catering or shopkeepers, they will be working day and night to keep all of our essential services going.</para><para>The ones we hope will not have to swing into gear, although we have seen a lot of them latelyâand others have already mentioned it tonightâare the firefighters. We need to pay tribute to the enormous and hard work done by volunteers and to those who have already been out fighting the bushfires. We all say thank you, especially to the volunteer firefighters, who do so much. I say a special word of thanks to the volunteer firefighters in my own electorate, who unfortunately have had to regularly troop up to New South Wales to help out. Last summer many of them were away from their families over Christmas, and I very much hope that the fires abate and that all firefighters will be able to be with their families this summer. Many of you would know that I am a bit of a fanatical surfer. I thank all of those who work on the beaches: the lifesavers, those who save us from the terrible things in the sea that sting and those who patrol our beaches. There are also those who do a wonderful job looking after those who do not have a home and who need food and shelter at what can be a very lonely time. Our thoughts go out to all of those volunteers. </para><para>I thank all of my colleagues. There is nothing like the Australian Labor Party caucus. We are a very tight-knit group, and all of us know that it has been a very tough year on this side of the parliament. I think everyone in the parliament knows what opposition is like, and the first year after an election defeat is always difficult. I think the Prime Minister would agree that the toughest job of all in the parliament is that of the Leader of the Opposition. I think we have the toughest Leader of the Opposition this country has seen. He shows enormous guts and determination in leading our party, and we all thank him very much for that. We all hope he has a very peaceful break over the next few weeks and that nothing bad happens while I have to look after the show!</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has been ably assisted by the Manager of Opposition Business, Wayne Swan, who is an extraordinarily hard workerâas well as a terrier, as the government well knows. The Chief Opposition Whip is a fantastic person to work with, and the staff in both Wayne's and Janice's offices also do a wonderful job, not only in supporting the opposition but in helping the parliament to run smoothly. I say a special thank you to Joan and Courtney in Janice's and Wayne's offices. I gather Joan's voice is almost gone so we certainly wish her a very relaxing break. She keeps us all very well organised. I would like to say a special thank you to my own staff both here in Canberra and in my electorate. They do an outstanding job; they are totally dedicated and nobody could wish for a more talented group of people. To the people in the Australian Labor Party, so well led by Geoff Walsh: we appreciate your creativity and your dedication to seeing the Labor Party continues its success all around the country and sometime soon, we hope, federally.</para><para>To you, Mr Speaker: I know I sometimes test your patience. Some of my constituents say they hear the member for Jagajaga being asked to sit down or be quiet a bit too often but I know you mean it well. I do thank you for your patience and dedication to the task, and I thank all of your staff for trying to keep us in order; we know that it is not always an easy task. Oppositions of any political persuasion are, as is the government, always very keen on robust political debate, and we are certainly no exception. I know that can sometimes be difficult both for you and the clerks and the staff of the parliament. We do not make any apology for that; I am sure it will continue, but we do thank you for working with us. To all the staff of the parliament, whether they are the clerks and their staff, Hansard, the Comcar drivers, the people who organise our travel, the library, the cleaners, the attendants, the maintenance workers, the security staffâthere are enormous numbers of people who keep this place functioning so well. We wish them all the very best for Christmas.</para><para>We go into this break with the shadow of international conflict hanging over us. This is a time when we often talk about peace, but I am sure I speak for all of us here when I say tonight that our hope is very much for peace to prevail in the world. I do hope that we have a very happy summer break and that we look forward to a very prosperous and peaceful 2003.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>10365</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI should begin these comments by letting people know where the House's business is at. My understanding is that the Senate hopes to have a message back to us by about 7.30 p.m. and I hope that we might be able to deal with that, have a dinner adjournment of about an hour and a half and then come back to deal with further matters as required. That is my understanding of where things are at. Obviously the House will be updated as things develop. </para></talk.start><para>It has been a tough year; it has been a tough year for Australia, and obviously it has been the toughest year of all for the relatives and friends of the victims of Bali. I suspect that most of them are bearing their loss with the grit and stoicism traditionally associated with the Australian character, but I do hope that the knowledge that 20 million Australians are feeling for them and grieving with them sustains them at this time. It has been a hard year for Australia and therefore it has been a hard year for the parliament. The vicissitudes of our national life, one way or another, are always reflected in this place. It has also been a year, as I understand it, when the parliament has made a bit of history. The stem cell debateâremarkably conducted in a great spirit of generosity and bipartisanship on both sides of the issue, which is rareâis, I believe, the longest debate that this House, indeed this parliament, has ever had. It showed us at our best. I am not sure that we were necessarily at our best at all other times.</para><para>Mr Speaker, it is appropriate at this time for me, as Manager of Government Business, to thank you and the others who fill the chair of this place for your hard work. I know it is your profound and heartfelt wish that we in this chamber should dwell more on the things that unite us and less on the things that divide us and that we should see more of the better angles of our nature in evidence here. I think it is pretty obvious, from what has transpired in the House over the last hour or so, that we do not, as members of parliament, dislike each other as much as our daily conduct would suggest. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, I fear your hopes will be dashed next year as they have been this year. I fear that the feral quality of modern Australian politics will persist, despite the hopes of so many people.</para><para>It is also appropriate for me to add my word of thanks to all the other people who allow our parliamentary proceedings to take place, particularly the clerks, led by Ian Harris and Bernie Wright, who are, I suspect, the truest and the most devoted guardians of the traditions of this place. They do a magnificent job and the nation ought to be grateful. The rest of the team that keeps the parliament goingâthe sergeant and the sergeant's office, the attendants, the APS personnel, the librarians, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters, the gardeners, the staff who keep the building looking beautifulâall deserve our gratitude. We tend to take them for granted. We should not, but we do. Let us at least acknowledge them now.</para><para>As Leader of the House, I should also add a particular word of thanks to the Government Whip's Office, led very well by the member for Robertson and assisted magnificently by the member for Gilmore. I also add a special word of thanks and gratitude to the member for Corangamite, the sharpest eye and the fastest counter in the business of the parliamentâthanks very much. If your eyes could get just a bit sharper and your hearing just a bit more acute and your counting just a bit quicker in the new year, we will all be thrilled. But you do a fantastic job, Stewie, as you are.</para><para>I should offer a word of thanks and pay tribute to my opposite number, the Manager of Opposition Business. I am not going to exonerate the member for Lilley from his various political crimes. Nevertheless, I think he has done a good job as Manager of Opposition Business. You can always have a conversation with him. He does not play games. If he agrees to something, he sticks to his agreement. He has been a very straight and straightforward Manager of Opposition Business. For me, it has been a pleasure to deal with him.</para><para>I was very conscious at the start of the year, when the Prime Minister made me Leader of the House, that I was slipping into pretty big shoes. Peter Reith was a giant parliamentary personality as well as being a leading member of this government. I probably should say that the mistakes and the misjudgments that I have made over the past 12 months are entirely my own but, to the extent that I have developed any ability and sure-footedness in this role, it is almost entirely due to the extraordinarily good advice of the Deputy Leader of the House, the member for Gippsland. I am sorry he is not here today. If the House was not conducted as well as it normally is, it is probably because I have been missing his good counsel today. He does a very good job, and his experience is much appreciated. </para><para>Finally let me say that I am very proud to be a member of parliament. I am even prouder to be a minister in this government. Notwithstanding the inevitable human error, it is a pretty damn good government and I think history will be pretty kind to it. Along with my parliamentary seniors, I thank you, Mr Speaker, and everyone else associated with the running of the parliament. I wish all my colleagues a very happy and perhaps even a holy Christmas.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>10367</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to wish every member of this parliament the best for the festive season. As a number of speakers have referred to tonight, it has been a tough year for the country and a particularly tough year for those families who are so affected by the events in Bali. If there was one event this year that reinforced for me the enormous responsibility we have to our community and to our country, it was the memorial service here in the Great Hall some months ago. It said to me that we were living in a new environment in this country and that that environment was something that would be affecting us for many years to come and particularly affecting the futures of not only the country but also our young people and our children. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Jenny Macklin, said before, it is the young people of this country who will live with the consequences of the decisions that we take in this area. I know that each and every member of this parliament takes their responsibilities in that area extremely seriously.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Speaker, I wish to thank you for your guidance throughout this year. I have appreciated the patience with which you have dealt with us as an opposition. I know you are reminded on a daily basis that the standing orders can be frustrating, and I know that will not change in the near future. However, I certainly reiterate that those on this side of the House do remain committed to fundamental parliamentary reform. We will continue to work for that. We hope that we can achieve some of those reforms in the year ahead, and I certainly do look forward to talking to the government and to the manager of government business about those matters in the New Year. I recognise that the government, initially, was favourably inclined to some reform. We will certainly continue to argue for it because, in so doing, we will make this parliament a better parliamentâand we might just make your job, Mr Speaker, a little easier.</para><para>Let me also thank the Leader of the House. I have found him to be a straightforward and forthright person whom you can deal with. That has been appreciated. I, like he, have come to this job for the first time, and I recognise that I have a lot to learn. I have certainly appreciated the assistance of many of my colleaguesâfrom the Leader of the Opposition, who is a former Manager of Opposition Business in this House, through to the member for Fraser and the member for Perth. We do not always get it right in this House, and we certainly do need the advice of many so we can do our job as best and as effectively as we can.</para><para>I would also like to pay tribute to the highly efficient and effective support network that ensures our successful legislative process. There are many people who provide daily assistance to me, to the opposition and to the parliament, and they should be mentioned. I am particularly thankful for the guidance and assistance of Ian Harris and Bernard Wright and all the staff from the Clerk's office. I especially wish to thank Judy Middlebrook and her team in the chamber research office who provide terrific and swift information, and Alistair Sherwin and his staff. They all continue to work tirelessly in pulling the legislative schedule togetherâand at no time will that be better demonstrated than tonight and the events which will occur in this parliament over the next few hours. They work hard and they work long hours, but they are committed to this parliament.</para><para>I would particularly like to pay tribute to the Leader of the Opposition. He is tenacious and he has worked hard. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, he has the toughest job in Australian politicsâprobably the toughest job in the country. It is not easy in opposition, as the current Prime Minister knows. Importantly, you need to work hard, be tenacious and be forthright. I would also like to thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her support and her friendship. She too has been working very hard behind the scenes, particularly in our policy process, to make sure that we are a very effective opposition. I would also like to thank the Chief Opposition Whip. She has tutored me on many occasions, and I have been a better person for it. I know there are many members of the caucus who appreciate the backup of our Whip and her staff, particularly Joan. </para><para>I would also like to thank my own staffâCourtney, particularly, and also Matt, Michael and all of the staff in the electoral office. There is an enormous amount of pressure that comes with our new role. It involves working with many people on many difficult issues, and they have laboured long and mightily. Their efforts and commitment are deeply appreciated. I should also mention our two assistant whipsâHarry Quick and Michael Danby. They have worked hard, particularly when it comes to organising the affairs of the Main Committee.</para><para>As we are about to enter this break for Christmas, I wish each and every member of this parliament and all of the staff who work so hard to make this the effective parliament that it is all the best for Christmas. I also thank my familyâmy wife Kim and my three childrenâfor their forbearance and patience. They put up with a lot. I think that is true of the families of all members of parliamentâalthough in my case it is a hell of a lot. But that is true not only of the families of members of parliament but also of the families of everybody who works here. The pressures between our working life and our family life just seem to grow, and we should not forget the sacrifices that our families make so that we are allowed to, in some ways, indulge ourselves in the passion of our work. Our families are all part and parcel of that, and at this time of year it is appropriate that we thank them for that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>10368</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to thank members for their remarks and to associate Carolyn and I and my office and the staff of Parliament House with the remarks that have been made. As everyone has rightly observed, this has been an extraordinary year. This will be a year in which Christmas is particularly poignant for a number of familiesâas stressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and by others who have spokenâwhen around the table they have an empty seat. If Bali taught us one thing, I believe it is that we are actually quite a unique nation and there is a level of cohesiveness about this nation that frequently is not widely understood. It seems to me that what has emerged out of the Australian psycheâto pick up a term used by the Deputy Prime Ministerâhas been an underlying sense of gratitude on the part of Australians that they are in fact Australians and gratitude for the history and background which has ensured that our nation has emerged as it is.</para></talk.start><para>It is perhaps also poignant to remember that this time last year, while we were reflecting on the awful tragedy of the twin towers events in New York, we were also remembering that 2001 had been a year of celebration for Australians as we recognised the Centenary of Federation. It is fair, I think, to observe 101 years later that our nation was 101 years ago the envy of much of the world and that 101 years later it remains the envy of much of the world. That is not extraordinarily a credit to the parliament, but it is extraordinarily a credit to the Australian people. It is a fair indication that whoever has been in office in this great institution over that 101 years has managed at least to reflect the will of the Australian people and offer guidance and ensure that we have enjoyed 101 years of prosperity that makes us, as I said, the envy of much of the world.</para><para>There are thoseânot those in the parliament but those outside of itâwho would observe that this opportunity at the end of each year to express goodwill to each other is somehow uncharacteristic of the parliament. I take issue with them, actually. This parliament is much more a place of goodwill than is recognised, and everyone in this parliament is passionate about peace. The goodwill is often exhibited when members are on committees, in meeting rooms around this place and from time to time in this chamberâbut is all too rarely portrayed realistically in the Australian community. </para><para>I want to join all others in extending seasons greetings to all of those who make it possible for us to do our work and make it possible for us to have the relationships we enjoy across the parliament. They have all been named by previous speakers, so I will not name them. Many of the team on which we are so reliant are people we do not frequently see. They work under the building; they work in offices that are not frequently seen; they work long hoursâand we all stand indebted to them.</para><para>I do, however, want to single out one or two people, and I am sure you will understand why. I want to express the sentiments of everyone in this chamber to those in the Senate, but most particularly to the Senate President. Some people may not know, but the Senate President in fact suffered the loss of his mother yesterday morning, so, for him, Christmas this year will be a little different. I want the Senate President to know that all of those who are aware of that will in fact be identifying with him and his family in their grief. I know that, when I spoke to him this morning, he was conscious of the number of colleagues who had contacted him and had been supportive of him.</para><para>It would also be appropriate for me on this occasion to acknowledge the support I received as Speaker of the House of Representatives from Senator Reid, when she was President of the Senate, and the way in which she so sensitively and professionally allowed us to go about our mutual roles, to respect the sovereignty of each of our chambers and yet also to ensure that there was an opportunity for us jointly to be involvedâI hope effectivelyâin the management of this place.</para><para>I cannot, as the Speaker, express this sort of sentiment without recognising, as everyone else has, the remarkable role played by the clerks and the staff in the Clerk's office. I join everyone else in expressing our appreciation to Ian, Bernie and their team, and in expressing our best wishes to Bernie at this time. I am also indebted, as the Speaker, to the departmental heads who make it possible for this building and its offices to function as they do. I am extraordinarily indebted, of course, to my own staff. Marie, who is known to everybody, Pauline, Barb and Dennis all work part time in Canberra, although Dennis is full time with his electoral responsibilities as well. Yvonne and Peter are the full-time people. I want to single out Mr Peter Gibson, who will be known to you all, for the extraordinary support that he gives to me and to people who make inquiries of my office.</para><para>I also would be failing in my duty if I did not recognise the extraordinary support that I have had from the Deputy Speaker. Deputy Speaker Causley has not been well, as many members know. He is making an encouraging recovery and expects to be back with us when we recommence in February, so we wish him well. In his absence, I have been utterly reliant on Deputy Speaker Jenkins, and it will not be a surprise to anyone in this chamber to known that Deputy Speaker Jenkins has been a pivotal member of the team and totally cooperative. I want to express my appreciation to him and my best wishes to him and his family. I want to recognise the role played by all in the Speaker's panel in helping to ensure that the parliament runs efficiently.</para><para>I should recognise the role, of course, of my Gawler staff. None of us could be here without each of our electorate staff. I want to express to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business in the House my appreciation for their sentiments. As they have observed, the view from this chair is a little different to the view from any other chair of the parliament, and this is a place in which there is a great deal more cooperation and goodwill, as I said earlier, than is popularly believed. When there are occasions where members are passionate, I remind the electorate that that is precisely what they elected their representatives to be. I remind the schools that I visit that, whether members sit on my right or my left, they are charged with representing at least 80,000 Australian constituents who have elected them all to be here. They are charged with ensuring that transparency is a key word in Australian parliaments so that the hundred years of relative prosperity that we have enjoyed can be projected into the future. </para><para>Finally, let me thank my family. As has been said, Carolyn, my wife, is in the gallery. Those of you who know my family will know that what seems to be the relative stability in the family would not have occurred without her total commitment to it. That has allowed me to do the things I have wanted to do, so I stand indebted to you, darling, for your assistance. Thank you.

The report I have just tabled provides members with a number of documents for their information. The committee considers it will be helpful to make witnesses and others who may be involved with the committee aware of the procedures under which the committee will operate. The first of the documents attached with this report is procedures which the committee will adhere to when undertaking its inquiries. Earlier this year, the committee considered undertaking an inquiry into the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The act has been in place since 1987 and the committee thought it might be timely to conduct a review of the operation of the act to ensure its provisions were meeting current requirements of providing the protection of privilege to the House. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The committee prepared a paper which commented both on the operation of the provisions of the act and on areas that may be relevant to the law of privilege that are not covered by the act. The paper examined cases of the House and Senate committees of privileges and relevant court cases. The committee decided not to proceed with a review of the act. However, it considered that the paper was a useful reference to make available for the information of members. It is the second paper attached to this report. Finally, attached to the report are draft guidelines for members on the status and handling of their records and correspondence.</para><para>In November 2000, the committee presented a report on the legal status of the records and correspondence of members. In that report the committee indicated that it would prepare draft guidelines to assist members with issues that arise from their records and correspondence. The status of these records, particularly the correspondence with constituents, has been of considerable concern to members. The guidelines are designed to help members navigate the maze of issues that can arise when there is a threat to the confidentiality and integrity of their communications with constituents. The committee has issued the guidelines as a draft for discussion and comment. The committee would welcome comment on the guidelines from members and others who may wish to make a contribution. The committee intends to hold a workshop in the new year to enable those with an interest to discuss and refine the guidelines. The committee will then prepare a final version of the guidelines.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title><type>Delegation Reports</type><page.no>10371</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Egypt, September 2002</title><page.no>10371</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>10371</page.no><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name><name.id>OT4</name.id><electorate>La Trobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI present the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Egypt's report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australia and Egypt: a parliamentary perspective</inline>, and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>OT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name></talker><para>âI am pleased to present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation which visited Egypt in September. Our report outlines the information we gathered during our visit along with our observations based on that information. We were fortunate during our visit to meet with a number of senior representatives of the Egyptian government and parliament, including the foreign minister, the Minister for Supply and Home Trade and the senior adviser to the Egyptian president. We also met with the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States. As a result of those meetings, we have come away with a good understanding of the views that exist within Egypt on significant events currently unfolding in the Middle East. The discussions at those meetings are summarised in the report which I have presented today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Two key issues are currently influencing events and attitudes in Egypt. Firstly, the war on terrorism, and, secondly, the Israeli-Palestinian situation. Those issues were raised time and time again during the meetings we held in Cairo. Our report details current Egyptian views on both those issues. One of the clear messages from those meetings is that peace is vital for regional stability and the economic development of the Middle East. Within Egypt, there are significant concerns about the possibility of escalating conflict in the region and how this will impact on all the nations of the region. The delegation was told on numerous occasions that Egypt welcomes Australia's interest in the region and hopes that Australia, with its history of involvement in peacekeeping efforts around the world, can play a constructive role in helping to bring peace to the region.</para><para>During our visit, we had the opportunity to hear about one peace initiative that is working in the Middle East; namely, the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. We met with representatives of the multinational force and observers, including the Australian contingent commander. The multinational force plays a significant role in helping to maintain the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, and we congratulate the Australian Defence Force personnel who are making such a vital contribution. The success of that treaty arrangement indicates to the delegation that there are models for peace in the Middle East which are viable and enduring. Political will and broad international support are the two critical factors. </para><para>Another important emphasis of the delegation was to examine ways in which the bilateral relationship between Australia and Egypt can be strengthened. The healthy trading links that we enjoy with Egypt were discussed at various meetings we attended. Egyptian representatives praised the quality of Australian produce exported to Egypt, particularly Australian wheat and meat. The reliability of Australian exporters in delivering produce and goods was seen as a particular benefit of trading with Australia. The delegation was told that Egypt was keen to provide Australia with greater market access for its wheat. At the same time, Egypt is seeking greater trade with Australia in relation to some of its goods, such as furniture and citrus products. Future trading and investment opportunities were also discussed, with agribusiness, oil exploration and production, and information technology and communications being areas that show potential.</para><para>The delegation was pleased to inspect one current joint venture in Egyptâthe Five Star Flour Mill at the Red Sea port of Adabiya, which involves an investment of $11 million by the Australian Wheat Board. That mill is regarded as a very positive sign of Australia's commitment to broadening our bilateral relationship with Egypt.</para><para>As part of its visit, the delegation was also honoured to lay wreaths at the Commonwealth War Cemetery at El Alamein. In the year that we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein, we were keen to pay tribute to the many Australians who lost their lives so that we could live in peace. In the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice, our efforts should always be directed to peace.</para><para>In conclusion, let me express our appreciation for the warm welcome we received in Egypt from the representatives of the Egyptian government and parliament. Let me also congratulate Australia's Ambassador to Egypt, Robert Newton, for the good work that he and his staff are undertaking in enhancing Australia's bilateral relationship with Egypt. I thank Ambassador Newton and our liaison officer during the visit, Melissa Bray, for the effort they devoted to our program and for helping to secure such high-level and significant meetings for the delegation. Thanks are also due to the Parliamentary Relations Office, particularly Russell Chafer, for their contribution. </para><para>The delegation is hopeful that our report will contribute to a better understanding in this parliament of the importance of our bilateral relationship with Egypt. We are also hopeful that our visit has helped to show the significance with which Australia views that relationship. I thank the committee's secretary, Andres Lomp, for an excellent report. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>10372</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâThe Australian delegation to Egypt in September 2002 created considerable interest in Egyptian government circles and the Egyptian press due no doubt to the continuing conflict in Palestine and the Australian Prime Minister's support for an American pre-emptive strike against Iraq. Because of this climate, the Australian delegation met a number of senior Egyptian government and parliamentary representatives, including: Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher; Dr Osama El-Baz, Senior Adviser to Egyptian President Mubarak; and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, Mr Amr Moussa.</para></talk.start><para>The delegation on a number of occasions was unexpectedly confronted by the Egyptian press, which required the leader of the delegation, the member for La Trobe, to carefully respond to the many questions relating to Australia's policy on Iraq and the Middle East in general. Mr Charles responded very professionally to these approaches. The Egyptian representatives expressed the view that, with their economy relying very much on the tourist trade, they were strongly opposed to any military activity that would lead to regional instability. Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher and President Mubarak's senior adviser, Dr El-Baz, expressed concern about statements from the US polarising the world by categorising countries as either for or against the US. This created doubt in Middle East countries' minds whether they were considered friends or enemies of the US. </para><para>The Australian delegation reassured our Egyptian hosts that the Australian parliament did not have a fixed view on an American pre-emptive strike and that we supported a full and open debate in parliament before any decision was made by the Australian government. It was made clear to the delegation that Australia is well regarded in Egypt but that we should be mindful that inflammatory remarks such as those by the Prime Minister and the foreign minister could jeopardise that good standing in the longer term. Egypt and Australia have a long history of cooperation, and this delegation reinforced those links. Egypt ranks in the top 30 of our trading partners, with Australian exports to Egypt totalling around $740 million in 2001. Thousands of Australians visit Egypt each year, attracted by their rich culture and heritage, so there is much to be said for maintaining our strong bilateral links with that country.</para><para>When we visited the Australian Embassy, we saw long queues of people seeking information about travel to Australia, both as tourists and as migrants. The embassy in Cairo deals with some 2,500 inquiries each month. This shows not only that there is a great link between our two countries but that there is also a great deal of strain placed on resources at the embassy. Some thought should be given to increasing those resources. On the day we visited there were a large number of Somalis wishing to come to Australia. Increasing resources to process applications more efficiently at our overseas embassies, I am sure, would help to reduce the number of refugees arriving in Australia unauthorised.</para><para>As a small demonstration of the many and varied links between Egypt and Australiaâand, indeed, the diversity of both countriesâthe delegation visited with Pope Shenouda III's adviser, Father Mauritius, who is in fact an Australian. Pope Shenouda III is, as members would be aware, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church.</para><para>I am sure I speak for the other delegation members when I say that we were honoured to be able to lay a wreath at the memorial to the Australian fallen at El Alamein to mark the 60th anniversary of the battle that saw so much Australian loss of life. Australia and Egypt have a good and solid relationship, and our delegation's visit helped to reinforce that. I am sure that the reciprocal visit by Egyptian parliamentarians will also build on the links that we have. However, as the report shows, we should be cautious in our dealings in the Middle East or that solid relationship may diminish in the longer term. That would be a great shame.</para><para>The delegation was very appreciative of the briefing given by the Egyptian Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mr Assem Ahmed Megahed, prior to our visit as well as discussions on our return. I would like to thank my fellow delegation members and the parliamentary staff who accompanied us, as well as all those in Egypt who showed us such great hospitality. I also commend the report to the House.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>10373</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title><page.no>10373</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>10373</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>10373</page.no><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name><name.id>848</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I present the committee's report on the examination of annual reports for 2000-01, together with evidence received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>848</name.id><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name></talker><para>âby leaveâThe report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on the examination of annual reports for 2000-01 reviews the performance of the National Native Title Tribunal, the Indigenous Land Corporation and the land fund in the reporting period. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fund has a statutory duty to examine the annual report of the National Native Title Tribunal. This report is prepared pursuant to section 206(c) of the Native Title Act 1993. Section 206(c) of the act requires the committee to report at its discretion to both houses of parliament on matters concerning annual reports to which parliament's attention should be directed. This, the eighth annual report of the tribunal, covers the financial year 2000-01. It was presented out of session on 5 October 2001, and tabled in the Senate on 12 February 2002 and in the House of Representatives on 13 February 2002. To assist in its evaluation, the committee held public hearings in Canberra on 25 June 2002 for the National Native Title Tribunal and on 17 June for the Indigenous Land Corporation.</para><para>I would like to outline briefly some of the issues that have arisen in the course of the committee's perusal of the annual report for the National Native Title Tribunal. On the last occasion the committee expressed some disquiet about the number and level of consultants retained by the tribunal. The committee is pleased to note that expenditure on consultants has been reduced by $700,000 and that there has been a decrease from 43 to 15 consultants over the period 2001-02.</para><para>The tribunal has taken steps to increase the number of Indigenous land use agreements registered. In the previous reporting period the committee noted that a number of ILUAs presented for registration did not comply with the act. The tribunal has taken a number of initiatives, including the issuing of guidelines and early compliance checking to increase the compliance rate. The committee notes that these improvements have increased the cost to the tribunal of registering an ILUA but have increased the efficiency with which applications are moved through the process.</para><para>The committee also notes the efforts made by the tribunal to inform parties about native title generally and to provide appropriate material to assist this process. This material included a CD-ROM, a videotape and a number of question and answer booklets. The committee noted that the National Native Title Tribunal annual report covers the required reporting areas, and complies with the legislative and other formal requirements concerning the provision of annual reports. Overall I am pleased to report that the tribunal has again produced an informative and accessible annual report.</para><para>I now turn to the annual report of the Indigenous Land Corporation, which also includes the report on the operation of the Indigenous Land Fund. The corporation has a primary responsibility to assist Indigenous Australians to purchase land and also to assist in the management of Indigenous-held land. The corporation's annual reporting requirements can be found in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. The report for the year 2000-01 was provided to the minister on 27 August 2001, and tabled in the Senate on 15 February 2002 and in the House of Representatives on 13 February 2002.</para><para>The committee notes that the ILC has adopted suggestions made by the committee in its 18th report. These included a suggestion that the ILC return to the previous report format and include information about the factors to be accorded priority when the ILC exercises its land acquisition and management functions.</para><para>The ILC report notes that there was a decline in the number of properties approved for purchase, purchased and divested. The ILC explained that this was due to a revision of its major policies during the reporting period. However, there was also a decline in this activity in the period 1999-2000, and the committee expressed some concern on that occasion. The committee will continue to monitor this aspect of the ILC's work, and notes that the revised National Indigenous Land Strategy and the Land Acquisition and Land Management Programs Guide were launched on 4 December 2002. In the light of this the committee expects that the ILC will be able to devote more of its resources to these responsibilities. </para><para>The committee notes that the 2000-01 annual report confirms the committee's concerns regarding the ILC's financial performance over the last two years. The committee hopes that this trend has been reversed with the appointment of a new chairperson and that the 2001-02 annual report demonstrates an improvement in the performance of the corporation. The committee notes that the presentation of the annual report of the Indigenous Land Corporation complies with the legislative and other formal requirements.</para><para>Finally, I refer to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund report for 2000-01. The requirements for this report are established by section 193I of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. The report was provided to the minister on 15 October 2001, and was tabled in the Senate on 12 February 2002 and in the House of Representatives on 13 February 2002.</para><para>The Land Fund was established in the 1994-95 budget. In 2004 government allocations to the fund will cease, and the intention was that the capital base of the fund would be sufficient to guarantee ongoing operational funding for the ILC. The return on investment may not yet be sufficient to allow this to occur. The committee has noted that the target amount is assured by the Commonwealth.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE

Sydney, in support of the proposed disposal of surplus land. In 1990, the Defence Logistics Redevelopment Project was initiated to fundamentally reorientate the combined Australian Defence Force logistics and supply functions. This program consolidates the large military warehousing facilities throughout the Sydney metropolitan area, which had previously been independently operated by the services, into one joint warehouse facility at Moorebank in western Sydney. This strategy has resulted in the closure of 49 hectares of the former Navy Stores at Bundock Street, Randwick, as well as other large storage areas throughout Sydney. The remaining portion of approximately 20 hectares will continue to be occupied by Defence for the foreseeable future.</para><para>The proposal to undertake site remediation and infrastructure development of surplus land has been developed in close consultation with the Randwick City Council and is seen to offer significant advantages to the Commonwealth, the council, Sydney based development and construction industries and the wider community. The proposed works will be staged to achieve an orderly and economic development of the site and maximise revenue return. The proposed works will consist of demolition of the remaining structures and clearing of necessary vegetation to permit other works to be undertaken; bulk earthworks; remediation of the site, including decontamination, to allow residential usage; construction of trunk infrastructure, including drainage, roads, sewer, water and telecommunications; construction of a new oval; development of an environmental park; and construction of a new community facility for the City of Randwick.</para><para>The works are expected to generate employment for some 80 people directly engaged on site in construction or construction related activities. Other off-site employment opportunities will be generated in areas such as material supply and support, off-site fabrication, management and administration. The cost of the proposed works is estimated at $85.4 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence by June next year and be completed in 2006.

It has been indicated that these are necessary tidying up pieces of this legislation jigsaw, covering various parts of the Migration Act. I will deal with these measures seriatimâone at a time. The very first provision this bill deals with provides that non-citizen children born in Australia are immigration cleared for the purposes of their birth entry. This and all the other matters we are dealing with here relate to questions of clarification. The purpose of the bill is to make as clear as possible the intent of the original act, and its associated parts, for people who find themselves in particular situations or who are attempting to challenge decisions taken by the minister or his delegates. The bill also provides general information for the community at large. But the underlying and most important purpose of the bill is to ensure the integrity of our migration legislation, and that is often the most difficult part to ensure.</para></talk.start><para>I have had experience in dealing with migration matters over many yearsâsome 17 years all up, of which 11Â¼ years were spent running the former member's electoral office in Blaxland, which I then took over. I have a reasonable amount of knowledge of immigration matters and of what Labor did in government, particularly the 1990 act and the 1992 act which toughened up the approach to immigration policy and also added an enormous layer of complexity. I will come to that a bit later and particularly to the PAMS introduced by former Minister Hand, which were the immigration department equivalent of the GST act in terms of just how high they might rise on a table.  </para><para>In trying to ascertain certainty with regard to decisions taken by officers of the immigration department, everything had to be spelt out. When spelling everything out and in attempting to be as clear as crystal, everyone knows that that presents two significant problems. One is legalese or bureaucratese. The second is that, if you are trying to write it in plain, simple, straightforward Englishâlike they were attempting to rewrite the NRMA rules or parts of the parallel importation bill, I think it was, the other dayâit is very difficult to do, particularly when you are dealing with legal matters. This bill encompasses a range of particular legal matters with the attempt to clarify them. One of those goes to the question back in 1992 that Mr Hand was trying to deal withâto provide codification of the departmental processes of decision making. There has already been a related bill put to the House. It dealt in detail with those questions and it was directly related to procedural fairness and how you ensure that. I aim to come back to that in later comments. </para><para>There are challenges almost every day to decisions that have been taken by officers of the department. The challenges go to the point of what was meant in the original legislation. This government, like our government when it was dealing with these matters, has had to bring bills like this before the House to clarify such situations. I will give you an example of this. Whatever a person's status once they are in Australiaâwhether they are here on a tourist visa, a student visa or any other legal visaâif they give birth to a child in Australia then the question of the status of that child generally has been taken, in the past, and certainly in our legislation, to be one of equivalence to the status of the mother. We thought that was pretty clear. Given the length of time that people who are here unlawfully can be detained, there have been cases where people have had children in detention. This bill tries to fix the question of the legal situation for that child. </para><para>There has been an argument put, contrary to the department's expectation in terms of this, that the child's legal status should be different to that of the parent. Of course, going back a number of years, the classic case related to this was that of Nancy Presad. Her situation was that she had been born to parents who were not Australian citizens and the question was whether simply being born in Australia allowed her to achieve Australian citizenship. We know that that can be the situation in the United States, but in this case our courts held that it was not so. This bill clearly makes it known that, if a parent is immigration cleared and lawfully here, the child will be immigration cleared and lawfully here. Equally, if the person is held not to be immigration cleared, such as an asylum seeker in detention, this amendment provides that the child is not immigration cleared and that the child's immigration status will then be dealt with in the substantive visa application process. So there is an absolute equivalence between the status of the child and status of the parent: whether the status is lawful or unlawful, the child takes on the same status as the parent.</para><para>It is at this point that Labor's amendment to this bill becomes relevant. Whether a child has just been born in Australia to an unlawful non-citizenâthat is, an asylum seeker in detentionâor whether an older child accompanied that person to Australia, Labor's says that the regime needs to change. We need to take into account the situation of mothers and children. We need to have a very fast processing regime, and we have proposed a series of changes to achieve that end. But there is an equivalence in that mothers and children should be treated in a different way. This bill declares absolutely the status of a child born to a mother in detention. Given that clarification, which we support, the question that our amendment goes to is: how and where that mother and child should then be kept in detention. The shadow minister has outlined the case. We believe: </para><quote><para>... as soon as possible after the commencement of detention under section 189, a detained child must be accommodated with his or her family members in immigration detention conditions which meet the same amenity and security standards as are required by the Woomera alternative detention arrangements for women and children operated by the department from 7 August 2001.</para></quote><para>We note that there is a series of members on the other side of the House who have indicated some support for that approach, quite clearly because the department has been operating this on a trial basis since August 2001. The reports from the department are that this has worked pretty well and that there should be no fear on the part of the minister or others in taking this kind of step. The very first part of our consideration is that unaccompanied minorsâthose who are not with their parents or guardiansâshould be placed as soon as possible in a situation outside the detention centres, but that where the children are accompanied they should be reunited with their parents as soon as possible in a situation like Woomera. The department has run with that.</para><para>I will pass over and come back to the second matter that is dealt with here, which is that of special purpose visas. That relates to the 1992 situation: what Mr Hand was trying to achieve and the question of procedural fairness. There is a direct relationship there. I want to go to another element of this bill, which relates to the Criminal Code and strict liability for people-smuggling offences. In a way, I am a bit bemused about this. We have just heard from the Deputy Speaker that the <inline ref="R1692">Crimes Legislation Amendment (People Smuggling, Firearms Trafficking and Other Measures) Bill 2002</inline> has been passed by the Senate. I know the bill went through the Main Committee the other day, because I made a speech on it. I noted in that speech that the very provisions that are in this omnibus bill also happen to be in that bill. However, there were more provisions in the latter bill. I know that since the bill has been through the House and the Senate I cannot add to any argument about it except to say that both bills have some of the same provisions. If a person is taken to be assisting someone to unlawfully enter Australia, they can face 10 years jail and a $110,00 fine. The bill that has just gone through, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (People Smuggling, Firearms Trafficking and Other Measures) Bill 2002, has a further provision to double that amount to 20 years imprisonment and a $220,000 fine.</para><para>This is a matter of tidying up unintended consequences or the fact that there are questions about what strict and absolute liability are. The problem here is that, when the Migration Legislation Amendment (Application of the Criminal Code) Act 2001 came into effect, there was a question about whether a person committing the act was mindful of the consequences of what they were doing, and, if they were not, whether or not that could be taken as a defence under the act. The bill that we are discussing today tries to reinforce what liability is and add clarity to that. It is a difficult concept to get around but it is an important one in dealing with not only those who have been smuggled but those who smuggle. If they are bringing people into Australia, it is important that the severity of the law is exercised as strictly as possible. So there is a conjunction of the two pieces of legislation in relation to that.</para><para>There is a further conjunction when we deal with older legislation which informs one of the other changes that this bill proposes, and I will go to that now. It is the matter of special purpose visas. This is an excellent example of particular situations where people who one would not think were in particular difficulty might seek to be treated in a different way from what would be expected in immigration law. Who are the people who get special purpose visas? They are aircraft crews, crews of visiting vessels and members of foreign armed forces visiting for exercises or training. There have been cases in the past where people have jumped ship and sought to stay in Australia. My aunty, Gwen Charisiadis, was married to Gerasimos Charisiadis, who jumped ship in the late 1940s. He was a ship's engineer and a great cook. He jumped ship, and, given that it was the forties, there was not much of a penalty, even though he had a Mediterranean background. It was probably the quality of Gerry's cooking that got him a guernsey in the first place. He was allowed to stay in Australia. He worked on Australian National Line ships, going from one port in Australia to another. After a long and successful career as a ship's engineer, he moved on to work on the fireboats on Sydney Harbour. Under this provision, my uncle Gerry would not have got a guernsey; he would not have been able to stay in Australia. On this matterâex post facto, because it certainly will not affect my uncleâit is necessary to consider that, where people are given a special permit to do their work, it is possible for them to take advantage of our largesse. </para><para>Here we get to the question of procedural fairness and the question of natural justice. The shadow minister at the table, the member for Lalor, is a lawyer of distinction and someone who has put together a very strong policy for the Labor Party to take us forward in this regard. But we know what the lawyers in the immigration area get up toâI have suffered them for 17 years. I know that there is pedantic nitpicking to pull out every thread from the immigration law to try and get a further step forward. The argument that has been put up is that, if a person is in one of these categories and they happen to decide to apply to stay in Australia, you should extend to them natural justice. They should be able to put in an application, put their hand up and have a chance to stay in Australia.</para><para>Gerry Hand not only had a great sense of humour but was also a pretty tough old immigration minister, and anyone who had to deal with him was aware of that. The law that he brought into operation in 1992 attempted to codify once and for all Labor's immigration law, to get a tough set of codified laws that was as specific as possible. The immigration regulations arising out of that were about six feet long. They attempted to give clarity and certainty to immigration law. Labor entirely supports the provision within this bill, quite simply because this bill makes clear that the rules of natural justice do not apply to such a visa cancellation. The person involved simply has no right to be heard. Why is that a sensible clarification? The shadow minister has made this point in her brief, and it could not be any clearer. This sums up our approach to a tough immigration policy that should be there to protect our borders and to protect our people. I quote:</para><quote><para>Australia does not owe hearing rights to non-citizens in such circumstances because it is pushing it too far.</para></quote><para>There are certain hearing rights to non-citizens in other circumstances, particularly offshore refugees, but for these categories we believe there should not be a question of whether natural justice should operate. Rather, the bill clarifies that and states it absolutely. The reason it does so is that, in the procedural fairness bill, the explanation given by the minister and by the department went to considerable lengths to underline the fact that the certainty that should have been there with regard to what procedural fairness was in immigration matters had been gradually eroded.</para><para>In fact, if you run back 50 years, the fundamental principles in relation to procedural fairness were laid down by Justice Dixon, our greatest High Court judge, the most influential person when it came to making fundamental law in a range of areas and the person who set this doctrine in place. It is arguable on a range of grounds that he may have been wrong. I personally do not think so; I think he actually got it pretty right. People who are arguing the toss from one angle or another are doing so in order to push the bounds of credibility and to push the bounds of immigration law as far as they go. The reinforcement of this ruling in this bill is all to the good.</para><para>A range of matters are dealt with in this bill. The last one I will go to in the short amount of time I have left is the question of restrictions on bridging visas for onshore applications for visas. Section 48 of the act deals with this. I am a bit concerned about the way it will practically operate. They say that, essentially, you have to be careful that people on bridging visas do not have a range of reasons to try to stay in Australia. I agree with that absolutely. What this bill goes on to try to ensure is that you cannot, if you want to make a change, nick off to Auckland or go on a bit of a trip to Port Moresby or to Fiji and then come back into Australia. What this says is: if you go to Auckland, Port Moresby or Fijiâand we know there is a bit of a precedent for thisâit will be taken to be part of Australia's migration zone. The problem with that is that we have had case after case of spouse applicants where the department has had to arrange for them to nick off to Auckland, New Guinea, Port Moresby, Fiji or somewhere else rather than send them back to Sverdlovsk or Denmark and then have them come back into Australia given the fact that they are legally married. With that in train, I would support the bill and support our amendment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms King</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>10394</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>10394</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe have had this message from the Senate on the ASIO bill, as I indicated earlier.

Since January this year, Labor has been calling for the release of children from Australian detention centres. In August, Labor foreshadowed amendments to the bill. These amendments would compel the government to release any unaccompanied children from high-security detention and to have children accompanied by family members live in accommodation like that in the Woomera alternative detention trial. They lay down a challenge to those moderate Liberals who are telling refugee advocacy groups that they are concerned about children in detention. These amendments have already forced the government to move on these issues. But the response of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to this House last week goes nowhere near far enough, and moderate Liberals who are claiming to be concerned about children in detention should be measured against how they respond to Labor's amendments. If they fail to vote with Labor on these amendments then it will be clear that they are merely espousing the rhetoric of compassion while they sit on their hands and do nothing.</para></talk.start><para>Labor, in contrast to the government, believes that Australia can have a policy that restores both integrity and compassion to our immigration program. The ministerial response to Labor's amendments to the bill was billed in the media as a great change. We read headlines like `Ruddock rehouses women, children', `About-face on detention centres policy' and `PM changes tune on asylum seekers'. But what we got instead was a meaningless document that was aggrandising the government's achievements in managing migration while doing little to change the situation in detention centres, especially for children. We got an extension of the eligibility criteria for a trial, we got the government issuing a migration series instruction on unaccompanied minors and we got the government saying it was thinking about engaging in a process that might lead to community consultations on something that they might do.</para><para>What we did not get was a legislative change to protect unaccompanied minors; what we did not get was a recognition that fathers and young boys should also be allowed to live with their families in accommodation like the Woomera alternative detention trial. In fact, the minister seems to find it hard to even refer to them as `fathers', `sons' or `brothers'. We heard him in question time this week calling them `any adult male partner', as he was unable to call them fathers, sons or brothers. What we did not get was any acknowledgment that the children on Manus Island and Nauru even exist, let alone that they are the responsibility of this government. Whatever stance one has with regard to asylum seekers who come to Australia, any individual with a sense of humanity must acknowledge that children are the innocent participants who are caught in a situation which is not of their making. </para><para>The amendments that were foreshadowed ask those moderate Liberals on the other side of this House to start where there can be no disputeâthat is, by getting kids out from behind the razor wire. Why is it important? Children are the most vulnerable of all social groups. They do not have access to the means of exerting power, nor are they capable of protecting themselves. They are restricted in the extent to which they are able to make decisions about their lives. They do not play any part in the processes which determine the policies that affect them. How do we know the Australian detention centres are inhumane places for children to live? The <inline font-style="italic">Damaging kids</inline> report, published by the Catholic Commission for Justice, Development and Peace in May 2002, was the first paper to really document the extremely high rates of self-harm in Australian detention centres and the harrowing psychological impact of detention on the children living in these centres in Australia. Life for children in Australian immigration detention centres means being under constant video surveillance. It means being addressed by a number and not by a name. It means having no playing facilities. It means sharing meagre recreation space with angry, often dejected and frequently suicidal adults.</para><para>Think about the case of Shayan Badraie. We all heard about his fate last week in this House and saw the harrowing pictures on <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline>. He was exposed to violence and to constant contact with despondent, depressed adults. He had been so disturbed by his experiences at Woomera Detention Centre that he had stopped eating and drinking. In a new report, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission president recommended that the federal government pay the Badraie family $70,000 for Shayan's pain and suffering and the costs of ongoing psychiatric counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder. In this report, the president also said that the minister should apologise in writing to the family for his department's mishandling of this boy's care and its decision to ignore expert psychiatric advice. Doctors had urged that alternative accommodation be found for Shayan and his family, but the advice was ignored.</para><para>The parents of this boy will now launch a legal action against the minister. Many cases will follow if we do not act now. But it is not the threat of court cases that should force the minister to act; this is about basic humanity and compassion. We cannot begin to imagine what these children have already suffered in their own countries. How can we allow their trauma to be intensified by being locked in these camps? Instead of providing an environment where healing can occur, we perpetuate the trauma.</para><para>Two women in my electorate have worked as nurses in Woomera. Earlier this year, they came to see me as they were devastated by what they had experienced. They told me of the impact that detention was having on children, that almost all the children they saw experienced severe developmental delay, were well below normal weight and height measures for children of their age and culture and that they frequently bed-wet. They told me of children clinging to them, as they were desperate to stay in the nurses' station rather than be returned to the yards. They told me of children traumatised by the constant checks conducted during the night that meant they rarely got more than two hours consecutive sleep. These women had no barrow to push with the government. They had no barrow to push in relation to immigration policy. All they had was their judgement, their years of professional experience and their fundamental decency as community members who believe that children should never be treated like this.</para><para>The Australian public would still be almost completely in the dark about the situation inside Australian detention centres had it not been for Labor's effort in demanding that the government allow the Independent Detention Advisory Committee access to these centres. It was Labor who called for the Independent Detention Advisory Committee to have admittance to the Woomera detention centre on 21 January this year, one day before the minister permitted the visit. The regional representative of the UNHCR described Australia's mandatory detention system on 29 July this year as the most severe in the Western world. After a five-day visit to Woomera detention centre, HREOC came to the conclusion that children were being inadequately educated and that the health services and general living standards were poor. The organisation reported 13 threats of self-harm, five lip sewings, one attempted hanging and three self-slashings in just two weeks. One 14-year-old was reported to have sewn his lips twice and slashed the word `freedom' into his arm. Children in our detention centres are being deprived of basic human rights such as adequate education and opportunities for safe play and development. How much more criticism is needed for the government to change its stance? A consistent, lasting and more humane policy is urgently needed. </para><para>The public release of the evaluation of the Woomera alternate detention trial on 20 August 2002 demonstrated the success of more humane arrangements for mothers and children. The project established by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs enables some women and their children to live in family style accommodation whilst still being in detention. The Australian Labor Party and the Howard government's own independent advisory body, the Immigration Detention Advisory Group, proposed to expand the Woomera alternate detention trial to family groups, including fathers and older male children. If, according to the minister's assessment, this alternative was successful, why has it not yet been extended? Why does the Howard government continue to insist on locking up children behind razor wire? The amendments foreshadowed today are designed to meet the needs of children without endangering the health and security of Australians. Labor has drafted the amendments with precisely this balance in mind. It seems necessary to emphasise this point because one of the Howard government's almost constant excuses for its lack of activity with regard to the fate of innocent children has been the issue of security. There have been no security problems with the Woomera alternative detention trial. No-one has absconded from the trial. The 25 women and children involved in the detention trial lived in former Defence housing under ACM supervision. As the women and children are still formally in detention, they are not able to freely come and go.</para><para>Moreover, the Howard government is engaging in a campaign to deliberately dehumanise asylum seekers in the eyes of the Australian community and to create a climate of fear. The most immediate victims of this strategy are the children. It seems to make a lot more senseâand this is one of Labor's aimsâto seek to promote community understanding of the facts about asylum seekers. When these amendments were first foreshadowed, the minister responded by saying they were ridiculous and would lead to endless litigation. He claimed that Labor's definition of `unaccompanied detained child' would lead to endless litigation, yet this is exactly the definition the minister included in his ministerial response last week. While it can be argued that the government has a duty of care for all children in detention centres, the minister for immigration is the guardian of and has responsibility for children in detention. How can the minister claim to meet his responsibility in this regard when he locks up these children and young people in detention centres managed by a privately contracted company? How can the government, falsely or otherwise, accuse parents of abuse when it now has more power to change the situation for these children than their parents do, and yet fails to do anything about the systems of abuse and neglect that it perpetuates?</para><para>The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, representing the minister, has the duty to care for all detainees and the ultimate responsibility for their welfare, although day-to-day operations are contracted out to ACM. If any parent or guardian acted in the way the Australian government has towards children in immigration centres, they would be immediately subject to child care and protection orders. It is not hard to imagine how history will judge the holding of children at detention centres or how it will judge the government responsible. Liberal moderate members of this House have a clear choice: vote for Labor's foreshadowed amendments and get kids out of detention or do nothing and be judged accordingly. If your pressure has already resulted in a small step forward you should keep that pressure up. You should stand and be counted on this issue and vote with Labor on our amendments. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>10397</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> is an omnibus bill that amends the Migration Act 1958 with the purpose of changing aspects of the Australian legal regime in relation to visas, creating a deputy principal member for the Migration Review Tribunal, harmonising the Criminal Code and relevant offences under the act and making some minor technical amendments. The main provision of the bill deals with the immigration clearance status of non-citizen children born in Australia. Item 1 of schedule 1 deals with birth entry and immigration status. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>A non-citizen child who is born in the `migration zone' is taken to have `entered Australia' when s/he was born (section 10).</para></quote><para>There would be little dispute over that statement. To the extent that this amendment deals with children of parents who are seeking immigration rights in Australiaâbe they boat people, unauthorised arrivals, refugees or whatever we might call themâthe amendments raise many contentious issues that have been the subject of a great deal of political debate over the past year, for example, children overboard, children in detention and boat people fatalities. To this end, the shadow minister for immigration and population has foreshadowed an amendment: a new schedule 7, `Immigration detentionâSpecial arrangements for children', which clarifies the terms `appropriate qualified child protection officer', `detained children' and `unaccompanied detained children'. The amendment also calls for the release from detention of unaccompanied detained children into the care of a foster family or other appropriate community based care arrangements determined by an appropriately qualified child protection officer.</para><para>In this ongoing debate on asylum seekers, the issue that was first addressed by the Labor Party was the issue of children in detention. Although the government have now moved to introduce guidelines for such children, this has only come about after the Labor Party advocated the release of children from detentionâindeed, it has been the official Labor Party policy to remove children from behind the razor wire since Simon Crean's Australia Day speech in January this year. If the government were serious about the issue, they would not simply issue guidelines regarding children; they would support the amendment moved by the shadow minister, the member for Lalor, that would enshrine in legislation a more humane policy regarding children in detention. Issues relating to children cannot be seen as separate from Australia's general policy on refugees and asylum seekers.</para><para>In their first five years in office, the federal government have been able to turn their neglect of the issue of asylum seekers into a political plusâan achievement, I am sure, that would have the admiration of all political opportunists no matter how deceitful their policy was. From the time the Howard government came to office in March 1996 until the arrival of MV <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> in August 2001 on the eve of the federal election, no fewer than 213 unauthorised boats with 11,513 people arrived in the Australian migration zone. These arrivals were dotted right around the west and east coasts of Australia, as far south as Port Kembla. It was saidâfacetiously, I would suggestâthat these refugees were seeking employment in the steel industry. At no time during those five years did the Prime Minister clench his fist and cry, `We will decide who comes to this country.' He saved it for the fear-and-smear election campaign.</para><para>Just to refresh your memory, Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, and the memory of other members, a couple of newspaper articles appeared in the state press prior to the last federal election. On 8 November 2001, an article by Tom Allard and Andrew Clennell was headed `Howard links terrorism to boat people'. The article said:</para><quote><para>The Prime Minister linked the terrorist threat to asylum seekers yesterday as Coalition advertisements attacking Labor's boat people policies reached near-saturation levels.</para></quote><para>Further on it said:</para><quote><para>Mr Howard said: âThere is a possibility some people having links with organisations that we don't want in this country might use the path of asylum seekers in order to get here.â He also drew a comparison between the current situation and the refugees influx after World War II. âQuite properly people got concerns when they thought war criminals, in the rush after World War II were allowed in,â he told the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail.</inline> Mr Howard stressed that he had no evidence the recent boats turned away from Australia contained any terrorists or undesirables but, by the same token, there could be no âguaranteesâ that there weren't. </para></quote><para>As the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat, said, that was quite clearly an attempt to dehumanise refugees. In an earlier article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> on 19 September, Mike Seccombe said:</para><quote><para>People of good conscience on all sides of politics have no doubt that the aim of everything the Government has done over the past couple of months has been to generate irrational fear amongst Australians over Islamic asylum seekers.</para></quote><para>That same article made reference to comments by members of the government at that particular time, including Peter Reith's `none-too-subtle suggestions that boat people arriving in Australia included potential terrorists'. At this point, there were some uncomplimentary remarks about the member for Fisher, who said:</para><quote><para>âThere is an undeniable link between illegals and terrorism.â</para></quote><para>It is difficult to get around that statement and to not understand exactly what is going on. I repeat:</para><quote><para>âThere is an undeniable link between illegals and terrorists.â</para></quote><para>That is what the member for Fisher is quoted as saying. The article goes on to say:</para><quote><para>We checked with the office of the Immigration Minister. The nearest thing they could point to was one refugee who had once been a member of the intelligence service of the previous Afghani governmentâthat's the one overthrown by the Taliban, with whom we are effectively at war.</para></quote><para>That was the background of the last federal election campaign, on which the government's refugee policy is based. As in so many of the recent security breaches, such as the Bali bombing and the refugee issue, the government should have known earlier what was happening and should have acted quickly. It seems that it was more interested in Centrelink breaches than in security breaches. The fact is that the Howard government should have been more aware of the international issues that would result in an increase in the number of refugees arriving in Australia. The fact that the government failed to act means that people smugglers have been able to convince refugees to take this dangerous journey. If there is an allegation to be levelled about who is soft on people smugglers, the answer is clearly the Howard government during its first two terms in office.</para><para>The international issues the government should have been aware ofâand quite clearly they were not or they did not act on themâwere the closing of borders in European countries; the consolidation of the Taliban in much of Afghanistan, leading to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Afghanis; the continued oppression in Iraq; and, most importantly, the growth of people-smuggling, with smugglers promoting Australia as a favourable destination. The facts are that the numbers of unauthorised arrivals that culminated in the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>incident had been because of the policy vacuum in the Howard government for the previous five years. Over this period, the Howard government should have secured agreement in our region to detect and destroy the people-smuggling rings and to deter forward transit by asylum seekers. How the doctrine of cooperation with our neighbours sits with the doctrine of pre-emptive strikes is yet to be determinedâ`We want your cooperation on boat people, but we will invade you if we perceive a terrorist threat.'</para><para>Australia did not secure any form of agreement on asylum seekers with Indonesia until it was too late. Indeed, Indonesia has still not made people-smuggling a criminal offence. The federal government's rather relaxed attitude to asylum seekers changed abruptly on 27 August 2001, when the polls showed that they were set to lose the election and when the Australian Search and Rescue broadcast a call to any merchant ship in the vicinity to render assistance to the stricken vessel, the KM <inline font-style="italic">Palapa 1</inline>. The Norwegian merchant vessel <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> responded to the call, intercepted the sinking <inline font-style="italic">Palapa</inline> and took its passengers aboard. The master of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, Captain Arne Rinnan, had intended to take the people rescued to a port in Indonesia. The rescued asylum seekers demanded to go to Christmas Island, which proves that these people knew exactly where they were heading and justifies the ALP's position in retaining Christmas Island as a processing centre for boat people. </para><para>Due to the government's failure to respond adequately to the human suffering of people, particularly children, arriving in Australia unauthorised, the ALP has decided that any unaccompanied children under 14 will be placed in the care of foster families after health checks are completed. Unaccompanied young people between 14 and 18 will be released into appropriate community care arrangements following health checks. Concern has been expressed about the contradiction in the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs being the legal guardian of unaccompanied minors while at the same time being the minister for detention and processing claims. Under Labor's new asylum seeker policy, such children will not be detained and, to avoid any perceived conflict of interest, Labor will make its proposed children's commissioner the legal guardian of unaccompanied minors who arrive unauthorised in Australia.</para><para>This is one area of policy we must get right as a nation. We must balance the security of our borders with humane and decent treatment of asylum seekers. For too long the government has vilified and denigrated those who seek to come to our country, fleeing persecution, war, famine, drought and all kinds of misery. This is not the Australian way. The second verse of our national anthem says, `For those who come across the sea, we've boundless plains to share.' Obviously that means only if you are not poor and fleeing trouble. Maybe the government will be rewriting our national anthem soon.</para><para>The government's policy in this area, as in many others, is skewed towards punishment. In the stick and carrot approach, the government always seems to favour the stickâthere is no balance. The policy paper that was released last week by the member for Lalor, the shadow minister for population and immigration, seeks to restore the balance between deterrence and compassion. Government is not only about following popular opinion; it is about leading the debate and leading public opinion. There is a great deal of mistrust amongst asylum seekers. There is a great deal of misinformation in the general community. The government needs to respond to both. There are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed, but there also needs to be considerable debate based on fact, not on spin. The government has whipped up a fear and smear campaign on this issue, using half-truths and untruths. That must end. The `children overboard' disgrace is only one example of where the government has failed the people of Australia. It has failed to be honest in its dealings with the Australian people. It has failed in the most basic function of government and leadershipâthat is, trust. </para><para>Labor's policy is balanced, addressing the concerns of the community over issues such as border protectionâprotecting Australia. It also addresses the need for compassion when dealing with the misery of human existence far from our shores. That is the Australian way. The amendments moved by the shadow minister have forced the government to change its policy on children in detention. The minister has now issued guidelines. If he were truly interested in a compassionate and humane solution to this problem, he would support the amendments that would see unaccompanied minors taken out from behind the razor wire and treated with dignity. </para><para>Bipartisanship does not mean blind adherence. It does not mean accepting everything the government says without question. It means working together in a constructive manner to achieve common goals. This is an area where Labor has always sought bipartisanship, but it is also an area where the government has sought anything but. The government does not want cooperation on this issue because it wants to use it as a political tool to score political points. It is too important an issue for that, but that has not stopped the government from using asylum seekers as political footballs to kick around for the pleasure of spectators. Since the release of Labor's policy, I have watched in question time, with dorothy dixer after dorothy dixer, the minister's attempts to rubbish our policy. </para><para>Quite frankly, the minister has not been all that successful in his attempts to tear it down. He has not been able to put the hatchet through the policy because, deep down, I think he knows we have some good points. The more enthusiastic he gets about attacking our policy, the more convinced I am that we are actually on the right track. Quite frankly, you look pretty silly trying to rubbish a good idea, and the minister knows this. He has gone through the motions but he has not really laid a glove on the policy in the last week or so. Interest groups such as the Australians for Just Refugee Programs, the Refugee Council of Australia, the Catholic Commission for Justice, Development and Peace, the Coalition for the Reform of Refugee Policy, the Uniting Church and the Brotherhood of St Laurence have all given the Labor Party policy a tick of approval as a major step forward in policy development.</para><para>Protecting Australia and protecting the Australian wayâthat is what it is all about. While the government seems taken with the first part, it seems to care nothing about the second part. It is all about balance. Labor has found the balance: strength in border protection and compassion in dealing with our fellow human beings. This bill will not be opposed, but this government is on notice: it must amend its strategy and again find the balance that this issue requiresâthe balance it has lost in the darkness of political opportunismâor it will suffer the consequences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>10400</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the remarks tonight of my colleague the member for Greenway, in his contribution to the House in the debate on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>.

I must say that I am very pleased to have been a member of that subcommittee. We waited until the Joint Standing Committee on Migration did a review of detention centres, and it brought down a report recommending some structural changes to those centres. I am pleased to say that the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was the first committee of the parliament to actually speak to detainees without any departmental people or ACM people present, and in camera. </para></talk.start><para>In some ways, that has been a tragic mistakeâbut let me say why it was done. It was done because we wanted the detainees to be able to speak frankly to the committee without any fear associated with their contributions. A lot of what goes on in detention centres is hidden from the publicâon the false proposition that it protects the privacy of detaineesâwhen detainees really want to tell their story. The last thing they want is privacy. If we were doing the inquiry again, I would say that, beginning with our interviews with all the detainees at each of the detention centres, I would give them the choice: keep it totally in camera or, if you do not want it in camera, we will make it public. I can only speculate on what the response might be, but I am pretty sure that the detainees would want it on the public record.</para><para>It was a very powerful experience, and I would say that all, whether they were Labor, Liberal or Democrat, were affected deeply by what they saw and heard. It is a matter of record that Minister Ruddock viciously attacked principally the coalition members when they brought down the report for a lack of rigour in what they did. Let me say what we did do. We spoke to the department and we were briefed by the department in camera before we embarked on these visitsâthe same with ACM. At each detention centre, we were briefed again by the department and ACM and had interviews with the detainees in camera. When we came back, we had eight hours of hearings with both the department and ACM after those visits in camera, just to give them an opportunity to correct the record, to get it right, to set the record straight. In the minister's mind, this is a lack of process and a lack of rigour on behalf of the committee. I think the committee brought down a very good report. As I say, it was viciously attacked by the minister.</para><para>I want to address some of the minister's responses. Recommendation 8 states:</para><motion><para>That the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation develop an appropriate risk profile to assist the early release into the Australian community of asylum seekers. </para></motion><para>The government says it is `confident' about `the existing process'. That is fair enough, but you need to understand that the committee spoke to the Director-General of ASIO. I cannot put before the House the transcript of that discussionâin fact, it was an in camera discussion and only notetakers' notes were takenâbut, Minister, rest assured that the committee did not override the Director-General of ASIO in its recommendation. Can I be plainer than that? I guess ministers can override directors, but I would have thought one would do so very reluctantly when it is the head of ASIO. I find your response very dismissive of what was, I think, a very constructive proposal by the committee.</para><para>We supported the minister's trial at Woomera. The committee supported it and welcomed it, and it put that in its report. I think it is fair enough to say that there was considerable debate within the committee about whether we should go further than that trial. In the end, we wanted to give credit to the minister for conducting the trialâa very limited trial, I might say, of a number of mothers and their children in a security compound comprising a number of houses. We certainly considered going a lot further. In fact, it is only in recent times that the minister has indicated that he is going to extend this very limited trial. For example, we have built a completely new detention centre at Baxter, and there are no such facilities. The newest detention centre at Baxter does not provide for this trial.</para><para>There are a couple of other things I want to say. The committee recommended critically that we should use the 14 weeks as a benchmark, but let me explain that to the House, because, with great respect to the minister, I think he sometimes dissembles on this point. His departmentâthat is, DIMIAâis funded to process these applications within a time line. From memory, at that time it was 14 weeks. The committee never recommended that, if someone was in detention and that time line was exceeded, they be automatically taken out of the detention centre. That has been a fabrication. I want to be perhaps a bit more generous and say: if it is not a fabrication, it has been a gross misunderstanding of what the committee was talking about.</para><para>We also talked about negotiating with appropriate community groups to examine the feasibility of developing a sponsorship scheme for detainees who have not been processed within the time limit. Again, the minister uses the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report and an earlier report done in 1994 to bucket this recommendation. But this is the same committee that never spoke to detainees in detention centres on their own. They always had a representative group, departmental officials or ACM officials present.</para><para>I find the government's response to recommendation 13 staggering. This recommendation says:</para><motion><para>That, wherever possible, blocks within detention centres be designated for the exclusive use of families.</para></motion><para>The government's response was:</para><quote><para>The IDCs at Perth, Villawood and Maribyrnong all contain designated areas for women, children and family groups.</para></quote><para>Minister, you are at the table now. Tell me: when were the family group facilities provided at Perth? We were told by your department and the person you have now promoted to deputy secretary that Perth, because of its tight constraints, is very temporary. We were told that if women go there, they are moved out quickly. We were told that families are not kept at Perth. Perth is so small, Madam Deputy Speaker; I invite you to go and have a look at it. It is very constrained. I am sure the shadow minister would agree with me that the facilities there are very, very constricting.</para><para>I am surprised, in a way, that we are debating this bill and the shadow minister's amendments, which address the issue of children in detention centres, so close to one of the holiest of Christian holy days. Forgive me, I am not being born again, but I would like to read a quote from Matthew about the flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents:</para><quote><para>After they had left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, `Get up and take the child and his mother with you and escape into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and do away with him.' So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt, where he stayed until Herod was dead. </para></quote><para>In other words, the holy family were refugees. They were refugees from the massacre of all male Jewish children two years and younger in the vicinity of Bethlehem. If they had come to Australia rather than Egypt, the best we would have done at Woomera would have been to put Mary and Jesus in a secure compound and leave Joseph in a detention centre. If Jesus was unaccompaniedâthe minister, I know, has made some recent announcements about thisâand a tad older, I would suggest that the conditions would not be pleasant. I guess the Labor Party, to paraphrase Moses, is saying: let the children go. Let the children out of the detention centres. </para><para>I do not want to single out for condemnation a colleague, the member for Cook, who came along on the detention centres visit, but he was the one on the committeeânot unexpectedly, because he is a trained psychologistâwho was really concerned about the mental health impacts on kids of being in detention centres.</para><para>I know that at the end of the report there was all this lovely guff from the department. As the former member for Throsby would say, `These detention centres are like Butlins holiday camps in the desert'. Everyone is playing basketball or cricket or at a sewing machine or a computer. I can honestly tell you that, at every detention centre I visited, I did not see one person engaged in any game. You could say that maybe that was just bad luck, but how do you play soccer at Woomera on the broken ground?</para><para>The other issue that was of great concern to committee membersâand I pay tribute to Senator Harradine here too because it was a point that he pursued vigorouslyâwas the education of the kids in the detention centres. Those managing the centres said, `Yes, we follow a state curriculum.' Now if we say about a public school or a Catholic school that they follow a state curriculum, what does that mean? It means that there are certain hours by way of compulsory attendance, that a curriculum is followed and that progress is made and monitored. It is true that there are teachers at these detention centres, and even at Baxter. But the notion that somehow the children there are happily progressing along the South Australia curriculum is utterly fictitious. I do not know how the department can serve up such drivel.</para><para>I have another point to make. I accept that the Mayor of Port Augusta has not made life easy and I do not support her comments, but if you are opening the newest detention centre in Australia, would you not think that you would have a memorandum of understanding with the South Australia government so that these kids could go to a public school or a Catholic school and at least get out of the detention centre? How cruel it is to have some children who were in Curtin go to a public school there and then, when you send them to Baxter, not allow them out.</para><para>I want to say a couple of things about Baxter. Baxter is an utter contradiction, and it is a contradiction for these reasons. If you look at the facilities that detainees have, the ones at Baxter are a lot better without a doubt than those in other detention centres, and I would not want to quibble in that regard. But there is a certain cruelty that has been designed into Baxter. By the way, I might say that we had a new DIMIA manager when we were there. He was very helpful and very politeâI am not being criticalâbut he was only three days on the job when we were there, and the ACM manager was only a week on the job. I wonder why those two people were changed at about the time the Human Rights Subcommittee were to visit them. That is mere speculation, I want to say. I am merely speculating.</para><para>But why is Baxter designed in cruelty? At some of the other detention centres, detainees are able to mix. The people at Baxter have been in detention centres for many months and in some cases years. Where they were mixing at other detention centres, now they are at Baxter where there are nine compounds and they do not get to mix; at compound one, you know the people in compound one. Also, the compound is turned in on itself. Just in case they should wish to look at the Baxter mountain escarpmentâand there is that opportunityâthe government have installed frosted glass windows. These are not big windows. They areâhow would I describe them?ârelatively small rectangular things, but there is an opportunity to see out.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>âBathroom windows. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>âWell, why is it that no-one can see out?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para>âBathroom windows aren't meant to let people look in either. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>âBut why design a facility where you cannot see out of the compound? Go through the gates at Baxter. They are a double set of gates where one gate has to close before another can open. I take an interest in defence matters, and I think these gates would certainly stop a Bushranger, an ASLAV. I am not so sure about a tank, but I think the posts would give it a good work over. The compound is thoroughly depressing, Minister, and I think you are better than that. I think you can do a lot better than that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The minister says in his response that there is any amount of scrutiny of detention centres. He fails to understand that many of the problems and criticisms of detention centres come from a lack of scrutiny. We argued for an official visitor program; he rejects it. He says there is an ombudsman and HREOCâof course, the government have cut their fundingâand, yes, they are available to do it. I am pleased that in our new Labor policy we have an inspector-general of detention centres who can do his or her own motion inquiries, he can do an inquiry on behalf of the minister and he can respond to complaints. Yes, it is another level of scrutiny and another level of administration, but I think, in the end, it is worth while.</para><para>There are lots of things I would have liked to say about the policy associated with the Labor Party now and our shadow minister. I just want to say that, in relation to the green card, the minister has never prosecuted one employer for employing an illegal migrant. You have not prosecuted one in all the years. You will send the illegal worker back to their country of originâas you shouldâbut you let the one who profits most, the one who exploits these workers, walk free and hide, and our green card is going to fix that. Our green card will target the employers who exploit this labour, and it will ensure that they get their fair measure of justice for their illegal activity, as well as the illegal worker who you now send back. I support the policy enunciated by the Labor Party on these issues. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>10403</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâFirstly, let me thank the members who have contributed to this debate on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. Obviously, I do not agree with all of the comments that have been made. I will not try to canvass them all, although I do acknowledge my friend the member for Chifley, and I will certainly try to clarify the issues in relation to Perth. It is the case that we have been endeavouring to provide accommodation for family groups separate to others. Perth has always been a challenge, not only because of the nature and size of the detention centre itself but also because of the states. Your state colleaguesâand you might like to talk to them about these mattersâare insisting that criminal deportees now be held in immigration detention. In Western Australia, they do not even acknowledge that there might be exceptional circumstances to be taken into account in whether that should happen. </para></talk.start><para>I must say that I find it strangeâI note that there is no press here, so I suppose this will not be reportedâthat premiers will sometimes write to me and they will even go to the press and argue very strongly that criminal deportation ought to be used in particular cases where there is a heinous crime. Yet perforce of the way in which detention centres have developed over a long periodâand I do not say critically that detention policy is easy, because when your colleagues were in office, only two new detention facilities were built, as I recall: one at Port Hedland, and that is a facility about which your committee has complained at least in part, and the other at Curtin, which was very much a makeshift detention facilityâgovernments have not planned over that long period and built purpose designed facilities. I might say that, when we seek to do that, as I have sought to do in Brisbane, I find I get fairly vocal opposition. The NIMBY set is very much alive, and nobody is terribly keen to have a detention centre in their district.  </para><para>Forgive me, I am spending time on the member for Chifley because he was here and I am here. I heard most of his comments. I apologise to members whose comments I have not heard, but I will try to pick up some of the points that have been made during the debate. I really want to focus on thanking those who participated. I hope the bill will ultimately pass.

Quite frankly, in my view it is better to work to be elected than to think you are a government in exile. We were elected to make decisions, administer policy and maintain effective administration. Holding the Migration Act in this country hostage to a political tactic is I think quite an inappropriate approach to take.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> does a number of important things. It clarifies the visa status of non-citizen children born in Australia. It clarifies that security can be taken before a visa is granted to ensure compliance with conditions. That is fairly important in many cases, otherwise they might not get the outcome they might be seeking. It enables the cancellation of a special purpose visa where it is undesirable for the holder to travel to or remain in Australia, with cancellation taking effect from the time of the minister's declaration. Special purpose visas are of a unique character; they are issued in extraordinary circumstances, and there ought to be a capacity to cancel them. The bill creates a deputy principal member position for the Migration Review Tribunal. Given the workload required for the proper management of the issues, this is also an important matter. The bill ensures that certain offence provisions operate as they did prior to the application of the Criminal Code. I foreshadowed that I would be moving amendments in the committee stage to give effect to recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. I hope that the opposition will accede to those amendments, as they were party to them.</para><para>This debate has been designed to address one issue: whether the opposition, if it were in government, would be better able than the government to handle detention policy, particularly as it relates to family groups. I notice that the shadow minister wants to claim he originated some unique developments that have occurred in relation to detention policy in Australia. I have to say that the Leader of the Opposition's speech on Australia Day 2002 had nothing to do with the alternative detention model that was implemented in August 2001. The fact is that this government was thinking constructively about the way we deal with issues relating to women and children in detention. You probably know of the young man by the name of Mitchell, I think it was, from Hothamâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Gillard</name></talker><para>âHis name was Grant Mitchell.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âYes; Grant Mitchell, from the Hotham Mission. I give him credit because he raised, at a public meeting I addressed in Melbourne, issues in relation to the way detention is dealt with in Sweden. In cases where it was seen as appropriate to detain people there were arrangements for women and childrenânot whole family groups; women and childrenâto be detained in an alternative way. My view was that we should look at whether that would work in Australia. With the department, we developed the alternative detention model.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The reason we did it in the way we did was quite clear: we wanted to ensure the detention policy was not undermined. You could release whole family groups, but there would be a greater likelihood of total family groups living in low-security facilities adjacent to the camp than there would be if one member of the family remained detained. That system has worked. The opposition thinks you can deduce from the fact that the trial has worked the view that releasing whole families would be equally effective. Whether it is or it is not, my greater concern is the impression that would be left with those likely to engage people smugglers. I think they see very vocal change in relation to important aspects of policy as an unwinding of policy in Australia, and see that as a signal that maybe their operations can be picked up and run again. So I am unwilling, for reasons I include in the letter to the Leader of the Opposition, to entertain the amendments proposed by the Labor Party. </para><para>The reason is very simple. It arises from the experience I have referred to before, when the opposition was in office and Gerry Hand was the minister. It related to setting arbitrary time limits for processing. The import of that was that, once you put in place provisions that impose certain obligations upon government that could be manipulated by detainees and their advisersâparticularly with the level of cooperation they might give to processingâpeople could simply wait out the time and then expect to be released. That is what happened in Western Australia. People waited out the time, there was some ambiguity about the time, they sued, and the Australian taxpayer was left to pay quite large damages claims for false imprisonment. So I regard an important aspect of the issue to be the introduction into the act of obligations expressed with so little room to move in appropriate circumstancesâin other words, they become mandatory in themselvesâthat you have the potential for litigation over the way they are applied.</para><para>In relation to implementing mandatory detention, the present legislation as drafted by the Labor Party provides very little scope for litigation over the circumstances in which people are held. The legislation was deliberate because of the nature of the litigation. You are proposing administrative complexities that would give rise to the prospect of increased litigation. Where do I think that might happen? When people come here without birth certificates, the only information you have as to their age is what they themselves tell you. Do you have scope for people wanting to dispute age? We have already had litigation over the methods by which you try to determine whether or not someone is cheating you, and in relation to people who have been prosecuted for smuggling and whether or not they are minors. We have had litigation over measuring their risk and whether the scientific techniques are sufficiently sound to enable very clear evidence to be given in relation to those matters.</para><para>There is a range of other issues that could arise. Reference has been made to an eight-year-old who was, for a time, in detention. The circumstances were that the child was initially in foster arrangements in Woomera, with families there. They were released on temporary protection visas, and assessments had to be made as to whether the child could be released with them. In the case of one of the families with whom the child had the prospect of being released, there was an adverse assessment of the proposed parent by the relevant state authority. It certainly took time for that issue to be addressed. I will not say it was an inordinately long time, but looking at the notes before me it took, I think, five months from the time that the child arrived at Woomera until the child was in fact released into foster care arranged by the South Australian authorities. Under the arrangements that we have in place, the eight-year-old was ultimately released and is now on a temporary protection visa. There was consultation with the relevant state authorities. I cannot imagine that that would have taken any longer than if people had litigated over those issuesâif they wanted to use the sort of statutory provision that you have in mind.</para><para>The basis proposed for releasing family groups does not have regard to the sorts of factors that were mentioned in the miscellaneous series of instructions that I have given to the department on the way this issue is to be dealt with. Certainly, health and security clearances are important, but there is a range of other issues that are also important in relation to the management of people. There is also the question of the availability of accommodation. It is interesting that comment has been made about the availability of accommodation at Baxter. I have certainly foreshadowed in discussions I have had with the state government from very early this year that at Baxter we wanted to have children in local schools, where appropriate, as well as an alternative detention model operating. The state government are sayingâand fairly late on the sceneâthat the only way in which they are going to be a party to these issues is with consultation. </para><para>However, when there had been very extensive consultation between the local school community and the school principals, when children were preparing to enrol in the local school, and I had told the mayor which school and when we were going to undertake their enrolmentâand had indicated to her that that was under way and there had been consultationsâwhat happened? The Premier of South Australia, the day he headed off on a three-week overseas trip, called off the participation of the children in the school. He has said that some other form of consultation now has to take place. Here is the Labor Party parading its virtues in this area, but the Labor Party is more than the Labor Party here; it is the Labor Party in all of its manifestations. All I can say is that the sort of cooperation I would have expectedâwith a reasonable amount of goodwillâhas not been forthcoming.</para><para>I have made it clear that I think you do need to have some capacity to make judgments about what is going to happen in an alternative detention system where there is minimum security. It is not a matter of having light beams and some detention officers living around the corner so you can say you have a high security facility, as the opposition seems to suggest would be appropriate; it is a matter of having regard to a whole range of issues. There are a lot of dynamics that you have to take into account with human beings, and some judgments have to be made. The instructions that I have given enable those judgments to be made in relation to women and children. They are quite precise but they recognise some of the administrative problems. The opposition is proposing a rigidity that would pay no regard to those sorts of factors. In that sense, we cannot accede to the amendments proposed, but I ask the opposition to see the importance of giving passage to the legislation and giving the measures that I have sought to implement an opportunity to operate and to make sensible judgments on them.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>10406</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>10406</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move opposition amendments (1) and (2):</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (after table item 7), add:

I want to briefly outline to the House the details of them. These amendments provide that for an unaccompanied detained childâa detained child who does not have a guardian with them, and we have used the definition of non-citizen child arising out of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946âthe government would be compelled as a matter of law, as soon as possible after the commencement of detention, under section 189 of the Migration Act to release that unaccompanied detained child into the care of a foster family or other appropriate community based care arrangement, determined by an appropriately qualified child protection officer.</para><para>I want to clarify this point, because I have not had the opportunity to raise this with the ministerâand I understand that it might be causing some consternation. These amendments were revised arising from a contribution from you, Deputy Speaker Gambaro, when it became apparent that the referencing in the first section, which read `released in accordance with section 198', ought to have read `released in accordance with division 7B'âso that is the change in this version of the amendments. That change was required to make it clear that what we are talking about in these amendments is that unaccompanied children, when they arrive in Australia, would be put in immigration detention but, as soon as possible, an unaccompanied detained child must be released from that detention into the care of a foster family or into another appropriate community based care arrangement. </para><para>In moving this I ask the House to noteâand the minister has gone to the question of discretion and other thingsâthat we have made sure that there is a catch-all and we have specifically provided that nothing in the subsection which requires that release from detention requires the taking of any action which would cause a health or security risk to Australia. We are putting forward a scheme where a government would be compelled to release an unaccompanied detained child from detention as soon as possible into an appropriate foster or community based care arrangement, but we have been careful to make sure that no governmentâthis government, a future Labor government or any governmentâis required to take any action which would cause a health or security risk to Australia.</para><para>These amendments provide that a child with family members, if the child is to be detainedâand it is important to note that this is not a release from detention issue; this is a conditions of detention issueâneeds to be detained in certain settings. We have defined that setting as meeting the amenity and security standards of the Woomera alternative detention trial arrangements. As I explained in my contribution on the bill, we know that that is a secured facility. The minister can make light of light beams and the rest of it, but we know that this is a facility with fencing, with security on the perimeter, so if you break the light by trying to jump the fence you will sound an alarm. And there is 24-hour a day guard presence. We are talking about children and their families living in immigration detention in those kinds of conditions. Once again, the provision that we have moved has the catch-all in it that no governmentâthis government or a future Labor governmentâwould be required to take any action which would cause a health or security risk to Australia. </para><para>These amendments strike an appropriate balance between meeting the needs of children and meeting security needs. At the end of the day, the minister has talked about the diversity of human needs and, surely, the key human needs to be met here are the needs of children. We are saying we do not think it is appropriate for children, unaccompanied or children with family groups, to be held over the longer term in high-security detention compounds as we now know them in the form of Woomera, Baxter or Port Hedland. We have put before the House a better way of dealing with that and one which does not raise any security issues. It has a catch-allâin making sure that no government is required to take any step which would cause a security concern to Australia and in talking about immigration detention conditions for families which are secured. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>This will be my final contribution. I understand that my colleague the member for Gellibrand, the shadow minister for children and youth, would also like to make a contribution. This is a schema of arrangements that meets our needs to deal with people in an Australian way, to deal with people in a way that is guided by fairness and decency and most particularly to deal with children properly. It means that unaccompanied children would need to be released from detention and children with family groups would need to be accommodated in secure conditions, but conditions which are better for family groups than those currently occurring now. I do not accept, and I do not believe, it can be reasonably argued that this opens up any security issue. In that regard, members of the minister's own Immigration Detention Advisory Group have endorsed the concepts of unaccompanied children being released from immigration detention and children with family groups living in settings like the Woomera alternative detention trial. Shortly, this House will divide on these amendments and it is perhaps a pity that we are having this debate at this time of night. The reason we are having this debate is that we want to see who in this House is prepared to support a different style of arrangement for childrenâwho is concerned about children in immigration detention.</para><para>I have never claimed that the Leader of the Opposition's speech on Australia Day caused the alternative Woomera detention trial. Of course that is not right. But I do claim that this amendment caused last week's ministerial statement. It is on the public record that that ministerial statement was made because of the proposition that some Liberal moderates were going to cross the floor and vote for this amendment. In the time remaining to me, I say to those Liberal moderates who put pressure on the minister to make the ministerial statement last week: your help to ensure the best possible conditions for children in detention is still needed. Firstly, we need the certainty of a legislative arrangement. The Migration Series Instructions, coming as they doâand as the minister laudsâwith bucket loads of discretion, are not good enough as a guarantee of conditions for children in detention. We need this legislative scheme. Secondly, and even more importantly, I say to the Liberal moderates who were so motivated by this issue that they put pressure on the minister to make the ministerial statement last week: we need a scheme of arrangements that keeps families together. I would have thought that in this century, in this nation, of all nations, it would be an unarguable proposition that you do families harm by splitting them up. We as a nation know that probably more than any other nation on earth because we live with the legacy of the stolen generation. Let us not contemplate making any comparable error. Family groups should be together. Mothers, fathers, brothers and sistersâthese are families.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tuckey</name></talker><para>âIsn't this about unaccompanied children?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name></talker><para>âNo, it is not about unaccompanied children, Minister.

My simple proposition to the Liberal moderates is: do you consider that a family includes a father and older brothers? If you accept that propositionâand it is a very simple oneâit seems to me that, as a matter of logic, as a matter of morals and as a matter of ethics, you have no option but to vote for these amendments. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>10409</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to speak to Labor's amendments. I want to do this because, as the shadow minister for children and youth, I have had a particular interest in ensuring that we do everything that we can, even in opposition, to have the most compassionate detention system that it is possible to have even while this government is in place. In these amendments, as the shadow minister has already pointed out, we have proposed a number of things, including that unaccompanied children should be placed in foster services and that children who are with their families, both mothers and fathers, should be placed in alternative low-security detention, such as hostel type or other accommodation, as appropriate.</para></talk.start><para>This has been part of a year-long campaign by a number of people on our side of parliament. Others have spoken about the Leader of the Opposition's speech on Australia Day and the very detailed work done by the shadow minister for immigration. I have tried to play some part in making a submission to the HREOC inquiry on the conditions of children held in detention. I have done this for a number of reasons. We think it is the only fair thing to do to ensure that very young children or young adults are not held in a situation which might cause long-term damage to them and which might add to their trauma. These are children who have experienced pretty traumatic lifestyles before arriving in Australia. We do not want to be in the position of contributing to the trauma that they suffer. From visiting the Maribyrnong Detention Centre, in my electorate, I have seen the issues that children face there, such as a lack of education, a lack of safety when they share facilities with criminal deportees, and this nonsense that they have adequate family rooms. Often two parents and two or three childrenâas I have seen in one situationâare in one room together, but they share all facilities with the rest of the detainees. This is not an adequate circumstance. We do not want to be in a situation where children are having to live in these circumstances. No matter what people's views might be about asylum seekers generally, no-one argues that children who arrive here can possibly be a security risk or here through some fault of their own. It is not appropriate to hold children in detention with some argument that they should share the blame, even if people hold the view that their parents might have some responsibility for bringing them here.</para><para>I am pleased that these amendments make clear that fathers also are able to live in these alternative arrangements. This is very important because it is asking families, children and their mothers, to make an impossible choice by saying to them: `Your children can be out of detention. You have to choose some form of freedom for your children, but that will mean separating the family.' It is an impossible choice to make for people who have fled in very traumatic and difficult circumstances. Where there is no reason for a father to be held in high security, we cannot see why they should not be able to have some semblance of normal life. We are talking about a pretty moderate ambition here: to have some idea of proper family housing, some capacity to cook meals and perhaps some outdoor living. This is certainly not what families are getting, even in facilities where they are able to be held together.</para><para>I have been lobbied by many of my constituents who have urged me to support these amendments. I have been lobbied by local church groups in particular, by children's welfare groups and family associations, by CAFWA and the Australian Early Childhood Association. I might also mention the Australian Council for Children and Parentingâthe government's own advisory group on the wellbeing of children and their relationship with parents. I must ask here: where has the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs been during this debate? The government and the minister are very proud that he is the first ever minister for children, but there is not much point in having a minister for children if he is not prepared to speak out on issues that affect them.</para><para>I know, and the council have reported, that they have met with both the minister for immigration and the minister for children. They have given advice about what they think is good for children. That advice is not public, but I am fairly confident that the government is not yet acting on it. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> We will take close note, when there is a vote on these amendments, of what the minister for children is doing. He has been lobbied extensively by the same groups who have been talking to us and talking to me as the shadow minister. If he is interested at all in pursuing the rights of children or their interests, and their parents' interests, he will be voting with us, on this side of the House, when we vote for these amendments. </para><para>The minister has made a statementâand I think the shadow minister has already covered this. Obviously the statement goes part way but not far enough towards dealing with the issues that we raise in these amendments. I found it extraordinary that when I came into the House and the minister was speaking he said that he was disappointed that we were using this political tactic. That is pretty extraordinary in a debate like this. The minister for immigration might not be awareâbut there are plenty of us on this side of the House that are awareâthat this very Minister for Children and Youth Affairs distributed, during the election campaign, some of the most despicable material that I have ever seen about what Labor's immigration policy would mean for people living in Tweed Heads. I would not deign to repeat even some of the contents of that statement in this House. To say that Labor, when we want to actually get children out of detention and to get families living in some sort of semblance of normal family life while maintaining the security that is appropriate in these circumstances, are engaging in a political tactic, when someone will stoop as low as the current minister for children will in the materials that he will distribute in his electorate, is well and truly beyond the pot calling the kettle black.</para><para>We care about whether children are going to be in detention or not. We care about their conditions, how they are being treated and whether they are with their mothers and fathers. We do not want to contribute more to the trauma that they have already suffered. We do not think that a government should activelyâperhaps permanentlyâdamage the wellbeing of a young person, whether they are going to live in Australia in their adulthood or anywhere else. We do not think that that is what a government should do. We will be watching closely not just where the minister for children is when we vote on this but where a number of members of parliament on the other side are, because they will have to live with this for a long time if they will not support our amendment and our proposals to help get children living in far more acceptable circumstances than they currently are.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>10410</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThese are thoroughly decent amendments to the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>.

The rest of the resolution was that the House: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>(2) recognises that since 1973, successive Labor and Liberal/National Party Governments have, with bipartisan support, pursued a racially non-discriminatory immigration policy to the overwhelming national, and international, benefit of Australia; and</para><para>(3) gives its unambiguous and unqualified commitment to the principle that, whatever criteria are applied by Australian Governments in exercising their sovereign right to determine the composition of the immigration intake, race or ethnic origin shall never, explicitly or implicitly, be among them.</para></quote><para>That was a noble resolution that was moved at that time. To the credit of the immigration minister, he crossed the floor, along with the member for Goldstein, Ian Macphee, Mr Steele Hall and Senator Peter Baumeâand Mr Ian Wilson abstained on that occasion. I think the minister will recognise that they are the basic truths of the situation.</para><para>I am saying tonight that there is a new opportunity for the government to cross the floor or at least, if that is regarded as too politically embarrassingâand I could understand thatâto acknowledge these amendments and to agree to the amendments on the voices. It would be a very sad indictment of this parliament if the government could not do that. At the end of a turbulent year, when young people have been among the most victimised in the globe, with very difficult times, with terrorism, we are simply moving amendments to say, `Come on, let's get the kids out from behind the razor wire. It's Christmas. Let's show a bit of good cheer and good spirit.'</para><para>I know the government, as a result of the amendments that were foreshadowed by the member for Lalor, have had a party room meeting where they realised that they had a problem. As a result of thatâagain to the credit of the immigration ministerâsome changes were made. My concern is that those changes were made in response to a political problem, not in response to the genuine merits of the motion that was put. The government have responded but only in a very small way. Here is an opportunity tonight, before Christmas, for the government to put their credibility on the line and say, `These are good, decent and humane amendments and we will agree to them on the voices.' Make the change, Philip, for the good of young people who are locked up behind razor wire. Do the right thing: join with Labor in passing these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>10411</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to speak in support of the two proposed amendments to the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> that involve children and families. Firstly, I wish to congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for closing down the notorious Juliet block. Juliet block was where asylum seekers from other detention centres were sent for alleged misdemeanours or what have you. We heard evidence that it was also a block in which a father and his three-year-old son were incarcerated for 23 hours out of every 24 for two weeks. That is a very shameful thing. It is disappointing that the deputy secretary to the department, in giving evidence, could not give a straight answer on whether Juliet block was a punishment block not only for adults but also for children. I am happy that the notorious Juliet block has now closed.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to unaccompanied minors, I will never forget the donga for unaccompanied minors in Woomera that, had any half decent health and building inspector gone into it, would have been closed down for overcrowding. I totally support the proposition that we should not punish the children for what we perceive as a wrongdoing that may have been done by their parents, and we should not damage them in the process. This is what we are doing. I support the two shadow ministers in their contributions. I was very pleased to go through Maribyrnong with the shadow minister for children when the committee went there. We should not make any mistakes. These amendments will benefit children. We should not care whether those children are Jewish, Christian or Muslim or about whatever religion or colour they are. They are all God's children and we all have a responsibility to them, particularly when they are unaccompanied.</para><para>We do not have national protection laws for children, much to our shame. But we do have laws in this country that give rights to children with respect to contact and access to their parents. This is at the very heart of what the shadow minister is proposing in relation to families and family groups. The proposition that we are doing something for families by taking women and children out of detention centres and separating them from their partners and fathers has always offended me. I acknowledge that it was a positive first step, but it did not go far enough. The coalition cannot campaign on the basis of the strength of its commitment to the institution of family when it believes that, when put to the test on asylum seekers, it must have a role in compulsorily separating families so that mothers and children will not have access to the father of the family. </para><para>Christmas, as I have mentioned before, is one of the holiest days in the calendar. It is about the birth and the holy family, and the family consisted of the child, Jesus, and Mary and Joseph; not just Mary and Jesus, and not just Joseph and Jesus. We would be putting them all together as a family unit. I strongly support this. If I had a Christmas wish granted, it would be to take a TV camera into these detention centres and not to have an interviewer but to just let the women talk about their experiences of being in detention with their children and of the utter despair, dismay and depression that they suffer. Go and talk to the women in Baxter because, by and large, they have been there for a couple of years. They are utterly shattered women who are seeing their families disintegrate but are powerless to do anything about it. These amendments would do something about it. I would urge you in the generosity and compassion of Christmas to support these amendments. They will help some people and children.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>10412</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank my colleagues for their contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>.

All I can tell you is that it is not easily done, and I will make one other observation. When the government has acted as positively as it has to provide a range of options that can be reasonably implemented, even if people felt stronglyâas you believe they might about these sorts of issuesâa resolution of this sort, as flawed as it is, is unlikely to get any support. On the point made earlier by the member for Chifley in relation to the Perth detention centre, I am advised that the accommodation has been increased and improved in its overall quality and that, depending upon the composition of the detainee population, it can be used for family accommodation. As a general rule, they tell me that hotel and motel accommodation has been used for short-term stays. That is the advice I have.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will take up the point that was made first in relation to the amendments to paragraph 196. The shadow minister suggested that it had been further amended to take into account some observations I had made in the correspondence that we have had. Let me say the advice I have is that the amendment is still inconsistent with the overall framework of the act; that is, in the act it provides for release from detention only if a visa is granted or if there is removal. In this case, it still does not provide for the granting of a visa and it is inconsistent with section 198 of the act itself.</para><para>But let me deal with the other two issues which I think are more substantial. They are the issues in proposed section 197D and 197E. The proposed amendment to section 197D in relation to unaccompanied minors, of whom I am the guardian, would require me to release them from detention. I would have no discretion as to the appropriate welfare arrangements for these children. They would be barred from consideration for placement, for instance, in the Woomera Residential Housing Project arrangement, where a close female relative may have been caring for them. That discretion would not be possible. Such an amendment to section 197D is inconsistent with the overarching framework of the act introduced by Labor in 1994. The proposed amendment to section 197D does not indicate that unaccompanied minors are to be granted a visa, nor when such arrangements are to commence or cease. Within the current legislative framework, the government is able to undertake appropriate care arrangements for unaccompanied minors. The legislation in that sense is unnecessary but inflexible. </para><para>I wanted to talk briefly about the interpretation and litigation issues. The amendments will increase the likelihood of litigation by people seeking to establish that they are an unaccompanied minor to enable mandatory release from detention, especially in those circumstances where people arrive without documentation. There appears to be no mechanism for ensuring that the child agrees to placement or for ensuring that their best interests are considered. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The legal obligation to place in foster care without qualification could be inconsistent with the minister's obligations to certain unaccompanied minors under the arrangements for the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act. The minister could be held liable for any harm to the child released under section 197D. Litigation could arise over what constitutes a health or security risk. There is no clear authority under this proposed amendment to supervise the removal of a child from Australia so, if the decision is taken that the child should be removed, there is no clear authority for redetaining the child and making arrangements for removal.</para><para>In relation to the proposed amendment to section 197E, the proposed amendment would make it a requirement that all family members be accommodated with the child in conditions that apply to the residential housing project now. This would act considerably to reduce the flexibility under the current legislative framework to address specific needs of detainees. The government has used a variety of alternative detention arrangements tailored to the needs of the individual or family. The amendments would introduce rigidity and a `one size fits all' approach. The proposed amendment to section 197E would become a pull factor by encouraging adults to bring children with them when they unlawfully enter Australia. The proposed amendment assumes that the risks of absconding from low detention facility arrangements are the same as for all families, whatever their circumstances, including their different stages of processing and reviewâand, I might say, the different ages of the children because they can be up to 18 years of age.</para><para>It does not take into account the practical limitations and high costs of arrangements if they are required to be implemented in every Australian city, nor does it take into account that sufficient appropriate accommodation could be difficult to identify. There is no distinction between short-term compliance cases, many of which are in the cities, and those of longer term detainees. There are, of course, the variety of interpretation and litigation issues. It is not clear which family members, immediate or extended, would be included. This could give rise to litigation. Nor is it clear how the situation where families decided they did not wish to cohabit would be dealt with, and extensive litigation could arise over what constitutes a health or security risk, as in the previous section. Nor is it clear what constitutes the same amenity and security standards as apply at the Woomera Residential Housing Project. I mention those matters. I think the amendments were well intentioned but not well thought through. I think the arrangements that the government has implemented more than satisfactorily address these issues and enable us to ensure that unaccompanied minors, as they are at the moment, can be released into foster care arrangements. For those people who wish to participate, where women and children are living in alternative residential accommodation, those arrangements, where it is appropriate, can be facilitated. I think that more than responds to the sorts of issues that have been raised. I commend the bill to the House and oppose the amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>10413</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the minister for his response.

The clarification in relation to the subsection 48(3) bar not preventing the lodging of a new claim offshore is, in our view, a sensible clarification.

When this bill was originally circulated, it was a straightforward bill that dealt with three distinct issues. These issues were to introduce certain interest withholding tax exemptions, to exempt compensation payments in relation to the German Forced Labour Compensation Program from capital gains tax and to enable friendly society investment products to be included in their assessable income. It was a straightforward bill, and Labor supports the changes. However, yesterday we were informed that the government had decided to make changes to this bill, even though the bill was not listed to be debated in the House this week. We were advised that it would be brought on the next day, and there would be amendments. </para></talk.start><para>This would not normally have been a major issue. However, it is an issue in this case as the government's amendments relate to matters that were foreign to the original bill. Whilst the first amendment relates to the original bill, extending an interest withholding tax exemption on nostro accounts, the second amendment amends the operation of the transitional compulsory third party insurance's rule for certain compulsory third party policies. The government has tried to ram through these changes by the backdoor with less than 24 hours notice. The government has tried to make changes to the transitional rules relating to compulsory third party insurance. The arrogance of this government is without measure. As a result of this, Labor will support the bill, but it is taking the unusual step of denying this bill noncontroversial status in the Senate and also will not allow it to be exempt from the cut-off.</para><para>I would like to briefly discuss the new amendments. The first amendment extends the interest withholding tax exemption for interest paid on nostro accounts held by authorised deposit taking institutions, ADIs, to financial institutions which are not ADIs but which conduct banking business with the public. It seems that, after the original bill was introduced into parliament, the government was lobbied by merchant banks to extend the exemption to them. As is the usual case with the Howard government, they acquiesced to demands from the top end of town. The supplementary explanatory memorandum states that this amendment will have no impact on the forward estimates.</para><para>The amendments in relation to compulsory third party insurance are aimed at reducing the compliance burden on CTP insurers by simplifying the application of the special three-year transitional rule. The amendments relate to policies taken out between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2003. The amendments will change the mechanism by which the transitional rule operates, such that it will be triggered by the date of commencement of the insurance policy rather than the date of payment of an insurance premium, as is the case at the moment. The intention is to smooth the phasing out of the transitional rule for CTP insurers by simplifying the identification of those policies that are subject to the transitional rule. The effect is that an entity is not entitled to claim an input tax credit for the acquisition of CTP insurance where the acquisition relates to a period of insurance that commences before 1 July 2003âthat is, input tax credits will be denied because of the commencement date of the CTP insurance rather than the payment date for the acquisition of the CTP insurance.</para><para>Contrary to public perception, the Howard government has raised taxes by almost two per cent of GDP since it came to office. With the budget in deficit last financial year, all that money is being spent, severely limiting the government's room to move on tax reform. In the last two federal budgets, taxes accounted for 24.9 per cent of GDP, including the GST. It was 23 per cent in 1995-96 under Labor.</para><para>Treasurer Costello tries to deny this. His budget papers show that tax accounts for only 21 per cent of GDP. The Treasurer wants to portray himself as the low-tax Treasurer; but he is actually the lack of truth Treasurer. In the budget papers, he talks about the Charter of Budget Honesty. The Commonwealth Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 requires that the budget be based on external reporting standards in accordance with the charter. The major external standards used in the budget are the Australia Bureau of Statistics accrual Government Finance Statistics framework and the Australian Accounting Standards, including Australian Accounting Standard No. 31, `Financial Reporting by Governments', AAS31. </para><para>The charter also requires that departures from applicable external reporting standards be identified. This is contained in appendix A to statement 2 and in note 1 to statement 12, which discloses departures from the external reporting standards. The departure relates, of course, to the treatment of GST. The clear policy intent, according to the Treasurer, of the intergovernmental agreement on Commonwealth-state financial arrangements is that the GST is collected by the Commonwealth as an agent for the states and territories and appropriated to the states. As such, it is not shown as Commonwealth revenue in other statements in this document.</para><para>The former Secretary to the Treasury and the former member for Fairfax in this place, Mr John Stone, took this issue up in the May edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Review</inline> in the year 2000. He had been in some debate with the Commonwealth statistician about how the GST was going to be treated. John Stone won the argument and the statistician put out an information paper called <inline font-style="italic">Accruals based government finance statistics 2000</inline>. This was published on 13 March 2000. The statistician devoted a whole appendix to his proposed treatment of goods and services tax revenues in government finance statistics. Former Senator Stone said that the statistician considered five possible tests as to that treatment for which the core elements of his argument emerge as follows:</para><quote><para>1. The Commonwealth has the ultimate role in the determination and distribution of GST revenue. The GST is imposed and collected by the Commonwealth under Commonwealth legislation. The Commonwealth government must endorse any changes to the GST rate and the rate change must be enacted into law by the Commonwealth parliament. The relativity factor determining the distribution of the net GST proceeds for each state and territory will be determined by the Commonwealth Treasurer. And the Commonwealth has the ultimate role in the determination and distribution of GST revenue. And, so, to the bottom line.</para></quote><para>He quotes the statistician as saying:</para><quote><para>The ABS will adopt the constitutional treatment for GST revenue and classify GST revenues as Commonwealth taxes in GFSâ</para></quote><para>that is, Government Finance Statisticsâand that:</para><quote><para>The distribution of GST revenue to state and territory governments will be treated as grants. </para></quote><para>Game, set and match. So the Treasurer is hiding from the taxpayers of Australia $30 billion of GST so that he can claim that his tax take is a low 21 per cent of GDP when it is actually 24.9 per cent. So Costello has worked out how much tax we pay but fails to include the GST. Costello's motive is his desire to be seen as the Treasurer who cuts taxes, but he cannot escape the fact that Labor did with 23 per cent of GDP exactly what the Commonwealth currently does with 24.9 per cent of GDPâthat is, make payments to the states and fulfil Commonwealth functions. Costello's accounting methods are at total odds with IMF guidelines and the ABS.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hunt</name></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

We need this legislation to give our intelligence agencies vital tools to deter and prevent terrorism. We have not wavered from this position and we do not intend to do so now. The government are not being pig-headed about this; the government have bent over backwards to accommodate suggestions that strengthen and enhance the operation of the bill.</para><para>We significantly amended the bill following the reports of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and we again proposed amendments following the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, some of which were passed in the Senate. But, as the government have repeatedly stated, we cannot and will not accept amendments that render the bill unworkable. That would do nothing to protect the community from terrorism. The community demands that our counter-terrorism laws are strong and certain. The opposition's amendments make this bill fail on both counts. The opposition's amendments make the bill, at best, unworkable and, at worst, unconstitutional.</para><para>The opposition's amendments go to matters of fundamental principle that we cannot accept. The government will not pretend to the community that what has come out of the Senate will provide the kind of protection against terrorism that we know we need. We will not do that when we know the opposition's package of amendments effectively renders the bill useless in the emergency situations it is designed to address, and open to challenge. That is why the government are rejecting the opposition and Democrat amendments that were passed in the Senate. In moving the government amendments in due course, I propose to outline just some of our reasons for fundamentally objecting to a number of the opposition amendments.</para><para>The government will be insisting on our proposals in relation to issuing and prescribed authorities. What we proposed was a workable, constitutionally sound regime. What the opposition has insisted upon is unworkable and unconstitutional. The government's unqualified legal advice is that there is a very significant risk that appointing sitting judges as prescribed authorities would be unconstitutional, regardless of whether they are state, territory or federal judges. Under the opposition's amendment, which was passed with the assistance of the minor parties, sitting state and territory judges would be performing functions under Commonwealth legislation that would give federal executive functions to state judges. Our advice is that there would be an unacceptable risk that this would be held to be incompatible with their judicial functions and hence to be unconstitutional. That risk is not just an arguable one but a very significant one. In the face of such a significant risk and on the basis of the advice available to it, the government cannot support the amendment in this form. The government will move amendments that will work and are constitutional to add former judges to the list of persons who can act in the capacity of issuing and prescribed authorities.</para><para>The government have always been emphatic that the ability to question and detain in strictly limited circumstances for the purposes of intelligence gathering to prevent and deter terrorist activity is fundamental to the bill. We have always been clear on that point. The opposition has offered a completely unworkable regime that will not give our intelligence agencies the capacity to get on with the job of protecting Australians and Australian interests against the threat of terrorism. This goes to the very heart of the bill. The opposition is fixated on a flawed notion of a law enforcement regime and does not appear to be able to grasp that this is an intelligence-gathering exercise where law enforcement concepts are not appropriate. </para><para>The bill deals with those circumstances where coercive questioning and detention, subject to strict controls, are necessary in the interests of public safety. For example, it may be necessary to detain a person to prevent them from informing others about ASIO's investigations, or to allow urgent intelligence investigations to continue unimpeded. In some situations the capacity to detain will be critical. As I have said before, it would be absurd to not have the power to detain a person for a limited period in a situation where not doing so might put public safety at risk. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>Those at the front line in meeting this threat tell us that, in order to protect the community from this kind of threat, they need the power to hold a person incommunicado, subject to strict safeguards, while questioning for the purpose of intelligence gathering. We accept this need, but the opposition does not. The government are rejecting the opposition's amendments that would limit questioning under a warrant to four hours, with a limited capacity to extend it to 12 hours. That proposal is an absurd, impractical proposition that does not allow sufficient flexibility to enable our intelligence agency to do its job. The government's amendment to reinstate the important provisions that allow coercive questioning and detention, subject to strict controls, is necessary in the interests of public safety. </para><para>The government will be insisting upon its proposals in relation to the protocols to cover the detention and questioning regime. The opposition amendments are yet another example of how the opposition have insisted on unworkable proposals. The government cannot accept that the protocols be disallowable instruments. Clearly, the opposition are trying to have further bites of the cherry. The opposition cannot be serious about passing the bill if they are going to insist on this extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny. The protocols will contain operational detail that is not appropriate for parliamentary scrutiny. It is vital that the protocols have sufficient flexibility. Entrenching them in a legislative instrument is not appropriate and is inconsistent with the way we treat comparable procedures that our law enforcement and security agencies are currently guided by. Having the procedures set in legislative concrete would render them unworkable. Having the protocols as disallowable instruments would not allow sufficient flexibility. </para><para>We have seen what the Senate has done to this bill. We cannot afford to waste time debating time and time again the minutiae that will be contained in the protocols. The government amendments cover the types of matters that the protocols must addressâand that is the type of provision the parliament should enact. The government cannot accept the opposition's amendment which will allow the subjects of warrants to have access to a lawyer of their own choice as a matter of right rather than an approved security cleared lawyer, as is proposed by the government. Again, the opposition's amendment is unworkable. The government's starting point is that all persons detained under a warrant should have access to a lawyer. The government proposes that lawyers be security cleared in advance to enable appropriate representation to be granted immediately. The costs of these lawyers will be met by the Commonwealth. We recognise that in extreme circumstances it may be vital to delay access to a lawyer. We have structured our provisions with tight safeguards and additional hurdles. The government is concerned about circumstances where there may be imminent danger to the community.</para><para>The government have repeatedly stated that a sunset clause is not appropriate. We are moving amendments to remove the sunset clause inserted by the opposition in the Senate. The international and domestic environment has changed forever. There is no way of saying for certain when, if ever, the provisions of the bill will be unnecessary. We have offered workable provisions for review of the legislation after one year and then again after three years. This will allow the legislation to be reviewed without subjecting it to arbitrary time pressures. We simply cannot say that these laws will no longer be required in two, three or four years. A review will allow for consideration of the bill and an appropriate level of scrutiny of the operation of the laws without the possibility that we will face a situation where we do not have these vital tools when we need them. </para><para>The government will also be insisting on our original provisions in relation to the questioning of 14- to 18-year-olds. We recognise that young people have special needs. That is why we have included additional requirements and special safeguards for 14- to 18-year-olds. We know that suicide attacks occur throughout the world. We know the devastation that they bring. We know that they can involve people as young as 16 or 17. Yet the opposition is seeking to deny our intelligence agency the capacity to gather intelligence in order to prevent suicide attacks. The Australian public would be appalled to think that we failed to prevent a 17-year-old terrorist bomber because ASIO was not allowed to ask him or her questions.</para><para>The key aim of this important legislation is to enable ASIO to question people in emergency terrorist situations in order to obtain the information we need to stop terrorist attacks before people are hurt or killed. We have always said that we recognise that this bill is extraordinary, but this bill is about intelligence gathering in extraordinary circumstances and is subject to significant safeguards. The opposition amendments go to the heart of the bill and fundamentally change the nature of what the government have proposed. The government have repeatedly said that we will not entertain proposals that will render the bill impotent or unworkable. That is why we have voted against the amendments moved by the opposition and the minor parties. If the opposition were serious about community safety, it would not entertain such a risk of unworkable and unconstitutional provisions. We cannot take the chance that our efforts to prevent an impending terrorist attack could be delayed and challenged on constitutional grounds. The opposition exposes itself as being hopelessly divided on this bill. The government have demonstrated time and time again our commitment to community safety, but we will not accept amendments that fundamentally change the nature of the bill. The government want this vital legislation passed before Christmas, but we will not try to pull the wool over the community's eyes by supporting a flawed and ineffective bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>10429</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Labor Party disagree with the government disagreeing with the proposals that have come back from the Senate.

The Attorney-General indicated that what he wanted was a capacity for intelligence gathering and questioning by ASIO. Now he is turning it into a detention regime.

The bill that has come back from the Senate, following recommendations not only by Labor but also supported by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, gets the balance right. Yet the government will not accept it. Why? Because they want to play politics with this issue. That is the only reason we have, because the government have the capacity, through the bill before us now, to get the tougher regime that they argue for. Even members of their own party, the Senate committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD accept it. Members of your party accept the amendments that Labor has been promoting and the Senate has voted on. You are ignoring even members of your own party who have looked at all of this evidence and who have had the opportunity to consider the information. There have been representations from the Law Council and from eminent jurists in this country, and you ignore them.

It can be through tonight and the legislation can be in place as soon as possible. </para></talk.start></continue><para>This bill which has come back from the Senate gives unprecedented new powers to ASIO. It also ensures the necessary protection of our citizens. We were prepared to give our security services these new powers because of the new threat facing Australia from terrorism. But when you give an intelligence organisation like ASIO new powers you must have safeguards built in. No other similar agency in the Western world would have the powers that this bill delivers to ASIOâand the Attorney-General knows it. We have supported tough new powers to fight terrorism, but we also want protection for our citizens. It means getting the balance right.</para><para>I use the words `getting the balance right' because when the previous antiterrorism bills came before this House the government and the Prime Minister argued that our amendments were unworkable and unacceptable. We hear that language again tonight. Three months later, when the Prime Minister went before the National Press Club, he said that the antiterrorism bill had got the balance right. In other words, once the politics had moved out, he recognised and was prepared to publicly acknowledge the merit of the Labor initiatives. That is what you should be doing tonight. If you were honest with yourself, Attorney, if you were really serious about getting tougher new legislation in place expeditiously, you would be passing this bill that has come back tonight.</para><para>We have aimed to achieve four critical objectives, which the government oppose.

The government said this danger would extend over the Christmas holidays and into next year. If, as the government appears determined, Australia joins in a US-led war against Iraq, the terrorist threat to Australia and Australians overseas may well increase. The <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> is about protecting Australians from terrorists. This amended bill will give ASIO new power to collect information from people who may know something about terrorists. The bill will empower ASIO, under warrant, to compel people to answer questions about terrorist activity. ASIO does not have this power at present. Even if dealing with an imminent terrorist threat, ASIO cannot compel people to provide information relating to that threat. This is a power ASIO needs now to deal with current threats. </para></talk.start><para>By passing this amended bill today, the parliament will enhance our security at a time of significant threat. This is a power that should be available to ASIO and should have been available many months ago. Unfortunately, the government's incompetent handling of this legislation has ensured that only today is the bill fit enough to be passed by this parliament. The original bill, introduced on 22 March, was very different from the amended legislation now before us. The bill, as introduced, would have allowed adults, and even children, to be detained and strip searched, and to be held in secret by ASIO for rolling two-day periods that could be extended indefinitelyâeven after the questioning had concluded. I repeat: `even after the questioning had concluded', Attorney-General. You were asked about that on two occasions and you answered in relation to that question. </para><para>The original bill was a proposal for indefinite detention incommunicado. The original bill breached fundamental legal and human rights principles. It was completely unacceptable. The bill was referred to both the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The detailed examination undertaken by these committees has demonstrated the effectiveness of comprehensive committee consideration by the parliament. Following the bipartisan recommendationsâI repeat: `bipartisan recommendations'âof the joint committee and the Senate committee, Labor successfully moved in the Senate extensive amendments which have fundamentally transformed the bill. The government also successfully moved a number of amendments which cherry picked elements of the Senate committee report.</para><para>The amended bill has the following features and safeguards: applications for warrants to carry out questioning may be made by the Director-General of ASIO with the approval of the Attorney-General; warrants for questioning to be issued by a prescribed authority with appropriate high legal standing and independence; compulsory questioning by ASIO officers before a prescribed authority for strictly limited time periods; persons being questioned to have access to legal representation; any custody must be directly linked to the questioning and no detention for other purposes; protection for children under the age of 18; and provisions for comprehensive parliamentary scrutiny of the questioning system, including a three-year sunset clause. These are all reasonable propositions; all should be accepted by the government.</para><para>We now have a bill which gives ASIO a tool that it urgently needs: a compulsory questioning regime. We also have a bill with strong and appropriate safeguards that have been insisted on by the legal profession, many community groups and the thousands of ordinary Australians who have written to the committees and directly to MPs and senators. These safeguards are consistent with well-established standards which apply to police investigations and to questioning by bodies such as royal commissions, the new Australian Crime Commission, ASIC, ICAC and other state crime commissions. The amended bill gets the balance right between security and civil liberties. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The government now have a choice: to vote for the bill as amended or to reject those amendments. They can choose to accept the new power for ASIO, which the opposition are prepared to support, along with the protections we are insisting upon, or alternatively they can leave ASIO without the authority to compel answers. </para><para>The government can act in the national interest or in their own perceived political interest. The ball is in their court. The government have made much of the terrorist threat to Australia. They have emphasised that the threat is very real and very immediate in nature. This issue should be above political game playing. The opposition support the amended bill, and we urge the government to also do so without further delay. That sends the right messageâcross-party support for legislation. We did it with the first tranche of terrorist bills, and they worked. If the government spurns the compromise, as they have indicated they intend to do, if they try to play politics with this, then the opposition are ready to fight that fight. We are determined to protect the Australian people from terrorism and to protect the rights and freedoms that Australians cherish. That is what we are fighting forâvalues, our institutions, the rule of law. That is what these amendments ensure, and that is why it is an outrage that the government seek to spurn the amended bill from the Senate.</para><para>I would like to conclude my remarks by highlighting what has been a fundamental concern for meânamely, the proposed treatment of persons not suspected of any offence. The government appears committed to its proposal that people not suspected of any offence be detained in secret for up to seven days. In contrast, the Crimes Act allows murder suspects to be detained by police for a maximum of only 12 hours. They must then be charged or released. What the government proposes is a detention regime for suspects and non-suspects alike, and an extremely harsh one at that, of up to seven daysâwith the first two days potentially incommunicadoâwithout access to a lawyer. The government's continuing commitment to this detention regime has been made very clear today by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice and Customs. The government has been very insistent that the power to detain persons not necessarily suspected of any offence is a core part of its scheme. This will be a fundamental departure from established legal and human rights principles, and the Attorney-General knows that. It is unacceptable. The government has utterly failed to justify this radical change.</para><para>Why should a person who is not suspected of any offence but is simply thought to be able to assist with information relevant to the investigation of a terrorism offence be treated worse than a murder suspect? Why should a non-suspect be treated worse than a suspect? The opposition remains very firmly of the view that this cannot be justified. This is not General Pinochet's Chile. This is Australia. For an Attorney-General, the first law officer of the country, to come into this parliament to argue for a secret detention regime for non-suspects is an utter disgrace. The Labor Party will never wear it; the Australian people will never wear it.</para><para>By rejecting the amended bill, the government are betraying the national interest. They are betraying the safety of the Australian people; they are betraying our democratic principles and they will be condemned for their betrayal. We will make sure of that. You do not defeat terrorists by detaining non-suspects incommunicado without lawyers. They are the values of our system. That is what differentiates us from the terrorists. That is why what the government is doing is inexcusable. It is inexcusable, and this Attorney is defending the indefensible. He knows it, and that is why today he found great difficulty in his press conference after that bill was amended in the Senate. We will maintain our position. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>10433</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join the Leader of the Opposition and my colleague the member for Banks in opposing the Attorney-General's motion. Today in an interview before the media, the Attorney-General emphasised that the government is about creating a detention regime. Indeed, as the member for Banks described it, it is not only a detention regime; it is a secret detention regime. It has been said, and it should be said again, when democracy conducts its business behind closed doors, democracy itself withers and dies. We should not forget that. We, in the opposition, have proposed a regime which is workable and is constitutionally valid because it is a questioning regime. We emphasise it is a questioning regime. Why? Because only a questioning regime will withstand constitutional challenge. </para></talk.start><para>It is the Attorney-General who is pulling the wool over the eyes of the Australian people in this context. It is well known to all members of the House that our system of government, based on the Westminster model, is based on a clear separation of powers between this parliament, the executiveâof which the Attorney-General is a minister of the Crown and a memberâand the judiciary, as set out in chapter III of the Constitution. It is the courts and the judiciary that have the power under our Constitution to detain people. If there is any authority required for that, let me point the Attorney-General to Lim's case, of which he would be aware. In the High Court, the majority judgment in that case said:</para><quote><para>It would, for example, be beyond the legislative power of the Parliament to invest the Executive with an arbitrary power to detain citizens in custody notwithstanding that the power was conferred in terms which sought to divorce such detention in custody from both punishment and criminal guilt.</para></quote><para>Which is what this proposed model does. It continues:</para><quote><para>The reason why that is so is that ... the involuntary detention of a citizen in custody by the State is penal or punitive in character and, under our system of government, exists only as an incident of the exclusively judicial function of adjudging and punishing criminal guilt. </para><para>Every citizen is âruled by the law, and by the law aloneâ and âmay with us be punished for a breach of law, but he can be punished for nothing elseâ.</para></quote><para>There are exceptions, and the Attorney-General would acknowledge those as described, for instance, in Kruger's case, where they said:</para><quote><para>The question whether a power to detain persons or to take them into custody is to be characterised as punitive in nature so as to attract the operation of Ch. III, depends upon whether those activities are reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for a legitimate non-punitive object.</para></quote><para>Look at the Attorney-General's interview and look at his speech today where he said that a purpose of the regime is to detain people to prevent them communicating. Indeed, incommunicado detention is for that very purpose, and he also mentioned the purpose of deterrence. Clearly, these are purposes of punishment; they are not reasonably incidental to obtaining intelligence for the purpose of preventing a terrorist attack. </para><para>The Attorney's model will be challenged and successfully challenged, I believe, because it is based on a model of detention for detention's sake, not for the purpose of questioning to obtain intelligence to prevent a terrorist attack. There is no point in this parliament passing such important legislation if it is only going to be struck down and allow terrorist attacks to occur because the legislation has been struck down. Look at what we are proposing, look at the authorities that we rely on and come up with a balanced package. The opposition are prepared to support the government in achieving that, but we will not respond to wedge purposes only to see legislation struck down and defeated and the whole purpose set asunder because the government has not been prepared to sit down, look rationally at the authorities and come up with a balanced model.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>10434</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFor the last 15 months, and probably longer, the people in this country who are assigned the responsibility to define threats to Australian citizens have come to the conclusion that Australia lies within al-Qaeda's defined South-East Asian field of jihad. That means for the average Australian citizen that we are legitimate civilian and military targets. We may be killed at will for the political purposes of establishing the ideological and political structures that those who support various elements of the terrorist movement believe should be established. We may be killed here; we may be killed abroad.</para></talk.start><para>Their definition of our humanity has more in common with the fascist definitions of people with whom the fascist movements of the 1930s disagreed than it has with any known political characterisation which we would normally in political discourse in this country assign to each other. This is a serious problem. We are serious targets. Australians have already been killed. The intention to identify other Australians for killing has already been established.</para><para>Australians have been killed partly because we do not share a particular set of religious convictions. We have been killed partly because we are supporters of the United States, who are defined as one of the enemies. We are to be killed partly because we associate with moderate Muslim regimes which are themselves targets. We are to be killed partly because we supported the independence of East Timor. There are a whole variety of reasons why we are potentially to be killed. We are to be killed in our homes, we are to be killed in our clubs and we are to be killed in our public buildings.  </para><para>These are serious issues for the Australian people and they are problems with which we must deal. Our intelligence services have advised us adequately on that; they make calculations from time to time. When this ideological and moral commitment and intention on the part of al-Qaeda and its affiliated organisations are capable of being transmitted into some sort of meaningful action, we are given warning about when that might take place. Nobody in the intelligence community is confident that they will be able to pick up any particular one of these threats with any degree of accuracy sufficient to prevent it, but they are getting better at it. There have been many incidentsâobviously the most recent one affecting our people is the incident in Baliâand there have also been many frustrations. There is an active intelligence operation now against al-Qaeda and it has some chance of containing the levels of threat that are there to members of our community.</para><para>If the bill passed by the Senate were accepted by the government, it would substantially increase the protection of the ordinary Australian citizen. The bill, as passed by the Senate, permitsâunprecedented in the history of this countryâintelligence authorities to take a person and question them for 20 hours. The Attorney-General would know well that those 20 hours, of course, are not 20 hours from go to whoa, from the time when the person is picked up; they are 20 hours of questioning. Any reasonable human being knows that 20 hours of questioning probably means, in practical terms, detention for two to three days, whether you choose to define this as a questioning regime or a detention regime. We define it as questioning regime. But the practical effect of it will be to hold people for two to three days.</para><para>In addition, while legal protections are extended to the persons so picked up for questioning, if the lawyersâand there are emergency provisions associated with this, so it is not necessarily a lawyer of their own choosingâdivulge the activities in which those people have been involved, they will go to jail. If those who are detained for the purposes of questioning lie to their questioners, they will go to jail. It is as simple as that. This is a powerful tool which will be available, if you pass the legislation, to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. That tool is not available to the FBI; it will never be available to the FBI and it is not conceivable that it will ever be available to the FBI, except if the FBI is dealing with aliens in the United States. They cannot do it with a US citizen, but we will be able to do it with an Australian citizenâor, for that matter, a US citizen in Australia. It is a powerful tool. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> If you permit it to be put in place, there are checks and balances contained within itâand you will have an opportunity to review whether those checks and balances are effective or too constrainingâbut it is worth a go.</para><para>You are concerned that some of these matters may be disallowable instruments. The Labor Party is supporting this because we believe it ought to be put in place. We are not opposing it because we think that the civil liberties questions necessarily override the importance of the protection of the state and the citizens within it. We are not in the business of finding ways of knocking off regulations that you establish under these proposals. We are not in that business. We are in the business of ensuring an effective regime. At the end of the day, that is our bottom line.</para><para>Attorney-General, I have served on one of the committees that has examined the matters that the government has placed before us, and others of my colleagues have served on other committees. I have taken a great deal of interest in the way in which this has been handled. I know and you know that there is great disquiet on your back bench about these matters. Many of the things to which you objected that are entailed in this legislation were in fact positions arrived at by some of your own members serving on those committees. You know as well as I do that this is not opposed or questioned by a group of ratbags in the community who wish us ill. The people who have taken stands against this in the general public include the Law Council and the Press Council. As I said, they are not ratbags; they are people who take seriously the issues and concerns about civil liberty in relation to the Australian people. </para><para>These people know precisely how much the powers of the state are extended by this legislation. Their view was that the attitude of the Labor Party ought to be to not permit this legislation, which would never see the light of day in the United States, to see the light of day here. We choose not to take this view, because we think that we are threatened. We think our society is threatened. We think we have to protect our society. We think this bill will help us protect our society. That is the basis on which we approach itâthe same basis on which we approach the terrorist legislation. But this legislation means 20 hours of questioningâeffectively two or three days. If there is any information that that person will voluntarily divulge, they will divulge it in those 20 hours.</para><para>You are worried about age limits. You talked about whether or not a 17-year-old might go out, as some 17-year-olds have, with a bomb strapped to them and destroy the lives of Australians. Frankly, the person you described, Minister, is a person to be dealt with under other legislation, not this one. If the person that you have in custody is a person that you have reason to believe could be a suicide bomber, that comes under the criminal elements associated with the terrorist laws, and that is how you would deal with that particular individual. In any event, this is an enormous enhancement of your power, but it is an enhancement you need right now. This is very late in the day and very late in the sittings.</para><para>My advice to you, Attorney-General, is to take what has been offered to you by the Senate. We are about to enter what many of us like to describe as `the silly season'. We also know that there are authoritative reports globally that al-Qaeda and its affiliates intend to turn this season into something quite different. It is possible, not likely, that the United States will engage in military action in Iraq over the course of the next few months prior to the parliament's next sitting. I do not think they will, but they might. If they do, it is unquestionably the case that Australians abroad and here will find themselves a target for heightened activity by al-Qaeda and its supporters. We need the information. There is a chance that, if you pass the bill in the form in which it has come back from the Senate, you will get that information. You would not be able to live with yourself, Attorney-General, if, in rejecting what you had to handâwhether or not you think it is a work of perfectionâan event about which we might have had information took place. You would not forgive yourself. There is no need for you to place yourself in that situation. There has been strong support on your side of the House and, I might say, on your side of political affairsâthere are not too many Labor supporters in the law councils or for that matter on the Press Council. Your side of political affairs wanted much less; in fact, they wanted nothing at all to pass this place. We want something that is good, workable and effective. Give it a go. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>10436</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to comment briefly on the amended <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> as returned from the Senate, and I also oppose the Attorney's motion. I accept the honourable member for Brand's assessment of the regional terrorist scenario, but as I said in the second reading debate the bill as first presented to this House allowed fear to prevail. It lessened our freedoms and, instead of encouraging vigilance and caution, emphasised unfounded proaction, secrecy, unfounded suspicion and a climate quite antithetic to that which should prevail in Australia of all places.</para></talk.start><para>The price of freedom is eternal vigilance, but not at the price of putting freedom second in line to denying freedom. The amendments subsequently approved by the Senate significantly improve this bill in line with the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The government has chosen to reject these amendments and, in the case of the judges required to be issuing authorities, argues constitutional difficulties. The amended prescribed authority provisions propose that in the first instance it be made up of retired judges. If there are insufficient numbers of retired judges, then serving state or territory judges can be called upon and, if there are still insufficient numbers, senior members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </para><para>I also read a copy of the opinion of former Commonwealth Solicitor-General Gavan Griffith QC; as has been made clear, he sees no constitutional difficulties. Again I challenge the Attorney-General to further explain his legal advice as to why the government believes this judicial arrangement, so vital for the independence of, and public confidence in, the prescribed authority, is unconstitutional and why it contradicts Gavan Griffith QC.</para><para>I remind the House of the Law Council's statement to the Senate inquiry that the powers proposed to be granted to ASIO are so far-reaching that the issuing of warrants should only be capable of being authorised by a chapter III judge. I humbly suggest the former Commonwealth Solicitor-General has not only confirmed the constitutionality of the judicial arrangement in the Senate amendments but has also confirmed the constitutionality of the exercise of a warrant by such a panel in that it is not inconsistent with the exercise of judicial power.</para><para>As the Senate committee report statedâand it was a majority bipartisan report with three individual dissenting reports, as I recallâASIO is an intelligence-gathering agency, not a law enforcement body. Unless we embody that basic concept in this legislation, we sacrifice a large slab of our hard-won freedom by handing over policing to faceless secret officers. They need to be faceless and secretâthe public and the nation support thatâto inquire, but only under the strict supervision of an independent prescribed authority with every protection of common law rights and human rights.</para><para>We have here what is most likely the first major proactive law that I can recall, as opposed to the normal law making in parliaments around this country which traditionally has been concerned with reactive lawânamely, dealing with law-breakers after the event. Here we are dealing with action before the event, dealing not only with suspects but with nonsuspects. That is why we need the exceptional safeguards to protect rights that to this point have left us rightfully boasting that we are the freest nation on earth. That is a big call perhaps, but I will continue to argue it if this legislation is passed as amended by the Senate. I could not do that should this legislation come into law without those amendments. It is important to remind the House of the words this week of the Chairman of the Press Council, Professor Ken McKinnon. He said:</para><quote><para>There are so many differences between this and the kinds of freedom our society has fought so hard to achieve.</para></quote><para>Professor George Williams told the Senate inquiry that he thought it would be difficult if not impossible for ASIO to be sufficiently secretive to adequately fulfil its primary mission as well as to be sufficiently open to scrutiny to exercise the powers set out in the ASIO bill. That is the nub of the argument here, and that is why the government's legislation is deficient without the amendments passed by the Senate and in particular the totally independent and separated power of the prescribed authority and the three-year sunset clause. As with native title, if a ramping up of security concerns is being used as a double dissolution trigger, the cost will be our freedoms and not our security, which is well protected by the bill as it stands, amended by the Senate via the bipartisan recommendation of the Senate committee. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>10437</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMight I make a couple of practical observations. I recall being involved in debates and discussions when, for the first time, the Commonwealth parliament introduced time limits and videotaping of interviews of suspects involved in allegations of breaches of federal offences. I remember at that time that there were people of considerable experience who believed that by providing such time limits the police would be handicapped in their work and that by videotaping those materials there would be difficulties. In truth, in practice we discovered that it was probably the most important advance in the efficiency of law enforcement, that disputed confessions were no longer the subject of long litigation and that the system worked very well. We also discovered that all the necessary questioning of suspects could be undertaken within a time frame substantially less than that now proposed to be the maximum period for the interrogation of nonsuspects under this legislation. </para></talk.start><para>The opposition knows that we need to provide a framework which is more open to the security agencies to seek information and to compel answers from those who are not suspected of crimes. This is a framework which allows that. What I find very puzzling is why the government will not accept a framework that the goodwill of this parliament will allow to pass. If it believes that there ought to be sterner or different measures and wants to put that to the political test, let it bring back further measures and let us have a debate in future. But why, for God's sake, when we accept that we face as a community the real risk that somewhere someone may be seeking to attack our society and the individuals in it, would we not at least agree on those elements that both sides of this parliament and the Independents and others can agree on and then have our debates and disputes? Nobody is saying that the Labor Partyâand those who see this as the furthest reach to which those who believe in civil liberties and a decent set of arrangements to protect the rights of individuals are prepared to travelâwish to expose Australia to terrorism; surely they do not see that their fellow Australians and parliamentarians and many in the community are treasonous or acting against the nature of the interests of the Australian society.</para><para>Why not pass what has been offered that gives the opportunity to question people, to compel their testimony, to hold them for a very extended period, to do all that the government has said is necessary? Pass the legislation and then have any further disputes that the government may wish to have for political reasonsâto persuade the community that there are issues that it wishes to litigate further for double dissolution purposes, for whatever political gain.</para><para>If the circumstance does arise when, as a result of a deadlock between the houses, we do not have legislation in place, then we will have one of the most disgraceful political arguments possibleâthat is, who is to blame? What a disgrace it will be for this parliament, this country and this community. Accept what is on offer on the goodwill of both sides of this House, then fight your fights.

At that meeting the Commonwealth agreed to legislate to allow self-assumption of risk for people who choose to participate in inherently risky activities such as adventure tourism and sports. The bill is designed to underpin state and territory reforms to the law of negligence by removing incentives to sue for breach of contract by relying on a term implied by section 74 of the Trade Practices Act. At the COAG meeting on Friday, 6 December COAG noted the Commonwealth's commitment to amend the Trade Practices Act to ensure that state and territory legislation will not be compromised. Acceptance of the amendments would impose fetters on the capacity of parties to rely on the bill and hence would compromise the effectiveness of state and territory reforms. The government cannot accept these amendments as they are contrary to the commitment made to all state and territory premiers and chief ministers to ensure that the Trade Practices Act does not undermine state and territory law reform. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>10445</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSection 74 of the Trade Practices Act implies into every contract for a service that the service will be rendered with due care and skill and that any material supplied in connection with those services will be reasonably fit for its intended purpose. The <inline ref="R1610">Trade Practices Amendment (Liability for Recreational Services) Bill 2002</inline> amends the TPA to allow contractual exclusion, an exclusion clause or waiver for liability for death or personal injury by the providers of recreational services from the implied warranties in section 74 of the TPA.</para></talk.start><para>The bill went to the Senate economics committee, and from the evidence obtained by the committee it is now apparent that the minister's press release inaccurately represented the government's position on the bill. It is now clear that the government did not intend to move any amendments to the bill even though the bill appears to allow people to agree to unlimited waivers releasing service providers from all liability for death or personal injury, including in those cases involving gross negligence.</para><para>There is significant opposition to the bill in its current form from those who made submissions to the Senate committee. However, the expert panel on the review of the law of negligence did support the bill, subject only to amending the definitions of recreational services and personal injury. It should be noted that the Insurance Council declined to make a submission, on the basis that they wanted to see the whole package of reforms in relation to the Trade Practices Act before commenting. The objective of this bill now, according to evidence from Treasury to the committee, is to meet the commitment made by the Commonwealth at the ministerial meeting on public liability insurance in May 2002. The communique from that summit states that the Commonwealth will:</para><quote><para>Legislate to allow self-assumption of risk for people who choose to participate in inherently risky activities such as adventure tourism and sports, subject to preserving adequate protection for consumers under the Trade Practices Act 1974.</para></quote><para>The states are committed to introducing mirror legislation where required. The popular appeal of this bill, as was represented by the minister's press release when the bill was introduced, was that it allowed people to voluntarily assume the risks involved in risky recreational activities. This was seen as addressing the need by tourism operators and sports providers for enforceable waivers so that they were not liable for accidents which arose from the inherent risks of participating in such activities. Providers are seeking to avoid liability and ensuing litigation for injury resulting from obvious or inherent risks in recreational activities, as this was threatening the continued availability of affordable insurance cover. The bill also hoped to reduce pressure on insurance premiums.</para><para>At the time of its introduction in June, the bill was strongly supported by pony clubs, and operators of adventure tourism and other high-risk activities. However, that support now appears to be qualified. The Australian Consumers Association have also indicated that, without amendments, they would be forced to issue a consumer warning to participants in recreational activities. This bill goes further than just potentially removing liability for accidents or obvious or inherent risks from participating in recreational activities. If so agreed, a waiver could also waive liability for negligence, however arising. The likelihood of this occurring, however, will depend on people agreeing to such a waiver, service providers requiring such waivers and courts not adopting a conservative interpretation of a waiver and so reading down the extent of the liability waived. Evidence to the committee indicates that, if the bill proceeds, lawyers will actively seek to have courts read down waivers or will assert that waivers were not understood or disclosed, and so not effective. This is probably also the view of the Ipp report, which stated:</para><quote><para>In summary, the Bill removes the obstacle presented by s 68 to the exclusion of the warranties implied by s 74. It does not, by itself, exclude, restrict or modify the liability of providers of recreational services. The ordinary law of contract presents various significant obstacles to the achievement of that end. </para></quote><para>The obstacles the panel refers to include the following. The exclusion of implied warranties will be subject to the ordinary rules of contract law, which are stringent. The exclusion must be effectively incorporated into the contract and, in cases where there is doubt about whether the rules about incorporation have been met, the doubt will be resolved in favour of the consumer. In order to be effective the words of the exclusion clause must be clear and unambiguous; again, any doubts about the precise meaning of the clause will be resolved in favour of the consumer. A contractual exclusion, if effective, will only be effective against the other party to the contract. Thus, if one person enters a contract for the supply of services to a group the other members of the group may not be bound by the terms of the contract. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> Also, the Ipp report asserts that many people who participate in recreational services do not do so pursuant to contracts.</para><para>Thus, the bill appears to address the needs of tourism operators but in many cases will mainly just alter what is litigated. On the other hand, there is legitimate concern that this bill may remove the incentive for businesses to ensure that they provide safe services. Evidence to the committee suggests that the government is aware of these problems. It claims that it is concerned to be consistent with state reforms in the area of self-assumption of risk in recreational activities; however, there is some variation between jurisdictions at this stage.</para><para>According to the communique at the ministerial meeting on public liability insurance in October, every state and territory has made some commitment in relation to the provision of waivers to allow people to accept risk. Of those states which have announced or implemented the details of their commitments, New South Wales has passed legislation which limits liability for damages for personal injury arising from recreational activities in the following way: there is no liability for harm as a result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity; there is no liability arising from a risk of an activity in respect of which a risk warning has been given; and, a participant in a recreational activity is able to waive the requirement that services be provided with due care and skill.</para><para>South Australia has passed legislation establishing a system of registered codes governing the provision of recreational services. Where a service provider has registered and undertaken to comply with the registered code, the service provider can enter into a contract with a consumer modifying the duty of care owed to the consumer. The service provider is then liable in damages only if the consumer establishes that a failure to comply with the code caused or contributed to the injury. Victoria has passed legislation which is similar to this bill but makes provision for prescribing the form of the waiver and what particulars must be included in the waiver. It requires that the waiver is signed by the consumer, that no false or misleading statements are made in relation to the waiver and that the waiver is ineffective for an act or omission causing injury which was done with reckless disregard. The details of the commitments of the other states and territories is much vaguer. Thus, it is not clear whether there will be uniformity among the states and territories in any event.</para><para>A number of amendments to this bill were suggested to the Senate Economics Committee. A number of submissions, including the Law Council and sporting industry bodies, recommended that a code of practice or an accreditation system be introduced. This raises issues, though, of who develops such codes, and it still allows for litigation for the interpretations of the standards in the codes. The Plaintiff Lawyers Association wanted waivers limited to waiving liability only for inherent risks. Such an amendment attempts to remove liability for accidents, but it is difficult to define and likely to result in significant litigation as to what is an inherent risk in sport. For example, is a neck injury to a hooker in a rugby scrum the result of the risks involved in scrums generally, the referee not properly supervising the formation of that scrum or the rules of the game at the time being inadequate in relation to the formation of scrums? These are all areas that a plaintiff lawyer would want to see litigated and tested in the courts. </para><para>Finally, a number of submissions and the Ipp report suggested amending the definition of recreational services to narrow the range of activities to which this bill applies. However, the definition suggested by the Ipp report is made in relation to another amendment in the Ipp report, which is more significant than what is contemplated in the bill, and appear to be made just for consistency. The definition adopted in the bill is the same as that used in the South Australian and Victorian legislation.</para><para>The opposition moved an amendment in the Senate so that the bill operates in a manner similar to the Victorian legislation. The intention of the amendment was to allow the originally stated objectives of the bill to be met. The amendment would introduce some balance by also at least retaining liability in cases where an act was done or an omission was made with reckless disregard. This will create some incentive for businesses to provide safe services. Prescribing the terms of waivers may also limit litigation and remove the worst kinds of waivers. The requirement for each waiver to be signed will not, however, be supported by everyone. For example, the Australian Amusement, Leisure and Recreation Association have indicated that it is inappropriate that waivers should have to be signed for large-scale recreation parks, such as people attending theme parks and agricultural shows.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe question is that the amendments be disagreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Mr SLIPPER (FisherâParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (1.24 a.m.)â I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendments.

With the federal budget in deficit last financial year, we know that after 11 years of almost continuous economic growth, all that additional revenue is being spent. That makes Peter Costello not just a big taxer but also a big spender. It is an odd achievement from someone who aspires to be a conservative Prime Minister.</para></talk.start></continue><para>After seven budgets, the pattern is clear: the Liberal government's response to every bump in the political or economic road is to loosen fiscal policy. It happens on a small scale and it happens on a large scale. At the moment, the Senate is dealing with the Inspector-General of Taxation legislation which has a $2 million bill attached to it, that is simply $2 million to validate a press release that was put out during the election campaign. It happens on a large scale. Last month, the Treasurer revealed that the first home owner scheme has cost the Commonwealth $2.9 billion since July 2000. This government has been a net spender for almost the entire period that it has been in office. In 1996, it is true that it made cuts to the budget. In fact, the cuts that it announced to the budget saved more than $21 billion over four years. After the 1997 budget, when the Treasurer declared victory over the budget deficit, the government immediately began to spend, slightly at first. In that year, the net loosening of all fiscal policy decisions, revenue and expenditure was $296 million. The next year was of course an election year and we saw a net loosening over the budget year and for the next three out years of more than $20 billion. The year 1999 was not an election year but the year after one, when you would have expected the government to be tightening its belt. But no, we saw $11.7 billion of net fiscal loosening over the budget year and the three out years. In 2000, again we saw another net loosening of $7.3 billion over that period. The year 2001, of course, was an election year and one which the government started in a state of absolute political desperation. We saw a net loosening over the budget year and the three out years of $23.9 billion. This year, again, was not an election year, but one when you would have thought that a government that had spent a cool almost $24 billion the year before might have tightened its belt.

This has serious implications for the future and will put a lead weight on future reform. Major reforms such as those outlined by the Board of Taxation in their report on the options to improve Australia's international tax competitiveness and the IMF's call to reduce Australia's high marginal tax rates have serious revenue implications. Had Peter Costello exercised some real fiscal restraint over the last seven years instead of spending an increase in tax of around two per cent of GDP, he would have more room to move on the big issues that influence Australia's economic performance.</para><para>Prime Minister Howard has recently suggested that his government will hand back to taxpayers some of the budget surplus in the form of tax cuts. In fact, when he did this, he said, `I am just stating the principle that, if you have a bit left over, the automatic assumption should not be âOh, whacko, we will spend it.â' Unfortunately the Prime Minister already has. The value of the GST income tax cuts of 1 July 2000 have been seriously eroded. The government no longer has the capacity to restore them without either breaking one of its key pledgesâto keep the budget in surplusâor making hard decisions to find extra money somewhere else.

Even if Telstra were sold, nobody will accept as credible an argument that paying for tax cuts out of the proceeds of asset sales is sustainable. This dismal picture is derived using the forward estimates from Treasurer Costello's latest Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and the estimates of fiscal drag contained in Access Economics's highly credible <inline font-style="italic">Budget Monitor</inline>. Access Economics's fiscal drag estimates show $2.3 billion this financial year, $3.5 billion next financial year, rising to $5 billion in 2004-05 and $6.2 billion in 2005-06. That is a lot of extra money being hauled out of taxpayers' pockets every year. It is $17 billion being hauled out of taxpayers' pockets this financial year and over the next four years in bracket creep. It explains why family budgets are under so much pressure.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the financial year in which the last tax cut was deliveredâ1 July 2000âthe top marginal tax rate cut in at a threshold equal to 142 per cent of average ordinary time earnings or about $42,000. The top marginal rate of 47 cents in the dollar now cuts in at 129 per cent of average earnings or a little over $46,000. Based on the official forecasts for wage growth, by 2005-06 it will cut in at 115 per cent of average earnings which by then will have grown to almost $52,000.</para><para>Australians on lower incomes are suffering similar tax increases as a result of the lower tax thresholds and rates not being adjusted. By 2005-06, all taxpayers will be well and truly sick of being soaked by a financially lazy government that increases its spending every year and pays for it with bracket creep. Obviously there will be many new financial pressures, as there already have been in the short time since the mid-year review of the budgetâsome hundreds of millions of dollars.</para><para>After more than 11 years of almost continuous economic growth and five years after Treasurer Costello claimed victory over the budget deficit, it is valid to ask why future budget surpluses depend on continuous tax increases provided by bracket creep. The answer is simple: for the five years since 1997, the Howard government's response to every bump in the political and economic road has been to loosen the budget. Governments cannot take that approach indefinitely before taxpayers find they are paying a high price. With an uncertain international economic outlook, having a surplus that is dependent on future bracket creep leaves the budget in a very tenuous position. If the Treasurer's optimistic economic growth forecasts are not realised over the next couple of years, the budget will become even tighter and the capacity to provide tax relief will diminish even further.</para><para>The Treasurer was very disingenuous in this place two days ago. He went on the defensive, using a dorothy dixer during the early part of question time, and attacked the arguments that I have just put in this place and that had been published that day in my article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. The Treasurer had three main points of attack. The first one was that he disputed my use of the $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion headline cash balance figures for 2004-05 and 2005-06, choosing not to recognise that those figures were net of fiscal drag. If you add Access Economics's fiscal drag figures for those two years of $5 billion and $6.2 billion respectively, you get exactly what the MYEFO forward estimate headline cash surpluses areâ$14.5 billion in 2004-05 and $15.9 billion in 2005-06. This is not difficult arithmetic: it is simple addition.</para><para>The Treasurer's second complaint was that I had criticised the fall from 142 per cent to 129 per cent in the proportion of average earnings at which the top marginal threshold cuts in. The Treasurer said that it would not be so low had I not imposed a higher top marginal tax threshold. His suggestion that I personally had stopped the top marginal tax rate from being higher is flattering but untrue. The actual tax thresholds in the final ANTS package were the products of a deal between the coalition and the Australian Democrats, in which the Labor Party had no part. The Treasurer's attempt to paint Labor as the party which stopped the changes to the top marginal tax rate are as inaccurate as they are unbelievable. The Howard government made a deal with the Democrats; if the Treasurer in hindsight now sees that as being a mistake, he should take it up with his own party. It has nothing to do with the Labor Party.</para><para>I, with the rest of the Labor Party, opposed the government's entire ANTS package, which included an unfair redistribution of income tax and a regressive GST. He did not dispute that the top marginal tax threshold has fallen relative to average earnings, an admission by him that there has been significant bracket creep. The Treasurer's final defence was to suggest that I was advocating indexation of his tax scales. That is a total fabrication by the Treasurer. I do not support indexation of the tax scales, because that would institutionalise the Treasurer's own unfair tax scales.

This bill is one of a number of taxation bills that have been debated in this House during the year. I have a specific interest in some of the provisions of this bill and, therefore, I am keen to speak briefly on them.</para></talk.start><para>This bill deals with three specific areas. The first is concerns about specific exemptions to interest withholding tax. These measures are designed to reduce compliance costs for business. The second issue is the one that I have the most interest in. This deals with capital gains tax exemptions for certain compensation payments. The specific payments deal with compensation for former slaves, forced labourers and certain other victims of the Nazi period in Germany. The final issue covered by this bill is changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 that deal with the products of friendly societies.</para><para>Compensation for the victims of the Nazi regime is extremely important. I do not need to go into the atrocities committed by the Nazis during their rule of Germany and their conduct during the war. The German Forced Labour Compensation Program was set up under German law to provide compensation to victims. The scheme provides for two types of payments: for personal wrong or injury, including slave or forced labour, and for property damage or loss where relief under other funds is not available. These funds can also be made to relatives of the victim or to the victim's heir. Currently, if such a payment is made to a victim's heir who is not a relative, the payment attracts capital gains tax under section 118-37 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This amendment bill extends the current capital gains tax exemption to the victim's heir who is not a relative, in the case of personal wrong or injury payments, and to the former property owner's relative heir in the case of property damage or loss payments. </para><para>The changes are welcome. The people and their families who had their lives destroyed by the Nazis have suffered greatly and thoroughly deserve any compensation they receive. My electorate of Stirling has quite a large Jewish community who still feel the effects of the heinous acts committed against them by the Nazis. Each year since my election in 1998, the Jewish Community Council of WA Inc. has invited me to its annual Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony. Each year I have been honoured by this invitation. This year the ceremony was held at the Jewish Centre in Yokine. The ceremony is always extremely moving and is a fitting tribute to the millions of innocent people who lost their lives. We must never forget that human rights must always remain central to our democracy. I was moved by a quote on the back of this year's program. It said:</para><quote><para>Judaism has 613 commandments; after Auschwitz we have a new oneâa prohibitionâwe are forbidden to give Hitler posthumous victories. This commandment applies not only to Jews, but to all humanity.</para></quote><para>This bill also recognises other communities that were persecuted by the Nazis. There were people from Eastern Europe and even Italy who were sent to Germany during the war and forced to work to keep the Nazi war machine running. They also deserve this recognition of their suffering.</para><para>I would also like to briefly examine an issue that has been ruining the lives of many of my constituents over the past three yearsâthe government and the ATO's handling of the mass marketed tax effective investment issue. The government today is making some very worthwhile changes to tax legislation. However, its administration of taxation leaves a lot to be desired. We are currently seeing in this House and the other place questions raised about the minister responsible for tax administration's credibility on tax avoidance. This raises serious issues about the right of this minister to administer our tax system. If the minister is found to have engaged in tax avoidance then the Prime Minister should sack her from the ministry and apologise to the tens of thousands of Australians who have been accused of tax avoidance by the ATO in the mass marketed tax effective investment debate. </para><para>I am not going to comment on the individual schemes, as I am not a qualified taxation lawyer. We have a process for dealing with any disputes about taxation rulings, and this is ultimately through the judicial system. All the parties concerned will no doubt respect the decision of the court. However, there is a process prior to the cases being heard in court, and I am concerned that this process was subverted.</para><para>I want to raise some serious questions about this government's handling of this whole issue. I do not want to engage in petty political point scoring when I have previously been speaking in this debate about victims of the Holocaustâthe victims of that tragedy deserve more than that. However, I wish to make some considered comments about an issue that has cost Australian lives through suicide and has also broken many Australian families. I am sure that the House is aware of the emotional impact that these ATO decisions have madeâconstituents who have been caught up in this saga have approached us all. I am not going to give a potted history of this issue as I would take up too much of the House's time. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> However, I would like to deal specifically with the conduct of the minister in terms of accountability and what I feel have been heavy-handed tactics by the ATO.</para><para>After being approached by constituents in 2000 and 2001 I asked some questions of the Treasurer in mid-2001 on specific issues with regard to the taxpayers charter and some questions on the procedures of the ATO with regard to their processes in issuing reassessments. On 28 June 2001 I asked questions 2773 and 2774. By the time parliament was prorogued I had not received answers to these questions. Earlier in the year I had asked a simple question about the operation of the ATO's taxpayers charter and whether that charter had any legislative force. This question was also not answered. If this had been an issue that was not topical, I might have been a little more accepting that the minister had not answered my questions. However, this issue was hot, dominating both the Prime Minister's and the Treasurer's visits to Western Australia in the lead-up to the federal election in late 2001.</para><para>When the 40th Parliament came into existence, I again asked the same questions on 19 February 2002. They were numbered 154, 155 and 156. To date, these questions have not been answered. I have used the processes available to me and have asked the Speaker to write to the Treasurer on a number of occasions, but still have not received any answers. I am curious about why the Treasurer has not answered my questions. What we have here is an accountability issue. Does the Treasurer not want to answer my questions because of the answers he will provide? </para><para>I also asked a question on the composition and operation of the Part IVA Panel at the ATO, and I thank the Treasurer for his answer. This question was also relatively simple. It was an attempt to find out who was on the panel and when it met. The answer, which I received on 11 November, caused me further concerns which centred on accountability. My major concerns were with the informal nature of the panel, the fact that the community representatives were also on the ATO consultancy payroll and that the composition of the panel varied between meetings. This would be considered in many fields as a conflict of interest. In an interview with Jim Hanna from AAP, I was quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>How objective are they if their consultants, drawn from the ATO's register, are being paid by the ATO? A community representative is somebody who is an accountant with a peak body or someone who represents a community body.</para></quote><para>As the Part IVA Panel was used by the ATO to endorse its decisions on these reassessments, I was concerned that it be accountable and transparent. The panel is neither, yet its decisions have been used by the ATO in arguments put to taxpayers about the decisions made against them. </para><para>I asked another question about the deal offered by the ATO on these schemes. This question dealt with what has been described as the `mail merge mentality' of the ATO in relation to investors. I had numerous calls from constituents who had received the ATO's publicised offer. I asked question No. 363 earlier this year to get information for constituents prior to the closing date of the offer, which, I must add, was extended slightly. My concern was that all investors received an identical letter, with their name, address and the name of their investment as the only differences. This makes a mockery of the taxpayers charter, which states that all taxpayers must be treated individually. </para><para>What also concerned me was that people were being told to accept the offer before a deadline or penalties would apply, yet they were not told exactly how much the offer would cost them. In effect, they were signing up to something without knowing what they were signing and how much it would cost. As well, they were signing their legal rights away. If you applied this scenario to consumer protection in any other industry, mechanisms to protect the consumer would immediately come in. I have never heard of people signing a settlement without knowing what the settlement will be. It was almost as if they were being coerced into signing before the proper processes occurred that exist under law for the settlement of these issues. I received an answer from the Treasurer three months after the offer had closed. So much for accountability.</para><para>Without entering into the merits of a test case, which is a completely different issue, I am appalled at the lack of natural justice for these people. They deserve their day in court. If a court finds that they have avoided tax, they should be penalised. However, if a court finds that they have not avoided tax then they have suffered a real injustice. The right to take your issue to court is a fundamental part of our democracy, as is the accountability of the executive. I will conclude my contribution to this debate by saying that this country needs a proper and independent umpire on taxation issues. The measures introduced by this government to create an inspector for taxation do not do this. In reality, the role mirrors that of the Taxation Ombudsman, meaning that it cannot enforce. Let us not undo good legislation by failing on the issue of tax administration. Some real reforms need to be debated in this place and put into action. It is the responsibility of the government to provide the impetus for this.</para><para>Although this issue affected many of my constituents, the majority of them live in seats occupied by members opposite. The member for Curtin and the member for Kalgoorlie have in their electorates the largest number of people affected by this issue in Western Australia, yet neither of them has used the House to address or even acknowledge this issue which is hurting so many of their constituents. It is time that those members opposite had the courage to speak up for the people they represent rather than contributing to the silence in this place that pervades from the government benches.</para><para>Our tax system is not oppressive; however, our administration of the laws passed by this parliament on taxation matters are hurting people. If they are wrong then they should pay the penalty; however, we must remember that the foundations of our legal system are based on the adage `innocent until proven guilty'. Let us not let our people feel that they are guilty until they have had their day in court. The sooner the government amend the act to make the ATO process clear, open and accountable, the sooner people's faith in the ATO and its system will be restored or strengthened. I call on the government to take this action as a matter of urgency. I also call on the government to support Labor's amendment to this act. I would like to read the amendment into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. It says:</para><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>âwhilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</para><para>(1)	imposing the largest tax burden of any Government in Australia's history;</para><para>(2)	imposing the highest personal income tax burden on Australians;</para><para>(3)	imposing the highest total income tax burden on Australians; </para><para>(4)	planning to hit Australians with an extra $17 billion in bracket creep over the forward estimates years; and</para><para>(5)	relying on bracket creep to keep the budget in surplus.â</para><para>I call on the government to seriously consider how they are handling their tax system and the burden they are placing on ordinary Australian families.

I note that no-one from the government has spoken on this bill. I know that the hour is late and the end of the year is actually here, but, if you look at the speaking list, the only reason why this House has not closed down is that people in the opposition are still speaking. It is within our power not to do that. Then nothing would be coming back from the Senate and we would not be proceeding. However, we recognise that we have a duty to the parliament, however pressed we are.</para></talk.start><para>Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2002 has three elements. I will deal with two of them in passing and one more substantially, and then I will deal with the amendment put by the shadow assistant treasurer. First, very much in passing, is the question of interest withholding tax exemptions. Essentially, they have been directed towards the attempt pursued, in particular, by the member for North Sydney, at least in rhetoricâwe are yet to see how much action there will be. It has been a bold attempt, even whilst we were in government, to set up, in conjunction with the state Labor government, Sydney as one of the key financial capitals of the Asia-Pacific. This bill argues that the changes made here in terms of interest tax exemptions deal with bonds and certain other tax concessions, which are given both overseas and in Australia, essentially on the same basis. The argument is that that will provide a stronger basis for investment within Australia, encourage more overseas investment and provide an incentive for people to draw closer to Australia and make Sydney, and indeed Australia, a stronger financial centre. The actual matters in relation to associates and prohibitionsâwhat they can and cannot do, deemed interest payments and all the restâI will leave to the aficionados.</para><para>I note that chapter 3 of the bill deals with friendly society investment products. We know that friendly societies have always been dealt with in ways that are different from a lot of other entities. That is because of their very nature: they were groups that came together to assist each other mutually. There are a number of plans in relation to students, funerals and so on. A series of changes was made whilst we were in government. The context that is provided for this series is that these changes will be put in place in order to harmonise that with a number of other measures that have already been taken. The member of the opposition who preceded me, the member for Stirling, dealt with that at some length.</para><para>The key point of the bill is schedule 2, regarding the capital gains exemption for certain compensation payments. This is a very important measure and it is timely given that the German government has taken action with regard to a compensation program for German forced labour. The genesis of that program is a foundation, set up on 12 August 2000, which has about seven subsets regionally within the German federation. The foundation was set up to provide compensation to former slave and forced labourers and certain other victims of injustices suffered during the National Socialist period. This measure is an extension, and a very belated one, of a series of other measures that were put into place much earlier. German governments in the past have certainly found it difficult to come to terms with their history.</para><para>I had a direct and particular association with victims of National Socialist policy as an electorate officer for the former member for Blaxland when he was Treasurer. Two people who came to see me had been in concentration camps. Both of them had suffered enormously before and during the war. Not only had they been forced labourers but because they were Jewish they had been placed along with many others in concentration camps. In fact, we know that six million people of Jewish descent were killed in the concentration camps throughout Germany and in occupied Europe during the war. We know that those who did not suffer annihilation suffered deprivation, starvation, torture, mental and physical cruelty, and the other abominations that were visited upon them in the death campsâthe medical practices and experimentations. A vast panoply of evil was visited not only on those two people but on the six million who are remembered. Another 5Â½ million or so peopleâgipsies, disabled people, people who were different because of their sexual orientation because homosexuals were marked by the Nazis to be treated in a special way, and people who suffered from dwarfismâwere brought into the general description of effectively being non-Aryan and, therefore, were up for dissolution or annihilation. People who survived the death camps need to be dealt with in a particularly civil way and in a way which recognises what they have been through. </para><para>You can never put it past bureaucratsâas hard as they try to do their work in a way that is sensitiveânot to get bound up in the existing law. At the time those people came to see me, although we recognised that those payments were compensation payments to former victims of concentration campsâand I think they were free of taxâthe problem was that they were not free from being taken into account for the purposes of assessing income for social security payments. These people were of pensionable age and, because a good part of their lives had been spent living and working in Australia as post war migrants, when they got the compensation payments from overseas their pensions were affected.</para><para>Decades after these people suffered under National Socialism's brutalities, finally the German government stepped up to the mark and said, `Our forebears were responsible and we are sorry for what our forebears delivered to the Jewish people and to others.' I note in passing that that has not happened in this House with this Prime Minister in relation to the depredations of our forebears to the original inhabitants here, but the German government has done it in relation to Nazism. They finally were able to look at their past and to look it in the face. They have struggled to do that because what happened was so terrible and went to the core of what their society was about. I believe that the Japanese have still not faced up to what they did to China as a fascist militarist state prior to the Second World War, through to what happened during the war.</para><para>Those people who suffered most waited decades. I think it took me more than two years to get it through our parliamentary processes while we were in government and to get our departmental officials to recognise the inhumanity of not taking that income into account. It was not normal income; it was compensation for being incarcerated in a concentration camp in either Germany, Poland or the Ukraine. Good social policy and good public policy must necessarily take that into account. More than a decade on, in August 2000, the German government finally took the other action they needed to. They said that compensation should be given not only to those people whose relatives were obliterated, to the tune of six million of Jewish descent, but also to those people from all over occupied Europe who were drawn into Germany's factories to serve the war effort as slave labour, including children aged 14 who had their lives permanently damaged by it. They finally got recognition.</para><para>So the changes I helped to put through, when I was working for the former Treasurer, were in regard to not only those who had been in concentration camps but also those who had served as forced labour. We tried to open it up so that they could have payments made to them. In this case, we are taking the further step of saying that, if there is a capital gains tax element for either the victims or their direct relatives, it is right and proper to take that into account. This not only encompasses those people but deals with property loss as a result of racial persecution. We know that millions of dollars were ripped away from people not because they committed any crime but because, in the eye of the fuehrer and his Reich, they were non-Aryanâthat is, they were not of what the fuehrer and his Reich considered to be the pure race. They were people defined as polluting the Aryan race. </para><para>Simply by being defined in a certain way, those people designated as being Aryan in National Socialist Germany had the right to loot the possessions of the people they destroyed in the concentration camps. It also gave those designated as Aryan the right to walk into every house, every abode and every factory of every family whose lives had been put to the test and take all that those people had built up through their work for the whole of their lives. We know, finally, more than 50 years on, that the Swiss government has been brought to task for its culpability during the war, which came to light a couple of years ago. It was a neutral country but it actually took the life savings of those people who had been robbed and deposited them in the accounts of Swiss banks and others. Finally, the Swiss government has been forced to pay some compensation.</para><para>This government is doing the right thing in taking these measures with regard to capital gains tax exemptions. It was right for the Labor Party, when it was in government, to take measures with regard to people's income as compensation and to say, `It's only right. It's only just. It's only proper. It's only the most minor of concessions to take account of what dreadful depredations were suffered not only by those who died but by those who survived and by those who were their progeny. It is important for those people to be recognised.' <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>Having dealt with the weighty matters, I will go to our amendment and the government's depredations on the Australian public at large. The government are at fault because, despite arguments to the contrary, we know thatâeven though the Prime Minister has said they may actually advance tax cuts in the futureâthere is a tax bracket creep of $17 billion which this government want to divert to their own uses rather than putting it back into the pockets of the people into whose pockets it should be put back.</para><para>Indeed, we see one-third of an article given over to this in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. This is not a case of reading a paper; it is utilising it, as I have seen the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and virtually every member of that frontbench do. It is not just something you do for a lark or as recreation; this is about dealing with it in the speech. In Matt Wade's article, `Tax cuts in doubt as billion-dollar prop for budget is exposed', he makes the point that, with the amount of bracket creep that the government is not willing to give back, what we are looking at is not a budget surplusâas we knowâbut a budget deficit. Why are we looking at that? Because, starting from the position of running absolutely scared in February and March of last year, a minimum of $14 billion was wasted by this government last year to get themselves re-elected. Every one of the groups that they saw, they thought they needed to buy offâthe superannuees, those who are otherwise retired, the pensioner groups. There was $14 billion of fiscal profligacy from March through to the end of the year. In fact, some could argue that it is not $14 billion, but $20 billion.</para><para>The Treasurer and the Prime Minister want to say, `This government has been perpetually in surplus.' Whilst we were in government, we were in surplus for four years, and they were the first four years of budget surplus in the entire history of the Commonwealth. Despite the fact that the coalition ruled for most of the time since Federation, it was Labor that first brought in surpluses. Drawing on what Labor achieved through the 1980s and 1990s in restructuring this economy and providing that firm foundation, there should have continued to be surpluses. There should have been a real surplus; the Treasurer should not have had to flip over on whether this was a cash or an accrual budget.</para><para>Last year, we were dealing with accrual accounting. This year, the budget is on a cash basis because the accrual basis format simply says the budget is in deficit. That is why the Treasurer changedâaway from headline countingâto another form of accounting. The reality is very simple and this government cannot move away from it. They want to take back most of the bracket creep; they want to cover their hides for the profligacy of $14 billion to $20 billion spent on buying the last election. They want to try to keep the budget notionally in surplus rather than accept the reality of the deficit not only on an accrual basis but also on a cash basis. The second reading amendment moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer has my total support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>10458</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R1621">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2002</inline>. The bill seeks to make a number of minor changes to the Australian taxation law. I want to focus particularly on the section that will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 which provides a capital gains tax exemption for payments received by Australian taxpayers under the German Forced Labour Compensation Program. This program provides two types of payments: firstly, for personal wrong or injury, including slavery or forced labour; and, secondly, for property damage or loss where relief under other funds is not available. The payments are made to the victim, to a relative of the victim or to the victim's heir.</para></talk.start><para>Currently, the German Forced Labour Compensation Program payments are not subject to income tax. However, they are subject to capital gains tax in certain circumstances. The amendment extends the current capital gains tax exemption to all payments received by Australian residents under the German Forced Labour Compensation Program. There are approximately 4,000 Australians who have claimed payments under this program, and there are probably many more who are entitled to do so but have notâand that is a subject I will return to in a few minutes. Many other countries have offered similar exemptions. The United States Congress passed legislation in May 2001 exempting survivors of the Nazi Final Solution and their heirs from federal taxes on compensation or restitution payments received after 1 January 2000. Such payments are also exempt from tax in Canada, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.</para><para>We have all heard that there are two certainties in life: death and taxes. There are other certainties that arise out of the taxes part of thatâthat is, tax avoidance, tax evasion and tax minimisation, sometimes called aggressive tax planning. Whatever it is called, it is aimed at reducing individuals' liability to taxation. The German Forced Labour Compensation Program payments are currently not subject to ordinary income tax, as they are not income according to ordinary concepts. The program is part of the German economic foundation called Remembrance, Responsibility and the Future, which will provide payments to people who performed slave labour during World War II. The German government and German industry are each providing half of the funds for the foundation.</para><para>Around $US5 billion has been contributed to the program to compensate those people who were compelled to work in concentration camps, ghettos or other places of incarceration or other people who were forced to work anywhere in Europe under German occupation under conditions resembling imprisonment or extremely harsh living conditions or perform work under a work program in the Nazi `extermination through work' policy. This was a policy where people were given starvation rations, if rations at all, and were literally worked to death, but some people managed to survive this process because it was stopped by the ending of the war. Each person will receive up to $A12,000. Of course, no amount of money can adequately compensate a person for the horrors they have suffered at the hands of the Hitler regime. However, those reparations by the German government and industry are to be welcomed. I would say they are part of the German government's general remembrance of a part of their history and their atonement for the things that happened. This is an interesting contrast with atonement by the Austrian and the Japanese governments for events during the Second World War, which certainly has not reached anywhere near the degree of importance that it has in Germany.</para><para>However, the last thing the government should do with this kind of program and with these types of payments is to tax people at their top marginal rate. I have mentioned that there are many people who do not claim these payments. I can think of a close family friend who is now in his late seventies and is very fit and very active in business. As a young 16-year-old he was taken from Hungary to work with thousands of other slave labourers in a copper mine in Yugoslavia. His story of the work that he did and his liberation, like all of these stories, makes an ordinary Australian who has not experienced these terrors feel in awe of people who could go through such things and lead productive lives afterwards. Of course, many of these people reject these payments as `blood money' that can never compensate for what happened to them or their families. </para><para>These payments are currently subject to capital gains tax because of the broad definitions in the capital gains tax provisions. That tax was introduced by the Hawke-Keating governments over the howls of the coalition, particularly of the current Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition. I might add that it was introduced to eliminate the greatest form of tax evasion available at the time. At this point it is worth noting that it is the current opposition that consistently has improved the tax system. The Australian Labor Party introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. It was the Australian Labor Party that has attempted and will continue to attempt to simplify the goods and services tax and the business activity statement. Meanwhile, those on the other side of the chamber, who claim to be friends of small business and who, one would have thought, would therefore be responsible for reducing taxes on business, are in fact dumping the tax burden onto middle Australia. The government are the highest taxing government in the nation's history, yet their mates are still getting away with some tax rorts.</para><para>The tax system has always made a distinction between income and capital. The distinguished jurist and former chief justice Sir Owen Dixon described capital as a tree and income as the fruit which grew from the tree. Prior to the capital gains tax, only the fruit was taxed while the tree could grow and grow but was not taxed. This led to tax evasion as taxpayers converted taxable income into tax-free capital gains. Capital gains, no less than income, wages, interest, dividends and business profits, increase an individual's economic status and purchasing power. Given the fundamental tenet of our income tax system that tax should be based on the capacity to pay, capital gains should be taxed. The old system was quite unfair and inequitable as it meant that two people who earned the same amount, with the same purchasing power, would be taxed completely differently depending on whether their money was income or a capital gain. As the tax system was distorted the tax liability was more and more skewed towards middle Australia as the wealthy got away scot free on capital gains.</para><para>This, in turn, led to a reduction in compliance as middle Australia found the tax system more and more unfair. Over the years, this parliament has introduced a number of exemptions to the capital gains tax provisions. One of the most notable is the exclusion of compensation payments for personal injury and death. This exclusion, in fact, was a major reform and improvement for the insurance industry. Prior to this, compensation payments had to be artificially increased to take account of the significant amount of compensation payments that was taken by the Commonwealth in capital gains tax. This exclusion allowed for a significant reduction in the quantum of compensation payments. These German forced labour compensation program payments are another form of compensation payment, and therefore should not be subject to capital gains tax. They should not be subject to capital gains tax because capital gains tax was never meant to capture these types of payments and because it does not undermine any of the basic principles of the taxation system of fairness, simplicity and equality.</para><para>I particularly take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the previous speaker, the member for Blaxland, in arranging changes to the system that enabled the issue of these kinds of payments from individuals to be addressed. Just before I finish, I may ask the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, and her representative in this place, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Mr Anthony, if these payments will also be excluded from consideration in Centrelink payments. These payments are exempted from social security considerations in most other countries. Other similar restitution payments for people who survived the Nazi extermination are exempted from social security considerations, including French payments to orphans of persons who died during the deportation as part of the persecutions during the German occupation of France during World War II and payments from the Dutch fund for needy survivors of the Nazi Final Solution, which are paid through the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. Also, periodic German restitution payments are exempted from the calculation of Australian pensions. I hope these payments will also be exempted. Otherwise, we are giving with one hand and taking away with another. I join members opposite in supporting this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>10460</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt will not come as any surprise to the opposition that the government does not accept the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Kingston.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>âYou don't like the amendment?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âI have something to say about the second reading amendment, my friend.

I greatly appreciate the fact that so many people have been prepared to come in and enjoy the facilities of the chamber at this time of the morning. As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by the quorum called by the member for Franklin, this bill does contain four very different measures all of which should be welcomed. The government does appreciate the support offered by the opposition with respect to this bill.</para><para>Australia has considerable potential to gain a greater share of international financial services business. Australia has a number of advantages, including a stable financial system, a highly skilled work force and a time zone advantage over many other regional markets. In addition, tax reform has made Australia more internationally competitive. However, intense competition for regional financial services centre business means that Australia needs to pursue more actively its role as a centre for financial services. The changes will assist by removing disincentives in the interest withholding tax to the issuing of certain types of debt. There is a perceived risk that issues of debentures might accidentally breach the restrictions on the issuing of debentures to associates and thereby lose the exemption. This bill will remove a possible impediment to Australian companies issuing debentures in Australia and thereby help to further integrate the domestic and offshore corporate debt markets.</para><para>The second change will remove an anomaly that has hindered Australian companies raising finance offshore through issues of qualifying securities. The government has also decided to exempt from interest withholding tax interest on nostro or clearing accounts held by financial institutions with foreign banks. The compliance costs are disproportionately high for the small amount of tax collected and removing the tax will make it easier for Australian financial institutions to act as intermediaries between nonresidents. Care has been taken to ensure that the exemption will not be abused. Taken together, these changes should enhance Australia's development as a centre for financial services. </para><para>Secondly, the bill contains measures to give effect to the new tax treatment for funeral policies, income bonds and scholarship plans offered by friendly societies as announced in the budget. These measures are essential to complete the process by which the tax treatment of friendly societies has been modernised in the wake of business tax reform.</para><para>The third measure changes the timing of the end of the special transitional provision in the GST law for providers of compulsory third party insurance. At the request of the states and territories, compulsory third party insurers were allowed until 1 July next year to get their systems ready for the GST. The current transitional period rules only cease to apply if a policy is paid for on or after 1 July 2003. This has disadvantages because it applies unevenly. An application provision based on the date the policy commenced will have a more consistent application and be easier for third party insurers to administer because their record-keeping systems always show a date a policy commenced but do not always record when it was paid for. State and territory insurers support this move. </para><para>The last measure in the bill gives effect to the commitment of the government to exempt payments from the German forced labour compensation program from capital gains tax. It removes any confusion about the tax treatment of those payments. Payments from the program to victims for both personal wrongs or injuries and property loss or damage are exempt from capital gains tax but payments to the victims' heirs could have been taxable without this amendment.</para><para>I wanted to comment substantively on the points contained in the bill in the event that a succession of quorums was called as I was delivering the government's response to this debate. I did promise the honourable member for Kingston that I would address his second reading amendment and indicate to him why the government is not prepared to accept it. A lot of misleading information has been disseminated recently about the government's tax take as a share of GDP. Unfortunately, most of it has been just plain wrongâand I suspect those opposite are well aware of that fact.</para><para>The total income tax paid by Australians as a share of GDP is lower now than it was six years ago during the government's first year in office. This is despite the fact that more than one million new jobs have been created since this government was elected in March 1996. In the year 2000, this government introduced the largest cuts in personal income tax in Australian history, cutting it by $12,000 millionâthat is, $12 billion. To put that in context: if all this government had done when it came to office was to index tax brackets by the consumer price index, people would be paying more tax than they are today, because the income tax cuts introduced by this government were greater than all of the so-called bracket creep from 1996 to 2002. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>I think it is unfortunate and fairly puerile that the opposition is doing this at this time of the night. You would not know that Christmas is just down the road. The member for Prospect ought to appreciate that it is not really in order to constantly call quorums just for the sake of disrupting the business of the House. Although it is within the standing orders, it is not appropriate that she should exercise those standing orders at this time of the morning. I suspect that it is something to do with the fact that there is an opposition Christmas party on, and those opposite do not want the parliament to be sitting.</para><para>I will continue with what I was saying before I was interrupted by the call for a quorum. As the Treasurer told the House the day before yesterday, Australians are actually paying $500 less than if there had been full indexation over the whole course of this government. Then we have the complaint that the level at which the top marginal rate cuts in is too low. I inform the House that the reason why it cuts in at that level is that the Labor Party opposed our increase. The government bill was to push out the top marginal tax threshold to $75,000 and the Labor Party opposed it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âYou ought not interject, my friend, because you were one of those who voted against what the government proposed. The Labor Party opposed not only the government's plan to lift the level at which the top marginal rate applies but also this government's income tax cuts generally. As the Treasurer also reminded us, the member for Hotham went so far as to refer to the fiscal profligacy of the government's planned personal tax cuts. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to general taxation receipts, Commonwealth general government sector cash taxation receipts as a proportion of GDP have declined from 23 per cent in 1995-96 to an estimated 20.9 per cent of GDP in 2002-03. In 2002-03 and the forward years, the estimate is that Commonwealth tax share as a proportion of GDP will remain below the levels of the past seven years. I know that Labor says the GST is a state tax but, under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, all GST revenue is paid directly to the states and territories. GST revenue is not available for expenditure by the Commonwealth. This provides the states with a stable and growing source of revenue to fund important community services such as roads, schools, hospitals and police and allows the states to progressively abolish a range of narrow and growth-reducing taxes.  </para><para>The Australian National Audit Office has taken a technical view that the GST is a Commonwealth tax, as it is imposed under the Commonwealth legislation, and quantified the consolidated financial statements for 2000-01 on this basis. The Commonwealth discloses this difference of opinion in the budget papers as required by the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998. If the GST is to be added to the Commonwealth tax revenue, then the state taxes it replaces should be subtracted in calculating the overall tax share. In addition, if we are making comparisons over time, you have to compare apples with apples. Should we not factor in the wholesale sales tax and programs such as family tax benefits? This side of the House quite emphatically does not apologise for rejecting the second reading amendment.</para><para>In the minutes remaining to me I will comment briefly on a number of other points raised by members of the opposition in this debate. The member for Kingston, the shadow minister at the table, referred to the interest withholding tax amendment and claimed that the government acquiesced to the lobbying of the big end of town. The government did listen to businesses that would be affected by this bill. We are a consultative governmentâwe talk widely and we listen. On further advice the government agreed to provide the interest withholding tax exemption for nostro accounts to all financial institutions that, it was informed, operated these accounts. That probably pre-empts the question that the shadow minister may well ask in the debate on government amendments a little later. The bill and the amendment will reduce costs of borrowing for financial institutions. </para><para>The member for Kingston also claimed that the bill will deny input tax credits for policies that commence before 1 July 2003. Policies commencing before 1 July 2003 do not attract input tax credits under the current legislation if the premium is paid prior to that date. The implication of this bill is that policies which commence on or after 1 July 2003 will attract a credit for eligible businesses, irrespective of whether the payment is made prior to that date.</para><para>The member for Stirling referred to the significant Jewish community in her electorate of Stirling. The member for Blaxland also referred to the Jewish community and some of the appalling things that happened to that community in the Second World War. The member for Stirling welcomed the capital gains tax exemption for compensation payments to victims of the National Socialist regime. She also recognised that the bill extends the exemption to other European citizens who were victims of injustices suffered during the National Socialist period. The government recognises the suffering experienced during the National Socialist period and welcomes the support by the member for Stirling for the government's amendment.</para><para>The member for Stirling also referred to mass marketed schemes. I just want to say two things in response to her. Firstly, as the Prime Minister has said repeatedly in this place, there is not a shred of evidence to support allegations against the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Secondly, in relation to mass marketed schemes, the commissioner himself said that it would have been better if he had acted sooner. But, that said, the commissioner has gone a considerable way to address the balance with a settlement offer which clearly recognises the plight of the unsophisticated investor. Other cases are being pursued through the courts with a number of decisions clearly in favour of the commissioner. Tonight the government has been trying tonight to get passage of a bill to establish the position of inspector-general, a very useful avenue for scheme investors. Because of the quorums having been called, I do not have time to deal with other matters raised by honourable members.

The bill proposes to amend section 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 enabling the ACCC to bring representative actions in respect of breaches of section 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. Members will be well aware of the content of this bill. It is the same bill that Labor set aside on 19 August 2002. The Liberal government has an unflattering history of continually trying to slip into the Trade Practices Act powers that would enable the ACCC to become involved in what are really industrial relations matters. These are matters best heard and resolved through the industrial relations tribunal system. </para></talk.start><para>The only analytical evidence supporting this billâevidence that the government appears to be totally reliant uponâis a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission produced in May 1994. Those recommendations are not only eight years old but, importantly, referred to a completely different legal situation to that which exists today. More recently, in August 1999, the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector reported on widening the powers of the ACCC to undertake representative actions. However, that report made no reference to small businesses being disadvantaged as a result of secondary boycotts.</para><para>Labor holds firmly to the position that on matters other than industrial relations issues it supports the provision for the ACCC to conduct representative actions under the act. This is particularly in the circumstances where the costs of litigation and the associated legal complexity are beyond the ability of small business to seek legal redress. Therefore, Labor supports the ACCC undertaking representative action on behalf of small businesses for a breach of the Trade Practices Act under the areas where the ACCC currently has an enforcement power and which are properly matters of trade practices law.</para><para>However, Labor opposes this bill on the principle that secondary boycotts need to be considered and managed only as matters of industrial relations law. The simple consequences of operating industrial relations matters through the trade practices law would promote an aggressive and less conciliatory approach to the management of industrial disputation. Thus Labor opposes this bill. It does not serve small business well. What this bill really shows is that the Liberal government long ago ran out of good policy ideas on how to improve small business policy. Over the years, the Howard government has consistently and persistently ignored the issues and interests of small business. When it has taken action, it has unfairly added a relentless level of taxation compliance and a corresponding level of business red tape that has transformed one million small businesses into unpaid tax collectors and tax bookkeepers for the government. </para><para>The Institute of Chartered Accountants have expressed concerns about inconsistent or incorrect advice from the ATO, an avalanche of unnecessary paperwork and ridiculous compliance requirements under threat of penalties, duplication of demands due to lack of integration of ATO systems and hours wasted on hold on the ATO help line hoping for a response. This has consequences for small business: they are either paying higher fees to their accountants or are themselves facing the same difficulties. In addition, the Howard government has unleashed hundreds of tax auditors on small businesses to check their compliance with the complex GST. The budget included an extra $804.3 million for the ATO over the next four years to enhance GST administration. Of that, some $190 million has been allocated to small business GST field services to raise an additional $130 million in GST revenue each year. The tax office hopes to raise an additional $3 in revenue for each extra dollar spent on tax administration. That will be a lot of additional GST audits.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Yellow PagesÂ®</inline><inline font-style="italic">Business Indexâ Small and Medium Enterprises</inline> released last week shows that small businesses second most important criticism of the federal government was the GST and its associated paperwork. Labor, unlike the Liberal government, wants to assist small business, not hinder it. Labor has introduced into the House a private member's bill, the <inline ref="R1494">Taxation Laws Amendment (A Simpler Business Activity Statement) Bill 2002</inline>, which will enable a simpler method for small businesses to calculate their GST remittance. Under Labor's simpler BAS option, each registered business using the ratio method would be given a GST ratio based on its own trading circumstances. The GST liability would be calculated by multiplying business turnover by this ratio.</para><para>The simpler BAS option also provides a safe harbour from the potential costs arising from any tax audit. Currently, businesses being audited may have to justify every separate input tax credit claim and account for every separate taxable sale. That is what this self-proclaimed pro-small business government has done to small businessâit has driven it to its knees, accounting for every transaction. But under the ratio method, all small business has to do is show that all turnover has been disclosed. This is an example of a simple change which would benefit small business enormously.</para><para>Another Labor private member's bill introduced into the parliament will ensure that insurance companies pass on to small business the savings achieved as a result of changes to public liability insurance arrangements instead of using them to boost their own profits. The crisis in public liability insurance has impacted most severely on small business. Small businesses are struggling to obtain public liability insurance at affordable prices, but the Howard government has consistently failed to act to protect small business, despite its clear constitutional responsibility. Most recently, copies of a draft private member's bill aiming to crack down on late payment by big business and government to their small business suppliers was circulated for consultation. Late payment continues to be a severe problem for the cash flow of small businesses. A Yellow Pages survey found that small business considered cash flow to be their second top business concern. This was second only to lack of work or sales. But the Howard government has rejected Labor's call to support this bill, calling the issue of late payments esoteric.</para><para>Small business also has other issues that the Howard government is failing to address. Those issues include the availability of skilled staff, access to business skills training and tenancy laws. The government's priorities are clearly wrong. This is proven by the same Yellow Pages survey released last week that found small businesses biggest criticism of the Howard government's policies was that they were too concerned with big business. </para><para>The issues I have identified today are real issues facing small business. The Liberal government should be devoting resources to address these issues instead of playing wedge politics, as shown by this bill. The Howard government is planning to force more red tape on small business with its plan for so-called superannuation choice. Labor proposes to exempt small business from the choice regime to reduce an already overweight compliance burden. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>If the government really wanted to take some action on trade practices, it would join with Labor in supporting the reforms to introduce criminal sanctions for the most extreme abuses of market power. Instead, the Liberal government prefers to attack the ACCC and Professor Fels. The ACCC is there to ensure strong competition and to protect consumers and small business. It should be supported in performing this function, not attacked and undermined by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and other ministers.</para><para>Further, if the government were genuinely interested in helping small business, it would address the difficulties that small business encounters when dealing with big business. Instead, the <inline font-style="italic">Inside Canberra </inline>newsletter has reported that Mr Hockey told a meeting of the National Small Business Forum on 20 September 2002 that his department had agreed not to put in a submission to the Dawson inquiry at the urging of many small business groups.

This bill is about overcoming a problem of bullying within our society. It is about the abuse of power against the defenceless. In this particular case it is about overcoming the problem of secondary boycotts by collective labour against small businesses, which are often run by individuals or a small number of people who have no capacity to protect and defend themselves. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cox</name></talker><para>âName one!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name></talker><para>âIn my electorate of Flinders there are 6,000 fine small businesses. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> As I said, this bill is about overcoming the effects of pernicious acts of bullyingâbullying that is rife within our industrial relations system. It is rife because collective labour is abusing its position. The member for Kingston asked me a challenging question. He asked me to identify a secondary boycott within my electorate. Let me start with one of the more prominent ones in the last few months. We had a major strike at BHP Steel. BHP Steel was subject to actions by the ETU, the CFMEU and a number of other unions. A series of small businesses and small to medium enterprises within the electorate are in the supply and support area for BHP Steel, and almost all of them went close to the wall. If this bill had been in place and they had been able to receive support from the ACCC, they would have been in a much stronger position and they would have been protected. So go ahead: ask me more questions; I could not be more delighted, my friend.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Flinders will address his remarks through the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name></talker><para>âI was referring to the chair when I said, `My friend.'</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Flinders may continue.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name></talker><para>âIn continuation, this bill operates by providing the ACCC with the capacity to act as a protector and defender of small businesses which would otherwise not be capable of mustering the economic, legal or general administrative resources to take on a major national organisation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to deal with three things in addressing the bill: the background, its importance and the core provisions. In looking at the background, we find that small business accounts for 95 per cent of all business in Australia's economy and that those 95 per cent collectively employ approximately 50 per cent of Australia's labour force. But that 50 per cent is largely un-unionised and largely subject to the dictates of the collective national organisations if they subsequently become victims of secondary boycotts. Small businesses in particular suffer substantially from restrictive trade practices. The reason is that most are self-funded and rely on narrow profit margins: they cannot afford costly legal disputes and disruptions to trade. Unnecessary union disruptions have adverse effects on producers and consumers and lead to inefficient outcomes.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Swan</name></talker><para>âWhat about people, you dope?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name></talker><para>âI respect the fundamental right of people to give or to withhold their labour.

That is not the way we operate, that is not what we believe is acceptable and that is not something which we should be upholding or defending. The purpose of the bill, very simply, is to amend section 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 by allowing the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take representative action against the losses incurred by small businesses through secondary boycotts.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What is the importance of the bill? The bill achieves a number of objectives. It will ultimately provide increased protection to small businesses against disruptive and potentially harmful union action. It does this by allowing the ACCC to take representative actions against contraventions of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. Small businesses using this process can claim compensation for union disruptions aimed at causing significant lossesâso there is a notion of intention. Small businesses can also claim compensation against union agreements with workers which affect the supply of goods and services. What could be simpler and fairer than to say that a party which is not directly engaged in a dispute should be protected from the harmful consequences of that dispute? That is unless we say that there is a new principle afoot hereâthat what we allow is an intended victimisation of third parties to achieve a political end. Is that the sort of collateral damage which is encouraged? We have had experience of that in this country over the last yearâthe notion that collateral damage is not an acceptable approach and not a way to carry out actions. </para><para>Very simply, I believe that this is a bill of great importance. Essentially, its provisions are as follows. Item 1 of schedule 1 enables the ACCC to claim damages against union activities that contravene sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. This increases the power of the ACCC to support small businesses. Item 2 of schedule 1 outlines the appropriate procedures the ACCC must satisfy prior to any representative action. The effect of this change is to allow the ACCC to initiate proceedings against any breaches under the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>Ultimately, this bill is about three things: supporting the small business sector; increasing the competitiveness and resilience of the small business sector; and, above all else, placing a stake in the ground and saying that there are certain fundamental principles about bullying which cannot stand. You cannot allow a position where a large national organisation intentionally takes action in order to achieve a particular end, whereby it will claim collateral damage and a victim along the way. If that is not their approach, if that is not their intention, then they have nothing to worry about. But this legislation provides protection for those who would otherwise not be able to protect themselves. There is nothing more fundamentally Australian than fighting against bullying, standing up for those who need protection and standing up for the rights of small businessesâpeople who go out there and do it for themselves, and work, struggle and sweat to build this country. I commend this bill with all my belief.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>03:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>10468</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat was a rather repetitive contribution from the member for Flinders.

I thought he had worked for the current minister for foreign affairs, but one could form the view, based on his contribution tonight, that he might have worked for one Peter Reith, because he has this ideological obsession with the trade union movement. However, the point is that he has ignored all the facts.</para><para>It should be no surprise that I should rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1621">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2002</inline>, because I am a former shadow minister for small business and have a very deep-seated interest in the small business community in this country. I acknowledge the contribution that the small business sector makes to the Australian economy. It is a growing contribution. We all acknowledge the changing nature of the Australian economy. Our workplaces are growing much smaller. We are working with much smaller business units in the modern economy. The Fordist regime is behind us. The small business sector will play an increasingly important role in the Australian economy.  </para><para>However, the member for Flinders misses the point in all of this. The key point is that this is a non-event; this is a red herring. I sat on the Baird committee, as did the member for Eden-Monaro, and this issue was not raised with the committee. The member for Scullin is in the House this morning and he also sat on the committee. This is an issue that was not raised with the Baird committee. I remind the House that the impetus for the establishment of the Baird committee was a Labor Party commitment prior to the 1998 election to hold an inquiry into market concentration in the retail sector. It was the Labor Party which first acknowledged that that market concentration was causing problems for the small business sector. They were having difficulty competing with the Woolworths and the Coles of this world. </para><para>It was Labor who first committed to addressing those problems and, reluctantly, the Howard government was dragged screaming to match that commitment prior to the 1998 election. I remember it very well. I was surprised at the end of the day that they had committed themselves to doing so because, as we all know, the Howard government is not about markets; it is about big business. It is not about small business. It relies on big business for its patronage and for its political donations. So I was surprised but pleased that the Howard government matched Labor's commitment to hold an inquiry into market concentration in the retail sector. </para><para>We got through the 1998 election and, unfortunately, the Labor Party lostâI can acknowledge that. The Howard government then had to turn its mind as it did. I note that the minister for small business is entering the chamber now. What an opportunity for him to make a contribution to this debate. Following the election, the Howard government had to make good on its commitment to hold this inquiry. Of course, there was a lot of jostling going on on the other side of the House at that point about positions on the front bench. The member for Cook was one of those lobbying hard for a guernsey but, alas, he missed out so he was given second prizeâhe was made the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. </para><para>But the member for Cook did not realise at the time that he was being handed the poisoned chalice, because he was given a brief that the Howard government did not support. He was told to hold an inquiry but was told quite clearly not to expect to make any recommendations that would be supported by the government. In other words: `Go and do the inquiry, member for Cook, but don't go in too hard. Don't do too much for the small business sector. Don't make any effective recommendations to the government because, at the end of the day, the Howard government is for the big end of town. We feign interest in the small business sector, but at the end of the day we know where our bread is butteredâit is the big end of town. So don't expect to come back to us with recommendations that are going to help the small business sector at the expense of the big end of town.'</para><para>The member for Cook accepted the brief and away he went, and we held a fairly extensive inquiry. It was an informative inquiry. We heard all sorts of evidence about the impact of market concentration in the retail sector and the impact it had on the small business sector and its ability to compete in the marketplace. We heard some very sad stories about the misuse of that market power on behalf of the big end of town and the impact of that on the small business sector.</para><para>It was also effective in the sense that there was a bipartisan spiritâI know the member for Scullin will agreeâand a bipartisan approach to the recommendations of that committee. We all agreed that part IV of the Trade Practices Act had to be strengthened because there were fines for misuse of market power of up to $10 million, if I remember correctly, but they were not of any assistance to the small business person who had been affected by the misuse of market power. So we agreed unanimously that part IV of the Trade Practices Act should be strengthened so that not only big business could be fined for misuse of market power but also, while the ACCC has the big end of town in the commission, they could also seek compensation for the small business that has been affected by that misuse of market power. </para><para>We all agreed on that, but we had a minor disagreement on one pointâthat is, sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. The Labor Party do not believe that 45D and 45E should be in the Trade Practices Act. We think they are best enshrined in industrial relations law, so why would the Labor Party seek to extend the representative action powers of the ACCC to 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act? It makes no sense. Yet what did the government do? The government held the opposition and the small business sector to ransom. Rather than accept there was no point in insisting that the additional representative action powers of the ACCC go to 45D and 45E, rather than just allow that to be carved out and got on with, the government dug in. Months went past, a period in which small business could have had access to these new provisions. But the government was not concerned about the small business sector; it was concerned about the politics of it because, at the end of the day, it is always about the trade union movement. We saw the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations earlier in the week waxing lyrical about New South Wales legislation which enshrined the role of the mine workers union in New South Wales to play its part in safety issues in the coalmining industry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âAt least you stood up for them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>âI did stick up for them. That is a practice that has been going on for decades. It has been enshrined in regulation for decades. All the New South Wales government was seeking to do was take that a step further and enshrine it in the legislation itself, but Minister Abbott had a problem with that. Why? Because he saw another opportunity to give the trade union movement a whack and, at the same time, give the Labor Party a whack by virtue of the close association between the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party.

But 45D and E are not an issue. When the Labor Party moved amendments in this place to carve out 45D and E, I would have been happy for the government to stick to their view on those sections.

They suggest that, in talking about a report from 1997, we are living in the past. If you look at this report and at the actions of this government, nothing much has changed. I was willing to acknowledge that, at least in the area of franchisingâmuch to my amazement, because it was a code installed by the sector itselfâthere has been some improvement. That was a classic sector where small business, because of the actions of people with market power, were bullied, and where the market did not have a level playing field. Action needed to be taken to ensure that small business had a chance of surviving people who could be described as bullies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Those people who want to talk about the Reid inquiry as a piece of history might go down to their local shopping mall and ask the businesses there whether the issues about retail tenancies mentioned in that report have changed over five years. They might ask whether the imbalance has been corrected between those who run the shopping malls and the small businesses that try to operate there. Fortunately, through the actions of state and territory governmentsâand, I have to acknowledge, not just those of Labor Party persuasion but also those of coalition persuasionâimprovements have been made in the way in which states and territories, who have responsibility for retail tenancy matters, are acting. The point is that these are the issues that are of the utmost concern to small business. The two inquiries of this parliament have indicated that.</para><para>As the honourable member for Hunter has indicated, the opposition continues to express the view that, if some sort of action is required, this is an industrial relations matter; it is not a matter of trade practices. The issues of imbalance in markets are to do with other sections of the Trade Practices Act. If we are to see representative actions being taken by the ACCC, as the honourable member for Hunter has indicated, section 46, `Misuse of market power', is one of the areas that needs to be looked at. They are the issues that the honourable member for Dawson, in taking up a debate with people like Roger Corbett, from Woolworths, should be looking at. We should be looking at that area to make sure that it is strengthened and to make sure that the ACCC is given the resources to take representative action.</para><para>I believe we are being diverted by this debate. If we want to spend the House's time debating small business issues, then we should look at the proper issues and not be diverted by section 45D and 45E matters. I think it is important that the imbalance of market power or the actions of bullies are discussedâbut let us identify the bullies. If the concerns that led to the Baird inquiry were relevant then, we should look at the current statistics on the market share of the big retailers. Back in 1999, at the time of the Baird inquiry, Woolworths and the Coles group had a 68.3 per cent share of the retail market. In 2002, that has increased to 74.2 per cent. It was a problem back then, so the fact that it has now increased by another six per cent is the type of issue that we should be looking at in considering amendments to the Trade Practices Act. That is what this bill is about. It is proposing amendments to the Trade Practices Act. The opposition is saying that those amendments are misguidedâthat they are amendments to the wrong sections.</para><para>If we want to do the proper thing by small business, we should take on board these other issues that are important to the future of small business. What are the types of issues that an organisation such as NARGA, representing smaller retailers, are still championing in their literature? For one, they indicate that, under the review that is taking place of the Trade Practices Act, there should be a review of the way that section 46 operates. In their contribution to the Trade Practices Act review, they do not mention sections 45D and 45E but, much to the embarrassment of the government, they mention GST compliance and other matters that are not covered by this bill. That is the point that the opposition is makingâthat this is a misguided piece of legislation because it really does not go to the issues that small business are interested in. One can only conclude that this piece of legislation is driven by ideology more than any other reason. </para><para>As I said from the outset, I am really concerned that we are having this type of debate over a bill that is a section 57 trigger. I am not sure that many people understood that, between the hours of three and four o'clock in the morning, on the last day of the parliamentary session, we would actually be discussing matters to do with a bill that could potentially be used as a double dissolution trigger. That is really the crux of the matter. The minister knows that he is not going to get this legislation through the Senate. He says the justification for the lack of government speakers on this piece of legislation is that it has been discussed before, on two occasions: the original bill this year and the 2000 amendment bill to the Trade Practices Act. I am sorry, but that is not good enough. If this is something that the government wants to put forward, we really should be having a full debate, on the basis that it is potentially a double dissolution trigger. It concerns me that, in the late, late phase of this session, this is the way the debate is being handled.</para><para>As I have said, there are other matters that we really should be looking at. If the honourable member for Dawson and Senator Boswell are putting pressure on their coalition partners to ensure that these other matters are investigated and discussed, they should tell me how that is progressing. One of the recommendations of the Baird inquiry was that there should be a review of the matters investigated in 1999. If 1999 is too far in the past, I am sorry. But those two inquiries are still relevant, because many of the issues that were put to those inquiries have still not been addressed, and are not addressed by this piece of legislation.</para><para>Having been a member of both inquiries, the reason I intervened in the debate was that both inquiries are used as justification for this bill. That is a distortion of what was discussed, what was investigated and what was presented to those inquiries. If we are going to have the debate, let us be fair dinkum about it. If people want to talk about bullies, let us identify the real bulliesâthe ones who are really giving small business concerns. If we had gone through the franchisees and through the policy, we would have done that. If we look at larger retailersâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>âWho is the bully?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name></talker><para>âIf the minister does not know what the other ones are, he cannot be going around.

They are the types of issues we should be spending time on debating. I suggested from the outset that this would be a heroic contribution and, perhaps as I need to move on to other duties in the chamber, I will leave it.

It is most interesting that those who sit in opposition would be concerned that the Howard government are introducing an ideology. What else would we be doing? We go to the polls to introduce legislation; we go to the polls on a policy platform. It might all be new to those who sit on that side of the House, but we go with policy to an election. When we get elected, we come to this chamber and to the Senate to make sure that we introduce that legislation. What we have is the Howard government once again introducing and delivering on promises we made at an election. What we heard was union payback.

It ensures dynamic and temporal efficiencies, it ensures that the consumers benefit and it ensures that, in the marketplace, there is a continued development and proactivity with respect to research and development and all of the things that are by-products of a competitive marketplace. Far too often, it is the union movement that resorts to thuggery to achieve an outcomeâas has been demonstrated when they have blockaded wharves and this government stood up to them, when they blockaded other businesses or when they charged in and destroyed premises, as was demonstrated by the royal commission into building practices. Far too often, the consequences of this thuggery is that it is small businesses, the mums and dads, the people who work 60- or 70-hour weeks to generate and operate a profitable small business, who are adversely affected by those who are quite happy to skim off the union fees that are paid, not having to actually be accountable for their wages.

We have had quorum after frivolous and spurious quorum, and now they are resorting to references to safari suits and those types of things.

So we could finish there, but I am sorry to say that we will not. There is a little bit more to this in terms of its design and intent. There have been very few speakers on this bill on the coalition side. Perhaps they were not drawn to it, because of the flimsy nature of this bill and the fact that it had been through the House. I was delighted by the superb speech made by the member for Scullinârather than the member for ScullionâDeputy Speaker Jenkins, who is now in the chair. Not only was he on fire but he put the arguments very well and dealt with the Baird committee report that dealt with the trade practices matters relevant to this bill today and with the Reid report. I remember Bruce Reid and his report into shopping centres, I think it was: the operation of shopping centres, market power and the fact that Woolworths and Coles dominate the market.</para><para>As the member for Hunter pointed out, these reports were generated by the concerns of the Labor government before they lost government in 1996. The core of what the current government has arguedânot particularly well, I would advertâis that, while the Labor Party does not really understand what they are about here, in making these changes to the Trade Practices Act 1974, they are about looking after small business. They have that concern at the very core of what they deal with in all of their government practices, and that is the one key thing they have been committed to. Well, if you believe that line you are readily taken in. The argument they put was that Labor does not understandâspeaking contextually relevantly to the billâthat, when they say this was in the industrial relations area and that this is the area it should be in, they are mixing things up. </para><para>That is part of the key to our reaction to this bill. This is not about secondary boycotts, but that is all that the government members can talk about. Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act are an utter obsession and an utter fixation for this coalition. That has been the case for the Prime Minister since 1974 when he walked out of a suburban solicitors' practice and into parliament. It is an obsession that the coalition cannot get away from, and one that totally fixates and transfixes them. I am sorry; the argument just does not wash. Secondary boycotts are illegal under this coalition government. That is not news. What may be news to the government, and certainly to the members who have spoken in this debate, is that secondary boycotts were illegal under the Keating and Hawke Labor governments. The core point of the coalition's argument has no foundation in fact. This is not about secondary boycotts. What we have argued is simply that the illegality of the prohibition of secondary boycotts lies in the industrial relations area.</para><para>If this legislation is passed in the House tonight, despite what I have said and will say, despite what the distinguished Deputy Speaker Jenkins argued so cogentlyâand, indeed, at 3.45 in the morning, coherentlyâand despite what the member for Hunter argued, it will be a half step away from becoming a trigger for a double dissolution. That will be sometime next year, if the government get around to putting it up to the Senate and if it gets knocked over again. The core point is: knowing that secondary boycotts are illegal and were prohibited not only by them but by us, why have the government taken a certain range of actions to stop us talking about this bill? The minister at the table is seeking advice on doing that now. The reason is that there has been a bit of contracting out and a bit of consultation. We know that there have been a few consultants to this government. We know that the former minister for industrial relations, former member for Flinders Peter Reith, hired a consultant to look at this areaâto look at what the problems were and at how to make a transition from the Industrial Relations Commission. We know that the Industrial Relations Commission was founded in 1904 and I think the Harvester decision was its most significant early decision in 1905. Although industrial relations have worked so successfully in this country, the government wanted to obliterate the Industrial Relations Commission. When former Minister Reith got Des Moore to take up an appointment as a consultant to look into this area, he knew that secondary boycotts were illegal. But the brief to Des Moore was: `Get us out of the industrial relations area and take us into trade practices. Tell us how we can move from one area to the other. Tell us how we can give power to the ACCC'âas the government are attempting to do with this billâ`to unleash their investigative dogs onto single unions, in pursuit of denying them their right to organise within workplaces.' We have seen it on the waterfront, with the MUA. We have seen the attempt, time and time again, to unleash those forces against individual unions.</para><para>Let me go to a particular point. Having established that secondary boycotts are not illegal and, therefore, that they should be kept within the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Act and the industrial relations powers, let us look at one of those key areas. I have already alluded to part 1 of this flimsy bill, which deals with the kind of action that can be taken take under the Trade Practices Act, and what might be permitted. I will simply state the case in terms of what the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> has said about ACCC representative action. It says:</para><quote><para>Section 87 of the <inline font-style="italic">Trade Practices Act 1974 </inline>(TPA) permits the ACCC to bring a representative action seeking compensation and other remedies on behalf of people who have suffered, or are likely to suffer loss or damage as a result of another person's contravention of specified provisions of the TPA.</para></quote><para>Normally when we are dealing with the Trade Practices Act we expect that we are dealing with people involved in a particular industry in a competitive situation and that we are attempting to ensure that non-competitive activity does not occur. It can happen that very large and substantial companies today were once small businesses. It is possible to argueâand I think there are a number of cases in which it can be substantiatedâthat very large companies can sometimes have practices that are extremely uncompetitive. It could be the case that when they were generated and started out they might have had uncompetitive practices as well. Even given the effluxion of time, there may be action that could be taken by the ACCC in relation to competitors. </para><para>It just so happens that I know a bit about this. Although I told the House about my mother's family small business background, I have not talked about the most significant small business background in my family history, and that is H. Hatton and Sons of Bankstown. In 1921, when the <inline font-style="italic">Torch </inline>opened, they were greengrocers and confectioners, but as Bankstown changed and grew my grandfather built a business in construction. Because of the nature of Bankstown, his business covered the whole range of activitiesâthey carted sand and wheat, delivered coal to people throughout the Bankstown area and also advised people on how to build concrete steps, houses, housing extensions and so on. They were renowned in the area and, in Greenacre, which is part of my electorate and the City of Bankstown, they had an ice run. As you would expect with any small company in those days, which my grandfather's company wasâbased in Allum Street in Bankstownâan ice run was pretty hard work. They bought large blocks of ice from the Punchbowl ice company, paid good money for them and then delivered them to people's doorsteps.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>âIt is 25 minutes to five in the morning.

It is not just relevant to the Trade Practices Act but also to the very point that the ACCC is being asked to intervene on in relation to this bill. Normally, you would run up and down the street, get people their ice with the tongs, whack it on their doorsteps and take their money. One day, my grandfather and one of my uncles, who were doing the work, went from one end of the street to the other and there was no money at all, yet those people paid for the services they received. They did the next street and the next street and when they found the perpetratorsâthe people who had broken competitive practice and had knocked off the money in the first, second and third streetsâmy grandfather pulled the bloke out of the truck, advised him that it would not be sensible in future to be anticompetitive. He advised him to stop stealing the money that had been left there and to go about his business in another way.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I suppose if you are going to be honest about the way you run your business at the startâand that leads to what the company is going to be laterâmaybe you will not actually do as well as other people. My family and my father's family did not succeed, did not become multimillionaires and did not build national companies, but the Fox family certainly did. The Fox family, which started in Bankstown and knocked off the money from my grandfather's ice run, ended up running one of the most significant transport companies in this country; but the basis of it, the building of it, started right in Bankstown, in Greenacre, knocking off a competitor's money. So I am wondering whether, if the provisions of this bill which this minister wants to see go through this House were operative, I or members of my family wouldn't have a claim against the Fox group for the uncompetitive behaviour that they undertook. I am wondering whether, even given the effluxion of time, I wouldn't be able to say to the ACCC, `This should be taken into account, you should be pressing this, rather than being the government's lapdog in terms of secondary boycott action and attempting to belt the daylights out of what the government see as the big problem: the unions.' It might also be the fact that, while the government are saying that they are standing up for small business, they have battered the daylights out of business in Blaxland and they have belted them with the BASâthe Australia card for Australian business.

It was this government that brought in the GST. It was this government that brought in the BAS. This is about this government and its rhetoric in relation to the ACCC and what it wants to achieve in this trade practices bill to bring secondary boycott measures and enforcement out of the industrial relations area and into trade practices. It is this government that needs to take responsibility for what has happened to small business and for the position they are in.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government also needs to take account of its own backbenchers. When the Baird committee looked into thisâand we have had an attestation to this from two people from our side who were on the committee: the member for Hunter and the member for Scullin, who is in the chair at the momentânot only our members but also the government members on that committee heard a range of concerns from small business, yet there was no government action to redress those concerns. Fundamentally what they heard was that there was very little concern in relation to sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. No calls were heard from small business in Blaxland or North Sydney or anywhere else for this change in the act to empower the ACCC to take action that they have never been able to take beforeâthat is, to become the government's chief tracker of its key targets: the unions that it sees as being responsible from time to time for secondary boycotts.</para><para>I reiterate the point: if you want a double dissolution out of this, go ahead and try and get it. We will see you when you have it, either on this or anything else, and we will deal with the core issues that are presented to the electorate at that timeâwhenever it is. The latest time you have got is around October 2004, Joeâjust to let you know. What we are doing tonight in refusing to accept this bill we have done before. This is not about the Industrial Relations Commission, except for this: that the other key fixation of this government, the one that they cannot simply get over, is that the Industrial Relations Commission has existed, going back almost to the foundation of the Commonwealthâit is only three years shy of itâand it has successfully arbitrated and conciliated industrial disputes. They want to smash it to smithereens, to fragment it to its elemental condition and in fact wipe it off the table. That is what this bill would seek to do. That is the government's agenda with this; that is what they hope to achieve. </para><para>This bill may pass here shortly when we vote on it but I do not expect that it will pass the Senate. Its flimsiness cannot cover up the fact that the government's position is not only ideological but driven and fanatical in this regard. To those who before pressed it, like the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the former member for Flinders and the Prime Minister, so fixated and obsessed, and indeed other members of this government, I say that you cannot run industrial relations by whacking the ACCC on your individual unions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hockey</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIANS WORKING TOGETHER AND OTHER 2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10481</page.no><id.no>R1550</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>10481</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate has considered message No. 206 of the House relating to the bill and does not insist on its division of the bill.

It is real dirty pool to get those sorts of dirty tricks at this hour of the morning. We had been led to believe by this government that it was accepting those amendments and it has come in here with its own amendments. We have not had the opportunity to compare them to our amendments and to make a considered judgment in this important area of public policy affecting parents and affecting the mature age unemployed. All I can say is that I am just completely disgusted by the behaviour of the ministers. This is in an area where we thought we had some agreement. God knows what will happen in the areas where we do not have agreement. This area is pretty important. This is the government that says it believes in family values. How can it have possibly disagreed with the amendments that we moved when it came to sole parents, amendments which said that the new requirements of reciprocal obligation should not conflict with their parenting responsibilities, and other amendments that we have moved in relation to the mature age unemployed? Parents are the best judge of their parenting responsibilities, not governments. We are certainly satisfied with our amendments, but we now do not know what the government is proposing and have not had an opportunity to study what the government has said.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The minister is right in one respect: there is a battleground out there, in that Labor has moved a comprehensive set of amendments advocating fairness in the penalty system right across the social security system. We have; we have made no secret of itâwe have campaigned on this issue for years. We have been disgusted by the attitude of Senator Vanstone, who has had a `shoot first, ask questions later' breaching policy. Lots of people out there have been hurt. Huge financial penalties have hit them. They have suffered. The agencies that are at the front line and have had to deal with the consequences of this can testify to how immense the impact of that has beenâtoo many Australians have been unfairly penalised and they have paid a very high price. They have suffered, and they have suffered severe financial disadvantage.</para><para>Our amendments in this area are fair and are based on the independent report of the Pearce committee. We think we have put forward in this area of the penalty system across the social security system a balanced package, a package that enhances compliance and increases participation. These amendments ensure good behaviour is rewarded while retaining significant penalties for those who do not play by the rules. We on this side of the House have no time for those who want to rort the system, none at all, but we have a lot of time for those who need the system and we believe in the integrity of the system. This government has no choice but to accept that some change is required and, if need be, we will debate this at length and we will debate it as long as the government wants toâunder any circumstances. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>04:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>10494</page.no><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name><name.id>XJ6</name.id><electorate>Richmond</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to give some clarification which might be of benefit to the Manager of Opposition Business. I have just been informed by the Clerk that there might be some confusion in that the agreement, from my understanding, that was reached with the opposition was that these amendments that have come back had to come back to the House, had to be rejected and reaccepted because they had to come from the House of Representatives to make them valid constitutionally. So I suspect that a lot of the debate tonight may be unnecessary because on those areas we have agreed. Of course, there are some areas on which we will continue to disagree, and I am sure they will be the subject of a division shortly. That may assist the Manager of Opposition Business. While he briefs himself, I further clarify that the government is very keen to continue with Australians Working Together. It was the next phase following the McClure report. Today the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations launched the second phase of AWT. We believe that the measures that we are putting forward are worth while. Perhaps I will now give the member for Lilley the chance to continue the debate with this newfound knowledge. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>04:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>10495</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is not newfound knowledge; it is knowledge delivered at an hour which is simply unacceptable, in a way which is unacceptable, in a procedure which is unacceptable, in circumstances which are unacceptable. But I am delighted to hear unequivocally that you have accepted our amendments in the area of sole parents and mature age unemployed, because you should have and I am pleased you have. That brings us to the area which is of contention, the battleground, as you described. I guess that battleground comes down to really four areas or possibly five, and I want to talk about them briefly.</para></talk.start><para>The first one is the area of the reduction in breach penalty periods from a maximum of 26 weeks to eight weeks. The second one relates to that as well, because we have to balance the reduction in breach penalty periods, with an increase in penalties that would apply each fortnight: from 16 per cent to 20 per cent for a administrative breaches, from 18 per cent to 20 per cent for a first activity breach and from 24 to 25 per cent for a second breach.</para><para>The third area relates to restoration of payments on complianceâthat is, when they remedy their error their payments are restored. This measure is particularly important. This is a measure which encourages participation and rewards people who do the right thing. The fourth area relates to the reduction of the accumulation period, where breach penalties may compound, from two years to one year.</para><para>We have put forward what we regard as a fair and balanced package. It has its origins in the independent report by Professor Pearce. It is a package of changes that are certainly more than affordable in a $50 billion welfare system. They are changes that encourage participation, they are changes that encourage compliance and they are changes that in many ways, along with the working credit, reward work over welfare. It should not be forgotten that involved in this bill is the working credit, already delayed by this government by nine monthsâa measure which Labor had as its policy when it was in government and which was abolished by this government seven years ago. It is absolutely essential to encouraging people to move from welfare to work by rewarding that effort, in contrast to the situation at the moment where unemployed people who work part time, casually, are taxed 80c in every additional dollar earned over the threshold. If that was the tax rate applying at the top end of town or in middle Australia there would be a riot. Six years ago the government put that in place. I will not go into the detail of thatâwe have debated it on many occasions. But all of these measures need to be set in that context.</para><para>We are pretty keen to pursue the amendments that I have outlined in those four areas. But, having said that, Labor is mindful of the need for progress on this bill. We do not want to see a situation where this bill is stalled or there is a deadlock. So, in the Senate, Labor will not necessarily be insisting on every single amendment that we have moved. We do have a core package which will deliver fairness to the people who really deserve it: those who are being unfairly penalised, breached and punished by this government. We will not be party to insisting upon Democrat amendments relating to Austudy, numbered 44, 46, 48, 51, 53 and 55, as these amendments are not consistent with the package which Labor is pursuing. Labor will not pursue amendments relating to the accumulation period. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> This leaves the remainder of the amendments which, unless there is a breakthrough, we will insist upon in the Senate when the bill returns to that place shortly. They seek to have a reduction in the breach period from 26 weeks to eight weeks, coupled with an increase in the breach rate from 16 per cent to 20 per cent, 18 per cent to 20 per cent and 24 per cent to 25 per cent for those various periods that I described before. The other key group of amendments relate to the waiver of the remaining portion of the breach periods when a job seeker remedies their error. </para><para>In summary, the amendments we will be insisting upon are (22), (24), (39), (40), (63), (64), (18), (43), (61), (65), (75), (77), (74), (76), (37) and (42). We believe that these measures are essentialâessential to encourage participation, essential to reward work over welfare, essential to integrity and essential to protect people who should not be unnecessarily punished in this system which is meant to be a safety net. Unfortunately, the safety net for too many people has had huge holes cut in it in recent times. We are keen for the government to keep this bill alive, to see whether we can reach agreement on some component of the Pearce amendments and to progress the working credit. The ball is now in the government's court.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the Senate amendments be disagreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>05:03:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy SpeakerâMr Jenkins)

This bill amends the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to partially implement recommendations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its August 2000 report called <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant.</inline> Yesterdayâin fact, it is two days ago nowâthe Prime Minister confirmed just how little interest he has in work and family issues. There was a deafening silence from the Prime Minister's office in response to the release of report of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, on paid maternity leave. In case we needed it, this bill is further evidence of the government's abysmal track record on work and family issues. It is long overdue and it goes only part way to addressing the matters raised in the report to which I have referred. The bill shows just how limited and belated the government's work and family approach is.</para></talk.start><para>Over two years ago, in March 2000, the member for Jagajaga introduced into this House a private member's bill with the same title as this bill. That private member's bill amended the Sex Discrimination Act and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to make sure that pregnant, potentially pregnant and breastfeeding women are not discriminated against in the workplace.</para><para>The bill was in response to a clear need for legislative changes, highlighted in the <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive</inline> report. That report was presented to the Attorney-General in June 1999âover three years ago. The bill before us today implements only some of those recommendations. It has taken three years for the government to introduce a legislative response to that report. Not only is the bill abysmally overdue; it is also totally inadequate. It implements only three out of the 12 recommendations in the report calling for amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act.</para><para>Non-discrimination in the workplace is, in fact, like being pregnant. There is no halfway: you cannot be a little bit pregnant and you cannot have only a bit of non-discrimination. A workplace is either free of discrimination or it is not. There is no point settling for half measures. This bill shows that the government is willing to do exactly that: settle for half measures by implementing, three years late, only three recommendations from the pregnancy report for amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act.</para><para>When the report was publicly released, Susan Halliday said that the report had uncovered horror stories such as women miscarrying because they were not allowed to sit down at work, men being sacked for attending the births of their babies and women being harassed about their appearance and removed from the front desk where they were visible to the public. In one case documented by the commissioner, a woman working in a car factory was denied a chair, despite bleeding and severe pain. She collapsed at work when seven months pregnant and her baby was born prematurely with an undeveloped heart. Ms Halliday said:</para><quote><para>Something has to be done. It is fair to say that there are lives at stake here.</para></quote><para>In the face of such truly shocking stories, it is appalling that it has taken the government so long to implement any of the commission's recommendations. It is willing to settle for only half measures, in fact, only quarter measures, considering three out of the 12 recommendations. For 3Â½ yearsâthat is more than four pregnanciesâhow many pregnant women or new mothers have had to combat a form of discrimination because of the government's inaction?</para><para>Whilst discrimination and harassment on the grounds of pregnancy and potential pregnancy are grounds for complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act, the <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive</inline> report found that workplace discrimination and harassment on these grounds remain real issues for many women, and that clarification of the act is needed in a number of areas. The commission reported that some employees concealed their pregnancy for as long as possible because they feared pregnancy discrimination and that some senior professional women took accrued annual leave, long service leave and the like so that they would not have to reveal and have recorded on their employment records the fact that they had taken maternity leave.</para><para>Amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act were overdue three years ago and now the government has introduced a bill of half measures and only half measures. The bill in its current form just does not go far enough. The bill only covers the three areas of the act identified in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report that relate to, firstly, whether discrimination against breastfeeding women is grounds for sex discrimination; secondly, the asking of questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy during job interviews; and, thirdly, the use of information obtained in medical examinations. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission recommended that the act be amended to make the law in these areas clearer for the benefit of employers and employees, in particular. The report found:</para><quote><para>Erroneous tactics and exploitative practices are, to this day, being utilised to remove pregnant women from the workplace or deny pregnant, and potentially pregnant women, equal employment opportunity. </para></quote><para>The bill we are debating redrafts the part of the act that prohibits requests for information that are connected to acts of unlawful discrimination and provides clarification by adding an example of a prohibited question. The bill also adds an explanatory note to make it clear that the exception that allows requests for pregnancy related medical information to be made does not override those provisions of the act which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex or pregnancy. The operation of the act is expanded by the amendments but they eliminate confusion identified in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report about the meaning and operation of the act regarding pregnancy and pregnancy related issues.</para><para>Unfortunately, the bill does not address a number of other legislative changes recommended in the HREOC report. These changes are significant and worthy of noting specifically, and they include: empowering HREOC to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; allowing referrals by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to the Industrial Relations Commission of discriminatory awards or agreements without the need for receipt of a written complaint; enabling the award of punitive damages as well as compensatory damages; removing the exemption for educational institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; ensuring coverage of unpaid workers; and removing the exemption of employment by an instrumentality of a state.</para><para>The amendments the Labor Party propose, in contrast, address 10 of the <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive</inline> report's 46 recommendations. Our proposals will enhance the rights of pregnant and potentially pregnant women by empowering the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; ensuring unpaid workers are covered by the Sex Discrimination Act; removing the exemption for employment by an instrumentality of a state from the Sex Discrimination Act; removing the exemption for educational institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; allowing punitive damages to be awarded, specifically including breastfeeding as grounds for unlawful discrimination; allowing the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory awards or agreements to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission without the requirement to receive a written complaint; clarifying that a complaint about a discriminatory advertisement may be made by any person; clarifying that the asking of questions to elicit information about whether and when a woman intends to become pregnant and/or her intentions in relation to meeting her current or pending family responsibilities is unlawful; and, finally, clarifying that it is unlawful to discriminate in medical examinations of pregnant women during the recruitment process. They also extend the antidiscrimination provisions to employees who are in the process of adopting a child.</para><para>Improving the protections for pregnant women is important, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. A lot more in terms of policy change is needed. Australia needs a sea change in policies and attitudes that are hindering the capacity of women to take on and survive the complex responsibilities of work on the one hand and family commitments on the other. It is time women, particularly women who are thinking about starting a family and women who have young families, are supported by policies that will make a difference to their lives and assist them to balance those competing responsibilities. I am not referring to how women who are corporate high-flyers with nannies, housekeepers and the like cope with the challenges they confront but to the millions of Australian mothers whose jobs are the safety net for their family's economic survival. They literally work to pay bills; they work to support their families. With the dramatic increase in real estate prices and dramatic increase in credit card indebtedness, it is becoming more the norm for families to require two incomes to surviveâand certainly to survive in the capital cities in Australia, where most families reside.</para><para>But the Howard government refuses to recognise that most families just cannot afford to have one parent at home full-time for five years and that most women who leave work to have a baby return to work at some stage after the birth. The proof is in the statistics. Well over 60 per cent of Australian women spend their baby's first year out of the paid work force, but more than half of new mothers in two-parent families are back at work before their babies are two years old. By the time their children have turned three, nearly 70 per cent of mothers these days are back in the work force, usually, as I indicated, as a result of those economic pressures. Mothers understand the importance of staying attached to the work force during these early child-rearing years. Their preference is for part-time work. Among parents of dependent children, in June 2000 57 per cent of employed partnered mothers and five per cent of employed partnered fathers worked part time.  </para><para>What the statistics do not show are the difficulties, the pressures and the anxieties experienced by parents as they negotiate the demands of their double lives. Research is increasingly showing the anxieties and pressures and the effect of those pressures faced by children in circumstances where their parents are trying to balance the challenges of both work and family responsibilities. Now it seems many young women think it is all too hard and are in fact deciding not to have children. The evidence is indisputable. Australian women are having fewer babies. The birthrate fell dramatically from 3.5 babies per woman in the early 1960s to just 1.7 in 2001. That is the lowest rate on record. It is down from 1.75 children on average in the year 2000 and much worse than the previous lows of 1.86 and 1.94 recorded in 1991 and 1981, when those figures were last taken. We are in very real danger of becoming a baby-free society, a place where children are a private responsibility that must never impinge on a parent's working life. If that culture becomes our culture, we will see that birthrate declining even more rapidly. </para><para>The Prime Minister's policies are creating this baby-free society. The Prime Minister's ideological preference is a world where men are breadwinners, women are full-time homemakers and children are at home with their mothers until they start school. The government's tax and welfare policies clearly favour single-income families. For example, the government's family tax benefit B is only available to single-income families. The election conceived baby bonus offends all notions of equity. It provides the greatest financial help to those who need it least and it is quickly eroded if the stay-at-home parent earns any part-time money. The everyday reality is that it just does not work according to the Prime Minister's view of life. The Howard government's policies reflect a narrow, conservative ideology, not the reality of most families, where both parents work because of the financial pressures that they face these days. That is why Labor is pushing for a sea change in policy and attitude and why it is committed to catching up with the rest of the world and introducing a system of paid maternity leave. </para><para>The difference between the government and the opposition is clear on this critical issue. The day before yesterday, when the Sex Discrimination Commissioner released her paid maternity leave report, the opposition were crystal clear about our position: we are committed to introducing paid maternity leave. There is absolutely no ambiguity about where we stand. We had a barbecue to welcome the report because where the Prime Minister says that work and family issues are barbecue stoppers, we think they should be a barbecue starter. We believe that a good barbecue must have two ingredients. Firstly, it needs a family and, secondly, it needs some time for people to get together. Without work and family policies like paid maternity leave, people will be less willing to start families and will have less time for activities such as barbecues and simply spending time with the kids. As I said before, not only is that a stress and a strain for parents; it is detrimental to the interests of children.</para><para>The fact that the government does not support work and family provisions like paid maternity leave makes them, literally, a barbecue stopper. Australia is just one of the two developed countries that does not yet have a paid maternity leave scheme. Countries we are lagging behind include Japan, Canada, Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Slovak Republic and New Zealand. Countries which have suitable family friendly policies have a higher birthrate where assistance is provided to families to have children. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>10510</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>05:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>10510</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, on indulgence: this is a discourtesy to the member for Barton, for which I apologise, but I thought he would not mind if I interrupted him to provide some further important information to the House. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe minister may proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name></talker><para>âI very much regret to have to inform members of further disruptions to our late night and early morning.

I believe the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer have expressed similar sentiments. They all say that they do not support paid maternity leave for all working women. They prefer a system where only middle-class professionals who work for large organisations have access to paid maternity leave and women in low-income jobs and small businesses do not.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The day before yesterday the government's response to the Goward report consisted of a terse, five-line statement from the Minister for Family and Community Services thanking the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and still refusing to commit to introducing statutory paid maternity leave. A more detailed response came from the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Peter Hendy, who was the education minister's chief of staff as well as a senior advisor to former defence minister Peter Reith. Mr Hendy's response was unequivocal: he did not support a system of paid maternity leave for all working women even if the government funded it. We find it difficult to accept that ACCI would not accept a system of paid maternity leave even if the government funded it.</para><para>It is clear that the Howard government will not introduce paid maternity leave. What is more, if the length of time the government has taken to introduce the bill we are now debating is an indication, it will be many long years before we get even some response to the Goward report. But a Crean government will introduce paid maternity leave in a form that does not burden small business, because we believe it is a fundamental part of Labor's strategy for working families. Paid maternity leave means that mothers who work will be financially able to take time out of the work force to recover from childbirth. It provides relief and respite while ensuring that women do not lose connection with the workplace and that, in the meantime, bills can be paid and mortgage commitments can be satisfied.</para><para>The aim of paid maternity leave is to make a contribution towards the income a woman forgoes when she leaves work to have a baby, and during the subsequent necessary period of leave needed for the health and welfare of both the mother and the newborn baby. But paid maternity leave is not the beginning and end of work and family issues. We understand and fully appreciate that. Paid maternity leave is a fundamental part of the work and family balance, but in itself it is not sufficient to help families meet the challenges and joys that a new child brings. Families confronting that life-changing event need one thing above all else: more options to suit their particular circumstancesâmore options for striking the balance between work, family and other activities, such as study, that best suit their needs and those of their children.</para><para>There is no `one size fits all' solution for families because no two families are alike; no two families need the same solution. Parents need a range of possible options so that they develop a solution that suits their needs. Parents want the flexibility to choose different solutions at different stages of their lives. Some parents may want to stay at home with their children, others will return to full-time work as soon as possible, others may want to return to part-time work. We need to support and encourage this diversity between families by giving parents a range of viable alternativesâat least for the first five years of a child's life, when clearly children are heavily dependent on the support and nurturing of their parents. Parents need to be able to construct their own long-term parenting plan from a number of options. Discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace must become a thing of the past. That is what a genuinely family friendly environment, we believe, looks like. I urge the government to accept the opposition's amendment to the bill to help realise that environment.

I am honoured today to stand in this parliament and to be a part of the coalition team. The coalition government during the last six years of leadership have worked tirelessly for the rights of women. Through this parliament we have successfully passed many pieces of legislation that have sought to improve the working conditions and the working environment for women and to reduce discrimination against us. Today we are implementing legislation that will provide greater clarity and address evolving attitudes towards women in the workplace. The implementation of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 heralded better equal opportunity outcomes for women by allowing employers to focus on actions and achievements. In conjunction with the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which contained provisions relating to equal remuneration for work of equal value amongst men and women, the economic status of working women improved and is continuing to improve.</para></talk.start><para>One of the principal objectives of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is to assist employees to balance their work and family responsibilities. Under this act, we as the government have taken action to remove arbitrary restrictions on part-time employment and to also encourage increased award provisions for part-time employment. In addition, there has been an overall increase in the number of family friendly provisions in collective agreements, with approximately 76 per cent of agreements in 1999 containing at least one family friendly measure, including flexible hours provisions. There is no doubt that there has been a huge increase in the participation rate of women in the work force. At the moment that participation rate is at 55 per cent. That is one of the highest in history. It is important that we note that it is striking a balance between work and familyâand work and family issues are more important than ever before.</para><para>The participation rate, which I am sure my colleagues opposite would welcome, is a result of a number of factors, including very strong economic conditions, greater flexibility in the work force, and a child-care sector that is flexible and enables more women to combine work and family. There are over four million women in the Australian paid work force at the moment. As a single mother in the past who has had to raise children, I know all too well the difficulties of balancing family and work life. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister is sitting at the table. I know that she has an interesting time, as do many mothers on the opposite side of the chamber and on our side of the House. Also, being a small business owner operator, I understand the issues we face and the need to have effective government policy to coordinate our involvement in the work force and our commitment to family life.</para><para>More women today are doing well in the business and the public sector. In fact, women hold 27 per cent of private sector senior managerial positions, which is an increase of just under 10 per cent since 1990. More women are going into small business. I saw some statistics recently that said that three times as many women go into small business these days. The greater involvement of women in business, particularly in small to medium type enterprises, is interesting to see. It is largely because they can combine family life and have the flexibility which perhaps would not have been available to them had they been working in a more rigid work environment. This government is committed to policies that help women achieve a balance between maintaining a positive work and family life. </para><para>Australian women have access to record levels of child care, including more flexible child care for families in shiftwork, particularly when children are ill. This government has been a very strong proponent of those sorts of policies and has provided much greater flexibility in the child-care sector and greater choice for Australian families. Those choices include the extension of in-home and sick care and also the entry of other operators, including private operators and family day care schemes and after school care.</para><para>The coalition government has also been encouraging the debate on paid maternity leave. Those on the other side would have us believe that a decision has already been made. It is important that we look at the pros and cons of this particular issue. We do not want nor should we encourage paid maternity leave to take women back to the dark days of restrictive work practices. That is something I would be totally against. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission issues paper `Valuing parenthood: options for paid maternity leave' made two interesting points. Firstly, the forward of the interim paper states:</para><quote><para>It should be emphasised that most of those consulted in the preparation of this paper were concerned that an individual employer funded scheme would prove disadvantageous to women in employment and to commercial competitiveness generally.</para></quote><para>Later in the report, it states:</para><quote><para>For those companies, in particular small businesses, with a high component of operating costs tied up in wages and operating on narrow profit margins, employer-provided paid maternity leave may disproportionately affect wage costs and in some cases be unaffordable. Organisations unable to afford paid maternity leave will be more likely to have women resign or not return to work following maternity leave. It may also make it more difficult for them to recruit women.</para></quote><para>Speakers opposite have indicated their preference for maternity leave. I think it is not just maternity leave that we need to consider, but flexibility in the workplace. I have said before on many occasions that, while it is good to give women 12 weeks maternity leave, it is no good if they have to go back to a workplace environment that is just as restrictive. There is a place for maternity leave to be balanced with more flexible work practices in the market. It is important that we look at all those factors when we consider balancing work and family life.</para><para>The maternity leave debate has been very emotional so far, and it will continue to be so. Providing a policy that will work for women and not against them is something that we need to look at. As I stated in my introduction, the coalition government has made some significant inroads towards improving workplace environments for women. Many years ago at one of my first job interviews, I was asked if, as a young woman, I was currently taking the pill. It was one of the most shocking moments of my employment history. Those were certainly the dark days when employees had to front up and speak to an employer who asked, as one of their first questions, whether a person was taking a contraceptive pill or whether the employee would get pregnant. It was a harrowing experience, and not just for meâa lot of women went through this. I was quite young at the time, and I recall being absolutely astonished that such a personal remark would be made.</para><para>I also remember going back to work when I had young children, and the problem then was: who was going to look after my baby? What child-care arrangements was I going to have made? It is a despondent time when you are trying to go back to work, and in those days there was incredible discrimination, particularly against women who had small children or women who were newly married or did not have children. It was a terrible period that I hope we will never see repeated. This legislation we have here today is commendable in ensuring that there is transparency in rules regarding questions that can be put to possible employees regarding pregnancy and potential pregnancy. I know that I am not alone in this experience; there are many women in Australia who have experienced this in the past. I am sure that many women in the past experienced much worse treatment than this. </para><para>Yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> there was an article that said that in the past year nearly 50 Queensland women claimed that after they had become pregnant, employers or work colleagues had discriminated against them. The article, on page 10, also said that 59 women claimed that they had suffered from discrimination because of their marital status and another four had experienced discrimination because they were breastfeeding. It is absolutely amazing. One of the provisions of this legislation clarifies that a question regarding pregnancy or potential pregnancy should not be put unless it falls within the category of a general question that is asked of everyone. The <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> article also gave some examples of sexual harassment in the workplace and I will quote one of them in particular:</para><quote><para>A WOMAN complained to her employer a colleague had sexually harassed her by making inappropriate comments and touching her shoulders. The company subsequently transferred her out of the section but left the alleged harasser in his position. She complained that her new position meant she was unable to claim overtime and requested to be transferred back. She was told this could not happen until she withdrew her complaint. The Anti-Discrimination Commissioner intervened, resolving the complaint and the woman was transferred back to her original job.</para></quote><para>That is an appalling example of the sort of discrimination that occurs out there in the workplace.</para><para>It is important that we look at the provisions in this legislation. We need to have caution here and also when we implement clarification. I would like to support the insertion of new subsection 27(1) to provide the necessary clarity. By that, it is important that it is not discrimination if an employer seeks a response on a question about a potential employee's future plans. I would regard this as pretty much a standard question in any job interview to assess the motivation and the future career aspirations of a candidate. I have been asked on many occasions, when I have undertaken an interview, what my future plans were in terms of career aspirations and motivational factors, so I think that that is fairly in order. If the interviewee willingly provides information on future family plans, then that is not discrimination. It becomes discrimination, however, if the employer directly makes reference to the pregnancy plans or uses that sort of information when determining who to give the job to. The message for employers and potential employees is to use caution when asking such questions.</para><para>I know that, from running my own small business, it was always in the back of my mind when I framed questions to potential employees. I was always very conscious of the fact that I did not create the wrong impression and that I did not cause some sort of indirect discrimination or discomfort to people that I was employing. I was always very conscious, during the interview stage, that I did not repeat the terrible mistakes that my earlier potential employer made when asking me about my future plans regarding starting a family. It is not discriminatory when an employer or a potential employer asks a question about a person's medical condition or pregnancy in a legitimate way. That is exactly the sort of clarification that we are needing in subsection 27(2). </para><para>It is really important that employers and employees do use discretion. I understand that many people want to maintain confidentiality, particularly in areas of medical and pregnancy issues, and that is their right. As Australians, we all have the need to respect this right. I would argue that, in fact, a good management practice is for the employer to act with sensitivity and discretion, particularly when discussing with individual employees their medical condition or their pregnancy, so that that can be safely handled in the workplace. I must say that I have also worked in very large and small corporations that have been very sensitive at the time that I wanted to start a family. In terms of re-rostering work, rescheduling, providing safety strategies or dealing with occupational health issues, I think it is very important that employers have that information so that they can assist employees and provide a suitable work environment. Everyone wins from that situation. It is a win-win situation for both the employees and the employers, and it does encourage women to return to the workplace. There are many companies in Queensland that have implemented strong family-friendly policies, and they are to be commended. It is also necessary for employers to ask about someone's medical or pregnancy status in a manner that distinguishes between the sexes, because it may also assist in the enforcement of appropriate precautionary measures. </para><para>This bill before us today makes sure that there is clarity to both employers and employees in the area of sex discrimination. The coalition has had an excellent report card in advancing women in the workplace and ensuring equality for all women. This bill that we are discussing here is another chapter in what is already a well-regarded volume. I would like to say that those past measures that we have implemented have been very good measures. The 2002 budget demonstrates the government's strong and continuing commitment to women in this special year, the Centenary of Australian Women's Suffrage. It has been 100 years since the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 came into effect, allowing most Australian women the right to vote and to stand for federal election. </para><para>The coalition government fosters a partnership approach to social policy, delivered in partnership with businesses, communities and individuals. The social coalition aims to develop opportunities for families and communities over and above those delivered by economic growth. We need to ensure that those opportunities continue in the workplace, particularly that women have safe and non-discriminatory workplaces that give them flexibility. The opportunities that I mentioned, particularly government support services, mean that women more than ever have those choicesâwhether they decide to be full-time parents or carers, whether they want to participate in the paid work force, or whether they wish to combine paid work with parenting or caring. I think that what is really important in this debate is that women have the opportunity to participate in whatever level of work arrangements they wish.</para><para>I supposed you could compare a working life to a product's life cycle. Women in the early stages of child rearing may want to work part time; as their children get older, they may then venture into the full-time work force; consequently, when their families have moved on, they may decide that they want to return to part-time work. We need to encourage that flexibility and ensure that we have non-discriminatory policies that will allow women to achieve their full potential. It is good to see that more and more women are going into managerial positions and that more businesses out there have family friendly workplace practices. I will comment on one particular business, Tamawood, which is a building company in Queensland that has provided exceptional working conditions for women, such as on-site child-care arrangements. They are to be commended. I commend the bill to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>06:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>10515</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a pleasure to follow the member for Petrie in speaking on the <inline ref="R1443">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002</inline>. I think I share most of her comments. Obviously, many of us have sought employment in different ways and experienced some odd reactions to seeking that employment, which means that we share an understanding of how important this debate is.</para></talk.start><para>The fact that we are moving some amendments and would like to see some of the other options that are put forward in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report adopted does not mean that we are not supportive of the steps that are being taken. I think there has been quite a change, even in the four years that I have been here, when I see how much more often we debate issues that affect working women in particular but also the balance between work and family, whether it is for men or women. Some of us would like some of these issues to move a bit faster.</para><para>I think that there is room for us to also try to have a debateâperhaps not always in this Houseâabout the way that all these different areas overlap and interact. We cannot really talk about discrimination in the workplace and not talk about the sorts of family payments that the member for Petrie was talking about. We cannot ignore child care or paid maternity leaveâall of these issues are ones that, increasingly, the public wants us to tie together. We need to look at how we can provide proper options for women who choose to work or go in and out of the work force at the same time as having and caring for young children. It is a pleasure to see that there is so much agreement about the range of issues that need to be covered. </para><para> I think a number of us on both sides of the House have been in circumstances where pretty terrible acts of discrimination have occurred. One of the things that surprises me most in the pregnancy discrimination area is just how absolutely unnecessary the reactions of employers often are. Mr Speaker, when you take the opportunity to read the reportâI do not know if you have had the opportunityâthat was prepared by the Human Rights Commission, <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive</inline>, which was the basis for the legislation before us today, you will see it contains a lot of information. The most common theme of the report is how little information people had about their own rights and how unaware many women, particularly young women, were that they did not have to put up with the sort of treatment they received. The changes that the government has adopted are really to clarify what could have already been covered by the act. There were many challenges and many instances that the report found had been ignored because the act was not as clear as it could be.</para><para>We would have liked to have gone a step further and to have instigated or adopted some new heads of discrimination as were recommended in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report, such as prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of breastfeeding and others. These have been picked up in the terms of the debate. I think everybody understands that we are moving in the right direction. At some point, it may be necessary for us to look at a way to introduce that into the legislation. I guess that will be tested through the sorts of actions that employers take and, if necessary, through some test cases as well.</para><para>This bill has been listed a number of times without coming on for debate. Several months ago when the bill was listed, and I thought we were about to speak on it, I had been at a local nursing mothers' group. A couple of the mothers talked to me about their experiences in the workplace when they sought to return to work having, in most instances, been treated very well during their pregnancies. They were quite happy with their various maternity leave arrangements. A number of them had had paid maternity leave and certainly that was a hot topic for discussion and it has turned out to be a topic in the week that this has come before the House.</para><para>One woman's example really stuck in my mind. She worked as a relatively middle-ranking clerical officer. She had her own office in a building with many other employees. She worked quite long hours and was paid a salary. She did not have to be there at particular hours; she could make up time at either end of the day if she chose or if the employer wanted her to. She asked her employer if she would be able to get a lock for the door of her office so that, when she needed to express milk, she could ensure that no-one would walk in on her during that time. She ended up having an all-out brawl with her employer who thought that it was an outrageous request to have a lock on the door. There could be many awkward situations in trying to accommodate the needs of breastfeeding mothers. If we have a situation where it is very easy to accommodate those needs but we have employers arguing against it, we have a long way to go to educate the community. People might need to think more flexibly. This would not have started some dreadful trend in the business. It was suggested that everyone would suddenly have locks on the doors and you would not be able to go in and talk to the various staff. Obviously, that was not what was being proposed. These examples abound in the workplace and we all need to work towards to change.</para><para>In debating this bill, we need to make a fairly basic point: working women are still fighting for fairness in the workplace. Equality has not yet been achieved in all aspects. Getting the right balance between work and family is very difficult, particularly at the time of pregnancy. If it is a first pregnancy, it should be a time of great excitement for the family. A lot of change goes on in people's lives. More and more we see examples of that happy time being spoilt by very difficult negotiations or reactions in workplaces. This bill will help move that forward. It helps clarify what is appropriate and what is inappropriate. I hope employers will take note. We will be moving some amendments in the consideration in detail stage to take that a little further and to make clear what we believe employers should and should not be able to do in this situation. </para><para>I might briefly give an example, because I am probably sounding as though I am being very prescriptive about what employers should do. There are guidelines suggested either in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report or in other bookletsâand I notice one has recently been produced by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations about pregnancy in the workplace and the sorts of discussions that should be had between employer and employee. Mostly they are pretty straightforward, sensible proposals, but it seems that we need to work a little more on the education side of things so that employees are confident they can raise these issues and employers are capable and confident of having the discussions as well.</para><para>I am keeping an eye out for a hopeful intervention of some news from the other place, but it seems that that is not going to happen quite yet. So I will read briefly from a booklet called <inline font-style="italic">Balancing Breastfeeding and Work</inline>, which is prepared jointly by the Department of Health and Aged Care at the Commonwealth level, the University of Adelaide and the South Australian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry. As well as explaining a whole lot of circumstances that might be of assistance to both women in the work force and employers, there is a section which sets out some guidelines to employers and workplaces and what they can do to support breastfeeding. Some of the things are very practical: making sure there is access somewhere in the workplace to a clean and private room, that there is some storage area, that there is a chair for the woman to use if they need to sit down while expressing or breastfeeding, washing facilities, and even things as basic as having access to a power point to be able to use an electric breast pump.</para><para>It seems to me that all of this moves the debate forward a little bit about whether or not this is something that is practical in a workplaceâin many it will not be. The changes that are being proposed and being introduced into the legislation do not seek to put an unreasonable burden on employers. Obviously each workplace is different, and sensible negotiations need to be had. But we need to be able to encourage women that they can have a proper balance and that they can make choices about how they want to continue to care for their children. This is a very important change, particularly in circumstances where they may need to return to work in a short time.</para><para>As I said, it is quite an interesting week for us to be discussing this bill because the Sex Discrimination Commissioner has released her next big report. This one from several years ago was a very important report at its time. Unfortunately, it has taken this length of time to now turn into legislation. The Labor Party, in supporting paid maternity leave, would be very keen to see that the current report that has been tabled this week will not be acted upon so slowly by the government. But, given comments made by other speakers already and what is well known on the public record, there seems to be no agreement at all on the government side about whether or not they even support paid maternity leave as an idea. So there is a lot of debate we still have to have in that area. I hope that we will be able to move forward because it is a vast jigsaw puzzle and it seems to me we are only putting a few pieces together pretty slowly. We need to eventually get them to all fit together so that families do have the options that we all want them to be able to have.</para><para>I hope that the government will take those recommendations and that report seriously. The full detail of the human rights commission's <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive</inline> report from 1999 has not been adopted by this legislation that is before us. There is a lot more that should be looked at and should be done. The clarification of what falls within or constitutes sex discrimination is certainly going to be useful; it will help both employers and employees to know what their rights are, but it does not quite take up the recommendations and the points made by the commissioner's report. People need to be clear what their rights are, and employers need to be encouraged to make sure they can introduce those sorts of standards within the workplace and that that would make a significant difference to preparedness to stay at work. </para><para>I commend the bill to the House. I flag my support, of course, for the amendment moved by the member for Barton and that I seconded. We do need to make sure that we are actually going to balance this sort of legislation with a proper paid maternity leave package with accessible child care and with a whole range of other family-friendly provisions which need to be put in place in the workplace relations system. I trust that we will be able to debate all of those issues in the coming year.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>10518</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>06:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>10518</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, I seek your indulgence.

I</inline>n particular, I am delighted to follow my colleague the member for Gellibrand whom I have known for many years and who I know has had a longstanding commitment and interest in this area. I am also delighted that my friend and colleague the member for Berowra is in the chamber specifically to hear this discussion take place.</para></talk.start><para>This debate occurs at the end of an interesting century, a century of movement and change, and evolution in the rights of women. It occurs at the end of a century which has seen the evolution of those rights across political, economic and social fronts. This bill represents an additional step along that path towards true and genuine equality. One hundred years ago, the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 came into effect. It allowed most Australian women the right to vote and to stand for federal election. Over time, through the success of Dame Enid Lyons and others, women have developed a political voice in the country. Similarly, they have developed a social voice through a range of authors, contributors, activistsâ many people on different frontsâand, significantly and perhaps of most importance, they have developed an independent economic freedom. One of the key reasons why we have seen a significant and continuing increase in the participation rate of women in this country over a period of decades is their increasing involvement in the workplace. That is where this bill fits in.</para><para>That process of evolution and of ever greater involvement of women in the workplace has meant a number of things. One, it has meant an increase in their participation; two, it has meant a gradual equalisation of the pay scalesâthere is more to be done, but there has been significant and quite dramatic progress over the course of the last century; and threeâand this is specifically where this bill fallsâit addresses some of the rights, conditions and terms of women within the workplace. </para><para>I wish to address three particular things in relation to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002. First, the background; second, the provisions of the bill; and third, its importance within the context of today. Looking at the background, in 1998 the Attorney-General requested the first investigation into matters relating to pregnancy and work. The report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and Productive: it is a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</inline>, which subsequently flowed, recommended the need for clarification in relation to three matters in particular. They were, firstly, the asking of questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy; secondly, the use of pregnancy related medical information; and, thirdly, whether breastfeeding constituted legitimate grounds for discrimination or whether discrimination on the grounds of breastfeeding was improper, inappropriate and unfair. That represents the background.</para><para>The provisions of this bill amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in accordance with recommendations 36, 37 and 43 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. The bill was prepared in consultation with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and groups that represent employees whether at the organised level or at the social level.</para><para>Significantly, the amendments clarify three things. Firstly, questions regarding pregnancy or potential pregnancy may not be asked during the recruitment process. Secondly, medical information collected from pregnant women may only be used for legitimate health and safety reasons. In effect, that means that medical information gathered for one purposeâsuch as for determining and protecting the health of a woman or a mother or a potential motherâcannot be used in the workplace for work related purposes. Thirdly, the bill clarifies that discrimination against women on the basis of breastfeeding is illegal. It is an important social step forward. What it says is that, as a matter of law, a woman has a right to breastfeed within the workplace.</para><para>What is at the third level? The importance of the bill. The bill has no financial impact, but it does ensure that the original act is clear. In very simple terms, it is illegal to discriminate against women on the basis of pregnancy, potential pregnancy or because they are breastfeeding. In order to implement this, the government will compile a pamphlet on pregnancy and work in order to increase awareness of this issue amongst employers and employees. Indeed, this bill is just one part of a broader social framework that shows a commitment in relation to the status of women.</para><para>The government's achievements and initiatives include, firstly, workplace equality. Since 1996 there has been a 14 per cent increase in the number of women in employment. That is an extraordinary advance in terms of the proportion of women in employment in a six-year period. Secondly, 52 per cent of the over one million jobs created since 1996âit has increased from 971,800 jobsâwhen I first prepared these notes, have been filled by women. Thirdly, the Workplace Relations Act includes a provision for equal remuneration for men and women when they have undertaken work of equal valueâa simple, clear, absolute and fundamental principle. That is the question about workplace equality.</para><para>The second principal area of achievement is in balancing family and workâand this is a process which is in evolution. Significantly, the government introduced a $24.2 million return to work program that assists people re-entering the work force after a two-year or more break  as carers or parents. In addition, under the category of balancing family and work, the government has committed $8 billion to child care in the four years up to 2004-05, counting the full range of child support and child-care benefits.</para><para>Very briefly, there are more challenges. This bill is a step along the path which has progressed over 100 years and which has gradually led not to a perfect situation but to a significant improvement in the economic, political and social fields. In particular, the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002 addresses the economic capacity of women by ensuring that they are protected when carrying out those duties associated with the normal practice of their lives, which comes from facing motherhood in and during their working lives. It is an important step and I am delighted to commend this legislation to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>06:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>10520</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âGood morning, Mr Speaker. The <inline ref="R1443">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002</inline> is probably the best example of a Clayton's amendment that this House has ever seen. It is the amendment you have when you are not having an amendment. The bill is the government's response to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission report <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive: it is a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</inline>. The report was commissioned by the Attorney-General in August 1998 and the report was required nine months later, in June 1999. As it was, the report was overdue and was finally delivered in August 1999. After a pregnant pause of nearly three years, mother and baby are not doing well.</para></talk.start><para>The report made a total of 46 recommendations, and 11 of those called on the Attorney-General to amend the Sex Discrimination Act in various ways. Out of the 11 recommendations only three are covered by this bill, and those three changes are largely cosmetic. They are only intended to make the act clearer to employers and employees. You might say that they are like the cream to hide the stretch marks, rather than dealing with the health and wellbeing of mother and baby. I should add that the three areas addressed in this bill are ones where there is a great deal of misunderstanding. Any attempt to clarify these issues is welcome. But the remaining eight recommendations that the Attorney-General has chosen to ignore cover issues which actually extend the rights of pregnant women and adoptive parents. I will come back to those issues later.</para><para>Firstly, looking at the recommendations addressed by this bill, I should begin by saying that many cases of discrimination arise out of well-intentioned acts of employers and service providers. They may have acted in what they thought would be in the best interests of the motherâand that in itself would appear to be the cause of many examples of misunderstanding of the act. Making provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act crystal clear to employers and service providers is a welcome and much needed measure.</para><para>In the report of the national pregnancy and work inquiry, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission exposed some alarming figures for employer awareness of equity and discrimination issues. It found in a survey of private sector employers in the Perth area that, while 81.2 per cent of employers of large businesses knew that discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy was unlawful, only 62 per cent of small business employers were aware of that; and in the retail sectorâthe largest employer of womenâonly 59.4 per cent of employers were aware. It is quite alarming to think that at the time that survey was conducted in 1998 only three out of five employers were aware that discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy is unlawful. Some 14 years after the Sex Discrimination Act was passed, only three out of five employers were aware of their responsibilities under the act. And the report also indicates that while those three out of five were aware of the overall requirements, there was considerable misunderstanding of how they should be applied.</para><para>The report suggests a total of 41 guidelines in plain English and with case studies in order to allow better understanding of the act as it applies to pregnancy. You should not have to be a lawyer to have a basic understanding of how to avoid discriminatory practices in your workplace, but I do not want to suggest that, if it is all too hard, then let us do away with it altogetherâlet us not throw the baby out with the bath water. Rather, it is better to clarify the act to ensure that it is more likely to be complied with. An understanding on the part of employees is essential if they are to exercise their rights.</para><para>Looking at the changes proposed in this bill, item 1 in schedule 1 of the bill changes the definition of sex discrimination to include breastfeeding and the act of expressing milk. This change is in response to recommendation 43 of the report, which calls on the Attorney-General to make sure that breastfeeding is a ground of unlawful discrimination. I would have thought that this was covered in the original act, but now it is clearly stated and leaves no doubt that matters relating to breastfeeding are included as unlawful discrimination. This is an important provision of the act and an issue which over time has seen community attitudes evolve from recognition to acceptance. The development of practices and facilities to allow nursing mothers to enjoy the full range of employment and social activities is a welcome change. The days when nursing mothers were sent off to the ladies toilet to feed an infant are thankfully rare now. But that does not apply everywhere. I have always thought it strange that people who thought you should feed a baby in a toilet would never consider eating their lunch in one. I realise that there is much more to the issue of discrimination when it comes to breastfeeding and that smaller employers and service providers face challenges when meeting their responsibilities in this area. But with the benefit of a clearer understanding of their responsibilities, I believe that a commonsense approach can satisfy all parties. </para><para>The second area covered in this bill again seeks to provide a clearer statement of the requirements of the act. Recommendation 36 of the report of the National Pregnancy and Work Inquiry recommends:</para><motion><para>That the Attorney-General clarify section 27 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) by the insertion of a specific provision that prohibits the asking of questions (whether orally or in writing) which might reasonably be understood as intended to elicit information about whether or when a women intends to become pregnant and/or her intentions in relation to meeting her current or pending family responsibilities.</para></motion><para>The explanatory memorandum to the bill points out that this is most commonly applicable in employment recruitment situations. However, it is not limited to employment. The examples given in the explanatory memorandum describe situations of applying to lease rental property and an applicant for a bank loan. With the changes, it should be crystal clear that anyone responsible for recruitment, letting property or handling loan applicationsâand I would think many other similar transactionsâis prohibited from asking questions that may be used to discriminate against a person on the basis of their sex, pregnancy or potential pregnancy or marital status. There are no ifs or buts; asking the question breaches the act. It is not a matter of saying, `I wasn't going to use the information.' Why would you ask in the first place if you were not going to use the information?</para><para>I hope that this amending legislation makes it crystal clearâand, short of drawing a picture, it could hardly be made clearerâthat this part of the Sex Discrimination Act needs to be widely understood and enforced. But, before I go on to the third change, it is worth going back to the figures I mentioned earlier in relation to the awareness of the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act. When two out of five employers do not even have a basic understanding of the act and for those who have a basic understanding it is necessary to clarify many issues, you have to ask whether greater effort needs to be put into getting across to businesses their responsibilities under the act. Clarifying parts of the act is one thing, but getting the message through to all parties is even more important.</para><para>The third change is to subsection 27(2) of the act. There is in the act an exception to the prohibition on requesting information that allows the provision of medical information concerning pregnancy. This is included for occupational health and safety reasons. I have noted that under the recommended guidelines No. 26 in the report states:</para><quote><para>... while it is appropriate to ask a pregnant job applicant to undergo a medical examination, any such medical examination should be undertaken with a view to addressing occupational health and safety concerns and should not in itself lead to, or exacerbate, discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy.</para></quote><para>It occurred to me that perhaps an additional guideline might be to restrict access to the results of medical testing where the result has no bearing on any occupational health and safety issue that may otherwise influence the employment decision. This would ensure that the employer did not discriminate against the applicant, as the decision to inform the employer of the condition would be made by the medical practitioner on the basis of occupational health and safety concerns. I would also point out that in the explanatory memorandum, in paragraph 4 of page 4, the example refers to a pregnant employer, which I take it should be a pregnant employee. </para><para>So much for what is in the bill. As I said earlier, out of 46 recommendations of the report, only three are acted upon by way of this amendment and they are Clayton's changes: they do not change the act, they only clarify sections of it. Referring only to the 11 recommendations which are the responsibility of the Attorney-General, where is the amendment to empower the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy as stated in recommendation 1? Where is the amendment to extend the coverage of the act to federal statutory employees, judicial office holders and members of parliament? Where is the amendment to ensure coverage of unpaid workers? Where is the amendment to remove the exemption of employment by an instrumentality of a state? Where is the amendment to remove the exemption contained in section 38 for educational institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy? I am happy to see the Attorney-General in the chamber now. I ask the Attorney-General: where is the amendment to the provisions in relation to the award of compensatory damages to enable the award of punitive damages?</para><para>All of these recommended amendments referring to the Attorney-General are still in limbo, sitting in the too-hard basket, waiting for another year or another Attorney-General. While we are dealing with a bill whose purpose is to clarify rather than change the act, why is it that recommendation 35 was not taken on board? In that recommendation, the report of the inquiry asked:</para><motion><para>That Attorney-General amend the <inline font-style="italic">Sex Discrimination Act 1984</inline> ... to make clear that a complaint about a discriminatory advertisement may be made under section 14(1)(a) of the Act notwithstanding that the complainant is not a person directly affected by the advertisement. </para></motion><para>While we are in the process of making amendments to clarify the act, why was that left out? This is a Clayton's amendmentâit is the amendment you have when you are not having an amendment. When you need to be seen to be doing something, this is the very least you can do. Out of 46 recommendations of the report of the National Pregnancy and Work Inquiry, the Attorney-General takes action on only three. By contrast, Labor is moving amendments to this bill which will address 10 of the recommendations which fall within the responsibility of the Attorney-General. That seems to indicate that the Attorney-General has absolutely no idea of the extent of the problem of discrimination against pregnant and potentially pregnant women.</para><para>As a crude measure of the issue we should note that in 1998 there were 249,000 live births in Australia. In that year, there were 3.73 million women in the work force. When you compare these figures with those of five years earlier in 1993, a clear picture emerges of the relationship between pregnancy and work. In 1993 there were 260,000 live birthsâthat is 11,000 more than in 1998âbut there were 3.26 million women in the work forceâthat is half a million less than in 1998. Today women make up more than 44 per cent of the work force. The images of the male as the breadwinner and the female as the homemaker have long since passed their use-by date. The average age at which a woman has her first child has increased from 26.3 years in 1985 to 28.6 years in 1995. Clearly something is happening to fertility rates and to the make-up of the work force and the two are related. The report of the National Pregnancy and Work inquiry quotes the Australian demographer Professor McDonald as saying:</para><quote><para>... if women are provided with opportunities near to equivalent to those of men in education and market employment, but these opportunities are severely curtailed by having children, then, on average, women will restrict the number of children that they have to an extent which leaves fertility at a precariously low long-term level.</para></quote><para>The report concluded that:</para><quote><para>The low fertility rate indicates a growing trend by women actually making a choice between work and family rather than seeking both. </para></quote><para>The report also quoted from a comparison of male and female managers, finding that in high technology companies two-thirds of female managers did not have children while two-thirds of male managers did. While I have drawn on this example, it is worth noting that workers in manufacturing, retail and personal services can expect the least family-friendly working conditions. All this paints a dismal background for pregnant and potentially pregnant women in the workplace. Women are showing their concern by choosing work ahead of family in increasing numbers.</para><para>I would have thought that one important thing that could be done would be to assist women to choose both family and work. One of the more obvious steps would be to address the widespread discrimination against pregnant women. For many women the answer to discrimination is: don't get pregnant. That is their choice, but it need not be. It is not by accident that Scandinavian countries have higher fertility rates than other developed nations. It takes more than the baby bonuses paid to parents who stay at homeâit takes a change of attitude in the workplace. When women are protected from discrimination they are free to choose both family and work. It will take the enforcement of standards of conduct and the education of employers and employees as well as service providers to end discrimination. This bill goes just a very short part of the way towards achieving that. Only with the adoption of the remaining recommendations of the report of the National Pregnancy and Work inquiry will we come close to achieving fairness for pregnant and potentially pregnant women. Only then can we expect the issue of declining birth rates to be addressed. Only when women can confidently plan for both a family and a career will we have reached the level of equality that women for such a long time have fought so hard to achieve.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Moylan</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>10523</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>06:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>10523</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn indulgence, Mr Speaker, I have a further update on proceedings.

Over the course of this year, while the government has been focusing on getting the bill passed, the opposition has shifted and changed its position and engaged in an exercise of rewriting history which has been second to none. In contrast to that of the opposition, the government's position on this bill has always been clear and consistent. We introduced this legislation because we believe and have always firmly believed that we need this legislation to give our intelligence agencies vital tools to deter and prevent terrorism. We have not wavered from this position and we continue to stand by it.</para><para>By contrast, the opposition has had as many different positions on the bill as there are days of the week. First they would not support the powers in the bill, despite the extensive amendments made by the government at the behest of the parliamentary joint committee, which included senior members from their own ranks. Then they sought to defer the debate on the bill to avoid taking a position, because there were significant divisions within their ranks. But, worse still, they then decided the power should be given to the police, despite the fact that the bill has nothing to do with law enforcement and everything to do with collecting intelligence. Then, sensing no doubt that the public had little time for their attempts to frustrate essential functions of the bill, they conceded that these powers should go to ASIO.</para><para>But what they propose to give ASIO is powers in a form that we say make them completely unworkable. Not only did all this toing-and-froing put the community at risk by delaying the passage of the bill but the opposition continued to seek to turn the bill into something that would not deliver the protection it was designed to achieve. I am patient, but even I reach a point at which I have to say enough is enough. For me, that point is where the bill no longer does what we have undertaken to the public that it will do, where it can no longer deliver on the promise of clearer powers to our intelligence services to gather intelligence to stop terrorist acts in circumstances where there is no acceptable alternative and where community safety is at risk.</para><para>The members opposite have preached long and hard about the things that the Labor Party will not wear. Apparently, they will not wear a system that would permit intelligence agencies to hold and question a person believed to have information about potential terrorist acts. They will not wear such intelligence gathering under a warrant issued by the Attorney-General, who is accountable to the people and the parliament and whose actions may be challenged in the courts. They will not wear a system where that warrant is approved by a federal judge or a retired judge and where the person is questioned in the presence of a senior member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a retired judge. They will not wear a system where the person questioned has the right to a security-cleared lawyer, paid for by the Commonwealth. They will not wear a system where the person can complain to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who can sit in on the questioning. And more extraordinary still, they will not wear a coercive questioning regime with detention in the strictly controlled circumstances that we propose. Yet the parliamentary joint committee had no problems with that and the member for Brand, Mr Beazley, and Senator Ray appeared to accept our position. They quite eloquently made out the case for the government's regime last night and this morning.  </para><para>Let us not forget another level of inconsistency: the Labor Party's New South Wales counterparts have given the New South Wales Police the power to strip-search children between the age of 10 and 18 without a warrant where there is the threat of a terrorist act. The New South Wales Police will be able to search a person's premises and vehicles without a warrantâI repeat, no warrant. There is also no judicial oversight as exists in the government's legislation, just the authorisation of the police minister. Federal Labor has been willing to wear this without a murmur. The government can wear the bill but not the opposition's amendments. </para><para>The opposition's amendments go to matters of fundamental principle that we cannot accept. The government will not pretend to the community that what has come out of the Senate will provide the kind of protection against terrorism that we know we need. We will not do that when we know the opposition's package of amendments effectively renders it useless in the emergency situations it is designed to address and open to challenge. The opposition has exposed itself as being hopelessly divided on this bill. The government has demonstrated time and time again our commitment to community safety, but we will not accept amendments that fundamentally change the nature of the bill. However, the government wants this vital legislation passed before Christmas. In the interests of getting the legislation through and giving the community the benefit of this protection now, we are prepared to accept two of the opposition's amendments. We do not do so lightly. The opposition has made much of the need for the inclusion of state judges as prescribed authorities. Legal advice on this point differs. However, on the basis that the opposition's advice maintains that, in the event the provision with regard to state judges is found to be unconstitutional, it would be excisable and thus would not render the entire bill unconstitutional, we are prepared to accept that provision. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>In addition, while we are firmly of the belief that the security environment we are living in is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future and that these powers will be needed for some time to come, we are prepared to accept the opposition's sunset clause on the bill. This will enable this parliament to give the community the protection it needs in the current heightened security environment, secure in the knowledge that these extraordinary powers will necessarily be revisited by the parliament in three years. These are concessions which we are prepared to make because we are committed to getting this legislation passed. We have demonstrated that commitment since the legislation was introduced. We have never wavered from that commitment. Now is the opportunity for the opposition to display a commitment to the security of the Australian people, to accept the government's offer and to support the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>07:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>10531</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt was appropriate that the last time the Attorney spoke in the House on the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> the lights went off, we went into darkness and the House had to adjourn for a short while. And I think it is indicative of the attitude in terms of some of the discussions that have taken place between this side and the governmentâthey seem not to get what we are saying; they seem to still be in the dark. It is good to see that, as the new light is dawning on this day, the government has moved some way, but they have to move a lot more. But talk about rewriting history: last night, the opposition, through the Leader of the Opposition, tabled legal advice from Dr Gavan Griffith QC, the former Solicitor-General, which showed that the amendments we proposed in relation to prescribed authority were constitutional. The government was running around saying, `We can't accept this amendment on a prescribed authority because of the danger of the constitutional problems.'</para></talk.start><para>We are still waiting to see the advice of Mr Orr. We saw a letter that was sent to Senator Faulkner, after Senator Faulkner contacted the Attorney's office and not at the time it was said to have been received, and the Attorney has a letter from Senator Faulkner, whose advice, and he said so in the Senate, was that that correspondence only arrived at approximately 1 p.m. after a phone call was made. There might have been some miscommunication, but, notwithstanding that, a letter went to the Attorney which said, `Show us the advice.' We still have not seen Mr Orr's advice, but at least the government has done the right thing and capitulated. Why has it capitulated? Because we have tabled the advice of Mr Gavan Griffith QC, and it is impeccable advice. </para><para>All the way through, with the terrorism bills and these bills, the opposition have acted responsibly. We have sought proper advice. We have a sound basis and sound principles for what we are putting to the government. What we are putting to the government, if it is accepted, will see cross-party support for these bills, as there should be. So do not talk about rewriting history. In relation to the sunset clause, the position was made very clear by the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, which unanimously recommended a sunset clause, and the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. So the government has bowed to the inevitable on that. I will talk about the other amendments when we deal with them shortly.</para><para>The government continues to go on with this nonsense. It is the government that is jeopardising the national interest. We say on this side that a workable bill has come out of the Senate. The government has come some way, but it has to keep walking. There is a long way for it to go yet before this side of the House will support an amended bill. It is absurd to suggest that the government has not known our position from day one. I have been involved in confidential discussions, and for the Attorney to say that there has been a shift in position is disingenuous. We have shown that the Senate process and the joint committee process have worked. We have involved lawyers and we have kept an open mind on this.</para><para>What we have sought to doâand so has the government, in some instances, but only in a minor wayâis to put submissions and, in the light of evidence from experts that came before the Senate committee, to move forward in our position in relation to a number of things, and the government has picked them up. I note that, in the Senate, the government has picked up a number of amendments arising out of the Senate. You cannot say that is technical and a bit of a maze, as the Attorney seeks to do in some of his press conferences and speeches, and that we are being nit-picking and pedantic. If that is the case, Michelle Grattan fingered you; you should be accepting all of the amendments. But in relation to detention as against a questioning regime, that is fundamental. I will deal with that in the next round of amendments.</para><para>We welcome the government's capitulation on these two matters. The reason we expanded the prescribed authority was that the government said it did not have enough retired judges. We were not going to have a situation where, in relation to that, the government could say that there were not enough people to serve on the prescribed authority. So we welcome the government caving in on these amendmentsâso it should. We would welcome that in relation to the other amendments, because it will give you a workable bill that has broad support across the parliament. You know it. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted) </inline>In relation to this set of amendments, we have great pleasure in supporting this position. It has been our position for some time, and the Attorney knows that.</para><para>The Attorney knows that there is no division on this side of the House in relation to the sunset clause or the prescribed authority. If anything, he should have a look at the Senate committee and joint committee reports. Members of the government, judging on the merits and not bound by their caucus room, voted for the sensible proposals in the report. So do not come in here and talk about rewriting history. I know who is rewriting history. It was not six hours ago that you were standing up and saying that, in relation to these aspects, they were non-negotiable, you were not going to move on themâthat the sky would fall in if you gave in on a sunset clause and there would be constitutional problems in relation to the prescribed authority. We nailed that pretty quickly. The other arguments are straw man arguments. I will deal with them in the near future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>07:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>10533</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicated last night when I was speaking on the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> that the Labor Party support tough legislation to counter terrorism in this country. We have always supported that and we have said so from the beginning. We have been prepared to enter the debate, consider the advice and make judgments based around itâand that is what the bill, which is continuing to come back from the Senate, is doing. I cannot understand why the government are not prepared to adopt all the amendments. There has been an indication this morning that the government are prepared to move on two amendmentsâone after we tabled advice from the former Solicitor-General, which the government now accepts. We still have not seen the government's advice as to why they were arguing unconstitutionality before. Now we have them tapping the mat on unconstitutionality.  </para></talk.start><para>Why do the government keep going to the brink but then only want to play politics? They do not want a solution; they just want to play politics. Also, we have now got them acknowledging that they will accept a sunset clause. What has taken them so long? If they are prepared to accept that this should be a bill that we trial, if you like, for the next three years, why do they not support the other amendments? It is because the other amendments go to fundamental principles. The first is that people who are being detained for questioning have access to lawyers. What is wrong with society having access to lawyers from a panel of lawyers that was recommended by a Senate committee, which members of the government agreed with? The Attorney-General is ignoring the advice coming from members of his own party, let alone the Labor Party. Why should people not be allowed to have access to lawyers if they are being detained? We accept that they should not be able to play around with the system and use it to delay. That principle has been attempted to be accommodated. It is a fundamental principle that they should have access to lawyers. Why will this government not accept that?</para><para>The second issue goes to the age at which people can be detained. Why should people aged 14 years be involved in this bill? As the member for Brand indicated, if it is a suicide bomber aged 17, you do not need this legislation; you use other legislation. Under this legislation we are talking about circumstances in which people can be taken in for questioning at the age of 14 and detained for up to seven daysâand for 48 hours they do not have access to a lawyer. How could anyone in those circumstances accept that this government is serious about dealing with principle as distinct from playing politics?</para><para>Then we have the questioning regime which they insist should enable them to question for up to seven days. Under the amendments that we have put forward, there is the ability to question for up to 20 hours. That does not mean less than a day; it means 20 hours of questioningâeight hours more than is currently provided for under the Crimes Act. We recognise that the special circumstances of this case go beyond the provisions that pertain under the Crimes Act, but that is not good enough for the government. Do not tell me that the authorities, the questioning agency and intelligence-gathering agency, ASIO, cannot get an understanding after 20 hours of questioning.</para><para>We are saying that the government has the capacity to get the bill through today. That is the challenge to the Attorney-General. Instead of coming into this place and trying to explain away his guilt in thisâhe could not even explain it at a press conference yesterday afternoonâwe say to the Attorney-General, `Change your mind and accept the amendments now' and we can have the bill through today.</para><para>That is the opportunity that faces you, Attorney. We can have this bill through before Christmasâa bill which is not just advanced by the Labor Party but supported by members of your own party. One can only assume that, if you reject this opportunity, you want to play politics with it. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> We can only assume that, if the Attorney persists with the stance he is taking now, he is playing politics with it. He is denying the opportunity for his government to give strength and power to ASIO to deal with the threat of terrorism in this country. This is a unique opportunity, as I indicated before. These are powers that do not exist in other democratic countries in the world. These are significantly enhanced powers for ASIO, which we accept in the context of the war on terror. But we are not going to compromise on the fundamental principles, and we are not going to ignore the advice that was determined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on all the evidence that came before it. </para><para>Attorney, why is it that you think you are the one who is right on this when you have been proven wrong on the unconstitutionality? The fact of the matter is that you do not have the courage to stand up to people in your own party who want to play politics with this. The people who consider the issues understand why these amendments are important. We urge you again, given that you have made the concessions on two of the points we have been arguing at length for some time, to go the extra step. Concede the extra three points, because you will have a bill before Christmasâa bill that strengthens the hand of ASIO; a bill that looks after the interests of the Australian citizens but that does not put some in jeopardy. Your legislation does. It takes away their rights. It is not fair in these circumstances.</para><para>If you think the Australian public is going to accept a position in which you deny people the right to lawyers and in which you say you need to be able to detain them for up to seven days, it will not wear it. The Australian public does want tough new powers, but it also wants the rights of its citizens protected. That is where you have to get the balance right, and the bill that has come back from the Senate gets the balance right. You want to distort the balance, and you are not doing your role or the country any service. I urge you to consider again these amendments in the interests of better powers and the protection of our citizens. Have the capacity and the decency to get the balance right rather than just play grubby politics with this bill.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>07:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>10534</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the House insists on disagreeing to amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 to 28, 30, 32 to 37, 40 to 47, 51 and 54 to 56 insisted on by the Senate.</para></motion><para>If I were to speak in support of this motion, I would simply be repeating what I have previously said.

What he said earlier was defending the indefensible. That is the truth of it, and that is why he could not get up this time and speak for another five minutes. The government's opposition to what are reasonable amendments to the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> is indefensible. If the government accept the Senate amendments, we will have legislation that ASIO can work with. What will it give them? It will give them additional powers. What have the opposition said they will do in return for bringing in a questioning regime? We have said, `Let's introduce penalties in terms of secrecy provisions.' The main thrust of the government's proposal is: we want to question for intelligence gathering. That is what they are saying. But, when you question the government further, they do not want to release people on the suspicion that they might talk to someone.</para></talk.start><para>We have come up with secrecy provisions that say, `If people leave the prescribed authority and disclose, they are liable to penalty.' That makes them no longer nonsuspects; that makes them accused who can be prosecuted, brought back in and kept in custody. We are told by the Attorney-General that he has problems with the drafting of these provisions. We have drafted them, but he says that he is not happy with them. There are number of precedents that this government can look at. The Australian Crime Commissionâthe former National Crime Authorityâand ICAC have the same provisions. That is our trade-off in relation to a questioning of the detention regime.</para><para>This is a fundamental matter of principle. As I said earlier, this is not Pinochet's Chile; this is Australia 2002. We do not pinch our citizens off the street, keep them incommunicado with no lawyers, and try to crush them by keeping them incommunicado for seven daysâthat is what you want to do. This is more than an intelligence-gathering exercise. The government say one thing but the reality is another. They want to treat people who are not accused of offencesânonsuspectsâworse than people accused of the most heinous of crimes. Under the Crimes Act, you can only keep suspects for 12 hoursâfour hours and then a further eight hours. You have to charge them or release them. Under our amendments, you can keep them for four hours plus another eight plus another eightâthat is 20 hours of pure questioning, which is more than adequate. </para><para>These powers are not available in America, the subject of a heinous terrorist attack, because their constitution prohibits it. The UK has had a bit of experience with terrorism, but these powers are not available in the UK for nonsuspects. Yet this government insists on these powers of detention for seven days. We say, `Yes, bring them in for questioning.' Neither I nor the Labor Party have any objection to people being brought in for questioning with lawyers. Our statute books have plenty of examples of that: if you are subpoenaed, you are required to attend. We also say, `If you attend under this legislation and tell lies, you are subject to five years imprisonment.'</para><para>It is absolutely indefensible for this government to maintain its opposition to what are reasonable amendments. Our track record on this is spot-on. We negotiated the terrorism bills that were first introduced into this parliament by this Attorney and this government, and we got them to a state where they were consistent with the values and the principles that we seek to defend from terrorists. You do not surrender to terrorists by, in effect, throwing out the values that we are defendingâthe presumption of innocence, the rule of law and access to a lawyer. This is not a dictatorship; this is not a fascist regime that we are defending. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The Labor Party will not support a police state, which is what this government basically want in persisting with their amendments. Judge them not on their rhetoric but on the quality of their legislation. The Intelligence Services Bill went through a committee prior to September 11, giving ASIO and the other authorities broad powers in intelligence gathering.</para><para>In relation to the incident in Bali, what happened to the terrorism bills? Proscription occurred through the UN. Those laws worked. More importantly, what the terrorists saw was a united response from our parliament. What the Labor Party are offering this government is a united response to an amended bill from the Senate. But we will not offer to surrender liberties that people went to war and died for. When my parents came to this country, they came under the Aliens Act. They were photographed, their addresses were taken and they were not allowed to move around this country, not because they were guilty of anything but because of the suspicion that people were non-white where they came from. Haven't we learnt from the mistakes of the past not to judge people on the basis of race or religion? We want to go after terrorists, not innocent citizens. What worries me is that the government says in relation to this: `We want intelligence-gathering powers, not punitive powers.' We are offering that through the amendments and the amended bill from the Senate. We are offering additional powers.</para><para>This Attorney says the bill does not go far enough. Attorney, there is an old saying: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. In this instance, the parliament is about to rise. The Labor Party will not retreat or surrender on fundamental principles in relation to this bill. We are united; we have shown that. You are defending the indefensible. It is in the national interest that you go the rest of the way with these Senate amendments, because they are offering additional powers. But what you want are repressive powers. They are not in the national interest. It is my view that you will not be able to sustain this in the public domain. Why? Because it is unreasonable. On the basic test, it is unreasonable. </para><para>I urge the government, even though it is late in the dayâit is early in the morning, but late in the day in terms of the debate on this billâto consider and reconsider what I think is a crazy position on their behalf. As has been said, and, I anticipate, will be said again in this debate, these are additional powers. The Labor Party have come a long way. I will not have it said that we have shifted and changed. We have maintained a principled position. We have sought to accommodate the reasonable requests of the government. We have listened to the experts that have come before the parliamentary committee. If you look at what we have done, you will see that we have been willing to move, because we do not want to take purely technical points. We are not taking technical points; they are fundamental. We say: after 20 hours of investigation, let them go or charge them. I commend our position to the government. Do not surrender what we are fighting forâour liberties, our values. Go forth with a bill that both sides of this parliament can agree with. I commend the amendments from the Senate. I commend members of the government who sat on the committees, who judged the terrorism bills on their merit and who support, in their reports and in what they have signed off on, all the amendments that the Labor Party is insisting on. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>07:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>10536</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis country needs the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. It needs a bill that will ensure that we have in the coming weeks and months the capacity to allow our intelligence agencies to do the very best they can in securing information from people in the community who may have a vague understanding, or even a more substantial understanding, of actions intended here or elsewhere that will take the lives of our citizens or the citizens of other countries. The bill is needed. It will not be a satisfactory outcome if we walk away at the conclusion of these proceedings without such an act.</para></talk.start><para>The Attorney-General got one thing right when he said that the Labor Party had shifted ground. Yes, we have. Many of us started off with an assumption that if these powers were to reside anywhere, they ought to reside in respect of the fully accountable and knownâin terms of the names and positionsâparticular individuals concerned in the police force. Those powers ought properly to reside with them, just as some equivalent of them resides with the New South Wales Police force, which has other strands of accountability attached to it.</para><para>We took the view that ASIO was a different sort of body and that the powers of detention, the powers of compulsory questioning and the powers, ultimately, to charge people with a failure to answer those questions and be jailed ought not properly reside within an organisation devised for different purposes. We have changed on that. We have attempted to move to the government's position so that we can get an outcome for the Australian people. That is why we have moved on thisânot because we have been confused in our objectives. Our objectives all along have been to achieve an outcome that ensures that there is some questioning of those who may have knowledge of possible terrorist acts in order that those acts may be prevented or we get the best possible particulars and information about them. That is why we have shifted. It is a reasonable thing for us to see you shift as well.</para><para>I think it is the profound conviction on this side of the House that the government do not move because they see a political advantage in not doing so. If that is the government's motive, their judgment in those areas is beginning to be shaky. Their judgment in political terms may well have been excellent in the latter parts of last year, but there is recent evidence around that if that is the motiveâa willingness to sacrifice Australian interests for political interestâit is no longer paying off as it has in the past. We witnessed that terribly last week when statements were made by the Prime Minister in regard to pre-emptive strikes, which had a major damaging effect on our capacity to mobilise the coalition we need to mobilise. Amongst the Muslim states or states with substantial Muslim minorities in our immediate region it was an ill-judged statement. I do not think that it did the Prime Minister any good, I do not think that it did the Liberal Party any good and we know for sure that it did not do the country any good. The same applies here.</para><para>Frankly, Minister, the public will not understand the differences between us. We stand here for a regime that will ensure that people can be questioned for 20 hours. In the way in which that is framed, that effectively means two to three days detention while that questioning is done. We have put forward amendments to the bill which have been carried by the Senate which ensure legal representation. You say that yours ensures legal representation as well. They will not understand the difference between us. I could go through virtually every single item of the regime. You can say the same: `Look, we do that.' We say, `We do it this way.' Frankly, there is going to be no political advantage to any particular side in the collapse of this legislation at the end of the day, though some may think there will be. There will be none. But I tell you what there will be if this bill does not go through. If this bill does not go through, an opportunity which is available to Australian security services, but not to those of our principal ally, will be lost. An essential additional component of the powers of ASIO will disappear. There will be plenty of blame to go around when that occurs, but the essence of what is needed will not take place. That essential protection will not be put in place. There will be no political gains, but there will be major security losses for the ordinary Australian. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>There is a negotiatorâthat is, Senator Faulknerâwho is authorised by the Leader of the Opposition to negotiate on the part of the Labor Party. We have had conversations. I do not want to go into the internal detail of those conversations; that would be improper. We are still interested in arriving at a position that is sensible on one particular item, as the Attorney-General knows. He has expressed concern about disallowable instruments. Senator Faulkner has indicated to him that, if something else appropriate can be put in place, he is prepared to give consideration to that. That is the bottom line. If the Attorney-General accepts that, he may not necessarily have the unanimous support of the parliament, because there are parties that do not agree with this proposition, but he will have the support of the opposition. He will have the combined support of the government and the opposition to see that this legislation goes through and gets put in place.</para><para>I appeal to the Attorney-General to rethink his position, to comprehend the extent to which we have made substantial compromises on matters of principle and direction. But there are some fundamental principles that will not be compromised. We have some fundamental concerns that we will not budge on, and they relate to the detention of children who are not suspects. That is not acceptable. As far as we are concerned, we cannot approach that situation. As for the rest of it, frankly, the regime that we put forward has additional protections that the government's does not. Those protections do not render it ineffectiveânot at all. If the Attorney-General remains convinced that they do, there is no harm, because the original legislation which was before us will not get through. </para><para>At least give this a chance to work. The Australian people need it. The Australian people are owed it. Our contemporary circumstances require it. There will in the end be no particular political advantage in us ripping each other up on this issue on the hustings. The public will see us basically in `screaming agreement' and wonder what the heck we are talking about. In those circumstances, I ask you, Attorney-General, to go away and think again. You have about half an hour before this gets back into the Senate. You have already had that conversation, as I suggested, with Senator Faulkner. I suggest that you have another one and see what you can come up with.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>07:41:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The SpeakerâMr Neil Andrew)

Every day, when I walk through the front door of my office here in Parliament House, I look at a very large photograph, which takes up most of the wall in the foyer of my office. The caption underneath it says, `Feel the power'. It is a very special and memorable photo because in 1996 the largest number of women ever were elected to the parliament on the coalition side. They numbered 25, and 25 of those women are featured in this photo. When you examine it carefully, you see that most of those women are still in the parliament and that three-quarters of them are or have been senior office holders. Four are currently serving as ministers, one in cabinet; three are former ministers; one is a government whip in this House; one is a Senate whip; and one is the retiring former President of the Senate, Margaret Reid. There is a former government whip, and there are six parliamentary secretaries and one retired parliamentary secretary. There are also many chairs of committees in that group of women. </para></talk.start><para>One of the most noticeable features of the increase in the number of women in parliament on both sides is the number of young women who have successfully combined pregnancy and motherhood with their work in the parliament and in their electorates. I highlight this because it is a wonderful example of women who work in a very demanding environment being very effective representatives and combining pregnancy and child rearing with their careers. Tonight, a lot of us have been going about our work for about 24 hours. We have had a young woman here in the chamber over the course of this night: Jackie Kelly, a parliamentary secretary and the member for Lindsay. She is a very good example of somebody who has had, and continues to have, a very successful career as a member of parliament and yet, over the course of her service to this parliament thus far, she has had and is raising two young children. I think that is a wonderful inspiration for many women, and for many young women in particular.</para><para>The fact that we have to have legislation to protect women with respect to the subject of this bill, which is pregnancy and work, demonstrates that we still have a very long way to go to change some people's perception of the ability and suitability of pregnant women to take part in the work force.</para><para>It has been 15 years since the Sex Discrimination Act was introduced, and it is evident that the operation of the act in relation to pregnant and potentially pregnant women is still not well understood. I have to say that black-letter law is always very helpful in bringing about change but, in itself, it does not. I know that the member for Fowler was very critical of aspects of this amendment, yet I think that it is practical. It goes to the heart of the problem. It is about changing people's perception. That means educating, encouraging. It is not one of those things where you can jackboot people into making the mental shifts that are necessary if we are going to move ahead on this issue.</para><para>There are few exceptions where pregnant women or women likely to become pregnant could be put at risk. That is an old argument that has been put for many years. In fact, we saw the member for Lindsay, when she was Minister for Sport and Tourism, argue this case for women in the sporting arena in the very public dispute over women netballers. We have had a lot of discussion about whether it is safe for women to work in certain occupations when they are pregnant, and I think that it has been demonstrated that there are very few jobs that women cannot do and very few activities that women cannot participate in when they are pregnant. This bill makes provision for employers to take this into account without any risk of breach of sex discriminationâthat is, the odd occasion, the odd exception, is allowed for, but there are very few of those.</para><para>This amendment had its origins in a report to government in 1999, the report of the national pregnancy and work inquiry, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</inline>. We have come a long way since the days when women were discriminated against in the work force because they married. That was something that was very common when I was a young woman and about to enter the work force. We all knew that we were only there, in some sectors of business and in the Public Service, as long as we remained single. The Public Service and many private organisations and companies had a policy of women not being able to return to their jobs once they were marriedâand certainly not when they were pregnant. However, the level of complaints in relation to pregnant and potentially pregnant women is still high, indicating that there remain cultural and attitudinal problems in respect of this matter. </para><para>In light of the level of complaints, the Commonwealth Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams, referred this national inquiry to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under the auspices of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in August 1998. The act provides the framework for the investigation and conciliation of complaints of unlawful acts of discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy, potential pregnancy, sexual harassment and dismissal on the grounds of family responsibilities. The reason for the inquiry was that, in the calendar year 1997, 14.7 per cent of all complaints accepted under the Sex Discrimination Act that proceeded to conciliation included an allegation of discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy. By May 1999, at the commencement of this inquiry, that figure had risen to 17.4 per cent. Discrimination was evident across all employer groups, including private and public sector workplaces. This was the first national inquiry into pregnancy and potential pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. </para><para>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission consulted widely with individuals, employees, employers, employer organisations, trade unions and others. I think it is enormously important that wide-ranging consultations take place so that we can get the best idea of what is going on in the workplace and how we can best put some proposals together to stop that practice. Anecdotal evidence indicated that discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and potential pregnancy was much higher than the official figures. Many cases were mediated by parties other than HREOC and were therefore not included in the official complaints figures.</para><para>As a participant in the UN women's conference in Beijing in 1997, I became acutely aware of the level of discrimination against women in the workplace across the world. It is an international problem. Under the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the foundation principle is that discrimination against women violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity. It is an obstacle to the participation of women on equal terms with men in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their countries. It hampers the growth of prosperity of society and the family, and makes more difficult the full development of the potentialities of women in the service of their countries and humanity. Australia is a signatory and has obligations under that convention. These obligations involve governments ensuring that they do what they can to eliminate the prejudices and the customs that give rise to a notion that women are inferior to men.</para><para>I was pleased recently to be a guest of the Chinese government and the China Society for Human Rights Study to talk about issues of human rights. People representing far continents were there, and we talked about what are human rights. Human rights are about human dignity. It is important for women and men, in fact, to have the dignity that comes from having a place in the work force. We discussed how sometimes customs and cultural backgrounds can be an impediment to providing real human rights and not stripping people of their dignity. Sometimes the prejudices are hidden behind what some people see as customs and culture. That is unfortunate because it is very difficult then for people to move forward and to allow others to have dignity.</para><para>Going back to the national pregnancy and work inquiry report, I was pleased to read the comments of the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. We have been in this place for a long time and I do not recall it being mentioned, but one of the earlier speakers on this bill tonight was rather critical of the business sector in relation to women in the work force. It was raised in the context of paid maternity leave. To balance that and to be fair, yes, there are some employers and employer groups who are sometimes not terribly supportive of making it easier for women to enter the work force and to balance family responsibilities with their paid work. On the other hand, as I said, I was pleased to read the comments of the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry in their submission to the inquiry. I had something to do with the Queensland chamber when I was shadow minister for women and, later, minister for women. In their submission they said: </para><quote><para>As Australian businesses expand both nationally and internationally, there has been a need for companies to be more competitive. Being competitive does not mean just from an economic perspective but also in terms of how the company is perceived. ... By adopting family friendly policies and complying with legislative requirements with respect to discrimination, businesses are indicating the importance of these issues. ... It is important to businesses, especially on an international level to show that they are complying with these Conventions, not just for their own public image reasons.</para></quote><para>So, to be fair, many business leaders and businesses in our country are very supportive of making it easier for women to juggle their paid work and family responsibilities. The Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry gave good reasons why providing equal opportunity in the workplace for men and women makes good economic sense.</para><para>In responding to the report, the government expressed its preference for a policy of education, guidance and raising awareness as the most effective way to promote the protection of the rights of individuals and equality of opportunity. The member for Fowler was somewhat critical. I do not think that is justified, because the government response to this has been to ensure that there is development and distribution of pregnancy guidelines by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is enormously important that we try to work closely with employers to ensure that they understand what is required of them. This makes it much easier for them to move forward and it can avoid protracted legal cases, which are not always useful.</para><para>The government has proposed these amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act to clarify that discrimination on the grounds of breastfeeding is prohibited, as is asking questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy at job interviews, and that information about pregnancy gathered from medical examinations may not be used for discriminatory purposes. Finally, a very important part of what the government is trying to achieve with these amendments is to make occupational health and safety information relating to pregnancy available to the public to raise awareness in the workplace. A lot of the measures in the amendments to this bill are very sensible, and they will help a great deal with some of the problems that have become evident in this report.</para><para>As some of my colleagues have already highlighted, prejudice against pregnancy in the workplace is just one of many challenges for governments and the community to deal with. There is also a vigorous debate taking place about the merits of introducing paid maternity leave. One of the critical issues for women wanting to raise a family and to continue in the work force is the availability of high quality affordable child care, including care outside school hours. I was interested to listen to the speech given by my good colleague the member for Petrie on the amendment to this bill today because she raised some issues about child care. I know that, as I have, she has had the experience of juggling work and family responsibilities without always having the support of a partner.</para><para>It is difficult for many women. Narrowing the solution down to a maternity leave allowance for 14 weeks, or some other period, will not really solve the bigger problem for many women and families who are trying to juggle work and family responsibilities. This debate needs to be wider than it currently is and to take in this issue of child careânot just for children who are very young but also for children who are going to school. We need to make sure high quality outside school hours care is available and affordable. That is critical to women being able to continue moving forward in their careers in the paid work force while juggling this with the important role of raising a family.</para><para>Many schemes have been discussed over the years and there have been many debates on how to achieve a balance between work and family responsibilities. It is something that Mr Howard recognised when he first came into this place as Prime Minister. I remember launching our policies and hearing him talk with considerable understanding about the tension that exists in balancing work and family responsibilities. Any of us who have gone through that experience know that he is absolutely right: there is a tension there. It is the challenge of the 21st century to ensure that we can balance the work and family responsibilities of men and women. </para><para>But that is a debate for another day. We are here now to discuss the amendment to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002. It will clarify provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act that protect pregnant, potentially pregnant and breastfeeding women from discrimination. The Attorney has introduced this bill. He introduced it in September 2001, however, when the last election was called, and the bill lapsed. I am very pleased to see it returned to this chamber for debate. I am sure that all of the women in this place, and certainly the women in the community, will be very pleased when the bill is passed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>08:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>10543</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI hope my voice holds for the time that is available to contribute to this debate on the <inline ref="R1443">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002</inline>. It is an incredibly important debate. The member for Pearce is absolutely right to argue that we need to see the dynamics of the work and family interrelationship in a much broader context. That is one of the reservations I have about the bill that has come before us: in my judgment it is a very limited, narrow and inadequate response to what was really quite a significant national report. Due credit must be given to the then Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Susan Halliday, who did a great job consulting with people, recording real life experiences and making, in all, about 46 recommendations, of which only three have been picked up by the government in the bill before us.</para></talk.start><para>A lot of women were concerned about the length of time that it took from the presentation of the report to the Attorney-General back in June 1999 to the parliament actually giving full and proper consideration to the issues contained within it. In essence, the report found that erroneous tactics and exploitative practices were continuing, despite the advances that we all thought we had made in this area, and that these practices were being utilised to remove pregnant women from the workplace or to deny pregnant or potentially pregnant women access to equal employment opportunities.</para><para>I was fortunate enough to be at the launch of the report. Some of the case studies in the report were quite horrific. I have been lucky enough to work in situations where both direct and indirect practices of discrimination, by and large, had been eliminated. But she did refer to cases, for example, where women miscarried because they were not allowed to sit down at work, where men were sacked for attending their baby's birth, and where women were harassed about their appearance or removed from front desk work. In one very horrendous caseâreferred to earlier this evening by the member for Bartonâa woman working in a car factory was denied a chair despite the fact that she was bleeding and in severe pain. She collapsed at work when she was seven months pregnant, and the baby was born prematurely with an underdeveloped heart.</para><para>It was quite shocking to read these case studies and to comprehend the fact that, even though we thought at the theoretical level that things had really improved for women, for many womenâparticularly in the blue-collar areasâlife had changed very little. The rhetoric of equal employment opportunity had not in reality made their working lives and conditions that much better. To that extent it is disturbing that the government appear to lots of women to be sitting on their hands and not properly responding to the breadth of the issues and the diversity of the recommendations made in that report.</para><para>I think the bill is a totally inadequate response. It has only taken up three of the 40-odd recommendations. The ones that have been picked up by the government really only go to the clarification of existing provisions of the act. They concern the asking of questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy, the use of pregnancy related medical information and whether breastfeeding is grounds for discrimination on the basis of sex. The minister, in his second reading speech, said the following, and this confirms what I believe are the limitations of the response:</para><quote><para>... the bill does not expand the operation of the act, but greatly improves, simplifies and clarifies important provisions of the act that provide protection from unlawful discrimination for pregnant, potentially pregnant and breastfeeding women. </para></quote><para>Of course, the Labor response is to welcome those developments, although we see them as inadequate. I think that the amendments that have been moved by the member for Barton pick up a number of significant and glaring omissions in the government's to date limited response. I am hoping that the minister will give serious consideration to the range of amendments that we have proposed.</para><para>I want to take the opportunity in the time that I have to refute the statement made by the minister in his second reading speech, in which he argued:</para><quote><para>Once again, practical and concrete steps are being taken by this government to remove sex based workplace discrimination and to improve the lives of working women ... </para></quote><para>We find a lot of generalised statements being made by this government about their alleged understanding and empathy with the issues that confront women at work and a perception that they are really involved in trying to do something meaningful about the work and family interface. I want to argue that the rhetoric and the reality for women and for menâbut predominantly for women, who continue to bear the major responsibility for family and childrenâare in fact miles apart.</para><para>Whilst the government have been sitting on this report and failing to respond, the numbers of women who continue to make complaints to HREOC, claiming discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy, has jumped by almost 150 per cent. The number of women, according to the annual report, making formal complaints soared from 86 in 2000-01 to 212 in 2001-02. Pregnancy discrimination has jumped from 16 per cent of previous sex discrimination cases to 30 per cent this year. That is probably a good thing, because it means people are more intent on asserting their rights under the law and seeking redress. </para><para>I want to give you a couple of examples of what continues to occur in our workplaces and about which the government is saying or doing very little. I cite a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> where a couple of case studies were given. A clerk claimed she was told by her supervisor to have an abortion after finding out she was pregnant soon after joining a real estate firm. She insisted she did not know she was pregnant when she took the job. She refused to have an abortion and was sacked. After conciliation, she was reinstated and paid $4,000 in damages. A casual worker with a government department was told she could not breastfeed or express milk at work, or take her baby to the office. After conciliation, the department changed its policy and paid her $1,200. An import and wholesale company refused to provide a full-time administrative assistant with light duties, insisting she carry on lifting and carrying, despite doctor's orders. She received $9,000 after conciliation. The point I am making is that the horrific stories that were first revealed by Susan Halliday in that really wonderful report continue to occur, and this is three or four years after her initial report. Things are not improving out there in the real world where discrimination on the grounds of sex and on the grounds of pregnancy appears to be continuing unabated.</para><para>We hear a lot of rhetoric from the government regarding the balance between work and family life. I think the member for Pearce was absolutely right in that the bill that we are looking atâand hopefully the amendments that the government will see fit to supportâare very restricted. We need to focusâand I am very confident that our party will in the new yearâon the kind of broad dimensions of that interface between work and family life.</para><para>I am pleased that the Prime Minister appears to have become a latter-day convert to feminism. I had always thought that his views of the world were very much predicated on the stereotype of the family behind the white picket fence, but his recent comments in this House give me some hope that perhaps attitudes are changing. They need to change very quickly because our society is changing very quickly. The proportion of couples with children where both partners work has risen from 44 per cent just a couple of decades ago to 62 per cent of the work force in 2000. So 62 per cent of couples who have children are in the work force. This figure really surprised me: more than halfâ51.3 per centâof new mothers in two-parent families are back at work when the child is between one and two years of age. </para><para>Two decades ago you probably could have argued that most women returned to work when the child was around preschool age, four or five; but the pattern now is one where large numbers of women return to work when the child reaches the age of one or two. I guess a lot of these younger women are part of generation X, which does not want to make a choice between family and career but wants to have society cope with their aspirations to combine the best of both. There are lots of women who want the option of having a career and children, and the statistics indicate that a lot of them are doing it with virtually no time off from their careers and no time at home in the early periods of their children's development.</para><para>I was disappointed but not really surprised to hear what the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said on a recent <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program. It reinforced a lot of things that the minister is prone to generalise about. In reference to a question he was asked about the issue of work and family life and maternity leave, he said something to the effect: `Yes, it is an issue but it is an issue that really has to be determined by individuals. Governments cannot legislate one-size-fits-all.' On this side of the chamber we agree that governments cannot provide `one size fits all' solutions, but governments are here, surely, to make a difference to the standard of living and the quality of life of the people we are elected to represent.</para><para>I think it is a total cop-out to transfer the onus for balancing work and family life onto individuals as if we, as people who legislate on their behalf, cannot do things that can make a material and significant improvement to that very important balance. As we all know, the difficulties for women are many. There are a growing number of difficulties because many women are precariously employed, and if you are a casual worker or a worker on an individual contract of employment you really have no bargaining power to effect family friendly policies at your workplace. A recent article that was prepared by our shadow minister for workplace relations pointed to the fact that under this government, despite the rhetoric of their so-called commitment to the balance, even where there were collective agreementsâassuming some level of union involvement, or at least that the work force was organised and women had some chanceâwomen were going backwards. So it was not just those who were precariously employed but often workers with secure employment, covered by collective agreements, who were finding their conditions deteriorating and not improving.</para><para>I would like to go to a couple of examples of the work that has been undertaken by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The work showed in fact that, under this government, there has been a decrease in the percentage of collective agreements containing flexible starting and finishing times, a decrease in the percentage of collective agreements providing for family and carer's leave, a decrease in the percentage of collective agreements providing for paid maternity leave, a decrease in the percentage of collective agreements providing for home based work, and no growth in the percentage of collective agreements containing flexible annual leave, paid family leave, regular part-time work or family responsibility provisions and child-care provisions. What it found was that, as we all know, there had been an explosion in the percentage of collective agreements providing for insecure forms of employment such as contract labour and casual labour.</para><para>When this government goes around expressing and professing sympathy and commitment to family friendly policies, with people believing that they understand the importance of work and family interface, then I think these people would do well to look beyond the cloak of the rhetoric and see what is actually occurring under this government, because the picture is one of regression and not one of progress. In that context, I think it is important to draw on the government's own reports and evidence to support our contention that the government needs to move at a much faster rate to make the kind of necessary adjustments and provide the supportive environment and frameworks so that working peopleâthe two-income couples, with both people in the work force, that are now the normâcan access family friendly arrangements and make their lives easier to balance. </para><para>With those general remarks, I want to commend the amendments that have been prepared by our shadow ministers. I think they do what the member for Pearce was urgingâthat is, to see the whole debate in a much broader context. I am very disappointed with the government's response. As the member for Fowler described it, we had a very pregnant pause while waiting for the bill to come before this chamber. I think the bill is very narrowâit is very restricted and limited.</para><para>I also wanted to take this opportunity to put on the public record the views of many women in Australia who would want to commend the former Sex Discrimination Commissioner for the groundbreaking work that she did. I think we all marvelled at the fact that a woman appointed under the Howard government to that very important position was able to bring these very serious issues of concern to the public's attention. I regret very much that the Attorney-General and the government did not see their way clear to renew her tenure in that position, because I think she would have continued to make very significant contributions to public policy about very important issues that confront each and every one of us when we go back to our electorates. In conclusionâand I am glad my voice has held upâI ask the government to give serious consideration to the very sensible amendments that have been moved by our shadow minister, amendments that pick up a lot of the recommendations where the bill is found wanting in terms of the proposals that would give true expression to a very significant piece of work undertaken by HREOC.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>08:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>10546</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhilst I rise in support of the <inline ref="R1443">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002</inline>, like the member for Throsby I am disappointed that the bill goes nowhere near far enough. The bill amends the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to implement only three of the 46 recommendations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report, <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</inline>. The amendments in this bill clarify three areas: whether discrimination against breastfeeding women is a ground of sex discrimination; the asking of questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy during job interviews; and the use of information obtained in medical examinations.</para></talk.start><para>The length of time the government has taken to adopt these recommendations is an indication of what little regard it has for women in the paid work force. The HREOC report was released in August 2000. The government responded to the recommendations in November 2000. But here we are, almost two years later, finally trying to implement only three of the 12 recommendations to amend the Sex Discrimination Act. The amendments contained in the pregnancy at work bill are welcome but they do not go far enough nor address the entirety of the report.</para><para>One of the key premises of the HREOC report is that post pregnancy issues, such as breastfeeding, are central to sex discrimination. In their submission to the HREOC inquiry, the Women's Electoral Lobby said: </para><quote><para>Pregnancy is a workplace issue that starts well before conception and ends long after birth. It is impossible to separate pregnancy and family responsibilities.</para></quote><para>The fact that this bill does not amend the Sex Discrimination Act to cover breastfeeding as a ground of unlawful discrimination is extremely disappointing.</para><para>The government's position is in stark contrast to Labor's. We have moved amendments to cover breastfeeding as a ground of unlawful discrimination as well as having previously introduced a private member's bill to this effect. You have to ask: what is the government's problem here? It is that it has a limited understanding of the lives of women. In relation to women in the paid work force, the government has dismissed the importance of paid maternity leave, calling it `middle class welfare'; taken no action on the specific disadvantage faced by women in accumulating superannuation; and ignored the chronic shortage of child-care places in outer urban and regional cities such as in my electorate, Ballarat. </para><para>I was very pleased to hear the member for Pearce raise the issue of child care in the context of this debate. I must admit I was somewhat surprised that she raised this issue, given that day after day in question time we hear the minister responsible saying what a fantastic job this government has done with child care and out of school hours care. The issue of access to affordable child care is one that we feel very deeply about in my electorate. We have over 100 families on child-care waiting lists, and many women and men are unable to accept positions and participate fully in the community because they cannot access child careâboth long day care and out of school hours care. The government has consistently refused to do anything about this and fails women and families on these issues.</para><para>I take this opportunity to examine why the legislation is necessary in the first place. According to HREOC, 18 per cent of complaints received by them in the years 1999 to 2000 concerned alleged discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or potential pregnancy. We heard from the member for Throsby that it looks like this percentage has increased in the intervening period. These figures are only the tip of the iceberg, as many complaints simply go unreported. Consultations during the commission's inquiry into pregnancy and work showed that harassment and inappropriate behaviour towards pregnant employees were not uncommon. According to the commission, discrimination included: constant references to the pregnancy, touching of employees' stomachs, badgering about the ability to cope with the workload, or constant questioning of pregnant employees about whether they really intended to return to work.</para><para>The discrimination was often subtle and not ill intentioned. But the consistent message from pregnant employees was that they found it demeaning, and it made it difficult for them to feel valued in their work environment while pregnant. They felt they did not receive equal treatment in relation to recruitment and promotion processes. According to the commission, 54 per cent of women in one study believed that their careers had been affected by taking maternity leave, a further 44.1 percent said their salaries had stalled, 34 per cent believed their careers had taken a backward step and 29.9 per cent said they had sacrificed their careers to give birth.</para><para>There appears to be a comparatively low awareness of pregnancy discrimination laws in comparison to antidiscrimination laws. The commission's development of pregnancy guidelines was a welcome step towards assisting employers and employees to develop a more family-friendly workplace. Figures from 1999 saw 3.8 million women employed and 257,394 live births recorded in Australia. The average age of women at the birth of their first child was 27.1 years, which is also the age of greatest career progression and when women are entering their prime earning years. Increasing numbers of women are putting off having children, in many cases due to work pressures and the expectation that women will have the primary role in child care. Families, and particularly women, have increasingly complex lives. Women are managing family responsibilities and paid work, they are often caring for older family members, they are heavily involved in their children's schooling and they participate in a broad range of community activities. For many women in my electorate, child-care arrangements alone are a logistic nightmare. </para><para>Governments need to understand that the current low fertility rate and the decisions women are taking to put off having children indicate a growing trend by women to make a choice between work and family rather than to seek both. HREOC argues that such choices are still necessary because of the failure of workplace practices to accommodate the realities of pregnancy and family responsibilities. It is for this reason that Labor have committed to paid maternity leave as one plank of balancing work and family policy. We are extremely conscious that any such plan must not place an impost on small business, but it is a policy whose time has well and truly come. So important is this issue  that  motherInc  has  conducted  a widespread community survey on www.motherInc.com.au to keep the issue of paid maternity leave on the national agenda. Recommendations 44, 45 and 46 of the commission's report relate to paid maternity leave. The report recommended that the government undertake economic modelling and analysis of paid maternity leave options, and called on the government to encourage broad debate. I am very pleased to see Pru Goward reporting this week on paid maternity leave. It took us a while, but we are getting there. </para><para>The government has given mixed signals on paid maternity leave and seems to view it as an exclusive benefit for women who work in large companies and government departments, but women who work in small to medium enterprises and in low-paid and casual jobs can basically go hang. The government's only answer to family policy has been the baby bonus, which, as women are now discovering as they try to access it, is minimal and skewed towards women on higher incomes. The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002 addresses some of the problems pregnant employees experience. However, I again highlight the comments of many of the groups who participated in the pregnancy and work inquiry: pregnancy is a workplace issue that starts well before conception and continues well after the birth of a child. The issue of access to child-care places is critical to balancing family and work. I reiterate comments made in my first speech to this parliament when I said that the government's market based child-care policies are not working in outer metropolitan and regional Australia, and the government must act urgently to address the situation. In conclusion, while I support the amendments contained in the bill, the government should support all the changes to the law and take other actions to give effect to the full recommendations of the HREOC report <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant.</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>08:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10548</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn rising to speak on the <inline ref="R1443">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002</inline>, I have to say I never believed I or my colleagues would be here, in the House, for so long. In my case it has been 25Â¼ hours since I walked inâand we are still going in debate with the House not stopping. Nevertheless, I welcome the bill before the House because I believe it is thoroughly overdue. This legislation is a step in the right direction, but we as legislators must be forceful in our endeavours to create a society that accepts that it is now a given that women can work if they choose as well as have children and raise a family.</para></talk.start><para>Legislation which protects pregnant women from discrimination is long overdue. The government should have given this legislation the priority it deserves rather than delayed it to such a late time in the parliamentary cycle. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and Productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</inline> has been published and on the public record for a number of years. The HREOC report identified three areas of sex discrimination in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 which were not clearly identified by employers and employees and which required clarification, and this legislation attempts to address that. The areas referred to by HREOC relate to whether discrimination against breastfeeding women is a ground for sex discrimination, the asking of questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy during job interviews and the use of information obtained in medical examinations. The HREOC report recommended that the act be amended to clarify the points raised, hence the debate we are now having on this legislation.</para><para>It is completely unacceptable in the 21st century that there is evidence which suggests that women who are pregnant or considering having children will suffer disadvantage and discrimination in our society. Women in Australia have fought many long and hard battles to overcome the barriers which prevented them from having equal status in Australian society. Historically, Australia has been the leading advocate for women's rights. We were one of the first countries to provide women with the right to vote. Notably, South Australia provided their women with the right to vote in the late 19th century. We were one of the first countries to enable women to run for public office, with Dorothy Tangney and Edith Cowan notable pioneers. In New South Wales, men had a propensity to dominate the political spectrum, for it took over 130 years before a woman became a minister in that stateâand I know what I am talking about because I was that woman. </para><para>The Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which was legislated by the Hawke Labor government, is the benchmark regarding the legislating against discriminatory practices in Australia. However, the HREOC report made a number of recommendations to further strengthen it in an attempt to prevent the still widespread discrimination against women in the workplace. It is pertinent to ask why the government has decided not to implement all the recommendations of the HREOC report. </para><para>Let us look at the recommendations that the government will not implement. They are numerous. I would like to mention just a few of them, because I believe they are very important and that they should have been included in this bill. Those I was concerned about that have not been mentioned would empower HREOC to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy, and would ensure coverage of unpaid workers. They would ensure that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations specifically consider the position of pregnant and potentially pregnant employees in any future workplace relations reform, to ensure that such employees are not exposed to the possibility of direct or indirect discrimination, and that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Office of the Employment Advocate ensure information is available to all workplace participants in relation to their rights and responsibilities in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 awards. Also, in relation to making certified agreements or Australian Workplace Agreements, the Office of the Employment Advocate would be required to collect and regularly publish information about the provisions in AWAs concerning pregnancy and maternity issues, and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner would be able to refer discriminatory awards or agreements to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on their own initiative. </para><para>They are not what I would describe, from reading just a few of those, as hard amendments to implement. Yet the government has not attempted to do that in this legislation. Those I have mentioned are just some of the 46 recommendations of the report. However, this legislation embraces only three. This is a very tepid approach to improving the rights of women to have careers and to even think about starting a family at the same time. What this government does not understand is that this is a fundamental human right. The recommendations I quoted would go at least some of the way to changing the culture in the workplace that discriminates against women and their families, but we know a number of the ministers in the government feel no compunction to change this culture. I note that only one of our male counterparts has taken part in this debate.</para><para>Another example I have championed for a number of years is the government's refusal to sign the optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Womenâor CEDAW, as we refer to it. I have previously spoken in this House to deplore the government's contemptuous approach to this vital element in improving the human rights of women by strengthening international law. I would also like to state that I have asked the minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Womenâin fact, it is question No. 1156 on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>âwhy the government still refuses to sign the optional protocol, considering that 75 states have now signed and, of those, 47 have ratified it. I also note that the government has not been a member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women since 1996. This is in stark contrast to the activist role the Hawke and Keating governments played in that commission.</para><para>Signing the optional protocol would have been a gesture to confirm that Australia is indeed a country with an undeniable and firm commitment to the rejection of all forms of discrimination against women, wherever and whenever they occur. Instead, the government refuses to sign for, I suspect, no more valid reason than to pander to the interests of the far Right and hence undermine the functions of the United Nations. During the 13 years Labor was in power, from 1983 to 1996, Australia developed a reputation as a leader in the areas of antidiscrimination and human rights. This was particularly due to the active diplomatic agenda of Gareth Evans. Australia signed and ratified CEDAW, and in 1995 the Keating government was active in negotiations to create the optional protocol the Howard government now refuses to sign. I believe the government's refusal to support women's rights on the international stage and this rather flimsy attempt we have before us to improve discrimination provisions show quite explicitly that, regardless of its rhetoric about supporting families and enunciating polices that are pro-family, the government has absolutely nothing to back up that rhetoric. </para><para>Paid maternity leave is something that the Labor party supports and that the government has dithered over. The Prime Minister, we know, is against the proposal but is playing a game of public relations semantics at the moment, designed to placate some of his would-be loyal constituents on this issue. We remain the only party in the House with a firm commitment to universal paid maternity leave and we intend to create a partnership with business, unions and the community to determine a funding model. Labor has made exceptions for small businesses in many of our policies. They include my private member's bill, which protects 100 per cent of workers' entitlements, introduced now for the fifth time. Unlike the government's scheme it makes a firm commitment to protecting 100 per cent of our workers' entitlements, and that certainly includes our women workers.</para><para>Protection of workers' entitlements is something the workers of Australia are waiting to see, and the women of Australia are waiting for a government that is genuinely committed to enforcing the right of women to work and have a family. The Labor Party has always prided itself on being a reformist party, and this area of socioeconomic policy is crying out for somebody to take the bull by the horns and bring the current mentality into the 21st century. One business has been quite groundbreaking in its policy towards paid maternity leave: Westpac. As reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 10 May 2002, Westpac introduced paid maternity leave in 1995. At that time the retention rate of female employees was 54 per cent. By 2000 the retention rate at Westpac had increased to 93 per cent. In other words, the rate had almost doubled. This is a success story. It shows that businessâif it is, firstly, socially responsible and, secondly, business savvyâcan incorporate paid maternity leave and ensure the business is able to grow.</para><para>Conversely, I know of a case involving another large financial institution. I will not name them here, but I can if that is requested. A senior female employee, who had been highly successful and beneficial to the company, went on the standard 12 weeks maternity leave. During that time she asked the company if she could return to work on a part-time basis, considering she had just had her second childâthe first was only a toddler. The type of work she did meant that quite a bit of it could have been done at home. The company decided to put the blowtorch onto her. Again, this was a women who had given a number of years of outstanding commitment and service, and who had risen through the ranks because of her talents and ability. She was now being pressured to return full-time or contemplate the alternative, which was, obviously, resignation. After she received outside advice on her rights the pressure was turned back on her employer and, fortunately for all involved, a compromise was reached. But why should talented women have to go through this because they have a family?</para><para>In another case I am aware ofâagain, I could reveal the detailsâa loyal and hardworking employee has been working in a multinational company for eight years, is now pregnant and is attempting to negotiate a package involving maternity leave. She has offered to do one day per week of work from home during that periodâwhich she now does on the weekends anywayâbut that is not good enough for the company. They appear to be absolutely flummoxed as to why one of their employees would even want to become pregnant. This is a case which occurred in today's Australia. There are countless cases of some form of discrimination or other against pregnant women in the workplace; and I will go to some more well-known cases on the public record later. </para><para>The day before yesterday, Pru Goward, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, released a report titled <inline font-style="italic">A time to value: proposal for a national paid maternity leave scheme</inline>. In that report Ms Goward recommended that paid maternity leave be funded by the federal government and provided to women at the birth of a child. I note that Ms Goward also recommended that this apply to all women in paid work for 40 of the 52 weeks before the birth of the child, and that they receive $431 a week for 14 weeks. This amount is in line with the federal minimum wage. It is interesting that Ms Goward has recommended that paid maternity leave be for a duration of 14 weeks. Why I state this point is that the government has refused to ratify the revised Maternity Protection ConventionâILO No. 183âof June 2000, which calls for a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave. So every OECD country has agreed to 14 weeks paid maternity leave, except Australia and the United States.</para><para>Again, this is an example of this government knowing of no other way than to follow, without question, whatever the United States does. I know the government believes that everything that comes out of the United States is gospel, but let us look at some of the problems that American women are having. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, in her article, `Executive Women and the Myth of Having It All' published in the <inline font-style="italic">Harvard Business Review</inline>, provides a very interesting synopsis on women, particularly successful professionals who are forced to make life choices. The disturbing point that Hewlett makes is that the typical female professional in midlife has `not made a choice but a creeping non-choice' to, firstly, not be able to find a partner due to the incredibly long hours they are forced to work to maintain their career and, secondlyâdue to thisâto have no children. According to Hewlett, this affects one-third of professional women in the 41 to 55 age bracket. This rises to 42 per cent in the corporate sector.</para><para>This example is from the United States but things are quite similar back home in Australia. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>by Jane Cadzow on 17 August 2002 illustrated a totally awful situation where a corporate lawyer in Sydney went through labour throughout a telephone conference with colleagues overseas. This conference began at 10 p.m.âan ungodly hour, I believe, to begin a meeting; but this is what is expected in the professional world, even when you are nine months pregnant. She gave birth to a daughter by emergency caesarean at 4:15 the next morning after taking a cab by herself to the hospital. Not once during the meeting did she let on to her colleagues the extreme discomfort that she was in for fear of being snubbed. Within hours of giving birth, she was asking her secretary to supply her with her emails; again, this was due to fear. This is a horrific example. To think that a woman in this day and age has to go through this just to maintain her career is something that society should be ashamed of.</para><para>If professional women have problems, what about workers that are in jobs at the lower end of the economic spectrum? These women are, arguably, less able to combat discriminative employers, and I would suggest that much harassment is not even reported. However, it would appear that the campaign maintained to educate women on their rights is showing some signsâI am pleased to sayâof getting through to our communities at large. According to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph </inline>of 29 October 2002, the number of women claiming that they have been discriminated against on the grounds of pregnancy has increased by nearly 150 per cent between the years 2000-01 and 2001-02. In terms of numbers, it went from 86 to 212. Again, I doubt that this is anywhere near the number of actual discriminatory events; however, it is a positive sign that women are becoming more aware of their rights and that some are being empowered to challenge discrimination.</para><para>Unfortunately, we still have a long battle to win when you have the barbaric example of a young clerk in a real estate firm being told, after she fell pregnant, that she should have an abortion. I cannot even believe that we have such low-lifes out there who are so callous that they would treat a human being in that way. The government appears quite prepared to protect people of such base mentality running a business, but it is not fully prepared to assist hardworking and honest young women to combine work and family life. </para><para>The government constantly espouses the rhetoric of being pro-family. Their record in this area and in other areas like child care prove the opposite. And public comments by leading ministers, including the Prime Minister, show that they are in no hurry to begin real reform and incorporate the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's and, might I add, Labor's proposal for paid maternity leave. The Prime Minister has stated in the near past that he is none too enthusiastic about the proposal for paid maternity leave. He stated on Melbourne radio station 3AW on 18 April 2002 that:</para><quote><para>If you are to impose it on employers, that will actually discriminate against some women because there could well be fewer women employees, no matter what sex discrimination laws might say because many small firms just won't be able to afford it.</para></quote><para>Is the Prime Minister condoning discrimination? I mean that is the essence of this government. It claims to be reformist but it does nothing to assist in areas where governments have a responsibility to be proactive and lead the community. Instead, the government is quite content to let the law of the jungle take precedence and, after some of the cases I have presented today, it is not just an analogy but an actuality. Other ministers, such as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, have stated that there is no way that employers should pay, and his counterpart, Senator Minchin, refuses to countenance the proposal of the taxpayer funding paid maternity leave, claiming that it is `middle-class welfare'âa contemptuous do-nothing approach.</para><para>Labor have not indicated that businesses should solely foot the bill for paid maternity leave. We believe that it is a shared responsibility which we have made a commitment to achieving. What is required is for all stakeholdersâgovernment, business, unions and employeesâto join together to find a solution. That is the Labor way. We are an inclusive party, not divisive. This issue is absolutely fundamental to formulating a sensible population policy in this country. It is not just about immigration, it is also about creating a sustainable population growth at home.</para><para>We have heard much of the government's propaganda about creating a family friendly environment, particularly with its much trumpeted baby bonus; however, even that policy is aimed at assisting those who are in less need of assistance at the expense of low-income families. Treasury itself has warned that a plummeting birth rate is the most daunting social and economic challenge over the next half century. This is a challenge that most Western societies face; however, other than increasing immigration, other areas of population policy are rarely discussed. So I am glad that we are now in the midst of a vigorous and crucial public policy debate. We cannot dither on this. We have a responsibility to get this rightâand we in the Labor Party certainly intend to do so. We plan to give young families a spread of choices, but these must be spread right throughout the community from professional women to shop assistants and clerks.</para><para>The Australian economy cannot afford to lose or underutilise the skills, ideas and potential of Australian women because they want to start a family. Recently, the member for Parramatta commented that the reason the birthrate was falling was due to men failing to commit. It is another simplistic argument from a government that refuses to commit to real reform. Instead, the government refuses to countenance paid maternity leave, it will not sign the optional protocol to CEDAW or the updated Maternity Protection Convention. It pays lip-service to family friendly policies. These three amendments are welcome but they do not go far enough. Instead, here on this side of the House Labor is committed to working with all members of the community to formulate a population policy that is both economically responsible and socially caring. That is the Labor way. We will continue to fight for women's right to work and have a family. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Gillard</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF TAXATION BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10553</page.no><id.no>R1628</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>10553</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered at the next sitting.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 9.00 a.m. to 11.19 a.m.</inline></para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>10553</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>10553</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, we have two matters to handle: messages relating to the Australians Working Together bills and the ASIO bill.

Indeed, we are very disappointed that they are jeopardising the whole <inline ref="R1550">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002</inline>, in which there are enormous benefits, particularly for those individuals who are disadvantaged, through our personal support programs, our working credit program and through our literacy, numeracy and language program. All of that is being jeopardised now by the recalcitrant view of the Australian Labor Party, particularly their view of being soft on compliance. It is rather ironic that it was the Australian Labor Party, particularly through Working Nation when they were last in power, who had a one-strike rule. It was a `one strike and you are out' rule. The actual compliance regime was far more severe. Indeed, in today's dollar terms the penalty would have been around $2,355 for a third activity test breach when the Australian Labor Party were in government.</para><para>We believe that the Labor Party are not genuine and serious about welfare reform. There are a lot of good measures, which I have mentioned, in this particular bill. We have made enormous changes over the eight months since the Pearce report so that the breach rate has actually dropped by about 30 per cent; we have introduced suspension payments, third breach waivers, clean slate provisions and a whole range of measures to assist those who are vulnerable or at risk. This has been a quite deliberate attempt by the government to ensure that there is a safety net for those who cannot help themselves but, by the same token, we are very firm on ensuring that there is compliance and that people do have to undertake their activity tests and administrative requirements. We do not believe that the proposals put forward by the Labor Party should be considered at all. Indeed, they send the wrong signal. What we are on about, of course, is proper work and activity requirements. On that measure, we do not accept the amendments put up by the Australian Labor Party and we disagree with them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>10555</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to oppose the motion moved by the minister. The amendments that we have moved put some essential fairness into the social security system, fairness that has been missing under this government. This minister and Senator Vanstone have had a penalty system operating which is essentially a `shoot first, ask questions later' breaching system. This has resulted in hundreds of thousands of people being fined and, in many cases, being fined unjustly. Even the government have recognised that there is a problem in the system but they have not got the gumption to come into this House and introduce some fairness into the system. Is it any wonder that people in the community think that this is a government that is very strong in controlling the weak and very weak in controlling the strong?</para></talk.start><para>The other advantage of these amendments that we are moving relates not just to the fairness that we are putting into the system. We are also putting in measures which will enhance compliance, because we believe that people should be responsible in the social security system and that they do have a responsibility to contribute and participate. Indeed, one of the most extraordinary things about what is happening here today is that the government is refusing to pass the one beneficial measure in this bill that would actually reward work over welfare. How extraordinary for the government to come into the House today and refuse to pass their own measure. They refuse to pass the working credit, the only beneficial thought they have had in social security in seven years. Do you know where they got it from? They got it from the Australian Labor Party. They got it from us, because it is our policy. They got it from us, because we do believe in rewarding work over welfare.</para><para>What this government does, with the current penalty system and the structure of withdrawal of benefits and moneys earned, is very simple. The minister for employment over there says that unemployed people should work casually, they should take any work that they can get. Do you know what he does when they get it? He taxes them 80c in every additional dollar they earn over the threshold. That is why this government has created a welfare trap which is trapping many Australians on benefits. They want nothing more than to stand on their own two feet and to have their hard work rewarded, but they cannot do it because of the welfare trap and because of the punishing effective marginal tax rate of 80c in the dollar for every additional dollar earned. </para><para>That would be addressed in this bill through the working credit. The problem is that the government has come into the House today and refused to pass it. It has got to be one of the few occasions in the history of politics and public policy in this country where a government comes into the House and says, `We are not going to pass our own beneficial measure.' Why are they not going to pass it? I will tell you why they are not going to pass it. They want to hold the unemployed who work hard out there hostage. They want to hold them hostage, because they will not introduce greater fairness into the system. We are going to fight for fairness. We are going to fight for responsibility. We are going to fight for compliance. We are going to fight because we are committed to a system which does two things: one, it rewards work over welfare; and, two, it invests in the capacity of individuals so that they have the ability to stand on their own two feet. You can only do that if you enhance compliance and participation. Some of the measures that we have put forward here do that. They give the unemployed and others the incentive to comply and to participate in the system.</para><para>What we are getting from the government here today is what we have had for the last seven years. It is a continuance of the welfare trap, the punishment of those on low incomes, and the inability to recognise that if you invest in people then what you will get is a much healthier and wealthier community. This action this morning is simply the action of a government that does not believe in investing in people. It is a government that has cut gaping holes in the social security safety net in recent times. It is a government that has attempted to cut the pensions of disability support pensioners by $52 a fortnight. When it comes to actually adhering to the one beneficial measure that they have put forward in seven years, they have decided to junk it, because they have had a fit about the fact that Labor is intent on introducing fairness into the system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:34:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The SpeakerâMr Neil Andrew)

We have come a long way and have made significant compromises to secure the passage of the bill. At the end of the day the opposition have not. The government will do what is necessary to protect the community from terrorism; the opposition is failing. The opposition will try to pretend to the community that a bill robbed of its workability and impact by their amendments will still deliver to them the protection they need. The government will not be a party to such pretence.

Why would you pass that up, Prime Minister? If you are out there saying that you are concerned about the security of this nation, why not pass this billâhere, now, today? If you said that you were prepared to pass this bill, this could be law at lunchtimeâand you know it. Do not go out there with crocodile tears saying that you are concerned about the security of this nation when you had the opportunity alone to determine it. It is a reminder of a famous statement that was made in our party once, `Whose party is it, Prime Ministerâyours or theirs?' There are people over there who know that this bill is the right way forward. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The other reason I challenge you today, Prime Minister, is this: the nation deserves it. The nation does deserve the security over Christmas time. They deserve it for the next three years that this bill will provide and they deserve it because we are in a different situation. We are under a new threat, and we as a nation have to rise to that threat. Do not go out there and start questioning the credentials of the Labor Party, because this party has always stood for the national interest. This party has always fought for the freedoms and liberties. It was John Curtin of whom it was said, `This country was left a free people and a free nation.' It was the Labor Party that established ASIOâalways with the safeguards. That is what the bill before the parliament does again today, and that is why it should be supported.</para><para>I heard the Prime Minister out there today claiming that the Labor Party is divided on that and using the fact that our numbers are down. Do you know why our numbers are down? Because there are people here with family responsibilities that were told that this parliament would not be sitting. I say this in case there is any doubtâand I am glad that the Prime Minister has moved forward; I hope he is going to engage in debate for the first time today, because he has not had the courage to come into this parliament to deal with this beforeâthis bill has been before the parliamentary Labor Party on three occasions in full caucus, it has been to the shadow cabinet at least as many times and it has been through the caucus committeeâand every time it was supported unanimously. If there is any doubt about it, I say to the members in this parliament, `This party is united in the position of support for this bill.' </para><para>The other grubby little tactic that you have been out today with is trying to assert that there is inconsistency between our position on this and that in relation to New South Wales. Let me just make this important distinction: the legislation in New South Wales is about police powers to arrest and search suspects; this bill is about detention and intelligence-gathering powers by ASIO for nonsuspects. There is no comparison at allâand you know it.</para><para>Prime Minister, what you are doing to this nation by going out with your rhetoric is playing on their fears. They do not want their fears played upon; they want a solution. The bill before the parliament today provides that solutionâa solution that says that, given the changed circumstances, we need to provide increased powers for ASIO. The truth of it is that the legislation before the parliament provides the toughest powers that ASIO has ever hadâunprecedented powers for ASIO; powers that no other Western democracy gives to its intelligence-gathering organisation. So let us hear none of this argument that this has not given increased or tough powers to ASIO. </para><para>But the truth of it isâand the public knows itâthat if you are going to give AISO additional powers, safeguards go with it. That is what the bill provides and that is why you should support it. I cannot understand your logic, Prime Minister, when you go out there and argue that this nation needs to be secure over Christmastime. This bill gives the security and you will not pass it.</para><para>I challenge the Prime Minister again to put aside what he thinks is personal political opportunity and to try and deal with this bill in the public and the national interest. Deal with it through the parliament; deal with it through debate; deal with it in the same way that members of your party have dealt with it: through committee, through investigation, through analysisâthe same way in which they looked at your bill in the first instance and said it was flawed. </para><para>The member for Fadden, on your own side of parliament, said that it was a threat to the democratic values in society. People from your party in the Senate will not support the sorts of things that you are still trying to insist upon in your original bill. The member for Fadden is not in the chamber! Is that another indication that there is a division on your side? Where is he? We have the disunity on their side. Here he is! Come on in, member for Fadden. You at least have had the decency and honesty to expose what your Prime Minister is on about. There are people on your side of the parliament, Prime Minister, that know that this bill is in the best interests of the nation. What the Prime Minister of this nation has to do in these times of threat, in these times of challenge for the nation, is to provide leadershipâleadership that provides a solution, not leadership that simply plays to the fear of Australians.</para><para>I understand the concern that Australians are going through, particularly post Bali. We all understand it on this side of the parliament. That is why we have said from the beginning that we are prepared to ensure that this parliament provides the avenue for the toughest powers that ASIO needs in order to apprehend, to gather intelligence and to stamp out terrorism. We have always said that we are prepared to throw the book at the terrorists. That is who we have to concentrate upon. But, I tell you what, in the process of it we have to ensure that the safeguards of our citizens are also maintained. That is why we are arguing about the principles that are contained and still remain. There are three of them: the question of age, the question of access to legal representation and the question of detention. The reason I hesitated on the third one is that when the Attorney-General was negotiating this with our side, he simply said that he wanted investigative powers for ASIO, not the detention capacity. He wanted inquiry powers. We have given that in this bill. We have said that we are prepared to give up to 20 hours of questioning for nonsuspectsâ`nonsuspects', Prime Minister: this legislation does not cover the suspects; it covers the nonsuspectsâby which the intelligence gatherers can question and determine the next course of action. We think that is entirely appropriate, particularly given the Criminal Code, the Crimes Act, only allows up to 12 in other circumstances. This is an extension of it. </para><para>These are the three issues about which we disagree with you. But, when you think about it, why is this not a significant advance for you? It is because of two things: first, the Labor Party has proposed it; and, second, you want to play on the fear of Australians and not give them a solution. We have seen it so many times. You try to drive a wedge with these issues rather than come up with a practical solution. </para><para>I want to know, Prime Minister, why you are not prepared to grasp this opportunity, why you are not prepared to give the opportunity to the Australian people to experience security in the coming months and yearsâsecurity that gives unprecedented additional powers to ASIO, powers that have never been experienced either by it or any other organisation similar to it in other countries. The powers that are proposed in this bill do not exist with the FBI in the United States and they do not exist with the intelligence-gathering agency in the UK. And we are offering them here todayânow. You have one last opportunity.</para><para>The Prime Minister nods his head. He knows that I am right. He knows that there is the opportunity to put in place this legislation today. As I said at the outset, this legislation can be operable by lunchtime if the Prime Minister does what his backbench wants him to do and passes this legislation. He has come in here today in supportâI expect he will be supporting itâof the laying aside of this legislation. If for one moment you were expressing concern for the Australian nation about its security, why would you lay aside the opportunity now to get unanimous support in this parliament for increased powers for our intelligence gatherersâincreased powers with safeguards? That is the sort of decision that real leaders of this nation have to take. You have squibbed it. You have gone out there and tried to ramp up the rhetoric in relation to it.</para><para>Prime Minister, people will analyse this legislation and they will ask of you, `What sort of a prime minister is he when he has the opportunity to get bipartisan support and unanimity in this parliament to increase the powers of ASIO and he does not exercise it?' The opportunity is there, Prime Minister. Even if you still think that the bill does not go far enough, why not grab it now? Why not revisit it in the next parliament? You cannot bring this bill back until we come back in February. So why not take the best on offer now and seek to build on it later? If you believe that there is insufficiency in it, then test it against the way in which it operates.</para><para>The Attorney-General said to us on previous occasions that this bill is unworkable and unconstitutional, and he was blown out of the water on the unconstitutionality of it by Gavin Griffiths QC in a legal opinion that I tabled last night. I am delighted to see that the government no longer argues the point about constitutionality. It has accepted that dimension of our amendment, as it has accepted the sunset clause. What I am saying to you, Prime Minister, is: accept the other three dimensions of this bill. Give the nation what it deserves. Give it the security it deserves over the Christmas break. Give it the solution, not the fear. What Australians want from their Prime Minister is someone who does stand up in the national interest, someone who does represent them and someone who is prepared to secure their future. They will be facing a difficult time because you have contributed to that fear today. I am saying to you: put your prejudices and politics aside. Give a solutionâpass the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>10565</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe purpose of the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> is to enable ASIO to question people in emergency terrorist situations in order to obtain the information we need to stop terrorist attacks before people are hurt or killed. In the new environment in which we sadly find ourselves, preventing attacks by gathering information before the attacks occur has acquired a premium it never previously had. We have a new situation that requires a new solution. The reason we are laying aside the bill that came from the Senateâwe are not laying aside the government's billâis that it is in a completely unacceptable form. </para></talk.start><para>Labor's amendments will wreck the bill and render it inoperable. From the very beginning, Labor have not been serious about serious and necessary amendments to the ASIO legislation. That is why they sent it off to a committee and gave that committee an unreasonably late reporting time, which has meant that consideration of this bill has been jammed up against the rising of the House and the parliament for the Christmas period. I invite the House to listen very carefully to this: further evidence that the Labor Party are not fair dinkum about this legislation is that the protocols that are proposedâin other words, the guidelines that will govern the operation of the questioning processâmust, according to Labor's amendments, be made subject to parliamentary disallowance. Even if I had agreed with what the Leader of the Opposition had said and we had passed their bill, when we came along with the protocols, the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens would have disallowed them in the Senate. Talk about double jeopardy! That is a great example of their hypocrisy. The Labor Party realise that they are going to be judged as soft on this issue by the Australian public. That is why we have seen the Leader of the Opposition come into this parliament with a whole lot of confected outrage. He knows that his amendments will destroy the bill. He knows that, if you adopt the procedures that they propose, this bill will be rendered inoperable.</para><para>We have no intention of parading a pretence, a fabrication, a fraud, to the Australian public. We have no intention of going out to the Australian public and saying, `We have passed a bill which will guarantee that ASIO has the necessary additional powers,' when we know in our hearts that that would be a monstrous lie to the Australian people. That is why we are not prepared to do it. The Leader of the Opposition comes in here pleading with me to rescue him from the political dilemma he now finds himself in. That is basically what the Leader of the Opposition has tried to do. People on the other sideânot least his predecessorâknow the need for this new legislation.

The Leader of the Opposition comes in here, pleading with me to accept a flawed measureâa measure that from a practical point of view will not give the additional power to ASIO that is necessary in the new circumstances in which we find ourselvesâbut just for good measure he has in his back pocket the capacity through the Senate to disallow the guidelines under which the questioning will take place.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>âThat's not right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âIt is right, Mr Speaker, and he knows it is right. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

That is fundamentally what has been proposed. In those circumstances, there is no warrant, there is no judicial oversightâjust the authorisation of the New South Wales police minister.

Prime Minister, I think you were in the chamber when I last spoke here five hours ago. If you were in the chamber, you would have heard me say this with absolute clarity: in the course of the discussions that Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray, Mr Melham and I had with Mr Williams, your Attorney-General, prior to that phase of the debate of this issue in the House, we offered to abandon the position that we had taken on the issue of a disallowable instrument in the Senate and to move instead to a regime which meant it was not vulnerable to the Senate but had some other form of process whereby there was consultation but the decision was in the hands of the government. That is what we proposed. We proposed it to the Attorney-General and then I reiterated it in public, here in this chamber, five hours ago. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There was no approach, even though there has been constant tick-tacking between both sides of the House on this matter, because we both accept that this is a critical issue to Australian security. No call came from the Attorney-General's office to Senator Faulkner to test that proposition. It was a proposition that we had already issued, but we reiterated it because we considered that the government had shown us good faith in their gesture on the issue of the sunset clause and by accepting our propositions in relation to the authority associated with the bill.</para><para>We responded with good faith, but there was no call to Senator Faulkner. After checking repeatedly with Senator Faulkner over the subsequent hours, I assumed that in that period of time the call would be made and that, if it was not, it would mean that the government considered that what the Prime Minister based almost the entirety of his speech upon was not a matter of relevance, that as far as they were concerned that issue was not central and that the other concerns they hadâsuch as a so-called interrogation regime as opposed to a detention regimeâwere the critical issues, not the issue of Senate disallowance. Prime Minister, we would have abandoned Senate disallowance, just like that. On this the Prime Minister rests his case against the Labor Party. It is unbelievable. This is the second time in two weeks that the Prime Minister has knowingly or unknowingly trashed the national interest in relation toâ</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>âI know he may not know. I am prepared to extend a slight benefit of doubt on his performance last week in trashing the relationships that we have with those with whom we must build an antiterrorist coalition. I am prepared to believe the Prime Minister may not have known what he was doing. He subsequently came to know it, and did not correct it, even though he had his foreign minister out there paddling like a duck on the water, desperately trying to make up for the Prime Minister's mistake. I suspect he thought he was positioning the Labor Party domestically, the way he tried to use this bungle by the government to position us domestically. I suspect he was doing that. But I will also give him due credit: he probably did not know what he was doing when he did it. It is inadequate for the Prime Minister of a nation under security threat. Nevertheless, it is a culpability of omission rather than commission. Frankly, Prime Minister, in this case, it is a culpability of commission.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Was that your central problem with the Labor Party's amendments? We offered, both in private conversation and here publicly in the chamberâand every member here heard it, and I see the Independent member nodding his headâto abandon that position five hours ago. I am sorry, Prime Minister, but I listened for the tonality of your remarks. They were not the remarks and the tone of a man defending the national interest; they were the remarks and the tone of a man who saw a political opportunity.</para><para>There are people on both sides of the House with a deep sense of patriotism and a deep fear of the situation in which we find ourselves. I have had the privilege, since I have become a backbencher, of sitting with some of your backbenchers. I have come to admire their patriotism. I have come to admire the way they try to take a dispassionate look at the issues that are placed before them. I admire their courage, because I know that you run a rougher race in the Liberal Party than most other Liberal leaders. I admire their courage on that front. I do not challenge their patriotism, and they do not usually agree with me on things. But I sit down with them on the basis that I assume that what they are worried about is the lives of their children, my children and everybody else's children in this country. I assume that that is what they are like. Therefore, when we sit down and negotiate with them and discuss things with them, I am fully confident that we bargain and discuss things in good faith. </para><para>The original bill that is being laid aside here could have, firstly, included the removal of your central objection and, secondly, put in place a regime permitting ASIO to question a person suspected of having knowledge of an imminent terrorist attack or some other matter related to terrorist activities for a period of 20 hoursâwhich in effect means two to three days. And if that person tried either silence or dissimulation, that person would be jailed. Remember, your version of the bill also permitted legal representation for persons so caught up. Ours was slightly different. We took the protective strength of those undertaking legal representation of a person so interrogated a point further. Because of the particular character of the legal representation, we were prepared to proposeâand we did in the amendments that you have rejected from the Senateâthat a further regime of secrecy be imposed on both people who have been picked up and anyone who represents them legally. Failure to conform with that regime of secrecy would render them liable to a jail term. That is actually tougher than anything that was in the original bill.</para><para>But I am not here to do comparisons of toughness; I am here to establish that we stood for the national interest. We bargained in good faith and, when you came back to us in good faith, we responded in good faith. We regarded your approach on being prepared to drop the position you had adopted towards the appointment of judges and your proposal to pick up the idea of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on a sunset clause as being in good faith, and therefore we responded in good faith. But no approach was made to us, Prime Minister.</para><para>I know at least as well as the Prime Minister the level of threat to the Australian community that is out there. As I listen to the briefings I get from intelligence officers, I have before me constantlyâas no doubt you do yourself, Prime Ministerâthe faces of ordinary Australians going about their daily business, be they in government offices, in private offices, at sporting venues, in nightclubs or wherever. I love them and I want them protected. I assume you do too, Prime Minister. So I do not play games. None of us on this side of the House plays games when we are presented with serious propositions to defend the national interest. We do not play games with those.</para><para>We all bring to the table our own views on what we see as the essential civil liberties of the Australian people, and so do you. Your fellow Liberals on those various committees who made propositions about eliminating children from the regime and trying to get in place decent legal representation were obviously informed by their concerns for civil liberties. The organising principle of the parliamentary Liberal Party is the defence of individual freedom. That is not necessarily a central feature of a social democratic creed, but it is of the Australian Liberal Party. I therefore expect to see when I deal with members of the Liberal Partyâand I do see it when I sit on committees with themârespect accorded to that fundamental tenet of liberal ideology, and I respect them. They have their viewsâand they showed their hands on those views on those committeesâand we have our views on civil liberties as well.</para><para>We are trying to marry the particular views in the propositions we put forward and introduce a regime that will permit those views to be protected, but at the same time hand to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation authority that the FBI in the United States could only dream of. The United States' Constitution would not permit this legislation, either in your form or ours. This is a serious extension of powers to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Had your bill or our bill got through, it would have seen a substantial extension of the capacity to do the job. What do I find here as I listen to the Prime Minister marshal his forces and his argument against my successor? He has as the central point of his criticism of the Labor Party position what seven hours ago we indicated to the Attorney-General we were prepared to give up and what five hours ago I indicated to this parliament that we were prepared to give up. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name></talker><para>âIt was raised in earlier discussions, too.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>âAnd Senator Hill was there, too.

When the telephone call failed to come, we assumed that the negotiating parties thought it was irrelevant. We said: `That's a shame. We thought that was a good response to their good gesture, but they're not interested.' Prime Minister, all it would have taken was a phone call from you if that was your central problem. We would have needed your draftspeople, of course, because you have better draftspeople. We could have got the authority of the Commonwealth behind it and provided that for you completely, and we would now have a bill before the Australian people which would have protected us instead of an opportunity for political exploitation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>10570</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI suspect there are some in the House who think the debate on the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> has gone long enough.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Banks on a point of order.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name></talker><para>âThe Attorney-General has already spoken in the debate.

In the course of that discussion, the issue that the member for Brand has particularly addressed and the Prime Minister has addressed was raised. I indicated serious concerns about that issue. As a result of that, Senator Faulkner indicated that the Labor Party would give thought to substituting an oversight process instead of a veto process. He concluded that discussion by saying he would consult with his colleagues who were there. When we came back to the House, we offered to make two changes with respect to issues that were discussed in the course of those discussions. We offered them up as amendments. When our amendments went to the Senate, they came straight back, with the amendment that the Labor Party was proposing to consider not there. It was not the coalition that had five hours to make the change; it was the Labor Party. The Labor Party has also operated on the assumption that that was the only issue that the government had with the Labor Party's or the Senate's amendments. It was not. There were a number of others, as the member for Brand and the member Banks are well aware. Fixing that one alone would not have changed the government's position in opposing the bill.

The difficulty turns on Centrelink's requirement that, in addition to establishing their own identity, carers must produce 100 points of identification to establish the identity of the loved one for whom they care. I agree that it is important that applicants for benefits establish their identity to stop welfare fraud. While putting together the necessary documentation might be a relatively minor stumbling block or inconvenience for you and meâit certainly would not be too difficult for us to collect our drivers licence, passport and evidence of bank accountsâit is difficult for some people. In those instances, I believe that a good case can be made for Centrelink to show a bit of flexibility, waive the 100 points requirement and, in so doing, lift a weight from the minds of my constituents at Christmas time.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Alex Scheffer of Capalaba was understandably distressed when he found out that, despite having been naturalised in 1958 and having been paid a pension for many years, his carer could not get any assistance from Centrelink until he could provide proof of Mr Scheffer's Australian citizenship. Having had the misfortune of being burgled a few years ago, during which, amongst other items, Mr Scheffer's original naturalisation certificate was stolen, getting the 100 points was not going to be an easy task. The task was made even more difficult by the fact that he was asked to pay a $55 fee to obtain verification of his Australian citizenship from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. He was told that the process could take up to six weeks. </para><para>As I said, Mr Scheffer is a pensioner and so $55 is not an amount of money that he finds easy to come by in a hurry. It seems ridiculous that his carer, who is saving the Commonwealth a considerable amount of money in aged care services which Mr Scheffer would otherwise need, should have to wait weeks, and possibly months, until he can get together the administration fee, plus the six weeks more he would have to wait for the request for proof of naturalisation to be processed. It is ridiculous not only because of the hardship it would cause Mr Scheffer and his carer but also because Centrelink would already have evidence of Mr Scheffer's citizenship status on file from when his application for his pension was processed.</para><para>The same principles apply to the Riddel family, although they find themselves in a very different set of circumstances. Their son Mark suffers from cerebral palsy. Although he is 35 years old, his condition means that when given a list of forms of identification that might be put together to reach the 100 points needed before his mother could obtain carers payments, they could produce only oneâa birth certificate. Mark has never had occasion to open a bank account or apply for a passport or a drivers licence. The family simply has no way of meeting the 100 points requirement. However, Mark has been on Centrelink's books for some 20 years as a disability support pensioner.</para><para>There are other people in the same situation, and there are precedents where Centrelink has waived the requirement. This is bureaucracy gone mad. I call upon Centrelink officers and those that make the policy to ensure that they look at these circumstances and, where it is obvious that Centrelink has the records in its files, they waive this particular requirement. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Petrie Electorate: Funding of Community Groups </title><page.no>10574</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10574</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt gives me great pleasure to be in the House today to talk about some local funding successes in my electorate of Petrie. The Petrie electorate, like most electorates, represents a population of very diverse interests, ages and nationalities. In October, the Redcliffe Historical Society received $2,500 for an oral history project based on the lives of the men and women who lived in Redcliffe during World War II. The members of the historical society are very active and their love and enthusiasm for local history is demonstrated by their ongoing commitment to exploring the unique history of the Redcliffe peninsula.</para></talk.start><para>Also in October, St Joseph's Primary School at Bracken Ridge secured a capital grant of $200,000 for the establishment of new classrooms and equipment for preschool students. Bracken Ridge is one of those areas which has had very strong residential growth in recent years, and the expansion of St Joseph's demonstrates this with the growing success of this school and its community. In the northern part of the electorate another growing school, this time a secondary school, secured capital funding of $98,000 for a car park and associated roads. Congratulations to Mueller College on its funding success and also for its continued academic and sporting successes.</para><para>With the growth of the global market, I am always delighted when a new business in the Petrie electorate secures funding to expand into a wealth of opportunity. Recently, the Poly Flex Group Pty Ltd at Clontarf secured an export market development grant to expand their business into the chemical product manufacturing sector. They are one of many local small businesses who have shared in over $3 million in EMDG funding since 1996. The busy intersection of Anzac Avenue and Sutton Street, Redcliffe, has been awarded $250,000 in the latest round of federal government black spot funding. Since 1996, over $850,000 has been granted to local projects in the Petrie electorate under this program.</para><para>The Petrie electorate is home to some wonderful cultures. I was delighted to congratulate Xi Rang Liu of Chermside for securing $25,000 for the Australia Council for the Arts. Xi will produce a publication in Chinese, which will look at changes in marriage customs in Australia and China over the generations. That should be a very interesting publication. Another local success was the Buffalo Memorial Homes for the Aged at Kippa-Ring. They secured 16 low-care places in the latest 2002 aged care approval round and a capital grant of $900,000âwell done to them.</para><para>Finally, I would like to congratulate two local winners in the National CommunityLink Volunteer Awards; that is, the Kingfisher Recycling Centre at Aspley, which was the Queensland winner in the environment, conservation and heritage section, and the Cerebral Palsy League of Queensland. The Cascade Community Garden Group at Redcliffe was highly commended in the same category.

The Anglican Church at Belmont North, with the support of local businesses both small and large, prepared a sights and sounds of Christmas display for people of the area. It was assisted by other churches in the area and the parishioners all worked very hard to prepare everything from making costumes to 1,000 calico take home bags for children. They prepared all the props, the electrical work and the scenery and they hand made items for the children that attended. </para></talk.start><para>Last Friday night, I visited the church and saw the sights and sounds of Christmas. It really demonstrated to me the true meaning of Christmas and how, if a community works together, it can show its strengths. The sights and sounds of Christmas were set up in five sections. The first section highlighted the pressures and the commercialisation of Christmas and how people are being forced to just think of buying presents and are not thinking and caring about each other, which is the meaning of Christmas. The next section looked at the importance of the Christmas tree. There was then a section showing the contrast between Christmas in Australia and Christmas in Latvia and, Anna, who is from Latvia, described for the people attending what Christmas is like in Latvia. Then it went on to a scene with two Santa Clausesâone very fat and rotund Santa who had been delivering presents and the other Santa who was very thin and was very sad because he was not able to deliver as many presents as he would like to those children that were living in poverty. The last section was a nativity scene, which emphasised caring and looking after everyone in our community. </para><para>One thousand children from the various schools in the area and 270 adults visited the sights and sounds of Christmas. There were students from Belmont North, Redhead, Jewells, Blacksmiths and Lakeside special school. Everybody that attended enjoyed it and came away with a different idea of Christmas and they were able to focus on the importance of caring for everyone in the community, and on what Christmas is all about. I thank and congratulate the church.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>CSM Group Ltd</title><page.no>10575</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>10575</page.no><name role="metadata">Tollner, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TOLLNER</name><name.id>00AN4</name.id><electorate>Solomon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to speak on the contribution made by a world-class Australian services company, CSM Group Ltd, which is at the forefront of some current exciting new business developments. CSM started nearly 20 years ago with just four staff as a computer company servicing government and business in the Northern Territory. Like many small companies competing against multinationals, CSM had to reinvent itself in the late 1990s, introducing a talented management team of local business people and shifting the company's core business to provide IT solutions for medium- and large-scale organisations. In the global IT market, it may seem strange to develop such a business in remote Darwin, a long way from any significant IT hub, but the company developed a team of IT innovators that today competes with the best in the world.</para></talk.start><para>Many of the IT professionals at CSM came through a graduate training program initiated by the company in 1995. So far 43 graduates have undergone training and all have high-level jobs in a part of Australia where they would otherwise have little or no such opportunities. CSM Knowledge is a private TAFE which meets the training needs of companies and individuals across Australia. CSM has also developed an internal service delivery ethos founded on world's best practice.</para><para>In 1999, CSM successfully bid for the Territory government's first outsourced IT contract. The competition included multinationals: IBM, Compaq, Lotus and Microsoft. Earlier this year an independent benchmark report on the service by Washington based Osterman Research showed that CSM had achieved or exceeded world's best practice standards in most areas.</para><para>The CSM contract was renewed this year by the newly elected Northern Territory government. The Territory boasts the first truly connected education system in Australia. Every primary, secondary, Catholic and independent school within the Territory is now connected by computer, providing student communication, teacher collaboration and education resources for some of our most disadvantaged schools. It took a disciplined and experienced company to deliver that result. CSM flew more than 56,000 kilometres, drove more than 40,000 kilometres and crossed 21 waterways to deliver computers to children in remote Australia. At a time of the worst drought in 20 years, this company went to Marla Bore, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Woomera to provide services where they are needed. </para><para>CSM recently won a number of tenders in information technology in Victoria, beating more multinationals along the way, and recently acquired the accounting business Horwath SA &amp; NT. This accounting division has a 30-year history in Darwin with one of the founders and current chairman, Mr Richard Ryan AO, being awarded the Order of Australia on three separate occasions. We should congratulate companies like CSM Group Ltdâa Northern Territory company that is now competing with multinationals on the world stageâfor proving what can be achieved with hard work and commitment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Education</title><page.no>10576</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>10576</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, merry Christmas to you and your family and to everyone else here. This is a time for reflection and I thought I would use a couple of examples to reflect on the very distant past and the recent past. If Aristotle and Plato came back today and looked at the coalition government and its lack of leadership in education, they would curl up in a foetal position and burst out laughing. Aristotle believed that education was too important for it not to be public. We find in his writings on politics that he believed in the public good. He would be horrified at what is happening to education in this country. Plato had a different view of education. He would also roll up and burst out laughing if opposition members started arguing on choice. He would call that fatuous and stupid. </para></talk.start><para>The only way to select people for education is on merit and talent. Those two issuesâthe public good and talentâgive me the introduction to say thank you to my long-serving staff members. I have been very fortunate in this place in that I still have my original staff after 15 years. I am very proud of that. One member of staff left nine months ago to go to higher places in the state government. Pauline Mannix, who is my office manager, specialises in immigration matters and has been with me for a long time. She is very efficient, does not beat around the bush and is a good leader in the office. Luisa Halacas, who has also been with me for 15 years, is the epitome of diplomacy. You need people like that in your office. She is a good listener, very caring, loving, gentle and thorough when dealing with and responding to constituents.</para><para>I have also had Patrick Hansen working for me, and he has moved into the state government to work for Patrick Conlon in emergency services as an adviser. He concentrated on social security matters and was probably my campaign manager. He organised political campaigns and was the political activist in the office. He made a significant contribution and I am very pleased for him in his new position.</para><para>We edit the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Herald</inline> in our office, and for that we are indebted to the great strength of Gary Orr, who works in my office and is the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Herald</inline>.

Alan was a healthy young adult until the rugby union grand final this year, when he became a quadriplegic when a scrum collapsed. At the time of the accident the McCabe family was a typical Aussie family with a new baby on the way but, since that accident, all of that has changed. Alan is still in hospital in Sydney in the spinal unit. Because of this tragedy, the community has rallied behind the McCabes and is raising funds to assist them in the challenges that lie ahead. </para></talk.start><para>Julie McCabe is a teacher at St Augustine's School. It is a good school with excellent values. It promotes academic excellence, excellence in sport, family values and Christian values. Those values are reflected in the way that many of the teachers and families from the school are supporting the McCabes in their attempt to raise funds. The Coffs Harbour Harlequins Rugby Club has also got behind the family at this very difficult time. </para><para>I would also like to commend the members of the McCabe Trust, who are committed to raising funds on behalf of the McCabe family. In particular I would like to commend Maureen Kennedy, Alan Sparkes, Dwayne Vignes, Robert McCabe, Ross Burton, Julie Wills, Ngaire Robinson, Carolyn Perkins, Narelle Coreless, Michaela O'Shea-Miller, Kyanne Kachael and Jenny Ryan. I understand that through the work of the trust they have managed to raise in the order of $45,000 to support the family. There was an INXS concert and the proceeds from the concert went to the McCabes. There were also various raffles and a community fun day. Alan McCabe, in his attempts to achieve rehabilitation, is an inspiration to us all. Likewise, the members of the McCabe Trust are an inspiration for the hard work that they are putting in to support a very much valued member of the community.</para><para>I would also like to commend the people of Coffs Harbour who have rallied behind the McCabes. There are many drains on the funds of families these days, and people have been very giving in contributing financial support to assist the McCabe family in what is going to be a very great struggle ahead. The trust are not resting on their laurels. Their work is ongoing and they are planning a range of events over time. One of the members of the trust, Mr Alan Sparkes, has a brother who was also made a quadriplegic in a rugby accident, and he is fully aware of what the McCabes must be going through. He has focused on the fact that the community has to keep supporting the McCabes over a long period of time.

I am pleased to be able to speak to this legislation. The legislation aims to improve the position of renewable energy and electricity generation in this country, and that is a worthy cause. I do not need to remind members of this chamber of the need for Australia to reduce its greenhouse gases. It is certainly understood on this side of the House, but if it is understood by the government it has not been translated into much action on its behalf. The importance of renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this country should be obvious, and I am sure it is, to all members of the parliament. Its importance cannot be underestimated. This bill amends the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. The intent of the bill is to finetune the act and attempt to make it more workable. Whilst most of the amendments that the bill makes are of a finetuning nature, two aspects are controversial. These are the windfall gain for hydro-electricity generators and the use of native forest waste as a renewable energy source. I am sure we will hear a lot more about that from my friend who will follow.  </para></talk.start><para>The opposition supports the bill in its present form but there are issues which must be dealt with following the review process which is currently under way. The aim of the original legislation was to accelerate the uptake of renewable energy and electricity generation in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also aimed to provide an ongoing basis for the development of commercially competitive renewable energy and to contribute to the development of internationally competitive industries that can participate in the growing Asian<inline></inline>energy market. </para><para>The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act established the mandatory renewable energy target. The target requires Australian electricity retailers and large buyers of electricity to collectively source 9,500 gigawatt hours per year of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. It establishes a system whereby renewable energy certificates are generated by accredited power stations that produce excess electricity from renewable sources on a 1997 baseline. One certificate is generated for every one megawatt hour of excess renewable energyâelectricity. These certificates can be purchased and used by electricity retailers and large buyers of electricity to reduce the renewable energy shortfall charge that would otherwise have to be paid when sourcing non-renewable energy. </para><para>The aim of all this is to stimulate demand for renewable energy consistent with the provisions of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. In doing this and by boosting investment in renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions will, it is estimated, be reduced by about seven million tonnes a year by 2010. I am sure that the benefits of reducing these emissions are clear to all. Regrettably, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 is the only mandatory greenhouse measure that has been adopted by the Howard government. It often pulls out this sole piece of legislation establishing the mandatory target to demonstrate its supposed commitment to abating the greenhouse problem. </para><para>As most observers will know, this government has a deplorable record when it comes to the environment. It is one of the only governments in the world refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol, and it played an obstructive role in the recent Johannesburg Earth Summit. It seems rather inconsistent having such domestic legislation encouraging renewable energy and electricity generation while at the same time opposing measures to address climate change at a global level. </para><para>The regime that the act sets up is a step in the right direction towards a cleaner, greener nation, but it is far too little. The government has done almost nothing to ensure the preservation of the environment for our children and our children's children. It has been prepared to play politics with the environment, hoping for some shortterm gain. This type of short-termism is one of the defining characteristics of the Howard government and history will not be kind to it if the government cannot see beyond the next poll. </para><para>I want to relay some information about renewable energy projects in the Northern Territory. There is no doubt that Australia has the potential to be one of the leaders in the field of renewable energy. It is doubtful, though, that we have the wit to take up that mantle. I say to the government that this is an opportunity that we should not miss. Certainly in my own electorate of Lingiari there is a fantastic opportunity to use and develop renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy and, to a lesser extent, wind power.</para><para>The government must do a lot more to promote the development and use of these technologies. The potential for the use of renewable energy in remote communities is enormous. Many communities in my electorate are leading the way in the successful use and development of renewable energy sources, and a couple of outstanding projects need to be mentioned. One of these, fortunately, does include work from the Commonwealth government. I just want to give some background here, though. When I first started living in the bush, in the late 1970s, in a very remote communityâsome 12 hours drive from Alice Springs in the north-west of South Australiaâthe only power source was a generator that used diesel. The communities in that region started to think, `Well, what we ought to be doing is looking at alternative modes of power delivery.' So there was an exercise that engaged a number of people looking at how they might get hybrid systems set up involving wind and solar energy. Over time some of these were experimented with. I might remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am talking about the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the very remotest parts of Australia. This exercise was driven by a desire to get away from diesel and to use renewable energy that could be provided through the resources of the sun and wind. </para><para>One project I want to highlight is Bushlight. It is a model for renewable energy programs, particularly in remote and Indigenous communities. I was privileged to attend the opening of this project in Alice Springs in May. This initiative will give 200 Indigenous communities across Australia the opportunity to benefit. The project will take nonpolluting, cost-efficient, reliable sources of energy to remote communities; furthermore, there is very important and strong emphasis on providing local training and employment opportunities for people who live in these communities. Bushlight is funded jointly by ATSIC, the federal governmentâthrough the Australian Greenhouse Officeâand the relevant state and territory governments. Managed by the Centre for Appropriate Technology, CAT, and the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy, the project aims to improve the efficiency of remote renewable energy services as well as to establish best practice for small renewable energy systems.</para><para>The energy problems in these Indigenous communities are considerable. Energy sources, typically diesel generators, are often too unreliable and too costly to provide for the energy needs of an entire community. They are also significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, as we well know. Luxuries that those of us who live outside of these communities take for granted, such as having a washing machine, are often not possible for people in such communities. The Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy estimates that currently around 108,000 Indigenous Australians live in approximately 1,200 discrete Indigenous communities across the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. The centre's research shows that these communities consume over 40 million litres of diesel per year in order to generate electricity. Adding a simple four-kilowatt photovoltaic system to a typical outstation in one of these places can reduce diesel consumption and cut greenhouse gas emissions by between 10 and 13 tonnes of COÂ² per annum.</para><para>One of the important things about this project is that it has been developed in partnership with Indigenous people. CAT, one of Bushlight's joint managers, is a nonprofit organisation with an Indigenous board. It ensures that the project takes a capacity-building approach in the communities where it is providing energy services. The project's mobile service teams provide not only technical support to Indigenous communities but also training in the maintenance of the systems. The project is also establishing a network of regional offices, each employing an Indigenous liaison officer and a regional manager who will work with the local communities. The success of this Bushlight project is based on these community driven processes and should be used as a model for other renewable energy programs throughout rural Australia. The use of solar energy in these communities has been remarkably successful and also has a great deal of potential to deliver further benefits.</para><para>The Bushlight project is an example of how the CRC for renewable energy is helping remote and regional Australia and, at the same time, is reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This project would never have seen the light of day had it not been for the funding from the renewable energy CRC. But astoundingly, as we heard on Tuesday, this CRC for renewable energy will be defunded. It is rather ironic and pretty sad that in the same week that we are debating this bill, which purports to encourage a renewable energy industry for government, the government announced the defunding of the CRC for renewable energy. What is this about? We do know that it reflects badly on the government and potentially badly on the Australian community generally. When the government announced that they were defunding the CRC they also announced that they will be giving $68 million of new moneys to the mining industry for renewable energy. In the end, as we know, this money will end up in the hands of multinational, multibillion dollar mining companies like Rio Tinto. </para><para>I think Rio Tinto have done a very good job over recent years in environmental management. I do not want to disparage Rio Tinto or the work that they are doing. But I want to highlight the contradictions and the absolute conflicts of interests. The chief scientist employed by Rio Tinto is giving that company access to these moneys. I would have thought that any reasonable person could adjudge that there might well be a conflict of interest. Why wouldn't you if you were an ordinary Australian living in the western suburbs of Sydney or in Alice Springs, Katherine or Darwin and you heard that the company for which the chief scientist, the chief adviser on these matters to the federal government, works is going to receive money for renewable energy research at the same time that the government is defunding the CRC?</para><para>We had a discussion about money for mates yesterday in the main chamber. It is appalling that in the week we are debating this legislation that this apparent and readily identifiable conflict of interest appears. But there is not even a blush from members of the government. The government said in the public domain that there was nothing wrong with this, that it is all above board. What would happen if you use the rules that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs uses for ATSIC? They would not be getting the money, because one of the main advisers to the government on decision making in these areas is going to indirectly be a beneficiary of these moneys through the funding of his organisation, Rio Tinto. It is a bit whiffy.</para><para>It is very clear, based on this example alone, that the government has got the balance in this CRC funding dreadfully wrong. I have no problem with moneys going to these mining companies in some form or another, but the way in which this issue has been handled is abysmal. It says a lot about the way in which the government operates, what its intentions really are and its inability to come to terms with its obligation to fund appropriate energy research outside the corporate sector.</para><para>The government's decision to de-fund the renewable energy CRC is the latest in a long line of decisions which shows that the government has no commitment to the environment. The Energy Research and Development Corporation was shut down by the Howard government upon coming to office. The Australian Greenhouse Office has now exhausted its funds for supporting renewables. The Photovoltaic Rooftop Program will run out of funds in mid-2003 and Pacific Solar laid off its R&amp;D team last week. What does that say about the government's commitment? In contrast, on Monday this week the Labor Party demonstrated its real commitment to the environment by announcing support for an increase in the mandatory renewable energy target. Labor believes it is vital to the development of the renewable energy industry and to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>There are a few other Territory based projects that I want to mention. The first is Powercorp, which has developed a new wind turbine technology. Powercorp is a successful Northern Territory company which has recently patented new technology that will revolutionise how wind turbines deliver electricity and has the potential to earn millions of dollars. The name of the technology is `dynamic grid interface'. It smooths out the variation in the supply of electricity which until now has been the greatest hindrance to small-scale wind power generation. The new technology will mean an end to flickering lights, and ice cold water coming out of a hot tap. The founder of Powercorp, Alan Langworthy, a prominent Territorian, should be congratulated for his achievements in developing what is truly revolutionary technology. This piece of cutting edge technology has stunned the world scientific community, as well it should.  </para><para>In basic terms, the DGI technology is a power equaliser tool that uses sophisticated electronic and computer software to regulate the supply of electricity. It allows variations in wind turbine power to be evenly distributed through diesel power grids. Without DGI, strong gusty winds blowing to a wind turbine diesel power grid would result in wild fluctuations in supply. The end result of all this is a perfectly stable electricity system. This is nothing short of a breakthrough for those people who live in remote communities and who have had to put up with flickering lights at dinner time. </para><para>I want to mention the Northern Territory's photovoltaic commercialisation project at Bulman-Watarrka. This is a prime example of the new Northern Territory Martin government's push to promote the use of renewable energy and to use it themselves in the supply of energy to communities in the Territory. The two-part project is worth about $4 million and will provide a total of 55 kilowatts of solar generated energy at Bulman and 225 kilowatts at Watarrka, or King's Canyon National Park, making it the biggest solar photovoltaic project in Australia. PowerWater, the NT electricity retailer/generator, owns and operates the Bulman Power Station and has been responsible for the overall implementation of the project. It is expected that savings in diesel costs over the 20-year life of the project will repay the system's installation costs.</para><para>These are very important initiatives, and in relation to the Bulman project it is worthwhile pointing out those people involved. The Northern Territory Centre for Energy Research played a key role in developing the project's concept and design and technical aspects of the project. Advanced Energy Systems provided detailed design, construction and commissioning for the project. Ecoenergy, an Alice Springs based organisation, was the main subcontractor to AES and completed much of the on-site installation. The Bulman community gave permission to use the land and has given enthusiastic support to the project, allowing it to proceed smoothly.</para><para>Finally, I want to mention the Alice Springs Cool House, located in Araluen in Alice Springsâa great example of adapting to the environment and a cooperative project between the Northern Territory government and the Arid Lands Environment Centre. It is using very innovative design to conserve energy and provide innovative designs for housing construction and the use of water and electricity. I commend this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>10581</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe purpose of the <inline ref="R1601">Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2002</inline> is to make legislative adjustments to the electricity from the renewable energy sources scheme. The original scheme required Australia's electricity retailers and other large buyers of electricity to collectively source an additional 9,500 gigawatt hours per annum of electricity from renewable sources by 2010. This measure was to increase the level of renewables based electricity generation from 10.7 per cent in the late 1990s to a projected 12.7 per cent by 2010.</para></talk.start><para>It was also designed to increase investment in the renewable energy sector and was estimated to potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about seven million tonnes per annum by 2010, through renewable energy electricity generation displacing high emission intensity fossil fuel based power generation. The scheme established the mandatory renewable energy target, MRET, which was a token effort to address greenhouse gas abatement. </para><para>The amendment is designed to improve the administrative integrity, effectiveness and efficiency of the Renewable Energy Act 2000. It removes the MRET, which has only been in place for two years. Many of the larger enterprises have used it to develop the baseline for their expansion into renewable energy power sources.</para><para>Tasmania, of course, is the home of renewable energy, starting before the Snowy scheme. Our first hydro scheme was at Duck Reach on the South Esk River in the late 1890s. Tasmania has used hydro power to build its economy since then and it has produced 60 per cent of Australia's renewable energy. Hydro Tasmania and its various business unitsâTranscend and Auroraâstill employ a considerable number of people in Tasmania; not as many as they used to, but they are still a major employment source. They also have the ability to develop new technology and use their expertise to help other countries to develop their renewable energy capacity through their consultancy arm.</para><para>With any energy source, it is important to seek new ideas and develop ways to upgrade existing schemes. But unless there is an incentive to do so and the people to use the output, then the status quo will remain and little will change. When MRET hit the deck, Hydro incorporated into its future planning to look at ways that it could improve its alternative renewable energy. It started with what it could improve in its existing infrastructure, which will include one major upgrade and 11 minor ones other than the normal maintenance round. </para><para>Wind power has been discussed for some time and when the MRET became an incentive, there was serious interest in looking at using wind as a good, clean method of power development. But it cannot be developed in isolation. Other power sources are needed to ensure that the spikes that are inevitably there with wind can be ironed out and boosted when needed. We have just heard my colleague from the Northern Territory, the member for Lingiari, speak about a major breakthrough in this regard by a person in his area.</para><para>Hydro power is an ideal joint partner because water can be adjusted quickly and cheaply to regulate the power generation. So it seems to be the right direction in which to be moving. But the development of wind energy is not as economically feasible as the development of hydro power. It needs more of a push to get it into the mainstream. When the MRET was established it became feasible to consider including wind power in the renewable energy grid. The criticisms of the system were that baselines for existing generators had been incorrectly set, which was stopping investment in new renewable energy developments, and that it would fail to substantially increase Australia's uptake of renewable energy, thus having a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. It is argued that the existing target of 9,500 gigawatts by 2010 is too low and that the design of the MRET scheme does too little to encourage investment in new renewable energy businesses.</para><para>It seems that Hydro Tasmania have been criticised for taking advantage of gains that have been made by existing hydro-electricity generation. Critics of the current scheme say that the use of the 1997 baseline data means that Hydro generators can supply all mandated RECs until 2007 without investing in new capacity and can enjoy a significant share of the REC market thereafter. However, that is not what Hydro did. They have worked hard to comply with and develop the MRET scheme. They do not believe it is perfectâthey feel the baselines are too low and the target needs to be increased by 2010 by at least a true two per cent additional renewable energy. The program has been useful in pushing the direction of renewable energy. Five hundred and sixty-eight megawatts of wind farms have obtained planning approval for construction. One hundred megawatts have been constructed and 158 megawatts are under construction. This far exceeds earlier government predictions about how MRET will stimulate new renewable energy projects. </para><para>This program is made commercially feasible by the MRET scheme. Investment in the upgrade program has increased from $16 million per annum pre-MRET to $66 million per annum. That is a considerable amount of investment in the state of Tasmania. Having inspected the wind farms and seen some of the potential upgrading under way in the older hydro generatorsâthat is, using water more efficiently and effectivelyâit seems that this has indeed encouraged a greater intensity into improving Tasmania's capacity for power production. With the Basslink about to come into being in the next few years, this extra power will be a welcome addition to the mainland and may well encourage subsidiary industries to be attracted to the island. One such is the building of a Vestas factory on the north-west coast and the other is the Hydro's ability to continue to research and develop new directions for wind generation. </para><para>I think the original objectives of the bill are being met. The uptake of renewable energy in grid based applications to reduce greenhouse emissions is under way. Renewables are being stimulated, which is providing a base for further development of commercially competitive renewable energy. It will lead to the Hydro and many private companies contributing to the development of internationally competitive industries which could participate effectively in our part of the world. Development of new technologies is expensive for both existing and new companies. I believe MRET gives opportunities for small companies to piggyback on the infrastructure and expertise of the bigger companies to develop new directions.</para><para>Continuing with the amendments in this act will effectively prevent the continuation of much of the development work already under way and it has enormous budget implications as companies cannot just stop what they have been planning over the last two or three years. It seems to me that it is ludicrous to introduce legislation at this stage to change the interpretation of the act. Some individual accreditor might rule that a new power generation scheme is not eligible because the system in the application effectively represents an expansion or modification to an already accredited power station rather than a new, separate power station. Any sort of power station takes an enormous amount of capital to bring up to standard to attach to our electricity grid. Fledgling companies do not have that capacity. However, small companies working with an established electricity generator could develop significant differences. Should we not gear the MRET to help existing companies become mentors and have partnerships with new technology rather than throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak? I think some changes can be made to MRET to answer some of the concerns raised, but to develop the sorts of directions that are being suggested in the amendments frankly adds police state dimensions to something which really could be a useful technology development tool.</para><para>Renewable energy certificates should simply be gained by any company involved in energy and power development, providing there is substantial proof they are contributing to the demolition of greenhouse gases. Australia is a bit of a joke anyway in this area after refusing to adopt the Kyoto protocol. To deny existing clean power generators to continue to research new directions seems to be a contradiction in Australia's position. I suppose nothing is really new under the Liberal government. They are so full of contradictions, it is not surprising that big and small business finds this confusing. The cutting of the CRC on renewable energy and the taking away of funds last week proves that this government is heading in a nonsensical direction when it comes to renewable energy. The big argument is lower prices, although I do not see a lower price for power for consumers. I believe the industry should gain some additional incentives to keep the price of power within the reach of ordinary Australians. Nowhere in any of the discussions have I seen any interest in this; it is more about how our environment has to be saved from us. There is always a social dilemma to that argument which needs consideration. </para><para>Biomass fuel production is another source of argument in this place. The CSIRO report on environmental matters relating to biomass fuel states that the environmental concerns can be adequately managed and biomass fuel production can make a very significant contribution to the reduction of Australia's greenhouse gas production. If someone wants to put in the investment and make it work, it seems that once again we are throwing away opportunities by placing barriers, which are being suggested, in the path of investors. Sensible and sensitive development is a plus, not a minus, for our society.</para><para>We need to encourage people to develop new ideas using international guidelines. We should ratify Kyoto and get on with developing ways in which we can meet those targets. Time and again, we hear arguments about how to stop various activities from occurring without any base knowledge of what they have contributed in the past and what potential they have. We should build on the expertise, guide the investment into sustainable areas and encourage change by example and incentive. Bans and restrictions only serve to persuade people to find ways around them. We want to use their inventiveness more productively. The forestry and energy industriesâtwo of Tasmania's vital industriesâcan be influenced by people working with them.</para><para>The Senate report which came down a week or two ago vindicates what I have said. There is a need to continue with the MRET scheme and encourage its positive review in the new year. The Parer report and its recommendations do little to encourage business to take up new directions. It is negative. It seems to want to change everything before it has been properly tried and tested. We can certainly do better and we need to better in the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>10584</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe future role of renewable energy is an important issue not just for Australia but also for my electorate. You would have heard during this debate that Labor supports an increase of the mandatory renewable energy targets from two per cent to five per cent by 2010. This would mean that, under a Labor government, by 2010 Australian energy providers would purchase five per cent of their fuel from a source that is renewable. Labor is committed to strengthening the MRET schemeâunlike the government, which appears set, under the draft Parer review, to walk away from it. For too long we have focused solely on nonrenewable energy sources. We have failed to invest strongly in technology that develops new renewable energy sources. In fact, on Tuesday we saw in the government's CRC announcement that it is abandoning the CRC for renewable energy.</para></talk.start><para>The government has no credibility on the issue of renewable energy. The government shut down the energy R&amp;D corporation, the Australian Greenhouse Office has exhausted its funds for supporting renewable R&amp;D programs and the Photovoltaic Rebate Program was underspent this year and runs out in 18 months. If this government were serious about encouraging renewable energy, it would invest in R&amp;D, not disinvest in it.</para><para>We have also not invested sufficiently to provide incentives to industries to develop a cheaper and more efficient use of nonrenewable energy resources. We must act now to encourage the development of alternative energy sources that are renewable, clean and have as little impact on our environment as possible. Labor is committed to increasing MRET and hence a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the Howard government's history on this issue is poor. For example, at the recent Earth Summit in Johannesburg, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage sat back as country after country backed the Kyoto protocol and promised to ratify it. First it was China, then India, Thailand and Canada that led the way. However, the minister continues to stand with the United States in opposing the ratification of the Kyoto protocol and seeks to fight actively against emission reductions.  </para><para>Only a couple of weeks ago the minister for the environment stated in a speech to Australia's peak business organisation, the Business Council of Australia, that our environment was vulnerable to climate change, and yet he still will not bow to pressure for his government to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The United Kingdom has done what many progressive governments in the international community have achieved, and that is to set sustainable targets on renewable energy. The Blair government has set a target of 10 per cent by 2010 and 20 per cent by 2020. This is an outstanding target. I should remind the House of the history of the British manufacturing industry, its pollution and its overwhelming use of non-renewable energy such as coal. If Britain can improve, so can we.</para><para>It is therefore justifiable that less than a month ago the UK environment minister, the Hon. Michael Meacher, criticised the Howard government for its inaction. He argued that the Howard government's inaction over the ratification of the Kyoto protocol was designed to `curry favour' with the US. In the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> last month, Ms Lenore Taylor quoted the UK minister as saying:</para><quote><para>âAustralia has been very close to the US and I doubt they would have taken the view they have if it hadn't been for the US.â</para></quote><para>The UK minister is saying exactly what the Labor Party has been saying about the Howard government throughout  this year. Its failure to ratify Kyoto is yet another example of the Howard government's inaction over greenhouse emissions and renewable energy.</para><para>I would like to turn to the importance of the review of mandatory renewable energy targets. There are some important issues within my electorate that the review needs to take into considerationâwhen it eventually startsâbefore handing down its findings. These include the impact of MRETs on native forests as well as the impact on energy pricing. In the recent Victorian state election, the now Premier and the Labor team committed their second term to rescinding the lack of leadership by the Kennett government on the use of our natural resources. With a commitment to end old-growth logging in the Wombat State Forest, I was also pleased to hear of the progressive approach the Bracks government took on native forest residue as a renewable energy source. Their commitment was to ban the use of native forest residues for electricity generation. The ramifications of recognising native forest residue as a renewable fuel source under this act are in the early days of investigation. I remain concerned that this bill continues to signal to the industry that this use is available and does not do enough to encourage the use of other possibly less damaging renewable fuel sources.</para><para>I note in the report <inline font-style="italic">Review of the science relevant to the sustainable use of native and plantation forest harvesting residues for energy production in Tasmania</inline>, published by the CSIRO in May this year, that the jury is still somewhat out on the ramifications of the use of native forest waste as a renewable energy source. In the report, the CSIRO state:</para><quote><para>Harvesting of fuelwood is a new activity in Tasmania's wet eucalypt forest, and as a consequence there are uncertainties associated with the economic supply of fuel, the nature and intensity of harvest on particular coupes and the impacts of removal on environmental values.</para></quote><para>I am concerned about the consequences that the use of native forest waste will have on our forests, both in terms of its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and its effect on the biodiversity of our native forests. Due to the infancy of the CSIRO's investigations, I am not adequately assured that it will not have a detrimental impact on forests in my electorate. I must admit that I support the ban proposed by the Bracks Labor government in relation to my forest, the Wombat State Forest. For too many years this natural resource has been used and abused. I have a recent list of endangered species in the Wombat State Forest from the World Wide Fund for Nature. They include the powerful owl, swift parrot, orange-bellied parrot, plains wanderer, eastern barred bandicoot, superb parrot, Australian grayling, regent honeyeater and the spot tailed quoll. The MRET review needs to take into consideration all effects that the removal of native forest waste would have on the biodiversity of these species. The MRET review needs to assess any implications that this would have on net greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and the level of biomass extraction under the RFA agreements and the plantation industry. </para><para>At the same time we need to concentrate on building incentives to encourage other sources of renewable energy. Take, for example, the recent announcement made by the state member for Ripon, Mr Joe Helper MLA, as part of the Bracks government initiatives on renewable energy. The member for Ripon recently took part in a `turning the turf' ceremony to mark the beginning of construction of the Chalicum Hills wind farm at Buangor. The Chalicum Hills wind farm will involve the construction of 35 wind energy generators that will be the first to be supplied under an agreement between Pacific Hydro and Danish wind generator manufacturer NEG Micon. Wind power is an increasingly significant source of power. The wind farm initiative in the member for Ripon's electorate will generate enough electricity for more than 25,000 Victorian homes. This development will provide a major boost to the regional economy from construction through to operations, maintenance and its potential for tourism. The local community have offered strong support for this development.</para><para>We need to support advances in the field of renewable energy. We must also support industries that are taking steps to provide cleaner energy from non-renewable resources. That is why I support the steps being taken by the CSIRO in finding cleaner and more efficient ways in the preparation of coal for the domestic and overseas markets. Most coal is cleaned, and some of the mineral matter, or ash, is removed to make it more valuable. This small step offers significant financial benefits by improving handling and transport, reducing pollution from coal-fired power stations and improving the quality of our coals.</para><para>I am pleased to stand here and say that Labor is committed to increasing the mandatory renewable energy target by two to five per cent by 2010. It is a target that is both sustainable and progressive. It is a target that, under a Labor government, we would be committed to reaching. The MRET review needs to take into consideration what direction Australia needs to take to satisfy its energy needs. It needs to look at ways to strengthen the MRET program and it needs to make sure that, as a policy instrument, it is doing what is in the best interests of the future of our environment. I would urge the review to seriously examine the effect that the inclusion of native forest residue will have not just in forests in areas such as Tasmania but also in forests such as those in my electorate, particularly the Wombat State Forest, which has been overlogged and not managed in the best interests of the local forestry industry or other members of the local community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10586</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn summing up the debate on the <inline ref="R1601">Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, I want to say that the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme is a cornerstone of the Commonwealth's strategy for growing the Australian renewable energy industry and it is a world first in creating a national renewable energy market that is backed by legislation. Section 3 of the act sets out the objectives for the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target. These are: to encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources; to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases; and to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable. Essentially, the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme, which I will refer to as MRET, aims to increase the share of electricity generation from renewable sources by providing a guaranteed market for an additional 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity per year from eligible renewable sources and, by 2010, is envisaged to achieve greenhouse gas abatement of between 6.7 to 7.8 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. </para></talk.start><para>The mandatory renewable energy target demonstrates that a combination of regulatory and market based approaches can help minimise compliance costs of the measure by enabling participants greater flexibility in their decision making to seek out and utilise cost-effective eligible abatement options. Since coming into force on 1 April 2001, the measure has performed strongly, with some 170 power stations accredited, representing a broad diversity of eligible renewable energy sources and technologies throughout the country. The member for Ballarat criticised the Australian renewable energy target as less stringent than the United Kingdom's renewables obligation order, which mandates an increase in renewable energy share of 8.5 per cent by 2010. She should know and understandâbut obviously she does notâthat in the UK the electricity growth is only half as great as in Australia and electricity prices are high, making the environment already competitive for renewables based electricity. We have a very different environment and a very different energy sector in Australia. As most people on this side of the chamber would understand, it has been coal based traditionally, which presents a very different challenge for our government.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1601">Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2002</inline> amends the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 by addressing minor deficiencies in the administration of the original legislation. These amendments are needed to maintain the integrity of the legislation. The changes proposed include the clarification of key definitions, including eligible renewable energy sources. The Renewable Energy Regulator is provided with a capacity to vary decisions or suspend accredited power stations in limited circumstances, including where there is thought to be gamingâgaming is where the output of a group of power stations has been manipulated for the purpose of creating more renewable energy certificates than otherwise would be the case.</para><para>The bill also provides adequate safeguards in that decisions by the Renewable Energy Regulator are reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. Other amendments included in the bill are the introduction of information-gathering powers to underpin the monitoring, auditing and compliance requirements and to bring the mandatory renewable energy target into line with similar pieces of Commonwealth legislation. The bill provides for the appointment of employees of state and territory governments, as well as Commonwealth officers, to operate as authorised officers for the purpose of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, and therefore to enable them to monitor compliance with the act. Finally, the bill addresses a potential double liability situation.</para><para>The changes are administrative in nature and are required now to provide certainty to the renewable energy industry and liable parties on the operation of the renewable energy trading system. These changes in no way impact on the government's commitment to conduct an independent review of the legislation as mandated under section 162 of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Again, if the member for Ballarat had understood what she was talking about, she would have known that that independent review does include a consideration of the extent to which non-plantation forestry waste has been utilised. It is a shame she did not do her homework.</para><para>On 29 November 2002, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage confirmed that the independent review of the operation of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 will commence very shortly, in January 2003. The minister has indicated his intention that the review be conducted in a timely, open and transparent manner. As a first step, the minister has already written to all major stakeholders requesting their input into the scope of the review. It will consider a range of matters, including the level of the target, the mix of technologies that has resulted from the implementation of the act, the level of penalties and the need for indexation to maintain the real value of the penalty charge, as well as some other environmental impacts. </para><para>The Commonwealth has a suite of renewable energy policies. Members of the opposition speaking on this bill seem to have overlooked this entire suite of renewable energy development policy worth $377 million. They include the renewable energy commercialisation program of $54 million, the renewable remote power generation program of $264 million and the supporting photovoltaic systems of $31 million. I was very pleased to hear the member for Lingiari refer to solar photovoltaic systems that he had observed in the Northern Territory. He said that, as they were a good idea, why didn't we do something about them. He would be aware that there is significant Commonwealth funding in those Northern Territory solar photovoltaic systems.</para><para>We have the Renewable Energy Equity Fund, $17.7 million; the Renewable Energy Action Agenda; and the renewable energy technology road map. The action agenda is in partnership with the renewable energy industry. This partnership has also launched a renewable energy agenda, which provides a strategic policy framework for the development of a sustainable and competitive renewable energy industry in Australia that aims for growth in annual industry sales to $4 billion by the year 2010.</para><para>We have heard a number of opposition speakers refer to the cooperative research centres announced just in the last 48 hours, concerned about the renewable energy CRC. They need to look at the entire suite of CRCs announced in the last 48 hours. The Howard government has announced funding exceeding $46 million for three cooperative research centres that will aid in abatement of greenhouse gasesânamely, the CRC for Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems, $23.54 million; the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies, over $21 million; and the CRC for Greenhouse Accounting, $1.35 million. Therefore, we have more than taken care of the research and collaborative research needs of this particular significant issue. The decision not to fund the Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy for the second time must be seen as a result of the competitive bid process.</para><para>Let me talk about our future. The member for Lyons talked about the fact that Australia continues at this point to not ratify the Kyoto agreement. I stress again, the government is committed to playing an effective part in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is taking action on both the national and international fronts. In fact, we are leading significantly in some of the work associated with the carbon sequestration through vegetation planting. When I was in Japan in January of this year, I was very proud to stand up and talk about how Australia is doing significant workâin fact, world's best practice workâin terms of understanding the carbon sequestration cycles. What we have done in Australia is world beating. The government has consistently stressed that, to be effective, action to address climate change needs to include participation by all major emitters of greenhouse gases. The United States has said that they are not going to ratify the Kyoto protocolâand they are the most significant emitter. To date, there has been no clear pathway for the involvement of developing countries in the Kyoto process. Without their involvement, there are risks of an energy-exporting country such as Australia burdening its own industry with additional costs.</para><para>We are concerned about our Australian work force and our Australian industry and its competitiveness both domestically and internationally. The government is committed to continuing to develop and invest funding in domestic programs to meet the 108 per cent target that it agreed to at Kyoto. The national greenhouse accounts released in August show that Australia is on track for this target. I conclude by saying that the refinements contained in this bill are another step towards achieving enhanced uptake of renewable energy and ensuring the emerging market in renewable energy generation is functioning according to the intention of this parliament. I commend the bill to the House. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PLANT BREEDER'S RIGHTS AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10589</page.no><id.no>S347</id.no></debateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 3 December.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10589</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>10589</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The purpose of the proposed amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 is to:</para><para>Â·	clarify the rights of plant breeders in certain circumstances where restrictions are imposed</para><para>Â·	enhance the access of breeders to the Plant Breeder's Rights (PBR) scheme, and</para><para>Â·	improve the administration of the act and of the PBR scheme. </para><para>I take this opportunity to flag the simple fact that plants are indispensable to our daily lives.</para><para>Pharmaceuticals, fruit and vegetables, insecticides, industrial starch, field crops, essential oils, flowers, dyes, wine and beer, textiles, livestock forage, edible oils, timber, glues, rope, ethanol, varnish, paperâan endless list testifies to the importance of plant life to human life.</para><para>Of course, the benefits that derive from new plant varieties do not simply fall into our hands. They are the result of significant intellectual effort and the skilful application of knowledge. </para><para>Australia is fortunate to have innovative people skilled in the breeding of new plant varieties, because innovative varieties are essential to meet Australian and world demands, providing, inter alia:</para><para>Â·	the building blocks for a diverse range of industries</para><para>Â·	competitive, high quality food and fibre products to meet increasing world demand and</para><para>Â·	practical solutions to health and environmental concerns.</para><para>The act is based on Australia's membership of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) 1991, a United Nations multilateral agreement establishing an internationally harmonised regime for exclusive intellectual property grants relating to new plant varieties. The UPOV scheme, built on uniform, clearly defined principles, encourages investment, innovation, multiplication and release of new plant varieties in, and between, member countries.</para><para>Australia's PBR scheme is a significant success story. One new variety is registered each day, with over 20 new major export crop varieties registered each year. PBR also stimulates a steady flow of new varieties from overseas, bringing investment and technology. Approximately 60 per cent of all applications for registration are from overseas.</para><para>Australia's achievements in plant breeding are significant in their own right. We need look no further than CSIRO, which is leading the world with its seed retaining phalarises, high-yielding rust resistant winter wheats and starch-enhanced barleys. Similarly, the export flower industry is based on our unique native varieties, so well displayed in the 2000 Olympic bouquets.  </para><para>However, in this competitive world others are also capitalising on our plants. If we are to make the most of our unique mega-diverse flora, we have to encourage plant breeding. The PBR scheme provides such encouragement, directly promoting innovation by establishing a legal intellectual property right in a new plant variety.</para><para>The certainty of this legal ownership and the opportunity to commercialise the innovation stimulate the intellectual effort, private investment and technology transfer that Australia requires. The PBR owner is provided with opportunity for reward, subject to certain provisions which safeguard the public interest. </para><para>Under the act, PBR is the right to disallow others from acts of production, reproduction, conditioning, offering for sale, sale, import, export, and stocking for any of these purposes of propagating material of the plant variety. </para><para>It is not the right specifically to carry out those acts. This is because PBR is a form of patent legislation, as confirmed by a recent High Court ruling. Implicitly, PBR coexists with other laws of the land and those laws may, for example, be capable of regulating PBR commercialisation activities. For instance, competition policy legislation may regulate PBR related commercial activities, or state legislation may regulate the sale and marketing of varieties. In other words, there are a number of potential public interest influences affecting the exercise of PBR.</para><para>All the proposed amendments are consistent with Australia's membership of UPOV and have wide industry and community support. I am pleased that the Senate has supported the government's bill. The Senate debate canvassed and rejected a number of non-government proposals that were not the subject matter of the bill, were inappropriate and were only distantly related to PBR.</para><para>An ALP amendment to add two members to the Plant Breeder's Rights Advisory Committee was supported by the Senate. I do not believe that these two extra members will add much to the PBRAC, which seems to have operated satisfactorily to date. Nonetheless, in the interests of securing passage of this bill, the government will not oppose the expanded committee membership. The wording of the ALP amendment is not entirely consistent with the existing relevant provision of act. In the interest of speedy passage of this important bill, I will not make an issue of this. However, I give notice that the government will seek to tidy the amendment up at a later date without altering its intent.</para><para>This bill includes significant clarification to section 18 of the act.</para><para>Section 18 was designed to protect public interest concerns regarding limitations that might be placed on the use of the propagating material, for example, reflecting the concern that the PBR owner should not be able to prevent, say, the making of bread or the brewing of beer from legitimately purchased grain.</para><para>However, it should not deny the holder of PBR the opportunity to exercise their right of exclusion regarding normal commercial activities, including, for example, the first point of sale in the trading of food commodities.</para><para>Section 18 is interpreted by some people as a means of avoiding the PBR owner's right of disallowance in normal commercial circumstances. As a consequence, significant quantities of PBR protected grain varieties in Australia pass through the commercial system without the PBR breeder having any opportunity to seek reward for their innovation. </para><para>The inequity of this is obvious. Moreover, it is a clear disincentive to investment in plant breeding and is a likely explanation why innovation in plant breeding in the field crops sector is lagging that of other sectors. </para><para>By deleting section 18 of the act we remove the possibility of such an interpretation, promote investment in plant innovation and better align the act with UPOV 1991. Public interest concerns related to preventing limitations on how propagating material may be used are picked up under the amended section 49 which empowers the minister to set conditions relating to existing and proposed PBR grants.</para><para>A further amendment, to be inserted as new section 18, allows for certain public interest restrictions to be placed on the exercise of PBR. The amendment provides that when other laws of the land restrict the normal exercise of PBR, and when such legislation authorises a person to do an act that would normally be subject to the PBR owner's right of disallowance, `equitable remuneration' must be paid. For example, the amendment will ensure that statutory marketing authorities are able to exercise their legally enforceable rights regarding exports and that PBR owners will receive remuneration if their rights are restricted as a consequence. This restriction is entirely consistent with public interest considerations and with international best practice as exemplified in the international treaty on these matters, UPOV 1991.</para><para>In summary, section 18 amendments clarify that the PBR owner has the opportunity to exercise their right of disallowance in normal circumstances. They confirm that coexisting legislation, implicitly in the public interest, may modify the exercise of PBR, and, in certain circumstances, the breeder must be remunerated. They reaffirm the intent of the legislation; promote greater harmony with the UPOV international intellectual property system; provide more certainty for our international trading partners; and, thereby, facilitate the inflow of plant variety investment and technology transfer.</para><para>The remaining amendments are administrative. They are diverse and include:</para><para>Â·	providing for equity between domestic and imported varieties in the use of synonyms and making the unauthorised use of a synonym an infringement;</para><para>Â·	clarifying the circumstances in which the breeder's right is exhausted;</para><para>Â·	providing discretion to cancel provisional protection in certain circumstances;</para><para>Â·	correcting inequities regarding the payment of fees;</para><para>Â·	further protecting commercially sensitive information and compelling the reasonable provision of materials for test growings;</para><para>Â·	clarifying the priority date for lodgement of application;</para><para>Â·	making explicit the grantee's right to initiate infringement actions; </para><para>Â·	extending the Plant Breeder's Rights Advisory Committee including the term of appointment from two to three years; </para><para>Â·	amending and making cross-references, correcting transcription errors, various clarifications and associated simplification of language.</para><para>I will not comment on each of these amendments. However, let me take as an example the amendment that facilitates experimentation. I refer to the proposal to exempt on-farm testing and research as activities that could threaten the ability to register new varieties.</para><para>Researchers must enlist the help of farmers to test new varieties and products in normal farming situations. This practice is essential if the true potential of the innovation is to be realistically evaluated. </para><para>While in no way offsetting their contribution, farmers expect, in many cases, to harvest the residual material and to dispose of it in the marketplace along with their normal commercial product.  </para><para>Under PBR this could qualify as a `sale' of the variety and start the `one-year' time clock within which a PBR application must be lodged. However, many varieties take more than one year of testing. Some take two, three or more years before a decision can be made to register and the new variety can be released. </para><para>Activity enabling the registration of new varieties in the circumstances that I have outlined should be recognised as valid, and is consistent with what is envisaged under UPOV. </para><para>Therefore, the government proposes to recognise extended periods for on-farm and experimental testing as valid pre-registration activities.</para><para>In conclusion, these amendments will clarify certain aspects of the legislation, enhance the access of breeders to the PBR Scheme and improve its administration. The amendments underpin the broader initiatives announced by the Prime Minister in the Backing Australia's Ability package. They will further improve the environment for increased plant innovation and investment in Australia and for our exports of IP intensive products and services.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Main Committee, and I present the revised explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>10592</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe purpose of the amendments contained in the <inline ref="S347">Plant Breeder's Rights Amendment Bill 2002</inline> is to clarify the rights of plant breeders in certain circumstances where restrictions are imposed; enhance the access of breeders to the Plant Breeders RightsâPBRâScheme; and to improve the administration of the PBR Scheme.</para></talk.start><para>I note with interest that the Australian plant breeding industry has a turnover of something like $1.2 billion per year. I understand that Seed Industry Association members have an annual turnover themselves of $500 million. Employment in related areas of the plant breeding industry involves 10,000 jobs, including seed growers, plant breeders, seed processors and seed merchants, distributed throughout all states in Australia. The export value of the industry is about $200 million per year.</para><para>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry referred to the fact that growth in the number of registrations under the PBRA since its enactment in 1994 has been impressiveâmore than 3,300 applications for registration have been received, with one new variety added each day. A figure of 317 new applications was recorded in 2000-01, which represents an increase of 21 per cent on the figure for 1998. Up to 100 new breeders enter the scheme every year. Approximately 60 per cent of all applications are from overseas. Most applications, I understand, are from the private sector and at least 20 new varieties in the major export crops category are being registered per annum, with 680 new varieties of field crops and pastures processed since the inception of the scheme. </para><para>What does the PBR Scheme do? It provides certain rights to breeders of new plant varieties in order to encourage plant breeding and innovation. A PBR right entitles the grantee to exclude others from doing certain acts in relation to the propagation of plant varieties for which a grant is held. The scheme does not prevent someone using a PBR variety to breed another variety. In fact, the PBR Scheme exists to encourage plant innovation. New varieties bred in this way must meet the standard PBR testâthat is, the new plant variety must be distinct, uniform and stable. A PBR right is limited to 25 years for trees and vines and 20 years for all other plants. The act coexists with other legislation that may impact on the use of a registered variety, including prohibition on its growing or commercialisation. PBR rights holders are also subject to competition legislation, including the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974.  </para><para>The amendments contained in this bill, as the minister pointed out earlier, are predominantly administrative and include a significant clarification to section 18 of the act. Section 11 of the act establishes the right of breeders to disallow certain acts of production and other activities in relation to a plant variety. Section 18 was designed to acknowledge public interest concerns regarding the limitations that breeders can place on the use of their propagating material. For example, it is not in the public interest to allow breeders to prevent the making of food staples such as bread from grain. However, the current section 18 has been interpreted such that it has denied plant breeders the right to deny any normal commercial activity in respect of their propagating material. This was not the intention of the legislation. Accordingly, the bill provides for a deletion of section 18 and the insertion of a new section that allows for certain defined public interest restrictions.</para><para>Sensibly, the new provisions provide that a breeder is able to exercise their right of authorisation of acts under section 11, except where the right is restricted by Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. Where such restrictions apply, equitable remuneration must be paid to the breederâa provision that is consistent with Australia's obligations under the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 1991. The bill also clarifies the power of the minister under section 49 to impose conditions on existing and proposed breeders rights on public interest grounds.</para><para>The Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 is based on Australia's membership of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 1991. This is a United Nations multilateral agreement establishing an internationally harmonised regime for exclusive intellectual property relating to new plant varieties. The act is a form of patent legislation that coexists with other laws. The evolution of this legislation commenced in the 1970s and has been the subject of public debate over many years. The Fraser government attempted to push a plant varieties scheme through the parliament in 1981. That scheme was considered deficient. It was left to the Senate to work through many of the unresolved issuesâa situation which continues, I believe, under the current coalition government.</para><para>The issue of plant breeders rights was then the subject of an exhaustive inquiry by the then Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources, the committee handing down its report in May 1984. It recommended that a plant varieties rights scheme be established and that legislation be drafted to conform with the 1978 UN convention relating to new varieties of plants. The committee also recommended that the then Department of Primary Industries closely examine all the evidence that was critical of the original bill. The end result of that proper and exhaustive process was the enactment of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. That act enabled plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants they developed. It was designed to stimulate plant breeding in Australia for both our domestic industries and for export.</para><para>Despite the exhaustive consultation that preceded the passage of this legislation through the parliament, significant uncertainty about the impact of the scheme remains in some sections of the community. Concerns remain about the impact on the developing world, management of worldwide plant genetic resources, the ownership of essential food resources, market structures and basic consumer interests. Proprietary rights are designed to provide plant breeders, both public and private, with a means of recouping some of the development costs incurred in the breeding of new plant varieties. Plant breeders rights are exclusive commercial rights to a registered variety of seed and are a form of intellectual property similar to patents and copyright. The Plant Breeders Rights Scheme seeks to encourage innovation and gives innovators legal protection from commercial exploitation of their products by other parties. It is therefore an essential protection for an industry that drives domestic industry development and generates, as I mentioned before, export income of some $200 million per year. </para><para>Ongoing innovation in the seed industry, driving the development and commercialisation of new seed varieties is the key to sustaining our major rural industries. The recently formed Australian Seeds Authority is a nonprofit organisation established to manage seed certification and accreditation in Australia. The establishment of this authority is an important step in the evolution of the Australian seed industry and will underpin development of this emerging rural industry. In addition to seed certification, the Australian Seeds Authority is responsible for matters relating to international seed trade and the development and implementation of an industry-wide quality assurance system. </para><para>The Labor Party has some questions relating to the impact of Australia's international treaty obligations on the Australian seed industryâquestions that go to the heart of the regime managed by the Plant Breeder's Rights Act as amended by this bill. The questions concern the decision taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, to sign the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation summit on world hunger in Rome this year. Does this treaty, for example, require Australian farmers to pay the United Nations a share of profits from crops grown from seeds stored in a global seed bank? Does the treaty, for example, establish a worldwide seed saver network designed to protect biodiversity and give developing countries access to new seed varieties?</para><para>As this government refused to sign this treaty between 1996 and 2001, what was the basis of Minister Truss's change of mind in June this year? According to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 10 June this year, the minister had a number of concerns about the transfer of genetic assets under the treaty, but decided it was better to be involved to protect Australia's interests. The Labor Party and the plant breeders industry need to know the details of these concerns. The same press article reported that the United States and Japan have refused to become parties to the treaty. Did the minister make himself aware of the positions of the United States and Japan and, if so, what is the position of these major seed technology innovators? It appears that decisions will be made by the United States and Japan about a range of seed technology issues outside the architecture of the treaty. Clearly, Australia's involvement in the consideration of these issues by the United States and Japan will be limited. What are the decision making processes under the treaty and the opportunities for signatories to have input into these processes?</para><para>The opposition is interested in the treaty's royalty program. We believe that at the time of the signing of the treaty the royalty details were not established. Have the details of the royalties and how they will be distributed yet been determined? If so, what are the details? Minister Truss is reported as saying that Australian plant breeders will profit from the new system because they can access foreign crops from the seed bank. The opposition assumes that they will have to pay for that access and we seek advice on how that access will work. I trust that the minister will assist the opposition in better understanding the operation of Australia's seed technology regime by seeking answers to the questions raised in the Senate by the shadow minister for primary industries and resources, and here today. However, the Labor Party is pleased to indicate its support for improvements to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act that will clarify breeders' rights, enhance access to the Plant Breeder's Rights scheme and improve its administration.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>10594</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Martyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTYN EVANS</name><name.id>N36</name.id><electorate>Bonython</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOften in the affairs of human society there are quite significant revolutions which change the way in which whole societies are organised. There was the Industrial Revolution of a few hundred years ago, the discovery of printing technology a few hundred years before that and the discovery of mathematics a few thousand years before that. In our own lifetimes, of course, we have seen the IT revolution and the biotechnology revolution, which we are living through at the moment. The predictions are that this will be the biotechnology century. I do not think the biotechnology revolution will last as long as a century. I am sure it will be well through its progress long before the end of this century. </para></talk.start><para>The underlying principle of both the IT discoveries and the biotechnology discoveries is not revolutions in themselves. The underlying principle behind them both is intellectual property and knowledge. In fact, we should describe this current period as a knowledge revolutionâit is not an industrial revolution, as we had previously, but a knowledge revolution. That is what underpins both the IT revolution and the biotechnology discoveries that we are currently beginning to explore. Intellectual property is the underpinning basis of this legislation and the parent act which this bill seeks to amend. As my colleague has outlined, the <inline ref="S347">Plant Breeder's Rights Amendment Bill 2002</inline> seeks to protect the intellectual property contained in the changes to plant breeding which plant breeders and farmers have undertaken in traditional ways and in the new and exciting ways which biotechnology now permits. </para><para>At the moment we are starting to sequence the genetic make-up of a number of very important cereal crops. We have already fully sequenced a number of basic plants. <inline font-style="italic">Aradopsis</inline> was one of the first organisms to have its genetic make-up fully sequenced, and rice and other important cereal crops will soon be fully sequenced in turn. It will not be long before all the major crops and all major animal speciesâas with humansâwill be fully sequenced, and our understanding of those sequences will be much more complete. It will be much longer before we understand the meaning of each of the genes within those sequences, so we might well have a map of the highways but we do not yet have a street-by-street and house-by-house map of each of the towns and cities along the way. But at least we are getting the map of the basic highways, and certainly a map of the countries and the states in each of those countries. That is very much the outline of what I would like to talk about. </para><para>Plant breeders undertake a very important task, because without them from day one humanity would have been very hard pressed to form the basic civilisation which we have now. Without the domestication of crops we would have been very hard pressed to form the civilisation which we now enjoy. Crops provide the basic sustenance which allows us to enjoy our current lifestyle. Crops provide energy for us all and without energy we would have nothing. Those plants have matured enormously over the years. For example, the wheat which we now use as a basic and staple commodity in all our lives was the first genetically engineered crop. Oats, barley and rye were combined in a very fundamental way in that first genetic engineering experiment of early plant breeders to produce wheat. Those who see wheat as a staple and fundamental commodity would, I am sure, be very surprised to find that it is a genetically engineered crop, but that is fundamentally what it is. That points to the fundamental fallacies in the arguments of many of those who oppose so vigorously the use of genetic engineering and biotechnology in our society today. I would like to examine more closely some of those issues in my commentary on this bill which is before the Main Committee today. </para><para>Plant breeders have a great deal of intellectual property to protect. It does not really matter whether they undertake their work in the highly traditional way used on farms for decades, as has been the case in my own state at Roseworthy College, which has a fundamental and long-established reputation. The college has done a lot of work over the decades on improving wheat and other cereal crop varieties, but in the early days it took a very long time to produce an improved crop variety. And, over decades, gradually and slowly to see those fundamental improvements come to light in crops was a very worthwhile experiment and one from which farmers and society benefited. However, it took a great deal of patience and was a hit-and-miss affair. </para><para>Now, of course, technology has improved the way in which plant breeders go about their work. In recent years, the more fundamental process was to induce mutations in the seeds. That could be done by introducing chemical mutagens to the seeds or, in more dramatic ways, by exposing them to radiation and forcing the seeds to mutate, planting large numbers of seeds and seeing which seeds survived, which produced useful mutations and which produced harmful mutations. If you planted enough seeds and exposed them to enough mutagenic chemicals and radiation you might well gain some mutations which were helpful to your breeding program. Then you were able to backcross those seeds with your fundamental stock and thereby produce an improved variety. This allowed a much faster tracking process, but I doubt that the public would be as impressed with that as they would have been with the more traditional but much longer process that was involved in the original plant breeding activity.</para><para>But that never got the publicity which biotechnology has, even though it involved changing the DNA of the plant and cereal crops in very fundamental and large-scale ways, and in ways about which the plant breeders had absolutely no understanding. They could see the outward signs of that DNA change, they could see the expression of that DNA in the outward appearance of the crop but they had absolutely no idea of how the DNA had changed within the crop itself. Largely the green movement and those who opposed genetic modification of crops had no real idea of how that modern plant breeding technology was undertaken.</para><para>Then along came the genetic engineering technologyâbiotechnologyâand we started to understand how DNA worked its magic in the breeding of plants and how genes came to express individual characteristics of plants. They came to express the amount of starch and protein in a cereal crop, the height of the plant, the way in which the leaves grew and how quickly the plant would flower and the likeâall of those characteristics which are so important to farmers and ultimately to the consumer as they affect the amount of crop, the amount of food and the price of the commodity, vital things to people in developed countries and absolutely fundamental life and death issues to people in the least developed countries.</para><para>These things became much easier for farmers and plant breeders to do but also started to take on political significance. A country like China, for example, combines the issues of the developing world and the technology of the First World. China, with its vast population, relatively hard-pressed economy and many people who have basic and subsistence lifestyles also has the technology of the First World in many ways and many highly educated scientists who are able to apply biotechnology. China is an interesting case study which I think we should all learn a little bit more about. In fact, China's farmers purchase and apply some $US5 billion of pesticides each year, which is a very large amount of pesticides, and many of those are long-term residual organophosphate pesticides. China's farmers, in recent yearsâfor example, in 1995âwere applying something like $US100 worth of pesticides per hectare on the cotton crop alone. That is a very substantial amount. For their cotton crop, they were applying $US500 million dollars of pesticides annually.</para><para>China's scientists have started to develop, as Monsanto did in the West, the BT cotton gene, because BT is a naturally occurring bacteria which produces a very significant toxin which the primary pest of cotton finds quite toxic. When that gene is expressed only in the leaves but not in the cotton itself or in the oil, the cotton pest eats the leaf and is affected quite fatally.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HM5</name.id><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Georgiou</name></talker><para>âIt dies.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N36</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Martyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTYN EVANS</name></talker><para>âYes, it dies. That is the practical, end of the day consequence for the cotton pest. In 1997 China planted some 2,000 hectares of BT cotton, as it is known. But by the year 2000 that had spread, China being what it is, and China had planted some 700,000 hectares or 20 per cent of its cotton crop with BT cotton. By now, 2000-03, I am sure the volume is even greater. Farmers who did not use BT cotton varieties sprayed pesticides on an average of 20 times per season. Some households of small farmersâbecause these are small farming householdsâapplied pesticides as many as 40 times a year, and every two or three days by the middle of the season. By contrast, BT cotton farmers applied organophosphate sprays only six times a year on average. They were applying only 11 kilograms per hectare; less than one-fifth of the quantity of pesticides used by non-BT cotton farmers. That is a dramatic difference. By 2000âand of course these estimates are a couple of years old because it is very hard to get the latest figures out of China, and it is hard to keep statisticsâthe estimates were that they had saved nearly 45,000 metric tonnes of formulated pesticide by using that BT cotton, and that was only with planting 20 per cent of China's cotton crop with BT cotton. That is a major reduction in the use of organophosphorus pesticides, which are mainly used in China. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Organophosphorus pesticides are very toxic to humans. Although it is very hard to get the statistics out of China, I believeâand so do many in the fieldâthat these pesticides are a significant cause of death and injury in China. Middle-class Europeansâand, indeed, some in Australia and some in a chamber not far from where I speakâbelieve that it is easy for us to protest and say, `We will not use these kinds of genetically engineered products.' Even though there are no genes in the cotton that expressed this BT cottonâso this shirt that I wear would contain none of those evil genesâand even though it is not toxic to humans, the reality is that some are prepared to sacrifice the lives of Chinese farmers, who would otherwise use that 50,000 metric tonnes of organophosphate pesticides saved when only 20 per cent of the crop was planted with BT cotton. Those lives would be saved immediately and directly by the use of BT cotton.</para><para>We can sit in our lounge rooms in Australia and take the very privileged view and the highly theoretical position that we will not favour the use of these genetically engineered cottons, but of course mankind has been genetically engineering plant and cereal crops for thousands of years. We did that in ways we did not understand, such as leaving the plants alone in the barn at night and letting them do their own genetic engineering, and we had no concept of how the DNA was being modified. But, of course, when scientists modify plants in ways we fully understand and move only one or two genes around, that is totally unacceptable. We are prepared to directly put the lives of Third World farmers at risk from organophosphate poisons, the effect of which we understand very well. We are prepared to put the lives of people in Zambia at risk because we say they cannot eat food that is genetically engineered because it is unacceptable for them. Those lives are immediately and directly at risk, and we can measure that effect immediately and directly.</para><para>We can no longer afford to take that kind of highly intellectual position. That is the kind of decision we must weigh in this genetic engineering and biotechnology debate. We must set those kinds of factors on the scale as well when we have our intellectual discussions about genetic engineering. Those issues must be put and weighed up in this debate as well. We must be very careful about looking at this on just an intellectual basis. Second-generation BT cotton is being examined now, where multiple genes are put in to prevent resistance developing and so on, so these technologies and that intellectual property will move forward. We must look across the whole range of this intellectual property, which bills like this seek to protect. It is not just an industrial revolution before us here; it is an intellectual revolution. To merely examine the technology is to overlook the whole basis of this revolution. The technology itself is almost irrelevant; the focus is the intellectual property that stands behind it. Even though it looks relatively mundane on its surfaceâand even though it is debated in the Main Committee, and few people necessarily contribute to that debateâI am sure that the minister and our colleagues in the chamber understand the fundamental importance of this kind of legislation in underpinning the revolution in knowledge of human affairs that is before us. </para><para>This is the legislation that will form the basis of the knowledge revolution of the 21st century, which is in effect as fundamental as, if not more fundamental than, the industrial revolution of previous centuries. This is the debate that will be the basis of that knowledge revolution. This is the kind of legislation which underpins that knowledge revolution. I think that this bill, along with its companion acts, the Copyright Act and Trade Marks Act, are the legislation of the knowledge revolution. The parliament should endorse them. Of course, we will have our differences about the precise terms, but that is the kind of legislation which this parliament must give the greatest attention to over the next decade or so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>10598</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâI thank the members who have made a contribution to this debate. As this <inline ref="S347">Plant Breeder's Rights Amendment Bill 2002</inline> has been developed over several years, there has been quite a bit of controversy surrounding it. The fact that there were only a small number of speakers demonstrates that the issues that have been around have been able to be negotiated and that there is general support for the content of the bill. I particularly compliment the honourable member for Bonython for his comments and for his contribution to the bill. I think it is a pity that more people around Australia do not hear the sort of message that the member for Bonython has just delivered to the Main Committee.</para></talk.start><para>It is important that people have before them a balanced presentation of the issues in relation to genetic modification. There is such hysteria, and nonsense being spoken in many instances, about genetic modification that the potential exists, as the honourable member for Bonython has rightly said, to delay the development of the best technology in Australia and to even risk Australia missing out on the best varieties and the new technology that farmers and other users of plants are enjoying around the world. His story about the use of chemicals on cotton in China is a story that is obviously repeated in Australia, the United States and a whole stack of countries. Cotton farmers have been one of the major users of organophosphate chemicals. Anything we can do to reduce the use of those chemicals is good for the environment. It is also good for the economics of farmers and, frankly, it is in the overall interests of the nation. Whilst the example of cotton is perhaps the most spectacular, and in many ways least controversial because very little of the cotton product is ever consumed by humans, the same principle can apply to other crops. </para><para>The advantages to the Third World of the development of genetically modified crops are potentially enormous. Hybridisation was a major step forward in agricultural production, but the benefits of hybridisation have never extended to the Third World because of the high cost of seed and the inability to keep the parent stock. GMOs offer the real potential for the best varieties and the best advances to be available to farmers around the world. That does not mean we should take risks. Obviously, everyone wants all of our food products to be safe, and that applies whether they are genetically modified or not. We do need appropriate regulatory machines but, more than anything, we do need some confidence building around the nation about the safety of these products. The sorts of comments that the honourable member for Bonython has just made will certainly help to contribute towards the public debate and a better appreciation of the potential value of genetic modification to Australian agriculture, to our environment and to the nation as a whole. Actually this bill is not specifically about genetic modification, but I know the debate in the Senate and also here managed to bring those subjects very much to the fore. </para><para>A number of questions were asked during the debate and I am happy to try and respond to them. I understand that queries were raised about whether the treaty requires Australian farmers to pay the United Nations a share of profits from crops grown from seeds stored in a global seed bank. I know that that issue has been canvassed from time to time also in the rural media. The treaty provides in general terms for payments to be made to a UN fund in some circumstances. This obligation would arise only in relation to plant genetic resources falling within the scope of the multilateral system established under the treaty. The obligation for such a payment would arise in those circumstances where a commercialised plant genetic resource, using material accessed through the multilateral system, is not available for ongoing research and development. The manner, form and level of payment will be determined by the treaty's governing body in line with commercial practice. </para><para>The payment system in the treaty implicitly recognises the freedom to operate characteristics of PBR. Commercialised plants for food and agriculture protected under plant breeders rights would be exempted from the payments because PBR legislation specifically requires new varieties to be available for ongoing research and development. However, payment may be required under other intellectual property systems such as patents, unless the patentee agrees not to limit further research and development. Australian farmers would benefit under the treaty. They would have continued access to new varieties of plants developed by Australian plant breeders using plant genetic material resources from overseas. </para><para>It was also asked whether the treaty establishes a worldwide seed saver network designed to protect biodiversity and to give developing countries access to new seed varieties. The treaty establishes a binding international framework for cooperation in the conservation, sustainable use and exchange of plant genetic resources, which is open to developed and developing countries alike. The treaty builds upon the existing system established through the Food and Agriculture Organisation in 1983, recognising the need to protect the genetic diversity of plant genetic resources. The system includes important world-class collections held in trust for the benefit of all countries, under the management of the International Agricultural Research Centres.</para><para>The centrepiece of the treaty will be the multilateral system of access and benefit sharing. The multilateral system sets out a facilitated access regime to govern access to, and the exchange of, plant genetic resources for food and agricultureâPGRFAâthat is included in an annex to the treaty and which is under the management and control of the contracting parties to the treaty and in the public domain. The treaty contains measures to encourage individuals and organisations such as the IARCs that hold PGRFA to include that material in the multilateral system. </para><para>There were some questions about Australia's role and the time taken for it to become a signatory to the treaty. Australia's decision to sign the treaty did not involve any change of mind. The treaty was still being negotiated in the period 1996 to 2001, and so it was inappropriate to really make a commitment at that time. When the negotiations were finalised in 2001, Australia joined with other countries in adopting the treaty text. Australia has actively participated in the development of the treaty because it believes in the need for open exchange of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture based on a fair and equitable sharing of the benefits. Australia supports the treaty's objectives and adheres to the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources, which the treaty will replace. </para><para>There were also some questions about whether I had concerns about the transfer of genetic assets under the treaty, and reference was made to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> in June of this yearâan article which I have to confess I do not particularly recall. Australia's participation in the seven-year-long negotiations demonstrated our commitment to developing an effective, open and fair system of transfer of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. During the course of these negotiations, and in its comments when adopting the treaty text, Australia made it clear that the treaty must respect the national intellectual property rights of the contracting parties. The treaty does not change existing rights and obligations under other international agreements. The multilateral system must be applied in a commercially realistic way to facilitate open exchange of PGRFA based on fair and equitable sharing of the benefits and on the need for the list of crops included under the multilateral system to be assessed and extended at the earliest opportunity to enhance the benefits and potential achievable through the treaty.  </para><para>There is also a query about the position of the United States and Japan in relation to this treaty. Both the United States of America and Japan have participated actively during the negotiations. No country voted against the treaty text. Both countries abstained when the vote for the treaty was adopted in November 2001. Both the United States of America and Japan can become parties to the treaty, and on 1 November 2002 the United States signed the treaty.</para><para>There were also questions about the processes and opportunities for signatories to have input to the processes of the operations of this treaty. When the treaty enters into force, the governing body comprising those countries which are contracting parties will become the forum for decisions about the treaty's implementation. Those countries that ratify, accept, approve of or accede to the treaty will become eligible to participate in the governing body. Decisions of the governing body will be by consensus, unless by consensus they decide on some other decision making approach. An interim committee open to all countries will undertake work in anticipation of the treaty's entry into force. There are also some queries about the details on royalties and their distribution which were not in place at the time of signing and a question about how these will be progressed.</para><para>When the treaty text was adopted by the FAO conference in November 2001, provision was made for the establishment of an expert group to develop the terms of the material transfer agreement to underpin the multilateral system. This expert group will also be given responsibility for developing recommendations on the commercial benefit sharing obligations, as outlined in my response to a question which Senator O'Brien put some time ago in relation to the payments to the UN fund. The interim committee met in October at the FAO and developed terms of reference for this expert group. Any payment under this scheme would be payable into a mechanism established by the governing body to receive and utilise funds and become part of the funding strategy. The treaty's funding strategy provides the priority to be given to the implementation of agreed plans and programs for farmers in developing countries, especially in less developed countries and in countries with economies in transition who conserve and sustainably utilise plant generic resources for food and agriculture.</para><para>There were also some questions about the basis upon which Australian plant breeders access foreign plant genetic material and whether they will have to pay. The Australian food and agricultural sectors depend to a significant extent upon access to overseas sources by PGRFA for continued plant breeding and improvement. The treaty will help secure Australia's plant breeders access to these crucial overseas sources. The treaty will build upon and replace the non-binding international undertaking on plant genetic resources established by the FAO in 1983, which has been of great benefit to Australia. If Australia were a party to the treaty at the time it entered into force, it would enable Australia and Australian plant breeders to access PGRFA from other parties to the treaty and to benefit from the new and enhanced global system of conservation, use and exchange. Under the treaty, contracting parties must provide to other contracting parties facilitated access to plant genetic material held under their management and control and in the public domain. Such access would be under the terms of a standard material transfer agreement agreed to by the governing body. As already indicated, there may be a payment obligation in some circumstances. If Australia were to become a member of the treaty, we could have a say in the governing body's formulation of the payment obligations, details and materials transfer agreement. This could be particularly important because our intellectual property systemâfor example, our patentsâhas the potential to trigger the mandatory payment arising when commercial materials are not available for further R&amp;D. Finally, the treaty does not require recipients of material from the multilateral system to subsequently take out intellectual property rights on new varieties. </para><para>Overwhelmingly, the amendments are routine and will make administrative improvements promoting access to and improving the efficient operation of the PBR scheme. We explained the uncertainty that exists in relation to current section 18 of the legislation and, importantly, the changes that have been made to section 49 to ensure that conditions relating to existing and proposed PBR grants are appropriate. Again, I thank the opposition for its support for the legislation. As I have indicated, the government has agreed to an ALP amendment in relation to extending the size of the committee and will move to add those two members to the committee as soon as possible. In the spirit of bipartisan support that has finally been achieved in the Senate after a very long debate, I thank the Main Committee for dealing with it promptly.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>10601</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr GEORGIOU (Kooyong) (11.50 a.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport: Flags of Convenience Vessels</title><page.no>10601</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>10601</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI take this opportunity to raise concerns and opposition voiced by many of my constituents in relation to the reflagging of Australian ships under flags of convenience and their subsequent recrewing with foreign crews. We know that often these crews are working under very appalling and exploitative conditions. It is a tragedy that the Howard government continues with a concerted policy to abandon Australian shipping and Australian jobs in favour of cheap foreign crews. We have seen this policy since the election in 1996. </para></talk.start><para>Average Australians believe that shipping is a vital Australian industry and plays a very important role in providing employment for many Australian coastal communities like those in my electorate of Throsby. I want, in particular, to raise the case of the docking of the <inline font-style="italic">Ikuna</inline> at Port Kembla last Sunday. The docking of that ship met with a community protest. This ship was formerly an Australian flagged and crewed ship out of Newcastle, then called the MV<inline font-style="italic"> Wallarah</inline>. The <inline font-style="italic">Akuna</inline> is now flagged out of Tonga. Its 17 Australian crew have been sacked and replaced with a Tongan crew who receive much lower rates of pay. I think that has been the whole incentive to deregulate the shipping industry, so that the shipowners can employ crews at less than the prevailing conditions of employment that have been long built up in this nation through the efforts of the unionâoriginally the Seamen's Union, now part of the MUA. If you do not believe me, I will quote from Mr Lachlan Payne, the executive director of the Australian Shipowners' Association, who said in a recent article: </para><quote><para>... an Australian seafarer earns about $52,000 a year. Wages under $10,000 ... can apply to some vessels operating under a flag of convenience.</para></quote><para>Regrettably, the plight of the discarded MV<inline font-style="italic"> Wallarah </inline>crew is not unique. Since 1994 the number of Australian flagged ships has almost halved from 74 to 47. This government's continued vendetta against the Maritime Union, its support of the deregulation of the shipping industry, the exemption of foreign crews from work visa hurdles and the allowance of single voyage permits which enable foreign nationals to work on our domestic runs is occurring at the expense of local jobs and is destroying one of Australia's oldest industries. </para><para>I think it is important to note that those who oppose the use of foreign crews on these ships of shame do not harbour any ill feeling towards the crew members. As Dean Summers, the International Transport Federation convenor, said recently in one of our local papers, `They'âmeaning the foreign crewsâ`suffer under this system as well. They need to be paid a minimum wage rather than be exploited.' The impact on local employment is devastating enough but so too is the potential impact on the environment. The recent spate of international maritime incidents involving flags of convenience vessels, many of which, by the way, have visited Australian waters, illustrates just how vulnerable our coastline is to the ships of shame.</para><para>If we look at the recent tragic incident involving the <inline font-style="italic">Prestige</inline> on the north-west coast of Spain, again a flag of convenience ship out of the Bahamas, the impact on the environment of such a disaster in Australia would be absolutely catastrophic. Imagine the effect of such a spillâ twice the size of the <inline font-style="italic">Exxon Valdez </inline>oil spill in Alaskaâon the Barrier Reef. A repeat of the <inline font-style="italic">Prestige</inline> incident in our waters would destroy not only the reef but industries such as fishing and tourism as well. This government is hell bent on destroying local jobs in the shipping industry and endangering other industries and our fragile environment as well.</para><para>I want to finish by paying tribute to the efforts of the MUA and the South Coast Labour Council. Their continued campaign in support of Australian shipping, Australian jobs and our environment, and for the elimination of foreign crew exploitation is to be commended and supported by all who believe in Australian shipping and its importance to our island nation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: Medical Services</title><page.no>10602</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>10602</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday I rise in this chamber to inform the House of the current doctor shortage in the Port Stephens area of my electorate. By way of background, it was around this time last year that we had the death of the doctor in Karuah and we also lost a doctor in Medowie at the beginning of 2001. As such, the patients in these areas have had to go to other general practitioners, predominantly in the Raymond Terrace area, which has seen waiting times go up excessively.</para></talk.start><para>Karuah is a unique little town at the northern end of Port Stephens. It is some distance from Raymond Terrace and there is a lack of regular transport for people to get in to Raymond Terrace to see the doctors. Karuah also has a very large aged community that are in receipt of the pension. Unfortunately, most of the doctors in Raymond Terrace do not bulk bill and that has exacerbated the situation.</para><para>Medowie is a town of some 6,500 constituents, which probably rolls out to around 8,500 people. It is halfway between Karuah and Raymond Terrace. We have been fortunate that the Port Stephens medical practice has established a practice in that town to take up some of the slack. Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, Dr Suraya Felix has decided to leave Medowie. She is an excellent doctor with some 4,000 patientsâabout triple the list that most doctors in the metropolitan areas see. This has created some problems. Whilst the Port Stephens medical practice is going to provide extra doctor services in the area from January and we have Dr Finkelstein setting up a practice in the area, we still have major problems with waiting lists. </para><para>In addition to this, in Lemon Tree Passage this week, the community have been alarmed to hear that Dr Jarvis, a fine doctor, has been suspended by the medical registrations board for financial impropriety. That has exacerbated the situation because, as a peninsular community, it also suffers from a tyranny of distance and a lack of public transport when they need to get to doctors.</para><para>Straight after the loss of the doctors in Karuah and Medowie, my office approached Kay Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing, and received in-principle support for two overseas trained doctors to come to Karuah and Medowie. The biggest problem we have had at the moment is that whilst we have met with a lot of doctors, shown them around the town and provided what support we have, their qualifications have not met the requirements to get medical registration and take up those positions.</para><para>I also get very concerned when the Hunter Area Health Service CEO, Katherine McGrath, comes out on the ABC, as she did recently, saying there is no substantiated case for a doctor to be located in Karuah. I find that very disappointing from a medical professional when you have to address the needs of the community, not just the needs of an area health service.</para><para>My other concern is the RAMAs. In Port Stephens, we have differing RAMA areas. Tomaree Peninsula, which is quite a wealthy area, is a higher level of RAMA than that of Medowie and Karuahâboth areas of need by my interpretation. This is based on the fact that there are a lot of people there with low level medical services. Any doctor coming into either of those towns from tomorrow would have full books. It would not be a case of sitting down and scratching around for work. The need is critical and they would have full books instantly. I know this problem is replicated in other areas.</para><para>The call today is going out to the Hunter Area Health Service, as the health professional organisation, and the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice. I have spoken to Arn Sprogis from that organisation to do what they can to attract the doctors so that we can support them. There is a misconception that I, as a federal member, should be able to advertise, interview doctors and get them into a town. I do not have that expertise; these medical professional units do. In the discussions with Arn Sprogis from the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice this week, there was an in-principle agreement for the division, at the Maitland After Hours Emergency Care, to provide after hours emergency care for the people of Karuah and Medowie. That is most welcome, and it will be welcomed by the community.</para><para>Finally, last Monday night in Medowie there was a meeting put on by the Labor Party to discuss the doctor shortage. I welcomed the initiative they took. They said they were going to debate me. They rang my office to find out if I would be in parliament and then put out a press release saying they were going to debate me at the meeting whilst I was in parliament. I think that is most unfortunate.

Climate change is a reality, as is land degradation, salinity, the deterioration of our water quality, loss of native vegetation and loss of biodiversity. As just one example of the environmental degradation facing Australia, one only has to look at the latest report by the Bureau of Statistics on salinity, which shows that 1,989,000 hectares of farmland, or just under 20,000 farms, are affected by salinity problems. This hurts Australia and hurts the Australian economy. Unless the trends are reversed, our nation faces a grave future. We must learn to live with our environment rather than constantly battle against it, in order to create a sustainable future for our people.  </para></talk.start><para>This is an area of policy that requires national leadership and cooperation with all levels of government. We need a coordinated approach to tackle the problems that are currently facing us and those yet to surface. Unfortunately, the government does not seem to believe in national leadership. The environment is not listed under section 51 of the Constitution, so the government passes the buck to the state governments and only makes a token effort itself. This simply is not good enough. The Labor Party does not believe in passing the buck. One only has to look at Labor's policy to understand this. The shadow minister for the environment and heritage, the member for Wills, has stated Labor's position clearly in two separate policy documents released this year. The policy paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Tackling Salinity: Labor's policy framework for sustainable land and water use</inline>' states: </para><quote><para>To address environmental, sustainable land use and regional development issues effectively, a national effort is required from all sectors of the community and industry, with leadership from the Commonwealth, and coordinated action amongst the states. </para></quote><para>The policy paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Combating climate change: Labor's policy framework for a sustainable future with quality of life and a healthy environment</inline> states: </para><quote><para>We desperately need a federal government that recognises the importance of this issue and will lead national action to reduce emissions in partnership with all sections of society. </para></quote><para>Labor's policy is clear: we will sign the Kyoto protocol and create huge opportunities for local companies to expand and grow.

This is a win-win situation. </para><para>Times have changed and we are far more aware of the consequences of our actions than at any stage in our past. We recognise now that we cannot continue to damage our natural environment with impunity. Only Labor, however, has the policies that will address the problems and create the opportunities that we need to drive our economy forward. Strategic partnerships and cleaner industries will position Australia at the cutting edge of the new economy. Sustainable jobs in sustainable industriesâsurely that is the target that we should set ourselves for the nation. The Prime Minister has a `kinda-sorta' policy. He wants us to meet our Kyoto greenhouse gas emission targets but, by not signing up to the document as a full partner, he is preventing Australian companies from benefiting from the international trading opportunities that are available.</para><para>Labor has a strategy; Labor has a policy. The salinity policy has been available since February and the climate change policy has been available since July. These are just two of a number of policies that have been released by Labor since the comprehensive policy review process began after the last election. There are opportunitiesâand I know the member for Mitchell will agree with me. There is economic growth, sustainable jobs and a protected environment. It is a win-win situation, but only if we act now and only if we lead from the front. Labor's policies, and only Labor's policies, will do that.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drought</title><page.no>10604</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>10604</page.no><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name><name.id>JT4</name.id><electorate>McEwen</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn 1 November, Goulburn Valley Water introduced stage 9 water restrictions to communities in my electorate, including Broadford, Kilmore, Seymour, Wallan and Wandong-Heathcote Junction. At the same time as these restrictions were announced, Goulburn Valley Water enacted an emergency management plan which involves transportation of 600,000 megalitres of water from Seymour to Broadford daily. This equates to around 22 large semi-truck loads of water a day at a cost of around $100,000 to $150,000 per month. If the dry spell continuesâand there is every indication it willâthe amount of water required could double by the end of the summer. All these communities are supplied water from Sunday Creek Reservoir. With no prospect of rain and low water levels, these communities are growing increasingly concerned about the shrinking supply of water and the water quality. </para></talk.start><para>Their fears are not being allayed by Goulburn Valley Water. It plans to pipe water from Tallarook to Broadford to shore up diminishing reserves for towns south of the divide, such as Wallan and Wandong-Heathcote Junction. This means the rural catchment that has long supplied water to Broadford will be piped across an extended mountain range to supply townships that border outer metropolitan Melbourne. In other words, water will be taken from north of the divide and piped south. Meanwhile individuals, families, the elderly, traders and small business operators in Broadford this summer remain dependent on truck loads of water arriving from Seymour to supply them with their most basic need. For the third successive year the people of Wallan are on severe water restrictions throughout the summer period.</para><para>There is no doubt that drought has taken hold in rural areas. The victims are not just constituents in my electorate but constituents around Australia in the electorates of many of my colleagues. What concerns me is the ongoing mismanagement of this finite resource in a rural region regarded as the food bowl of Australia. Seven firms in this region are included in the national top 200 export earners. The water authority also declares in its own promotional material that the water it supplies ensures the smooth operation and delivery of 25 per cent of the state's rural outputâsuch as dairy, beef, fruit and vegetablesâwith export earnings of over $1 billion.</para><para>But Goulburn Valley Water simply does not have a strong record of consultation with its customers, whether they be farmers or householders. It has proved this over and over again, and this is of course reflected in the distrust of the authority shown by so many sectors of the community. For example, the water authority collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in bulk water fees by selling drinking water to irrigators this year at the same time as it was imposing water restrictions right across the Goulburn Valley. This decision has left local residents and traders feeling utterly betrayed. The <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Times</inline> reported that shire councils had not even been informed of the decision, even though the water authority insisted that a program of consultation had been undertaken. The question remains: with whom?</para><para>Goulburn Valley Water chief executive, Laurie Gleeson, has since confirmed that the authority has made 9,000 megalitres available to irrigation farmers through the water exchange over the past two years because `water has been in excess of current annual domestic and industrial requirements'. Perhaps he could explain in more detail to my local communities exactly what excess water he managed to identify and how many of my towns, especially the towns that are on water restrictions, will be affected. And where exactly was this so-called excess water sold? Certainly the water authority has not taken up any opportunity offered to it to explain so far. Mitchell Shire Council recently coordinated a meeting of concerned residents and traders in Broadford which I attended. The water authority replied that it was unable to attend because of caretaker conventions in place for the state election. I have never heard such a blatant excuse to avoid facing up to a group of concerned residents in my life. I want two things to happen in regard to this issue: Mitchell Shire to stop all new development and the Goulburn Water Authority to answer its customers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Prime Minister: Christmas List</title><page.no>10606</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>10606</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe silly season is now upon us and everyone from the Prime Minister down wants to put on the red suit and cash in on Christmas. So I wonder what Santa will leave in the Prime Minister's stocking at Kirribilli House this Christmas. Of course, it will all depend on whether he has been bad or good. I can just imagine the Prime Minister sitting on Santa's knee at the local shopping mall and Santa asking whether he has been a good boy this year and whether he has told any fibs. Not even to questions about the `children overboard' incident? And what about good manners? He did say `Yes sir' every time to George Bush, but he did not say he was sorry to Justice Kirby. </para></talk.start><para>Has he been kind to older and less fortunate people? Well, there was that little matter of wanting to increase pensioner payments for prescriptions and also wanting to stop people getting access to disability support payments. But then he did give $2.3 billion to subsidise private health insurers so that they could give people free golf clubs, camping tents and music CDs. And what about all that money for Rio Tinto and Manildra?</para><para>What will the Prime Minister be asking Santa for this year? Will it be the set of Henselite bowls or the <inline font-style="italic">Reader's Digest Book of Caravanning Around Australia</inline>? Or will it be the Smokey Dawson rocker and a subscription to <inline font-style="italic">Wisden's Cricket Almanac</inline>? Will he be sitting back and enjoying retirement before the next year is over? Or if he is still Prime Minister, maybe he would prefer the GI George doll that nukes Iraq when you press the red button.</para><para>Just what does the Prime Minister want from Santa that his cabinet colleagues have not already given him? The Treasurer gave him the Sergeant Pepper's album for his 63rd birthday, so he will not want another one of those. Senator Coonan offered him the use of her weekender over the holidays, but he would not want to be seen down there. The minister for immigration sent him a landscape painting of the Woomera detention centre with a razor wire frame. That will look very nice over the mantelpiece at the Lodge.</para><para>Senator Alston sent him a Batman walkie-talkie set. He will get better service on that than on his mobile phone. And Danna Vale sent him a plastic battleship to play with in the bathtub. Now he can be the admiral of `the mightiest little navy in the world'. But he does not know what he will do with those oversize torpedoes that Senator Hill sent him. Maybe he could use them as paperweights in the office. And what was the Minister for Foreign Affairs thinking of when he sent him a suspender belt? The minister for education sent him a portrait of himself with the instructions to hang it behind the door. He could think of one small room where it would look just perfect. But what can he do with the present from the minister for workplace relations? He is still trying to clean up after those rottweilers that Peter Reith gave him. How will he cope with a pair of Welsh corgis as well? </para><para>It is very hard being the Prime Minister who has everything. What can he ask Santa for this Christmas? But it is a different story for many ordinary Australiansâthose families who were looking forward to their tax return to buy gifts for their children but who got a bill to pay instead; those families with relatives overseas who cannot get a visitors visa to Australia in order to share the holiday season with them. And there are so many; I can name at least 14 cases in my electorate alone. What about those families who did not work for his brother Stan and who lost their entitlements when they were retrenched? What about those families that look at the bigger slice that income tax takes out of their pay packet each week? But at least for the time being we may have a peaceful new year. I just hope that the Prime Minister asks Santa for thatâa peaceful new year. Merry Christmas and a peaceful new year to all the staff, members of parliament and to all Australians.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Youth: Waverley Action for Youth Services</title><page.no>10607</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>10607</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOne of the uplifting aspects of our role as members of parliament, in contrast to listening to the member for Fowler, is to be able to observe the work of so many organisations that help those in our community, particularly the disadvantaged. Those organisations rely on the voluntary efforts of members of the community, along with professional staff whose dedication, often at salary levels that do not reflect the importance of their work or the hours and stresses they face, make our society a more compassionate and caring one. </para></talk.start><para>One of those organisations in my electorate is Waverley Action for Youth Services, known as WAYS. WAYS has operated in the eastern suburbs of Sydney since 1979. In that time it has been at the forefront of assisting young people in the area through a wide range of services. I know that it has made a tangible and positive difference to the lives of hundreds. Indeed, every week WAYS works with over 900 young people.</para><para>WAYS has established itself as a one-stop shop for young people, aiming to provide the full suite of services that they might need. Its programs include sport and recreational activities; mental health programs; counselling; school education programs; and housing, employment, training and vocational programs. It is assisted by the generous support of many within the local community. It is also the recipient of financial support from councils and the state and federal governments.</para><para>In the latter context, I know how important support from the federal government has been to the service, and I was therefore delighted that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs had the opportunity to visit WAYS earlier this year as part of National Youth Week. Federal funding for WAYS is provided through a number of programs. It is part of the Job Network intensive assistance program, through which it provides case management services to people referred by Centrelink. It assists clients overcome some of the barriers to employment in areas such as housing support, mental health issues, drug and alcohol problems and numeracy and literacy skills.</para><para>The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations also supports WAYS through the Job Network matching program. Through the Job Network, WAYS assists in filling employment vacancies with unemployed clients. WAYS also is an active participant in and beneficiary of the Job Placement, Employment and Training Program, known as JPET. JPET funding has allowed WAYS to help people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness who need a range of assistance with accommodation, legal counselling and personal support, with the aim of remaining in employment or returning to school. I know that JPET is a vital part of their services in the eastern suburbs and, in an area with many disadvantaged young people, continued support from the federal government is extremely important.</para><para>WAYS is an innovative organisation and works closely with other community groups to deliver outcomes for young people in the most effective way. In this respect, I was pleased to be able to support the launch of a new program by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the member for Bradfield, which has brought together the skills and experience of both WAYS and the Salvation Army's Oasis Youth Support Network. A new joint initiative called FLOW is a pilot program funded by the Commonwealth department of education and aims to bring young people back into the mainstream educational and vocational training sessions.</para><para>Like many community organisations, WAYS does rely on the generosity and support of the community. Just this month it launched the `buy a brick' campaign to help it purchase the old police station at Bondi, which it hopes to use for accommodation for homeless people as well as for counselling services. It has 600 bricks left to sell and I encourage members of the eastern suburbs communities to support this fundraising program for what will be an important addition to WAYS' ability to assist young people in my area of Sydney.  </para><para>I place on record the thanks of all the residents of Wentworth for the work of the WAYS board, its dedicated staff, led by Amanda Webster, Russell King and John Gilbert, and all those who give a hand to a service that I believe is one of the nation's very best.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentarians: Backgrounds</title><page.no>10608</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>10608</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is an urban myth which is foul and most untrue that is perpetuated in this place. It is repeated every day with zeal by the member for Warringah and other government members in their attempts to displace the public view in terms of working people and average Australians. This parliament is subject to insult after insult about the backgrounds of membersâwhere they grew up, where they reside, where they were educated and where they educate their children.</para></talk.start><para>But the attacks put forward by the government are not so much an attack on politicians as an attack on working people and their families. Working people, ordinary Australians, are the backbone of this country. They are the lifeblood of industry, they are the consumers, they hold the values and ideals and, most importantly, they are the people that we all represent as members of parliament. The background and choice of employment of members of parliament before being elected is important. But, in itself, it means less than the ideals and values that we all hold and how we represent our constituents. The continual perpetration of this urban myth that all politicians are cast from the same mould and are a homogenous, bland group is completely false and without basis.</para><para>Members of parliament are representative of their own electorates and, in a broad sense, are a microcollection of the Australian people. Labor representatives are no different. In fact, they are more closely representative of their constituents through their own experiences, lives and, in particular, their formative years and their professions. The official record of data and detail about politicians contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook </inline>of<inline font-style="italic"></inline>2002 is a fantastic record of all sorts of information. Unfortunately, it is not expansive enough to include all of our professions and past jobs but rather only what we did just prior to entering parliament.</para><para>I have conferred with Labor members of parliament and consulted the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Political Almanac</inline> of 2002. It is a completely different picture from what is portrayed in the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook</inline>. For example, in Queensland, Senator John Hogg was a teacher with a science degree and taught for many years in schools. Joseph Ludwig, a senator for Queensland, grew up in Roma, lived in public housing and worked on weekends at a fruit shop and also as a TAB ticket writer. That is quite interesting. He studied law part time while working and spent a decade in the Army Reserve. He also worked as a public servant as an inspector in industrial relations. George Campbell, from New South Wales, became a shipwright's apprentice after leaving school. He came to Australia and worked at the naval dockyards at Williamstown.</para><para>Senator John Faulkner was taught in a public school and taught children with disabilities after getting his degree. Senator Hutchins, from New South Wales, went to a Catholic school and gained a degree but, interestingly enough, worked as a garboâhe tells me he was not a garbage collector; he was a garbo. He was a forklift driver with TNT before joining the Transport Workers Union. Gavin Marshall, from Victoria, was an apprentice electrician and an electrician. Trish Crossin, from the Northern Territory, was an early childhood teacher. Jan McLucas, a senator for Queensland, was a primary teacher and a city councillor. Her parents had a dairy farmâshe is a dairy farmer!</para><para>But in the House of Representatives I reckon it is even more interesting. Dick Adams, the member for Lyons, was illiterate at age 21 and taught himself to read and write. He is now more proficient than most. He is known as a foodie and loves both his food and the promotion of Tasmanian produce. He worked as a meat worker for the Longford meatworks. Graham Edwards, the member for Cowan, left school at 15 to work as a sheet metal worker before joining the railways. At age 21, he was working as a fireman. He served in Vietnam and, as we all know, he lost his legs there to a landmine, but when he was discharged from the Army he worked as a hospital clerk. Joel Fitzgibbon was an auto electrician and established his own garage. He studied at TAFE and went on to university. Steve Gibbons, from Bendigo, was an apprentice motor mechanic who left school at 16. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Oxley will please refer to members by their electorate as well.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83E</name.id><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name></talker><para>âSharon Grierson, from Newcastle, studied to be a primary school teacher and studied law part-time while being a mother.

I would like to highlight a unique project that a group on the Central Coast has put together to assist the drought stricken communities in western New South Wales. The Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby, of which I am very proud to say I am a member, has put together a unique drought relief effort. On 14 December, two semitrailers fully laden with 44 pallets of bottled drinking water in 10-litre containers will leave the Central Coast of New South Wales for Cobar in central western New South Wales. </para></talk.start></continue><para>While some of New South Wales has received rain, Cobar and many of the surrounding districts are still very much in the grips of drought. The Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby felt that because the hinterland of the Gosford Shire is one of the largest producers of spring water in Australia it was appropriate to send our product to Cobar in western New South Wales to show our genuine concern for the predicament that many of our western communities face. The water was donated by Peats Ridge Springs. They have donated, as I said, 44 palletsâapproximately 34,000 litresâof their excellent packaged spring water. That is a very generous donation from this company, which is a Central Coast company. It is a family based operation and has grown from a very small operation to a multimillion dollar business in a few years. I congratulate Livio Pace and the Pace family for this wonderful donation and for all the other things that they do for the Central Coast community. They are a very generous company.</para><para>Linfox Australia Pty Ltd, a transport company who are also based in Somersby, have generously agreed to transport the load to Cobar free of chargeâagain, a very generous donation. The Rotary Club of Cobar and the drought relief committee of Cobar have secured a warehouse, compliments of Mackenzies Transport, to store and distribute the water. The Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby are also helping out by agreeing to cover the cost of the packaging of the water. So Saturday will be quite a special day for the Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby. Unfortunately I do not think that I will be able to be there because of the vagaries of the parliamentary sitting. This being the last parliamentary sitting of the year, I am not sure what time we will get out of this place today, tonight or tomorrow.

We do have an understanding of the difficulties they are going through. We have an understanding of how important the rural communities are to our economy. Whilst some of us in the larger regional centres might take it for granted that we can walk into our supermarkets and have a wonderful range of fresh produce, we do know that it comes from the hardworking people of the rural areas and we know how much they are suffering at the moment from this terrible drought.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am very pleased to see that some communities in northern New South Wales have received considerable rain over the past week. It is certainly not enough to break the drought. This very generous donation of two semitrailer loads of bottled drinking water from Peats Ridge Springs is very much a symbol of the Central Coast's concern for those communities. I congratulate the members of the Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby for putting together this unique idea. The Rotary Club of Kariong Somersby is one of the more active rotary clubs on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Whilst I said that I am a member of that club, I really cannot claim any credit for the wonderful work that they do. Because of the parliamentary commitments that we all have in this place it is not possible for me to attend as many meetings as I would like to. Again, I congratulate all the members of that Rotary club.

Since the demise of Ansett and the collapse of the local cut-price operator Impulse Airlines, air travel to and from Newcastle has been more difficult than ever. With the added burden of skyrocketing insurance premiums, it was a challenge to service regional routesâa challenge no-one seemed anxious to take up. But with the Impulse fleet taken over by Qantas, fortunately the service was maintained.</para></talk.start><para>However, before long it was obvious that Qantas was unwilling to persist with the less financially rewarding frequent short trips to and from Sydney, and in July it axed 42 return services a week between Williamtown and Sydney. It was also obvious to the paying passenger that cut-price fares would not be offered again. The 19-seat Impulse aircraft were not so popular, particularly at the higher fare regime that was implemented, and soon these aircraft were withdrawn. Although services were replaced with the older aircraft of the Dash 8 Qantas link fleet, the consequences were dearer fares and less frequent flights.</para><para>In our nationalised and globalised economy, the changes had serious impacts on the many businesspeople who choose a quality of lifestyle offered outside Sydney but need to commute daily or regularly to maintain their business activities. The provision of a very early daily service to Sydney each morning is essential if businesspeople are to be able to connect to capital city flights and spend a full working day at these locations. It is an area that needs urgent attention by Qantas.</para><para>It has been reassuring that Qantas has retained its jet maintenance facility, as a result of direct representations to its manager of regional aviation, Narendrah Kumar, by the airport manager, the chairman and me. The performance of this facility remains high, and it is hoped that Qantas will recognise that investment in regional aviation needs a holistic approach. Qantas's sponsorship of the Knights football team is an investment the region will return to it through loyalty, if that investment is maintained.</para><para>Competitive price structures are desperately needed and are important to retain the travelling market. The impact of cut-price services offered originally by Impulse, before the regional aviation downturn, is that people did choose to fly. In fact, the Qantas market grew by 50 per cent during Impulse's Newcastle operation. There is certainly a lesson there for those interested in sustaining and growing the aviation industry. Fortunately, we have continued and persisted.</para><para>I would like to pay credit to Newcastle airport and to congratulate Newcastle Airport Ltd on gaining a commercial partner, Sangreal Holdings, to develop and manage $80 million worth of infrastructure on site development. It is wonderful news for Newcastle and the Hunter region. The new infrastructure could deliver 350 new jobs. It also means an exciting new direction, creating economic growth and associated spin-offs for the local economy, particularly in the field of aviation services, support services and the avionics and engineering industry that is associated now with our airport. Unfortunately, the government has done very little to assist regional aviation, but fortunately for Newcastle and the Hunter a proactive board and management team have tackled this challenge very well. I congratulate them on their determined efforts. I also congratulate Horizon Airlines for taking up the Sydney flights. </para><para>As Newcastle regional airport also share their facilities with RAAF Williamtown, it is fortunate for us that that is a positive and complementary relationship. It is also important for Defence that they assist in building a skills mass in avionics and aeronautical engineering. They cannot be the only industry incubators, and certainly partnerships like those posed by the regional airport will be to their advantage. In concluding, I would like to say that I have just returned from the Australian Defence Force Academy's graduation parade and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all the midshipmen and officer cadets of the 2002 graduation class. I also convey my appreciation and congratulations to the commandant, Air Commodore Julie Hammer, on an excellent outcome from her academics, staff and cadets. I also extend my appreciation to Rear Admiral Adams for his generous hospitality.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliament: Services</title><title>Gilmore Electorate</title><page.no>10612</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Gilmore Electorate</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>10612</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to start by making some comments about the member for Fowler's disgusting speech in the chamber just a few moments ago.

I wonder how her family feels about the filthy use of words she displayed in this House.</para></talk.start><para>Since coming to parliament, I have stood up on many occasions and spoken on a range of subjects, many of which have long been forgotten. Today I rise to acknowledge the contribution of those people who make it logistically possible for me to do so. I am sure many of us think we are an island: that we can stand alone and that we can do it by ourselves. A moment's quiet reflection will tell you otherwise. We may not be an island, but we politicians are the tip of an iceberg. Like an iceberg, many of the people who help and support us are unseen, whether by choice or circumstance. I would like to personally and individually thank each of those who make it possible for me to stand up here and speak on behalf of so many people. That is quite an obligationâand it is an honourâand I am thankful that there are people here and in my electorate to help me.</para><para>In this house things do not happen by accident. The old clichÃ© is right: many hands do make light work. Here in the house there are hundreds of people supporting my activity and that of other members, and making sure things move as smoothly as possible. Their collective efforts, whilst they are often unnoticed, at the end of the year are certainly appreciated. From Danica, the lady who collects the rubbish from my office and cleans the bathroom, to the support services in the library, the IT staff, the security staff, the clerks, the `grey and greens' sitting here in this room, and especially Carol in our corridor, and the Hansard staff and Broadcasting people, they all fulfil their duties with courtesy and grace. I extend special thanks to Monica and Nelka from the Hyatt breakfast staff. You are two very special people. How can I forget the fixers of our fax machine when we forget to turn it on? They work in relative invisibility. Theirs is an attitude of: `We are here to help others'. The least I can do, as a politician who uses the house they protect and look after, is thank them.</para><para>We come here regularly. We see everything in its place, and when we need things they are always there. We need to take the time to deliver a sincere and heartfelt thank you. I would like to mention every one of the parliamentary staff who have assisted me throughout the course of the year. Two years ago I first thanked the staff of parliament who helped me directly or indirectly. At the risk of sounding repetitive, they have continued to help me. Although some of the names might have changed, the service certainly has not. There are still the cheery greetings, there are still the smiles and there is still the willingness to please. You have all done a wonderful job, and I appreciate your commitment and dedication in coming back day after day to make my life easier. </para><para>When thanking people, I cannot forget those people in my electorate of Gilmore who did so much last Christmas and who did so much again this year. I thank all those who contributed to fighting the firesâthere are so many of you; you are too numerous to mention. I thank the ordinary people who gave donations of money or time to the drought relief program and all those who responded to the Bali tragedy. The community got together to share in the grief. Thank you for showing solidarity in the face of adversity, for getting together as a community and for the spirit you have shown in those hard times. When the time comes, we all work together to help and support each other. In a way, we are part of a team that makes things happen. Do not underestimate yourselves. Without you, my job would be a lot more difficult.</para><para>A lot has been said in relation to the media, but we in Gilmore are fortunate to have a very community oriented media.

Indeed, all members would concur with those sentiments. One hundred and twenty years ago, on Christmas Eve, the Ashesâthe historic trophy coveted by the two cricket nations, England and Australiaâwas born. In order to properly commemorate this anniversary, I thought it was fitting to commence a `Return the urn' campaign. In 1882 at a social match at Sunbury, where I live, a resident tendered the renowned urn to Ivo Bligh, the then English cricket captain. After his death it was given to the Marylebone Cricket Club. For over 70 years, the urn has been locked up at Lord's. To rectify this injustice, I wrote to the MCC on 26 June and requested:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... on the occasion of the upcoming English tour in 2002-2003, that the M.C.C. release <inline font-style="italic">The Ashes </inline>and deliver them to Steve Waugh, as captain of Australia, the current `holder' of <inline font-style="italic">The Ashes</inline>.</para></quote><para>That is an unusual phrase, since we have never had the urn in Australia. I added: </para><quote><para>Moreover, the trophy should only be returned to England when their cricket team has defeated Australia. </para></quote><para>On 2 July I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister along the same lines, asking him to indicate whether he supported the idea. I have yet to receive a response on this matter from the Prime Minister. I did, however, receive a response from the MCC. On 5 July they responded that they would not accede to this request because:</para><quote><para>... the urn is very old, extremely delicate and utterly irreplaceable. In our view, cricket fans ... would not forgive us if anything happened to harm this most historic and fragile of sporting artefacts ...</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>âDo they trust us?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN3</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>âIndeed, do they trust us? We are able to transport in this day and age the works of da Vinci, Picasso and Rembrandt through the galleries of the world but we are not able to transport this coveted, cherished clay pot originating from Sunbury. But I should not fret, because in the letter they did indicate to me that they have a crystal trophy modelled on the Ashes urn, which is now presented to the winner of each Ashes series. With all respect to the gentleman of the rarefied dining room at Lord's, this response is inadequate and says more about why the English team is in such a parlous state than anything else. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact is that, as I said in my letter to them in June, despite Australia and England having played for the ashes for 120 years and despite Australia having won the last sevenânow eightâAshes series in a row, the actual trophy has never left Lord's. Even on the occasion of the Centenary Test in Melbourne in 1977 it was only seen fit to send a replica of the urn. This I believe is contrary to the spirit of the original gift made at Rupertswood, Sunbury, and is moreover contrary to the spirit of cricket itself. Even the New York Yacht Club, after its first defeat in the America's Cup, saw fit to unbolt the trophy in 1983 after 132 years and deliver it to the new winner. There has been no respect shown to the Australian cricket team and the Australian public with respect to the Ashes. It is a sad reflection on the Marylebone Cricket Club. It is sad reflection on their lack of understanding about how important that urn is to the people of Australia.</para><para>A `Return the urn' cricket match is to be played on the original site where the urn was handed over on 24 December 1882. We are holding it on 22 December this year, the Sunday before Christmas. The game will be played between Rupertswood Cricket Club and the Abbotsford Anglers. It is about time that the English understood that this urn is something to be shared. It should be possessed by the winners. We have won the last eight series in a row and it is about time. We can let them keep the replica, because they are only a shadow of a decent team and therefore they should probably keep a replica of the urn. The original urn, the quality urn, should reside in Australia. At every test match that England plays against Australia, it should go to the cricket ground in each state of Australia where that match is being played, so that the Australian public can see it. I seek leave to table the letters that I have referred to.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia Post</title><page.no>10614</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>10614</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to speak about representations made to me by a constituent of mine who lives in the suburb of Riverhills in the electorate of Ryan. He contacted me several months ago in relation to Australia Post, and I was delighted to be able to help him. Indeed, we were very successful in our negotiations and discussions with Australia Post. The matter involved trying to get an Australia Post post box installed at the Centenary Place Shopping Centre in the suburb of Riverhills, which is a very nice part of the electorate of Ryan. One of the reasons why a gentleman by the name of Walter Wood, who runs the Riverhills newsagency, contacted me was that during the previous 12 months a substantial number of people had raised the matter with him, as the proprietor of the local newsagency. They asked him, `Why isn't there a post box here when there is clearly huge demand for one?' </para></talk.start><para>I was delighted to be able to get in touch with Australia Post and make representations on behalf of those people in Riverhills. We put together a petition, and a considerable number of Ryan residents came together on the issue. They were delighted that the federal member for Ryan was able to contact them and meet them. I went over to the Centenary Place Shopping Centre, inspected all the shops there and talked to the local residents. There is a new apartment complex just around the corner from the shopping centre, which has probably led to great interest in the issue of having a post box located at the shopping centre. I compliment Australia Post very strongly on their warm reception to my overtures. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>âDid they do it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMX</name.id><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name></talker><para>âThey did indeed come to the party and provided an Australia Post post box, which is a very significant issue. It has been provided on a trial basis. My lobbying, as the new federal member for Ryan after a year in the job, proved to be very successful. I am delighted to be able to say that the petition that we organised made a difference. I compliment Mr Walter Wood, who raised this matter with me many months ago. I was delighted to be able to help him. He has certainly given me feedback that the people that he has since spoken to have been very complimentary regarding the federal member for Ryan.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In recent weeks a considerable number of residents in Toowong got in touch with me because Australia Post was again on the move. This time they were going to take away a post box, which seemed quite astonishing to me, considering that this post box was in a location that was very popular, particularly with elderly residents, many of whom used it. Again, as the new federal member for Ryan, with a great deal of enthusiasm, I contacted the local Australia Post people and asked them whether this was true. Indeed, it seemed to be in the pipeline, but through the good office that I holdâand it is a great privilege to hold itâas the new federal member for Ryan, I was delighted to be able to make representations on behalf of the people of Toowong, who represented to me very strongly that they did not want this post box taken away because it was used frequently by elderly people. It was strategically located so that elderly residents did not have too far to walk in order to post letters. This part of Toowong is a hilly area and it would have been very inappropriateâindeed disgracefulâif Australia Post had removed this post box. As the new federal member for Ryan, I had the great pleasure of getting in touch with Australia Post and making representations to them. I think that is what being a local member is all about. </para><para>As a junior member of this parliament, I am delighted to see my friend and colleague the member for Flinders in the chamber. I know that he is doing a wonderful job in his electorate. He is filling the big shoes of the former member for Flinders, and I know that he is doing his job with great enthusiasm and dedication. I have the pleasure of sitting next to him in the chamber, and I am delighted to say that we are working well together in this parliament and are representing our constituencies to the best of our abilities. </para><para>Australia Post is certainly an agency that holds a very important place in our country. It is incumbent upon all members of this parliament, when they receive overtures from their constituents, to do the right thing by those constituents. I know that on my side of the parliament every member is doing that.

The hypocrisy in all of this can be found in the member for Paterson's long-running campaign to protect the local environment and in particular plant life in that local area. In fact he has been the champion of urban housing guidelines which he is now contravening. His hypocrisy has caused local developers in the area to refer to the member for Paterson as `Bob the Builder' because they feel there is one rule for them and another for local developers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But there is more, Mr Deputy Speaker. Following a story about Bob the Builder's antics in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on 27 November, the member for Paterson had his lawyers fire out letters to the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> and the Port Stephens <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline>, warning against printing stories similar to that which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>. In the letter, the member for Paterson's lawyers claim that he has complied with his conditions of consent. This is despite the fact that the council's general manager has publicly acknowledged that this is not true. As I said, the matter has been referred to ICAC and I and residents in the Paterson electorate eagerly await the outcome and the response of the council.</para><para>The member for Paterson has been a pretty busy boy. In addition to his development activities he maintains a consultancy business, sits both in this place and on the Port Stephens council and until recently sat on the insurance inquiries and complaints board, appointed by Minister Hockey. I note that the member for Paterson informed the Clerk only this week of his departure from that board in November.</para><para>I also note that until September, when I raised in this place the matter of his place on the council, the member for Paterson had not declared his position on the council on the register of members' interests, nor had he declared the allowance he receives as a councillor on Port Stephens council. He had listed his position on the IEC, he had listed his consultancy, but somehow he failed to remember to list his position on the council. This raises questions about the member for Paterson's concern about his eligibility to sit in this place under section 44 of the Constitution. There is a large body of legal opinionâit has not been tested in the High Courtâthat local government representatives do hold an office of profit under the Crown. If this were tested, it is likely that the member for Paterson would be found to be ineligible to sit in this place. That is the only reason I can think of, while having submitted such an extensive declaration to the Clerk, why he could possibly fail to declare that position on the council. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âI want to explain to the honourable member for Flinders that, under standing order 84A, interventions may only be allowed during an order of the day.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hunt</name></talker><para>âI apologise to the Deputy Speaker.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âNo need for an apology.

Colin Elso is a fine example of a citizen who has identified a problem, acted on it and brought together a democratic coalition in order to achieve the outcome he seeks. Colin Elso and the residents of Palmerston Avenue and the neighbouring avenues are concerned about road safety on the Mornington Peninsula freeway between Dromana and Arthurs Seat. They face a series of challenges. </para></talk.start><para>VicRoads, which I respect as a body and which does great work, has nevertheless failed to maintain to an adequate, acceptable and respectable standard the roads, fencing and general area. Mr Elso and 180-plus residents have gathered to produce a petition. That petition calls upon VicRoads to fulfil its obligations to maintain that area. The principal concern is road safety for both the road users and the residents. Of concern to the residents is the significant number of holes, breakages and gaps in the fencing, all of which pose a risk of small children entering this busy freeway. The consequence of that could be a very real human tragedy.</para><para>To give due respect to the petition, I read to the House the core concerns that the residents of Palmerston Avenue have in relation to the failure of VicRoads to uphold the full safety standards that you would expect along the Mornington Peninsula freeway between Dromana and Arthurs Seat. The residents note that they have the following problems: firstly, large branches that have fallen from trees either onto the road or in the immediate vicinity of the freeway; secondly, large amounts of rubbish against the fence and along the roadside edge; thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, numerous holes in the wire fencing along the edge of the freeway and along the Palmerston Avenue sideâeach of these is a potential point of access for small children to the freeway siteâand, fourthly, as has been noted in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper and various local newspapers recently, the increase in traffic along the Mornington Peninsula freeway over the last three years due to the increase in both permanent residents and temporary holiday makers on the Mornington Peninsula. The high speeds along these areas lead to a great deal of noise. Residents would like to decrease the speed so as to decrease the noise level. In respect of all of the above, the residents as ratepayers and as residents have petitioned VicRoads to reduce the noise levels and to provide a much safer environment for the many young children who reside in and around the area.</para><para>Ultimately this is an example of community participation in helping to protect the safety of a community. Democracy is not an easy process. Communities do have to work to achieve the outcomes that they want. I commend Colin Elso, Mrs Elso and all of the residents of Palmerston Avenue and the neighbouring streets on their activism. I have made representations to the Chief Executive of VicRoads, Mr David Anderson. I petitioned the Chief Executive of VicRoads to take seriously the concerns of the residents in relation to the Mornington Peninsula freeway between Dromana and Arthurs Seat and to act upon them.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forestry: Management</title><page.no>10618</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>10618</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn February last year the Gallop Labor government was elected in Western Australia, in part due to its policy of ceasing logging in old-growth forests. This is a matter that is very important to Western Australians and that they feel strongly about. With few areas of tall forest in WA, these relatively small but unique areas in our south-west are important to us. The world's only jarrah, karri, tingle, wandoo, blackbutt and tuart forests grow there. The decisions we make with respect to logging and mining in these areas must be informed by careful evaluation to avoid wherever practicable serious or irreversible damage to the environment.</para></talk.start><para>It was an integral part of the WA Labor election commitment that a comprehensive industry assistance package worth $123 million would be provided to support the policy. This included $15 million promised by the Commonwealth as part of the original regional forest agreement. The WA state government has now increased its contribution to $136 million. The federal government, on the other hand, and in stark contrast, has reneged on its promise and is refusing to develop a joint approach with the state for the expenditure of these funds, at a time when they are most needed.</para><para>The Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Mr Tuckey, and the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald, are dictating to WA the level at which jarrah yield should be set before they will consider releasing the funds. At a time when the pressures on the Australian environment continue to grow and communities are demanding that environmental values are taken into account there is no place for these tactics being employed by the federal government. Managing the activities of people in a way that conserves habitats, while sustaining resources and industries, is extraordinarily complex and difficult. Logging forests is not just about the wood or the trees. Frankly, neither Minister Tuckey nor Minister Macdonald can see either.</para><para>To their credit, the Western Australian state government have established a robust and legitimate process whereby the WA Conservation Commission will determine appropriate yields. This process, which provides for public review under the relevant state legislation, will be open, transparent and involve the community. The WA Conservation Commission is responsible for the preparation of the proposed forest management plans. The new FMP, which will be implemented from 1 January 2004, will be referred for environmental impact assessment to the Environment Protection Authority. The WA government will stand behind the EPA assessment and make decisions on yield after they report.</para><para>This process for determining the ecologically sustainable yield for our forests deserves the full support of the federal government, as do the local communities in the south-west, including the timber workers. For ministers Tuckey and Macdonald to be withholding funds to support this process and these people on the grounds that WA is not cutting down enough trees is environmental vandalism.</para><para>Many environmental issues cut across industry and government portfolios, which means that responses need to be integrated and coordinated. Ecosystems and ecological processes are not sympathetic to political boundaries, election cycles or the timing of government budgets. The days of placing economic and political interests ahead of our environment are gone. Western Australians have spoken on this issue. Timber workers in the south-west of Western Australia are waiting for resources from the federal government, and ministers Tuckey and Macdonald should accept their decision, stop holding the people of my state to ransom and honour the promises that were made prior to the election.</para><para>I agree with Premier Gallop that their demand for Western Australia to increase our jarrah yield to the vicinity of 200,000 cubic metres before funds will be released is both disingenuous and environmentally irresponsible. In the interests of the community, not only in Western Australia as a whole but in particular in the communities in the south-west, many of which are dependent upon the timber industry, I urge the ministers to reconsider their position and to ensure that the $15 million that was promised prior to the federal election is released so that those communities can be supported having regard to the changes that are needed in our forest industry. Ministers Macdonald and Tuckey should reconsider their behaviour and stop acting so immaturely. </para><para>In closing, I join with the members for Gilmore and Burke in recording my thanks to all the staff of the House. I convey my best wishes to them for the holiday season and for a peaceful new year.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forestry: Management</title><title>Education: Murdoch University</title><page.no>10619</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Education: Murdoch University</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>10619</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBefore I speak about the funding for the Peel regional campus, I must answer the member for Hasluck. Geoff Gallop has not had the guts to go to Manjimup and speak to the timber workers. The timber workers in Manjimup and in the south-west forests region are without jobs. The Labor government have promised to deliver funding for these workers, but they have not delivered any money at all. They want the federal government's money, yet they do not want a sustainable industry. They want an industry of 104,000 cubic metres of timber, yet they will not provide enough resources for these people to have jobs. It is an absolute disgrace. Geoff Gallop is an opportunist who has hoodwinked the workers of the south-west forests in the state. He should be ashamed of his disgraceful behaviour. He should show some guts and go to the south-west forests and visit these poor workers whose jobs he has taken away. He does not care about workers; he is more interested in opportunism and the green side of the equation. There is no such thing as old-growth forests in the area that he is talking about. We are talking about forests that are 100 years old that have regrown. Old-growth forests are in a very small area around Manjimup. Yet in the area around my electorate of Canningâaround Jarrahdale and Dwellingupâthere are no old-growth forests. They are all regrown forests, yet Mr Gallop has locked these up away from the workers.</para></talk.start><para>In the couple of minutes I have left, I want to congratulate the federal government, which has recognised the importance of the Murdoch campus in the Peel region. After strong representations to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, this campus has been awarded, out of the government's $42 million capital funding for universities, $2Â½ million for the establishment of capital works in the region. This region has almost 70,000 people, yet they do not have access to decent tertiary education. It is interesting that the member for Brand, who shares that part of the electorate with me, has made no representation on this issue. He has not tried to help the region in getting this facility for the area and, as a result, it took a visit on the ground from Brendan Nelson, the education minister, to see the need.</para><para>It is really great that Murdoch University, headed by Professor John Yovich and supported by Professor Kateryna Longley, has been a part of securing this project for the region on behalf of the Peel Development Commission. Not only is there a huge need for education for young people in the area; there is also a very large youth unemployment level in this region, thought to be up 35 per cent. This government is delivering for the region. Ultimately, this project is going to cost something like $4.6 million or $4.7 million, but I feel very sure that the balance of this program will be delivered by the minister next year. The $2Â½ million allows this university to begin. </para><para>What is going to be built as a result of this? There is going to be online education through three 80-seat video communications rooms, three 30-seat breakout rooms and one multipurpose laboratory and office for technicians, administrators and academic staff. It is going to be shared jointly with the Challenger TAFE, which is good dual use of learning facilities. The university learning centre will also have video and electronic communication links through Rockingham and Kwinana to the Murdoch campus for online access to courses, learning and resources.</para><para>The Peel region, as I said, has persistently high youth unemployment and also 14 per cent general unemployment. This is a great delivery to my electorate. It is the federal government going into the regions and providing education for those most in need. It is moving away from being city centric, where the larger universities tend to gobble up all the capital and cash. Finally, we are taking education to the areas of need and to the people who need it, particularly the young people in my region. I am very pleased to be part of a government that has recognised this and is doing this. Mayor Keith Holmes of the City of Mandurah is excited about it.

I wish the same for Australia and particularly for the people in my electorate of Braddon. I would like to speak about my electorate today. On 6 November 2001, I wrote to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, about the absence of airport security at the local airports at Burnie and Devonport in my electorate. This followed in the tragic wake of September 11, 2001.</para></talk.start><para>Since that time, with basically no reply from the minister, I have raised this issue in the House. This has occurred whilst we have had a continual gradient of terrorist alerts and security alerts and also budgetary expenditure on increasing security for airports. Do not for a moment think that I do not recognise the need to secure our major domestic airports in terms of both their international capacity and their domestic capacity. During this time, with this increased gradient of security measuresâand we are currently on an aircraft security alert, we are being asked to be vigilantânothing has been done about the airports at Burnie and Devonport. This is despite this campaign from not just me but the state government, my local communities and also our regional media, which have taken up this case.</para><para>So yesterday I waited with eager anticipationâafter my unforgivable outburst in the House the other day in questioning the minister; and mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa on thatâfor the Deputy Prime Minister's National Press Club comments about airport security. I waited to get my questions clarified. I was none the wiser after hearing those comments. I share that with members of the other side. In question time, I pitter-pattered over to sit with some of my parliamentary colleagues on the other side to ask them how they interpreted the Deputy Prime Minister's message at the National Press Club and, lo and behold, we were all scratching our heads because we could not understand what he said. The press reported:</para><quote><para>All airports that handle scheduled jet operations will have to conduct passenger and carry-on baggage screening, the federal government announced today.</para></quote><para>Fair enough. The report continued:</para><quote><para>Transport Minister John Anderson said that included propellor-driven planes, thus affecting some regional airports. </para></quote><para>Burnie and Devonport have turboprops and I said, `Hello, this is interesting. It looks like we might get a bit of an upgrade here.' The report went on to say:</para><quote><para>The government will also mandate screening for passengers and carry-on baggage where the airport operator or airline requests itâ</para></quote><para>in other words, `We'll tell you that you've got to do it if you ask us to.' What does that mean? I asked colleagues on the other side, because they obviously are far more in tune with the minister and they boast that they have regional seats, and they did not have a clue. The report continued:</para><quote><para>It will also introduce 100 per cent checked bag screening for all international services by the end of 2004.</para></quote><para>Well, whoopy-do, fantastic, that is great. Then you ask how much it is going to cost, and the conservative estimate is $180 million. Where is that money going to come from? `It won't be a tax. Maybe it'll be a levy. Maybe it'll be a $5 a ticket levy.' I worked out that, conservatively, about 170,000 people use Burnie and Devonport airports and at five bucks eachâand I am not too good at mathsâthat is about $850,000. Will that money then go into this mandated security system that we begged the Deputy Prime Minister for and we have to pay for? This is national security we are talking about. It is a federal responsibility, and we want assistance for this.</para><para>Now I am told, `There is not much of a threat around your way, so we will not mandate it at all.' If there is no threat around our way, why on earth are we asked to be vigilant? Why are we on a terrorist alert nearly every second day? You are talking about a security chain and a link in that chain, but where there is no security there is no link. It seems to me quite extraordinary that we have this bumbling, confused, nonsensical comment from the minister. When you ask for clarification, you hear, `It is a secret; it is security.' Well, it is not good enough and we will fight on. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mitchell Electorate: Bushfires</title><page.no>10621</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>10621</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â I want to talk about the bushfires in our area. They have been really serious. I want to describe to the House the commitment of firefighters, the dedication of volunteers, some of the tragedies that have occurred and some of the follow-on that will occur after the fires. The fires started and travelled at a rate of roughly 10 kilometres an hour through rugged country and eucalyptus bush. Lawns that appeared to be devoid of grass because they were cut so short actually burned with flames a foot high. The intensity of the heat, the dryness of the environment, and the fuel load that was on the forest floor created circumstances that have not been seen in known memory of bushfires in that area. The speed with which the fires travelled, the intensity of the heat and the significance of the burn was such that there were ember showers throwing thousands of embers hundreds of yards ahead of the actual flames, and spot fires were starting a kilometre or two ahead of the actual fire front. </para></talk.start><para>We tragically had a loss of two livesâone directly related to the fire and one indirectlyâand a number of injuries. Thirty-two homes in my electorate were lost, and a larger number across the whole area were lost. The scale of the burn was roughly 50 kilometres by 50 kilometres across the north and west of Sydney, on the fringes of the city, with the real risk, if there had been a wind change at a certain point last Sunday, that the fire front would have swept deeply into the suburbs of the north of Sydneyâinto Glenhaven, Annangrove, Kenthurst, Galston and Dural, across to Hornsby, Hornsby Heights and Wahroonga and right across to the Pacific Ocean. Fortunately, the wind and weather conditions changed and the fire has been brought under control.  </para><para>There were approximately 1,500 firefighters engaged in the event. In addition to those firefighters, something over 200 firefighting units were out continuously. In addition to that, there were the volunteers of the State Emergency Serviceâa great organisationâdoing traffic control and giving backup to the fire services, going out into dangerous areas to provide sustenance to the firefighters so they could stay on the job. In addition to that, in the fire centre at Kenthurst, which the Prime Minister visited last Sunday, we had working side by side the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, who were in charge of the process, under Mr John Hojel; the SES, as I have said; the New South Wales Police; the New South Wales Fire Brigade; the ambulance people; local government authorities; St John's; and VAD. All of those organisations related to bringing this emergency under control were working side by side in cells, managing their particular responsibilities in a unique and intense circumstance, but with great cooperation and goodwill.</para><para>I know that the volunteers supporting this process included elements from local Red Cross branches, the Country Women's Association and local churches. People just dropped things to come to the centre to cut sandwiches, prepare food and do anything possible to comfort families who had lost their homes, including providing accommodation and support. There were hundreds of individuals involved, and I want to pay tribute to them. Our community is going to pay tribute to these volunteers and firefighters on 26 February. We are going to gather at the Dural Country Club and pay tribute to these people who were involved. I would also like to mention Ben, a 14-year-old volunteer who was there day in, day out, doing a great job; and Allison, a part-time worker in the fire centre, who whinged so much they eventually gave her a uniform to fit her out like a traditional firefighter. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliament: Services</title><title>Foreign Affairs: Iraq</title><page.no>10622</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Iraq</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>10622</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn this last day of the sitting of the House this year I pay tribute to the staff of the parliament, the Library, the dining room and all of the attendants for the magnificent work they do. A lot of us lead very dislocated lives, coming from different parts of Australia to participate in the national life of this great parliament. It would not be possible without the incredible support that we get in all of the multifaceted ways from various staff. So I begin my remarks by thanking them and wishing them all a merry Christmas and a happy new year. I hope that we all have a peaceful one.</para></talk.start><para>That brings me to the gist of my remarks. Some weeks ago the opposition foreign affairs and defence committee met with a former ambassador for disarmament, Richard Butler. He has played a leading and very praiseworthy role over the years in that area, particularly on the elimination and nonproliferation of chemical and biological weapons, which Australia led under former foreign minister Gareth Evans. Ambassador Butler told members of the oppositionâand I am sure these views are reflected amongst members of the government, tooâthat, whatever one's views on policy with Iraq, he had been there many times and he had studied the situation of the people of Iraq, and he said that none of us in this great democratic parliament should have any illusions about the regime in Baghdad. He said, as many people have, that this regime is one of the worst violators of human rights in world. When speaking on the various policy options that we haveâincluding the opposition's policy, which all of us support, that, if there is to be action against Iraq, we should have United Nations action approved by the Security Councilâwe should all preface our remarks by underlining what an appalling regime exists in Iraq.</para><para>I feel at this time that someone must speak up on behalf of the millions of people in Iraq who are being murdered or tortured all of the time. It is all very well for people simply to focus on what might happen if there is a military conflict. People made very exaggerated scenarios when it came to Afghanistan. We do not want a military conflict, but, if it does come, the opposition says that it must come with a United Nations Security Council approval. But let us be under no illusions. Let us not create the Potemkin villages with Iraq that some people used to create in regard to the former Soviet Union. Saddam's regime practises genocide against the Kurdish people in Iraq. The infamous Anfal campaign, on which I have an answer from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>today, killed over 100,000 Kurdish people in a deliberate act of genocide. It included the use of poison gas against civilians. </para><para>This dreadful Baathist regime is best outlined in the great work on modern Iraq by the great Iraqi scholar at Brandeis University, Professor Kanan Makiya, called <inline font-style="italic">Republic of Fear</inline>. Unfortunately, I appear to be the only parliamentarian to have read it since June 2000. Makiya describes the Stalinesque regime that exists in Baghdad and its systematic killing of all kinds of political opponents, including radical opposition such as the Communist Party. A majority of Iraqis also live in total fear.</para><para>The Iraqi regime does have a relationship with terrorists. President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia did say that Mohamed Atta definitely did meet with Iraqi intelligence officers prior to September 11. This does not prove that Iraq was involved in September 11 but we should have no illusions. In Kurdistan at the moment the Kurds will tell you that the Iraqi service is working very closely with an al-Qaeda aligned group in Kurdistan to upset the great democracy that is spreading in that northern region, with 30 free newspapers and great human rights. Let us have no illusions about Iraq. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Murray Electorate: Drought</title><page.no>10623</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>10623</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to spend the next four minutes putting on the record in this place some details of an extraordinary circumstance affecting my electorate of Murray right now, and that is the failure of the irrigation system. For the first time in 100 years we have been faced with a situation where Eildon Dam is virtually not able to deliver any more water and we have had the lowest inflows in 102 years to the Goulburn, Loddon, Campaspe and Broken rivers. The great Goulburn, Loddon and Murray valleys are of course the food bowl of Australia. In the Goulburn system we are looking at less than 50 per cent of water allocation in an area where farms have been built to use 120 to 150 per cent, and more, of water allocation. In the case of the dairy industry this has meant that some 10,000 animalsâhighly valuable dairy cowsâhave so far been slaughtered or agisted to other parts of the state.</para></talk.start><para>Besides the loss of income, which is obvious when you have some 30 per cent or more of your milking cows removed from your property, there is also the loss of a whole generation of young peopleâthe trainees and apprentices who are no longer able to work in the dairy industry and who may go to cities and other parts of Australia. One of the things that we want to ensure is that the trainees and apprentices in the horticultural and dairy industries understand that there is a futureâto reassure them that after every drought it rains, and indeed every flood subsides. I am therefore so glad that yesterday, and in the last 48 hours, our Prime Minister announced a new scheme to assist, called Drought Force, where young people who are facing unemployment because of the drought can still work on local properties and continue their trainingânot leave the regionâand have financial support.</para><para>I also want to put on the record my extraordinary thanks to the effort of groups, often of women, that are putting together special days out for the women who are holding up in these very sad and difficult circumstances, day in and day outâlooking at which cattle to cull and which employees to let go. They have special days where they have, say, hairdressing or financial counselling. It is a time to sit down and talk together. There are now days out being organised for men to try and relieve some of the frustration and despair that these farming families are feeling. </para><para>I want to commend the work of Centrelink in our regions. The staff in Echuca, Shepparton and Swan Hill are taking the brunt of visits from many anxious, frustrated and despairing families, with both new customers and clients who are coming back with greater problems than they have ever had before. They are bearing up in the most magnificent way.</para><para>We have got donated fodder pouring into the area at the moment. I want to thank those who have donated that fodder and to note that we have had the tragedy of several fires in the last few days as a result of the instantaneous combustion of green fodder, cut too early, which does have that combustion potential. So thousands of bales have been lost in the last few days. But the announcement that exceptional circumstances relief will be delivered into this region is going to give a number of people a happier Christmas. It will not help them in the year to come when they have to work out how to buy back and reinstate their dairy herdsâanimals costing between $1,500 and $2,000 eachâwhen their levels of debt are now so extraordinary. But at least between now and, we hope, an autumn break to the drought there are more families with more hope as a result of the nearly $1 billion of drought support that this government has put into the systemâthe biggest support that this country has ever seen for drought impact.</para><para>Finally, I commend the work of the Bureau of Meteorology, which not only helps with situations like the bushfires in Sydney we just heard about but also has been trying its hardest to help farmers and the industries that depend on farming to understand what the El Nino means, and what the likelihood is for the autumn break so that those affected can make the most rational decisions about investments for the future. So I commend the Bureau of Meteorology most heartily.</para><para>Let me say, too, that I have sympathy for the associated businessesâfor example, the transport operators, the hairdressers, the shoe sellers and the people who produce fodder in these regions who have no crops; all of them are going to be helped a little through the new EC special criteria. They too suffer, just like the primary producers, and we must never forget them because they make up the rest of the economy in rural and regional Australia, all of which is dependent on the seasons.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âBefore putting the question for the adjournment of the Main Committee for the final occasion this year, I would join with a number of members who have spoken throughout this debate in placing on record the gratitude of members of the Main Committee to all those who enable this place to functionâthe attendants, Hansard, the sound and vision office, the clerks at the table and all the others who work behind the scenes in such places as the Table Office, the Assistant PLO, security, and others that I have not enumerated.</para></talk.start><para>The Main Committee is a great success.

That appeal was dismissed by a majority of the Full Court.2 The Yorta Yorta claimants then applied for, and were granted, special leave to appeal to the High Court.  The appeal was heard on 23 and 24 May 2002.  The judgment of the High Court was reserved.  </para><para>(2)	I am aware that the December 1998 judgment of Justice Olney contained the following passage:</para><para>The facts in the case lead inevitably to the conclusion that before the end of the 19th century the ancestors through whom the claimants claim title had ceased to occupy their traditional lands in accordance with their traditional laws and customs. The tide of history has indeed washed away any real acknowledgement of their traditional laws and any real observance of their traditional customs. The foundation of the claim to native title in relation to the land previously occupied by those ancestors having disappeared, the native title rights and interests previously enjoyed are not capable of revival.3</para><para>(3)	The consequences of the findings of Justice Olney (reflected in the passage quoted above, and elsewhere in his reasons for decision ) led him to find against the Yorta Yorta claimants' application for a determination of native title and determine instead that native title does not exist in relation to the areas of land and waters claimed by them.  As a consequence, the Yorta Yorta claimants appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court, but the appeal was dismissed.  The applicants then appealed to the High Court.  The High Court's judgment is reserved. </para><para>(4)	The specific findings of Justice Olney in the Yorta Yorta case are particular to that case.  Whether a similar finding is open in other cases depends on the evidence adduced in those cases.  That said, the principles of law that underpinned Justice Olney's findings were the subject of argument in the High Court appeal.  Accordingly, the potential impact of Justice Olney's finding on other applications for determinations of native title depends on the outcome of the High Court's consideration of the appeal heard in May 2002.  The decision of the High Court will be binding on all Federal Court judges making native title determinations in the future.</para><para>âââââââââââââ</para><para>1 Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria and others, Federal Court (Olney J), unreported, 18 December 1998 (matter number VG 6001 of 1995).</para><para>2 Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria (2001) 110 FCR 244; (2001) 180 ALR 655.</para><para>3 Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria and others, Federal Court (Olney J), unreported, 18 December 1998 (matter number VG 6001 of 1995), paragraph 129.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Finance and Administration: Superannuation </title><page.no>10627</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1052)</subtitle><id.no>1052</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10627</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 22 October 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	With respect to the Minister's Department and each agency for which the Minister is responsible, what is the total number of (a) male and (b) female staff.</para><para>(2)	In the Minister's Department and each agency, how many (a) male and (b) female staff are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and how many of each gender have elected to pay additional superannuation contributions.</para><para>(3)	In the Minister's Department and each agency, how many (a) male and (b) female staff are members of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) and how many of each gender have elected to pay (i) additional super and (ii) reduced superannuation contributions.</para><para>(4)	In the Minister's Department and each agency, how many (a) male and (b) female staff have any other form of superannuation.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>10627</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Finance and Administration has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The following assumptions were made to answer this question:</para><para>CSS - additional payments were considered any payments above 5%</para><para>PSS - additional payments were considered any payments above 5%</para><para>PSS - reduced payments were considered any payments below 5%</para><para>In relation to question 4, it is not possible to comprehensively answer this question as individual employees are not required to disclose their private superannuation arrangements.</para><para>DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION</para><para>Data includes all employment types (ongoing, non ongoing and casual) as at 21 October 2002.  </para><para>(a) 516 male staff and (b) 395 female staff.</para><para>(a) 105 male staff and (b) 46 female staff who are members of CSS.

I note the background information provided to me by Mr John Murphy MP, in his letter dated 31 October 2002.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also obtained further information and advice from the Australian Ambassador to Romania, who has also engaged the Romanian Government in informal discussions on the matter.   </para><para>On the basis of this information, it is my understanding that the Romanian Government has undertaken, through the adoption of legislation, to return property taken from these churches during the communist period.  In 2001, a legal framework was adopted to facilitate the restitution of buildings.  Similar measures have been taken regarding the restoration of agricultural lands and the Romanian Government has set itself the target of restituting 90 per cent of agricultural lands and forests by the end of 2002.  In July 2002, the Romanian Parliament adopted legislation that clarified the process of restituting property confiscated from churches, however churches themselves were not included.  In relation to this, the Romanian Government has stated it would prefer that the Romanian Orthodox and the Romanian Catholic Churches find a mutually agreeable solution.  </para><para>The matter is currently being examined by the European Commission in the context of Romania's accession to the European Union.  The Commission's 2002 Regular Report details the progress made but finds that it has been âhindered by weak administration and the absence of implementing legislationâ.  It also notes the absence of a legal framework for the restitution of churches.   The Commission states that Romania needs to implement further judicial reform and improve legislative processes.  </para><para>Given these are internal matters and there are significant domestic sensitivities, the Australian Government does not intend to make representations to the Romanian government on this issue.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers</title><page.no>10629</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1115)</subtitle><id.no>1115</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10629</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 14 November 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Further to the answer to question No. 692 (<inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 23 September 2002, page 6806) concerning crew members of foreign ships entering Australia, has his Department considered tightening the checking of all crew on foreign vessels entering Australia since 11 September 2001; if so, what changes have been or will be made.</para><para>(2)	On what date did shipping companies become liable for the cost of detention and removal of crew who desert their vessels and become unlawful non-citizens in Australia.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>10629</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	As indicated in my response to question 692, the Australian Customs Service (ACS) checks details of all crew and passengers on each ship entering Australia against ACS and DIMIA alert lists and reports to DIMIA if there are any persons of concern on the ship.
