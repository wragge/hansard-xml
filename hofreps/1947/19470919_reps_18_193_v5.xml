A report in to-day's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> J. Daniel, private secretary to the Attorney-General, alleges that a check, made of a petition presented to the Attorney-General's Department opposing the Government's banking proposals discloses some disconcerting features. The petition purports to have been signed by some 4,082 voters in the Attorney-General's electorate of Barton, and the report states - </para>

                    <para>The check reveals that, there arc  2,397  signatures without addresses;  301  of those who have signed give addresses which are not in the electorate  -of  -Barton;  53  persons signed the. petition and then crossed their names out. </para>
                    <para>Of  the telegrams of protests received, it is noted that batches  of  them have the same office  of  origin and have been lodged at the name time. Some of the telegrams give incorrect addresses, while other names and addresses cannot be traced in the electoral roll. </para>
                    <para class="block">As petitions are being presented to this House, will you, sir, state what is their standing, and what is the position generally in relation to them? Is it necessary that - they shall conform to accuracy? Should those who sign them be enrolled for the electorates in which they purport to originate? What other relevant circumstances are there in connexion with the presentation of petitions to this honorable House ? </para>

                        <para>- Th  course is that an honorable member who presents a petition assures the House that it is respectfully worded, concludes with a prayer, and is otherwise ' in conformity with the rules and orders of the House. My personal belief is that some degree of responsibility devolves upon a member to ensure, to - the best of his ability, that those who sign a petition are, as they purport to be, electors of the division mentioned in it, and that their addresses are accurately stated. All petitions stress that the signatories to them are electors of the divisions mentioned in them, and it . is the duty of honorable members, when presenting them, to inform the House of any knowledge they may have to the contrary. </para>

I understand that he proposes to introduce the budget today, but that the general debate on it will not be resumed before the expiry of a week from its introduction.

                            <para>- It is with great regret that I inform the House of the loss of the mine sweeper H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Warrnambool</inline> on Saturday, the 13th September, while engaged on mine-sweeping operations. Unfortunately, the loss of the ship was accompanied by loss of life, and also resulted in injuries to personnel, including the commanding officer. All the men of the ship have been accounted for with the exception of one who is missing, and, I fear, lost. Three have died. Of those injured, three at present remain on the critically injured list, five on the dangerously injured list, eight on the seriously injured list, two on the slightly injured list, one on the general improvement list, and eleven have gone on leave. I take this opportunity to extend to the relatives of personnel lost and missing, and to injured personnel and their relatives, the deep sympathy of the Government. I earnestly hope for a speedy recovery of all the injured. </para>

                    <para>During the war, 37 mine-fields, composed of moored contact mines, were laid by the Royal Australian Navy in the vicinity of the Barrier Reef, covering openings from Townsville to Cape Grenville. Sweeping of the Barrier Reef mine-fields was commenced on the 30th January, 1947, and to date 27 of those fields have been swept. It is expected that all sweeping in the Barrier Reef will be completed by the end of next month. Thousands of mines were laid in these defensive fields. Many of them have broken adrift from their moorings, and hundreds of mines have already been dealt with, by " rendering mines safe parties " operating inside the Barrier Reef and in the Port Moresby area. I have already informed the House of the position concerning drifting mines, as distinct from moored mines, and, therefore, will not comment any further at this stage. </para>

                        <para>- The Leader of the Australian Country party did write to me about a production drive. The subject was originally raised at a meeting between representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the manufacturers, and, after considerable discussion, both parties agreed to do everything they could to accelerate production. Since then the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has had several discussions, and has participated in a number of conferences, with a view to learning what can be done to accelerate primary production. The matter has also been discussed with Lord Addison, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has agreed that everything possible will be done to increase production, particularly of foodstuffs. At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the hope was expressed that the States would co-operate with the Commonwealth to ensure increased production. I cannot give the honorable member more detailed information at. the moment, but in view of his letter to me of July last, and of the question which he has1 just asked, I propose to prepare for him a reply on the subject setting forth what it is proposed to do. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago the Government appointed an all-party committee of ex-service members of the Parliament to make recommendations with respect to the payment of war gratuity. Will the Prime Minister now arrange for that committee, or a committee similarly constituted, to make recommendations for just and adequate provision for widows, children and other dependants of deceased servicemen? </para>

Previously, I promised that as soon as the Gratuity Boards, including the central board, had settled down to their work and had had an opportunity to survey the position, I would arrange to call together the available members of the all-party committee to confer with the central board. I shall do that. </para>

I shall examine the matter he has raised. It has been the subject of review during the last few weeks by a sub-committee of Cabinet, consisting of the Minister for Repatriation, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and myself. At a later stage the Minister for Repatriation will have something to say concerning the results of that review. At this juncture I am not able to give any further information. </para>

What is the position of these workers in respect of compensation should they be injured when travelling to and from work? As they are not actually employed until they are picked up who is their employer ? How can they be assured of receiving compensation in respect of injury suffered in such circumstances? In view of the fact that they are required by the Stevedoring Industry Commission to present themselves at the wharfs, is the commission their employer so far as the payment of compensation is concerned in the circumstances which I have mentioned ? </para>

                        <para>- The matter raised by the honorable member involves a most difficult technical problem ; and my answer refers to all waterside workers and not solely to that section mentioned by the honorable member. Waterside workers, in common with other workers, are covered by the Workers' Compensation Act while proceeding to and returning from work. The Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Supply and Shipping are examining the possibility of covering those waterside workers who report at a pick-up place but may not be engaged. The matter is being examined to ascertain whether it is possible to devise means whereby such waterside workers shall be covered by the workers' compensation legislation. </para>

Shipping prospects are good due to the foresight of the Government, the assistance given by the Australian Wheat Board, the Jute Committee and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tomlinson</inline> of the Barley Board, and to the co-operation of - the Indian Government, with whose representatives I conferred on this matter. The Australian Wheat Board, however, will have to ensure that over-buying shall not occur in order that available supplies may be spread equitably amongst wheat-farmers. </para>

In recent negotiations with the representative of the Indian Government we assured him that any wheat sold to India would be landed in that country, subject to supplies of jute being made available to Australia. The Indian representative explained that his Government issued licences for the export of jute, but it had no power to compel exporters to ship the complete quota for which licences had been issued. However, he undertook that the Indian Government would do its utmost to ensure the export to Australia from. India of the maximum quantity of jute. </para>

I have only recently returned from a very extensive tour of the north-west ports of Western Australia during the course of which I met representatives of the Roads Boards at every port <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> from Wyndham to Carnarvon. I saw no evidence to justify the allegation made by the Lord Mayor of Perth, nor were complaints of that kind made to me by the representatives of the Roads Boards. Every opportunity was given to the local governing authorities to place before me any matters of concern in the areas under their control. From my first-hand knowledge of conditions in the north-west of Western Australia I should say that the statement is exaggerated and without foundation. </para>

Because of the shortage of dollars the time is opportune for acceleration of those plans. I am not able to say what progress has been made by the various firms interested in the project. The honorable member will have read reports in the press that General Motors-Holdens Limited has completed two motor cars, which are undergoing tests. I have seen a couple of statements about the time when General Motors-Holdens Limited will produce motor cars in. greater numbers, but I believe that delays have occurred as the result of a shortage of various materials. The Government is giving every assistance to firms planning the production of an all-Australian motor car, and, as far as it lies within its power to increase supplies of necessary materials, the Government will act. </para>

                    <para>- In the first place; the honorable member's question is based? on false premises. Butter production in Australia: is not declining; in fact, production is- accelerating. Secondly, the price1 being paid to- primary producers for butter to-day is- reasonablygood' and is substantially higher than ever before in the history of Australia, with the exception of a period of several years after World' War I. The report of the committee appointed' to inquire into dairying costs is expected to become available about three weeks hence. The (rommittee met recently, and, I understand- adjourned for about a fortnight. As soon as the report is received it will be considered by the Government and a decision will be made upon it. The honorable member's statement regarding declining production demands some explanation. He has apparently misconstrued facts and figures. I read a few days ago in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that, since 1939, the milk consumption of Sydney and Newcastle had increased by 26,000,000 gallons a year, which, according to a rough calculation, represents about 7,000 tons of butter a year. The fact that a reduced quantity of butter is. available for export to Great Britain at certain periods is due to the fact that, under the regime of this Government, there has been full employment, higher purchasing power, and consequently a greater opportunity for workers to buy milk. </para>

                        <para>- Retail traders in Perth have suggested to me that the grievous lack of shipping to Western Australia can be remedied if overseas ships were permitted to pick up goods available in the eastern States and transport them to Western Australian ports. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether any prohibition under the Navigation Act or any other legislation has been placed upon overseas ships transporting goods from the eastern States to Western Australia? If such a ban exists, will the Minister reconsider it, so that overseas ships shall be allowed to carry goods from the eastern States to Western. Australia and thus overcome some of the shortages existing in that State? </para>

                        <para>- It is a fact that Trans- Australia Airlines recently applied for permission to carry a football team to Cunnamulla. That application, like other applications from sporting parties, was refused. Because of the difficulty experienced in the purchase of petrol from abroad the policy of the department has been to refuse all applications for special trips other than those required to provide essential services. That policy has been applied to any applications made by both Australian National Airways and Trans-Australia Airlines, but in one instance in which Australian National Airways had made prior application for a special trip to Newcastle from Melbourne permission was granted under certain conditions. The special arrangement was that the service would carry a team to Sydney on its ordinary daily service, and that it would be permitted to operate an additional aircraft to Newcastle and return to Sydney. I assure the honorable member thatno unfair discrimination has been made in the treatment accorded to the different airlines. Recently Australian National Airways was granted permission to carry a party of miners to the asbestos fields, and Trans-Australia Airlines was granted permission to fly mining plant to Kalgoorlie. </para>

I wrote to the  chairman  of the Repatriation Commission, informing him of government policy in regard to preference of unionists. I stated that I desired that that policy should be given effect. I asked him to advise the  Deputy  Commissioners in the various States that I desired their staffs to be informed of government policy, and of my wish that they should belong to the union which covered their calling. I believe that there are only two industrial organizations which cover the callings of the men who come under the control of the Repatriation Department. An analysis of the affiliations of officers of those organizations will quickly disprove any suggestion of Communist control. </para>

                    <para class="block">I desire to explain to the committee the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1947-48, and to furnish a statement of actual revenue and expenditure in 1946-47. </para>
                    <para>It is most satisfactory to record that during the financial year just closed employment in Australia rose to levels never before reached in peace-time. At the end of June this year the number of people in civilian work was 3,212,000. This was 200,000 above June, 1946, and 480,000 above June, 1939. Better seasons and higher prices, especially for wool and wheat, led to an increase during the year in the incomes of primary producers, output rose in most of the basic secondary industries and there was a marked expansion of new manufacturing enterprises. Housing made substantial progress, though hampered by shortages of labour and material's. Estimates of national income and expenditure in 1946-47 are contained in a separate paper which is being circulated with the budget papers. </para>
                    <para>Revenue and Expenditure,, 1946-47</para>
                <para class="block">Mainly because of these conditions, actual revenue in 1946-47 was £412,000,000 as against the estimate of £385,000,000 given in my budget last November. The largest increases were income tax £6,000,000, sales tax £5,000,000 and customs and excise duties £13,000,000. </para>
                <para>Expenditure on defence and allied services was £129,000,000. The budget estimate was £147,000,000. Post-war charges, on the other hand, involved an expenditure of £161,000,000 compared with an estimate of £131,000,000. Expenditure on this item, however, included the gift of £25,000,000 to the United Kingdom, for which provision had not been made in the budget. </para>
                <para>Credits against defence and post-war charges were <inline font-style="italic">£58,000,000</inline> compared with a budget estimate of £57,000,000. Net expenditure on defence and post-war charges was, therefore, £232,000,000, this being £11,000,000 above the estimate. </para>
                <para>Other expenditure was £218,000,000 which was £5,000,000 below estimates. </para>
                <para>Total expenditure in 1946-47 therefore was £450,000,000 as compared with the budget estimate of £444,000,000 and the gap between revenue and' expenditure, which was financed from loan moneys, was £38,000,000 aga inst a budget estimate of £59,000,000. </para>
                <para>Details of revenue and expenditure for 1946-47 compared with the budget estimates are given in statement No. 1. In addition the main heads of aggregate war expenditure to 30th June, 1947, are set out in statement No. 5 and details regarding loan transactions and the public debt in statement No. 6. </para>
                <para>In the course of my speech I shall refer to a number of statements which have been prepared and which contain more detailed information on the matters to which reference is made. With the concurrence of the House I shall incorporate these statements in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
                    <para>Sterling Balances</para>
                <para>As honorable members know, our reserves of international currency increased considerably during the war period and the greater part of these reserves are held in London. </para>
                <para>A number of factors contributed to this increase. Our export income during the war was fairly well maintained and imports of non-essentials were severely restricted. Very heavy imports were made of war supplies but a considerable part of these was made available under lend lease and mutual aid arrangements. This gain was offset by the reciprocal aid extended to the United States forces which had the effect of reducing export income. But the cash expenditure of American troops resulted in the accrual of very large sums in dollars which were sold to the United Kingdom against payment in sterling. </para>
                <para>Other countries also accumulated sterling balances, some to a much greater extent than Australia, and since these balances amounting in all to more than £3,500,000,000 sterling were demand liabilities, the United Kingdom had perforce to seek arrangements with the holders as to what would be done with them. Under the financial agreement with the United States, the United Kingdom Government did in fact state its intention to make such arrangements. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Government recognized how vital this problem was to the United Kingdom and gave much thought as to how Australia could best assist. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> gift of £25,000,000 made during the last sessional period as a contribution towards war costs incurred by the United Kingdom in the Pacific zone acted to reduce our sterling balances, and discussions were entered upon with the United Kingdom authorities in relation to the remaining balances. I myself talked the matter over in a general way with the Chancellor of the Exchequer when I was in London last year. Subsequently I arranged for the Secretary to the Treasury, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> G. McFarlane, to proceed to London for the purpose of further discussions. </para>
                <para>As a result of these discussions the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee,</inline> suggested to me that Australia could help them most in their present difficulties if we would take it as a broad objective to live for the time being within our external income and, if necessary, to restrict imports from all sources and so avoid the need to call upon our accumulated London funds. Thi.= did not mean of course that we should try to balance our trade exactly month by month, for that would have been impracticable; nor did it overlook the possibility that our export income might in adverse circumstances turn downwards so far that it would be inadequate to pay for even a minimum of essential imports. Should such an emergency arise the whole situation would have to be brought into review in consultations between the two Governments. The essence of the United Kingdom proposal was rather that while doing our utmost to increase exports both to the United Kingdom and elsewhere we would over a period endeavour to keep imports within the limit of what we could pay for from our current overseas earnings. </para>
                <para>Taking all factors into account the Commonwealth Government thought that this would be a reasonable arrangement. Indeed with our knowledge of how the United Kingdom stands and our desire to help it by every means possible it is the kind of thing we would have tried to do in any case because every day makes more evident the urgent nature of its needs. </para>
                <para>Accordingly I have personally conveyed to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Commonwealth Government the assurance that Australia will do its utmost to assist thorn in the ways they have suggested tous. </para>
                    <para>The Dollar Scarcity Problem</para>
                <para>I now turn to the dollar problem with which we are faced irrespective of the size of our total export income and the amount of our sterling balances. Australia, and the sterling area as a whole, is not able to earn sufficient dollars to cover the imports which it is desired to obtain from the United States or from Canada. "While this situation continues rationing of dollars is unavoidable no matter what happens to our sterling balances. </para>
                <para>The United States and Canada escaped war devastation and quickly regained their peace-time production. On the other hand, many countries, particularly the war devastated countries of Europe, faced enormous difficulties in reconversion and still have a long way to go. </para>
                <para>As a result the United States has been the main centre of demand to meet the shortages of the rest of the world. United States exports have been running at a level of about 16 billion dollars and imports at about 7 billion dollars. This gap has been financed from loans, relief assistance, notably Unrra, and reserves of United States currency. These loans and credits have been running down and the position has been reached where the demand for United States goods still persists but the corresponding means of payment are not available. </para>

                    <para>When the Anglo-American loan was negotiated it was expected it would last until the United Kingdom had achieved a. balance in its external position. Unfortunately this has not been realized and the loan is now almost exhausted. The main factors which worked against the United Kingdom and led to the running down of the loan were the big rise in prices in the United States, the delay in the recovery of war devastated countries in Europe and the Far East, the severe winter and the demands of other countries for conversion of sterling holdings into United States dollars after the 15th July last -the date when the United Kingdom, under the loan agreement, assumed the formal obligation of converting currently earned sterling into other currencies for current transactions. </para>
                    <para>Several foreign countries adopted expedients to build up sterling for the purpose of conversion into dollars. This added unexpectedly to the drain on the dollar loan in July and August. As a consequence the United Kingdom was forced as an emergency measure to suspend automatic convertibility of sterling into dollars. An announcement to this effect was <inline font-style="italic">made</inline> by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 29th August after consultation with the United States Government. Such dollars as are now available to the United Kingdom, including current earnings, will have to be rationed to meet the most essential needs. The United Kingdom still has a .gold reserve which is a backing for the sterling area as a whole but there .is a limit below which this reserve cannot be allowed to fall. </para>
                    <para>Faced with this difficult external position, the United Kingdom Government has recently announced further restrictions, including reduced rations, on -its own people so as to reduce imports and increase exports. The task confronting the people of the United Kingdom is verygreat and we must help by reducing our demands on the United Kingdom dollar pool to the minimum possible. The position is now being further examined at British Commonwealth talks in London. </para>

Of this £168,000,000, expenditure overseas is expected to account for £18,000,000. Last year overseas war expenditure was £77,000,000. </para>

                <para>Of this £75,000,000 it is estimated that £40,000,000 will be spent under the postwar defence plan, details of which were given to the House during the last sessional period. It will be recalled that this plan provided for the development of a comprehensive system of modern defences which would be commensurate with the new strategic responsibilities of Australia in the SouthWestern Pacific zone. It envisaged the expenditure over five years of £250,000,000 of which £200,000,000 is to be allocated to the three . services, £33,500,000 to research and development and £17,500,000 to the Departments of Munitions and Supply and Shipping. </para>
                <para>The balance of £35,000,000 provided for service and production departments this year relates to war-time commitments and includes £5,000,000 for deferred pay and £7,000,000 for the cost of certain Army and Navy equipment supplied during the war. The maintenance of our forces in Japan is also covered. </para>
                <para>Payments of war gratuity are estimated at £5,000,000 this financial year as against £3,000,000 last year. </para>
                <para>Thus, while expenditure on defence and allied services includes some commitments carried over from the war effort of 1939-45,. a very substantial part represents the cost of peace-time defence measures. </para>

We are also in the process of creating a strong nuclear defence force comprising naval, military and air elements and at the same time we are pushing ahead with fundamental research into some of the most advanced problems of modern scientific defence. The amount of the provision made in this budget should emphasize how largely defence must bulk from a financial standpoint, especially if compared with levels of defence expenditure in pre-war years. </para>

                <para>An amount of £33,000,000 is provided in the Estimates to cover expenditure on Commonwealth works undertakings excluding defence services. Of this amount, £7,300,000 is included for postal and telegraph equipment, £7,100,000 for war service homes, and £2,400,000 for shipbuilding. The balance of the provision is mainly for engineering works and buildings. The Commonwealth Government has at present a very large programme of works, particularly on postal and civil aviation activities. Because of shortages of labour and materials, however, the volume of works which can be undertaken this year has had to be severely limited. </para>

                <para>Expenditure during 1947-48 on the postal services, apart from capital expenditure included under New Works, is estimated at £30,304,000 compared with £26,756,000 in 1946-47. The increase is attributable mainly to the arrears of maintenance which accumulated during the war and to increased salaries and wages and higher costs of stores and equipment. </para>

                    <para>Payments to States</para>
                <para>Provision has been made for payments to- States of £65,000,000, which is £4,000,000 above the amount paid last year. It will be recalled that last year the tax reimbursement grants payable to the States were increased to £40,000,000 as compared with £34,255,000 under the war-time basis of reimbursement. To assist the States in meeting additional expenditures which are largely due to rising costs and prices, the Government has decided to make additional payments to the States, the effect of which will be to increase the tax reimbursement grants this year to £45,000,000 - an increase of nearly £11,000,000 as compared with the war-time basis. Details of the new arrangements are given in Statement No. 10. </para>
                <para>It is expected that the Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works Grant at £6,000,000 will be £1,200,000 greater than last year. </para>
                <para>The report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has not yet been received but a tentative amount of £5,042,000 has been included in the Estimates to provide for the payment of special grants to the three less populous States. </para>
                    <para>Other Civil Departments</para>
                <para>Expenditure on other civil departments this year is estimated at £26,700,000, which is £11,200,000 above expenditure in 1946-47. Of this increase, however, £4,400,000 is due to the fact that expenditures of the Department of .Supply and Shipping not now associated with defence are excluded from defence and post-war charges. The Department of Civil Aviation shows an increase of £2,500,000. This is mainly because payments by the Postal Department for the conveyance of air mails estimated at £1,400,000 for 1947-48 which were formerly applied in reduction of expenditure will this year be credited to civil aviation revenue. Other reasons are the expansion of overseas air services and a rise in maintenance costs because of the provision of additional aerodromes and more efficient technical equipment. The provision for immigration is also increased by £1,600,000. Expenditure by these departments will also be affected by increased wage and salary costs. </para>
                <para>A complete review of all Commonwealth departments, including the business undertakings, is  being carried out with the object of achieving the highest standards of economy and efficiency in administration on a peacetime basis. The Public Service Board has been re-constituted for this purpose and some progress has been made. The administrative organization which is to handle new and difficult functions of government must keep pace with its responsibilities, but the Government is determined that expenditures in all fields shall be kept under the closest scrutiny to ensure that the community obtains full value and efficient service. </para>
                <para class="block">Total  Expenditure 1947-4S. </para>
                <para>Briefly compared, therefore, total expenditure in 1947-48 is estimated at £427,000,000 against £450,000,000 in 1946-47. Defence and  post-war  charges are expected to decrease by £64,000,000 and other .expenditure to increase by £41,000,000 so that the total expenditure is estimated to be £23,000,000 less this year than last year. </para>

                <para>With the rates of taxation now in force it is estimated that revenue in 1947-48 would be £404,000,000 compared with actual revenue in 1946-47 of £412,000,000, a decrease of £8,000,000. </para>
                <para>After taking account of proposed tax concessions, details of which will be given presently, revenue for the current year is estimated to be £397,000,000, a fall of £15,000,000 on last year. </para>
                <para>Income tax and social services contribution is expected to show a fall of £12,000,000 and sales tax a fall of £7,000,000. Revenue from customs and excise duties is estimated to be approximately the same as last year because while imports have been increasing during recent months, the restrictions on imports which have been recently imposed and which may have to be intensified are likely to check this development. Other items including pay-roll tax and postal revenue show increases amounting to £4,000,000. Further details of estimated revenue are given in Statement No. 2. </para>
                    <para>Budget Summary</para>

                    <para>Public Borrowing 1947-48</para>
                <para>In addition to the budget gap of £30.000,000 requiring loan finance, there are the Loan Council borrowing programmes aggregating £63,000,000 to cover expenditures by State governments on public works and housing. The Loan Council has also approved a total borrowing programme of £20,000,000 for semi governmental and local authorities. Hence, the total estimated public borrowing during .1947-48 will he. £333,000,000. </para>
                    <para>Taxation</para>
                <para>During the last sessional period a series of important tax reductions were brought forward by the Government and operated from 1st July, 1947, so that they will be  effective for the whole of this financial year. v\s regards income tax and social services contribution substantial reductions in rates were made and an increase was granted in the amounts upon which rebates for dependants are calculated. The value to taxpayers of these and certain other concessions in respect of income taxation was estimated at £34,000,000 per year. Persons maintaining dependants were afforded the greatest relief, the reductions ranging from 100 per cent, on the lowest incomes to approximately 10 per cent, on high incomes. </para>
                <para>The annual value to taxpayers of reductions made since the cessation of hostilities in taxes upon individual incomes has now reached a total of more than £70,000,000 and the great majority of taxpayers are now paying half, and in many cases less than half,, the tax payable at war- time rates. </para>
                <para>On many incomes less tax is payable to-day than in the year 1938-39. For example, a man with a dependent wife and two children in the State having the lowest rates of tax in 1938-39 who was earning £6 per week would have paid approximately £4 tax for that year. Today he would pay no tax. In- the State which imposed the highest rates of tax in 1938-39 he may now earn up to £8 a week and still pay less tax than he would then have paid at combined Commonwealth and State rates. </para>
                <para>The cost to revenue of concessions given in respect of income tax will to some extent be offset this year by increased collection of taxation arrears. </para>

                </para>
                <para>The Government, proposes to abolish the war-time (company) tax which was imposed during the war period as a levy upon the exceptionally high profits made by some public companies Tinder war conditions. Since this purpose has been fulfilled it is considered that the tax should no longer be continued. It will therefore cease to operate as from and including the present financial year, which means that company profits of the year ended the 30th June, 1946. or the accounting period substituted for that year, will be the last year's profits subject to the tax. </para>
                <para>The cost to revenue of removing the tax is estimated at £3,500,000. </para>
                    <para>Sales Tax</para>
                <para>Concessions are proposed in respect of sales tax which are estimated to reduce revenue from this source by £3,500,000 in a full year and £2,800,000 in this financial year. Mainly these concessions will take the form of transferring items from the maximum rate schedule of 25 per cent, to the standard rate of 10 per cent. Full details will be given when legislation is brought down later to-day. </para>
                    <para>Gold Tax</para>
                <para>With a view to encouraging production of gold as a means of earning dollars and having regard also to increasing costs in the gold-mining industry, the Government proposes to suspend the operation of the gold tax. It is proposed that the suspension will operate as from tomorrow, and legislation will be brought down for this purpose. On the present rate of production, the estimated cost to revenue will be £350,000 in this financial year and £550,000 in a full year. </para>

                <para>Membership of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development was formally accepted by the Government on the 5th August, 1947. The terms of admission were on the same basis as those available to original members of the fund and bank. </para>
                    <para>Conclusion</para>
                <para>Two years of post-war experience have shown that full employment holds the key to many of the greatest economic problems of our community. Without full employment the financial burdens left by the war could not have been reduced so far; nor could we stand so well the present costs of defence and social services. Because of full employment, again a notable expansion of industry has been made possible and we are able to adopt such progressive measures as the fortyhour week, which the Arbitration Court has granted. The Government is taking no credit for .that. </para>
                <para>If conditions overseas deteriorate we will have to adapt ourselves to the circumstances and leave nothing undone that will contribute to the central objective of keeping all available labour steadily at work. This means amongst other things unremitting efforts to achieve greater production. It also requires a continuance of measures to prevent unwarrantable increases in costs and prices. As I have emphasized previously, there has never been a greater demand, except in the darkest days of the war, for all Australians to give of their best. </para>
                <para>In a special sense, our future as a people depends on what we do in this coming year. In fact, that statement does not apply only to the coming year. Great Britain has " turned-the-corner " perhaps, but it will have an uphill struggle and Australia will have to lend a helping hand. Within Australia we are laying permanent foundations for security by helping ex-servicemen and women to reinstate themselves, by overtaking the wartime lag in industrial equipment, by extending our social service benefits and by maintaining a post-war defence plan adequate to our responsibilities within the British Commonwealth and the United Nations. Abroad we are fulfilling our obligations for the advancement of security and are contributing as far as we are able towards easing the burdens of the United Kingdom.. Tasks of this magnitude can be fulfilled only if tackled in a willing spirit and with our full national resources. </para>

                <para>On the estimated production for 1947-48 an amount of £4,000,000 will be required for subsidy payments and it is anticipated that during the financial year a refund of subsidy to the extent of £500,000 will be received from the British Ministry of Food in connexion with exports prior to June, 1940, leaving £3,500,000 to be provided from revenue. </para>

                <para>It is expected that the sum of £230,000 will be required to meet the probable deficiency on the operations of the Apple and Pear Acquisition Scheme in Western Australia and Tasmania, including £200,000 for the previous season.

                <para>STATEMENT No. 10. - TAX REIMBURSEMENT GRANTS TO THE STATES. </para>
                <para>Under the war-time uniform tax scheme which operated until the 30th June, 1946, the tax reimbursement grants paid each year to the States vacating the fields of income taxation and entertainments taxation amounted to £34,255,000. </para>
                <para>At a Premiers conference in January, 1946, the Commonwealth Government indicated that it had decided to continue uniform income taxation indefinitely. The Premiers, whilst maintaining in principle their opposition to uniform taxation, agreed upon a revised basis on which future reimbursement grants should be paid to the. States. The revised basis of tax reimbursement grants was incorporated in the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946, the provisions of which became effective on the 1st July, 1946. </para>
                <para>This act provides that the aggregate of the grants shall be £40,000,000 in each of the years 1946-47 and 1947-48. In each subsequent year the aggregate grant of £40,000,000 will be varied in proportion to variations in the States' populations and the resultant amount increased by half the percentage increase (if any) in the level of average wages per person employed over the level in 1946-47. The manner of distribution of the aggregate grant of £40,000,000 among the States in the years 1946-47 and 1947-48 is set out in the table below. In years subsequent to 1947-48 the aggregate grant is to be distributed in accordance with a. formula which takes account of the respective populations of the States after adjustments have been made to those populations for relative sparsity of population and the number of children aged five to fifteen years inclusive in each State. The effect of this formula is such that by 1957-58 the aggregate grant will be distributed solely in proportion to the adjusted populations of the States. </para>
                <para>It was also agreed with the Premiers and provided in the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946 that  a  review of the basis of tax reimbursement grants might be made in the following circumstances: - </para>

                <para>At a Premiers conference held in August. 1947, the Premiers indicated that State expenditures were rising sharply principally because of increasing prices and costs, and that some increase in the tax reimbursement grants (which aggregate £40,000,000 in 1947-48) would be necessary if the State governments were to avoid serious financial difficulties in the current financial year. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Government has decided that the present basis of tax reimbursement grants should not be revised but that increased financial assistance to the States should be provided by means of an additional tax reimbursement grant. </para>
                <para>It has been decided that an additional tax reimbursement grant of £5,000,000 be paid to the States in the current financial year (1947- 48) and that in respect of each subsequent financial year an additional grant be paid to cover any deficiency between the aggregate tax reimbursement grant as determined by the 1946 Act and thesum of £45,000,000. This additional grant is to be distributed among the States in the same proportions as the tax reimbursement grant of £40,000,000 payable in 1946-47 and 1947-48 under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946. </para>
                <para>The tax reimbursement grants which it is proposed to pay in 1947-48 are compared in the following table with the grants paid in 1 940-47 under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1940: - </para>

                    <para class="block">In this bill authority is sought to increase the salaries payable to the holders of certain statutory offices where salaries are determined by legislation. For many years it has been widely recognized that members of the judiciary and officers in the higher executive positions of the Commonwealth Public Service have not been remunerated on a scale commensura'te with their responsibilities. and the Government has decided that adjustments should now be made. In assessing the increases which it proposes to make the Government has taken into consideration - (a) the long period during which there has been no upward adjustment of the basis of remuneration1; '(&amp;) the general trend of salaries for professional and high executive positions in Australia : and (c) the rates of remuneration of similar offices in the United Kingdom and other countries. </para>
                    <para>The salaries of justiceships of the High Court were fixed by the Parliament in  1903,  and have not been altered since. The salaries of the other judicial offices included in this bill were fixed subsequently, but strictly in relation to the salaries attaching to High Court justiceships. These salaries no longer bear the relationship originally existing to the earnings of the leaders of the profession at the bar, and the increases now proposed are in the direction of rectifying the position. </para>
                    <para>I need scarcely emphasize how essential it is to the maintenance of the high tradition of the judiciary that the salaries should be sufficient to enable outstanding legal men to relinquish their professional practices and become available for service in responsible judicial office. . The salaries attaching to the other positions covered by this bill were last determined by the Parliament as follows: - </para>

                    <para>The proposed increases have been determined as the result of a general review of the salaries of permanent heads and other high executive officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. Provision for increased salaries for holders of nonstatutory appointments has been included in the Estimates, and these will become payable when the Appropriation Bill has been passed. The last general review of salaries attaching to senior positions was made in 1937. Since that time, very important changes have taken place in the scope and functions of the several departments, the general effect of which has 'been to increase the responsibilities of the senior officers of those departments. The Government is convinced that the proposed increases in the salaries of permanent heads and other high executive officers are necessary to attract and retain the best men available and thus avoid the numerous resignations which have been an unfortunate feature of the Public Service since the end of the recent war. I therefore commend the bill to the House. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to give effect, on and from the 20th September, 1947, to the sales tax concessions foreshadowed in the budget speech. With one exception only, to which I shall refer later,, the provisions of the bill are confined to the allowance of relief, chiefly by way of removing certain goods from the third, schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, thereby reducing the rate of tax thereon from 25 per cent., to. 10 per cent., and also by allowing certain additional exemptions. Details of thegoods affected are set out in a statement which is being circulated for the information of honorable members. The reduction from 25 per cent, to 10 per cent, applies to a considerable range of goods,, including confectionery and ice cream,, advertising and other printed matter, paper products, photographs, camerasand photographic equipment, smokers' requisites, and fireside furniture. </para>
                    <para>The exemptions now granted ariseprincipally from special requests which have been made to the Government from time to time. For example, in responseto repeated requests, exemption is being granted in respect of water tanks for domestic use. The wide range of foodstuffs which is already exempt is being added to by an exemption of Australian products in the form of fish paste, and of foods which consist principally of fish. The exemption of " aids to manufacture " is being extended to cover plant used by any person exclusively or primarily and principally in the cleansing or sterilizing of bottles or other containers to be used by manufacturers in the marketing of their products, as well as goods for use in scientific research on behalf of manufacturers. There is a new provision for exemption of motor vehicles for the use of ex-servicemen who have lost a leg as a result of their service in the Armed Forces. </para>
                    <para>The sales tax amendments effected in November, 1946, included a provision for exemption of paint and certain associated goods. In the light of experience in the administration of that provision, action is being taken to re-express the relevant item, the chief objects being to authorize the unconditional exemption of lithopone, titanium, antimony oxide, barytes, whiting and goods marketed primarily as paint thinners, and also to authorize conditional exemption of materials not elsewhere exempted when  sold for use aa ingredients of exempt paint. It is provided in the bill that the amended terms of the item shall be effective on and from the date of commencement of the exemption of paint, namely, the 15th November, 1946. </para>
                    <para>As I indicated earlier, the bill contains one provision which is not of a concessionary character. Since the 13th September, 1945, the law has provided for the exemption of " aids to manufacture " in the form of machinery, implements and apparatus. The object of this concession was to obviate double taxation such as had previously occurred by virtue of taxing the cost of these " aids to manufacture" as well as the value of the manufactured goods which are produced with their aid. The value of the manufactured goods would normally take into account the cost of the " aids ". Among the goods covered by the exemption of " aids to manufacture " are master cuttings and matrices for use in the production of gramophone or broadcast records. Where a person contracts to make a record for another it is first necessary for him to obtain or make a master cutting and a matrix, and the cost of these articles is far greater than the cost of producing the finished records therefrom. It is a trade custom that the master cutting and matrix are handed over with the finished records to the customer for whom they are made, and it is contended that there is a sale of the master cutting and matrix. Some manufacturers adopted the practice of separately invoicing the master cuttings and matrices and the records, and of paying tax only on that part of the charge which is attributed to the records. In this manner, tax would be paid in respect of the records upon a value of a few shillings only, whereas the actual cost of production of the records would be several pounds. </para>
                    <para>The existing law is open to similar loss of revenue in respect of blocks for use in the production of taxable printed matter. The procedure referred to is an abuse of the exemption of " aids to manufacture ", which was granted on the understanding that tax would be paid on the full wholesale selling value of the manufactured goods. This value would normally reflect the cost of " aids " used in production. A provision has accord ingly been inserted in the bill to exclude from the exemption of " aids to manufacture " any " aids " which are to be sold to the purchaser of goods made therewith. I am confident that the bill will meet with the approval of honorable members generally. </para>

                            <para>.- As the result of observations made and information gleaned during my recent tour abroad, I desire to make some comments on the present state of world affairs. It seems to me that historically we have entered upon a second era of appeasement. This time, however, the power being appeased is not Germany but Soviet Russia. Already we have progressed a long way along the road of appeasement, and my very real fear is that unless we retrace our steps the world will be engulfed in a disaster greater even than that which followed the first era of appeasement, namely 1933 to 1938 ; and millions upon millions of people will again be destroyed or enslaved. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>Just as the fascists' programme of cruelty, slavery, oppression and death was clearly delineated in Hitler's <inline font-style="italic">Mein Kampf,</inline> so also, if we will take the trouble to inform ourselves, is the present policy of those controlling the Soviets expressed in crystal-clear terms in such works as the writings of Marx and Lenin in their original <inline font-style="italic">Manifesto,</inline> Lenin with <inline font-style="italic">Proletarian Revolution</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Left Wing Communism,</inline> and more recently in the publications of Stalin himself. The truth is that Stalin hag. seized in <inline font-weight="bold">Ms iron</inline> hand the: lives and destinies of over 200,000,000 people  other than those of. Soviet Russia, including Poles, Germans, Austrians, Hungarians,  Rumanians,  Bulgarians, Czechs, Chinese, Koreans, and Man.churians. Those unfortunate millions are being subjected, to a  reign  of terror which is certainly as terrible as any in modern history. The Communists, as the ruling class in Russia,, have killed or exiled or driven into concentration camps millions upon millions of unfortunate people, and are pursuing without let or hindrance their ruthless programme, and  by  the same methods as. did Hitler. They are following a course almost exactly identical with that taken by Hitler from 1.932 to 1939. Their cruelty is not confined to alien peoples; they have treated millions of Russian peoples with unspeakable cruelty. In the countries into which  they  have penetrated their treatment of the occupants has been equally barbarous. They are and have been tearing families asunder, dragging wife from husband, and mother from child. They have created, under conditions which belong to the age of barbarism, slave camps of their own people containing, it is estimated, upwards of 14,000,000 people, whose only sin is that they are opposed to the Communist party, or are not deemed sufficiently co-operative. Such is the Government of Soviet Russia, of whose evil nature the peoples of free countries are so abysmally ignorant. Such is the government which refuses co-operation with, the rest of the world except on its own terms. Such, is the government which grows hungrier and. hungrier for power despite concession upon, concession. </para>
                    <para>We are witnessing Munich in reverse: Our policy of appeasement will result, if action is not taken now, in a. calamity at least as dire as that which engulfed the world in 1939. The only apparent difference between the methods employed by Hitler and those which are being so consistently pursued by Russia is. that while the Germans sought to advance from west to- east, the Russians are seeking to expand from east to west, and into the south and the far east. We are witnessing a desperate bid b.y the Communist party of Russia, as distinct from the Russian people, to obtain world dominion - a bid which will inevitably succeed unless </para>
                    <para class="block">Ave confront it now- as we- should- have met the challenge of Hitler between 1933 and 1939. Maybe within this generation, it will. find its resolution in- another titanic struggle1 from which, no part of the world can escape,, in which western civilization,, of which we are a part, may well be obliterated forever, or result without conflict in the complete subjugation of all parts of the world to the Asiatic slave society which, the Communists  have evolved. I do not, I think,, exaggerate the dangers of the situation.; but, on a matter of: such importance, I believe- it to be my duty to speak what I. believe, without the slightest, reservation. The complete refusal: of Soviet Russia to cooperate in the administration of* "Germany, except on its own terms, is a good illustration of its policy. In the other European countries into which Russia has penetrated it has so reduced the status of formerly independent nations that to-day they are no longer separate national entities. Russia's real intention and policy are clearly delineated by its actions in Asia, as well as in Europe, and they are obviously a development of the pattern outlined in the Soviet writings which I mentioned earlier. </para>
                    <para>The aim of the ruling class of Russia - which, incidentally, when it speaks in its favourite jargon of the " dictatorship of the proletariat " means the " dictatorship of" the Communist party in Russia " - may be stated in simple language. There are- to-day only three powers which can control within the lifetime of this generation the future of the millions of people who inhabit the earth; the United States of America, Soviet Russia and the British Commonwealth of Nations. The Russian Communists- believe that the United States of America is their most formidable antagonist, and that the future- of the- British- peoples depends upon the survival of the United States of America. On reflection there is a great measure of truth in this thesis-, "because if the United States of America does not survive we. in Australia have only to ask ourselves what our chances of survival would be. The Communists of Russia are determined to. destroy the United States of America as a world power,, either by external, action- or internal penetration, or by a combination of those methods. Of course, I do not intend to convey that such a thing may be accomplished in a short period; we know from our knowledge of world affairs that such a process requires time.. But it is perfectly clear that that is Russia's ultimate objective. Because it does not yet possess the secret of the atomic bomb, or if it does, the ability to manufacture it, it is content to play for time. It requires time, first, to rehabilitate its war-time losses ; secondly, to build up its industrial potential, and, thirdly, it hopes - a hope it will do all in its power to bring to pass - that the passage of time may precipitate the democracies of the world into another depression. I believe that its immediate purpose is a two-fold one, the first of which is to extend its domination over an ever-increasing portion of the world's surface. It already dominates the greater portion of Asia and Europe; and by its well-known technique of mass intimidation, pressure and terrorism, exercises influence over an even greater area. The area it dominates, for example, the Russian zone of control in Germany, over which there is an impenetrable cloud of secrecy, and the other countries- which lie to the east of that aone, which at present are under its domination, it will never relinquish unless it is forced to do so; it is there to stay. </para>
                    <para>Coincident with the first objective, it is adopting fifth-column methods, through the agency of the Communist party, in the democratic countries - for example, Canada, the United States of America, England and Australia - the purpose being to white-ant and to weaken those countries. It is infiltrating their economic, social and political structure by false propaganda, by fomenting strikes, by stirring up discontent, by setting class against class, by creating doubt and insecurity in the minds of their people, and by discrediting the democratic institutions under  which  they dwell, thus making' the way easy for their final subjection to Communist rule; It is' my conclusion' that only a fool would deny that those are the twin objectives, in the immediate' future, of the Communist party of Russia. In. my judgment, there is no difference in principle between the purposes of Fascist Germany of 1-933 to. 1939, and Communist Soviet </para>
                    <para class="block">Russia, to-day. Even their methods are strikingly similar - in the mechanics of their organization, and in the ruthlessness,  dishonesty,  intolerance and cruelty with which their methods are applied. Just as war finally resulted from the threat to the world that was inherent in the fascist doctrine, so may war well result, perhaps in the lifetime of this generation, unless the policy of appeasing Russia, which up to recent days we have so consistently followed, is forthwith discarded, and ite place taken by a resolute determination, made plain to Russia's ruling class,- toresist the Communist domination of the world, by force if every other means should fail, since that is the only language which Russia seems to understand. </para>
                    <para>For Australia, there are four cardinal points of foreign policy which the facts demand. The first is to join with other countries in resisting Communist encroachment and domination throughout the world. I say that with this qualification only: <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> have endeavoured for the last two years, as every -man in this chamber knows - and be it said that the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has done his utmost along these lines - to find methods' of cooperation with the Russian Communist party. So have the United States of America and Great Britain; and so, 1 suggest, have most of the other nations of the world which are not directly under Russia's control. It must be recognized fearlessly that our efforts in that direction have failed to achieve the desired results. It must also be recognized that peace cannot come to the world unless Russia is prepared to co-operate. If it does not co-operate, these cardinal points of policy must be pursued. The second is to cement, in the most powerful edifice possible, the British Commonwealth, in terms of economic and strategic strength.. Thirdly, we must achieve, with the United States of America, the highest degree of community of strategic understanding, and must foster the closest ties of friendship, interest; goodwill and understanding with that country. Only by taking up' a strong line shall we ultimately bring- sense to those who are controlling Russian policy at the- moment. It must be made plain to Russia that we have no quarrel with the Russian people, hut that we are determined, so far as lies within our power, to prevent further Communist penetration and destruction of the systems of free people, and to restore to those who have had their liberties filched from them the right to live again under their own institutions, free from fear. </para>
                    <para>I sometimes throw my mind back, as must many other members of this chamber, to the magnificent speech about the four freedoms that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt</inline> in the dark days before the United States of America came into the war, when we were fighting alone. None of us, looking at the world, can now be satisfied that there is any immediate prospect of at least freedom from fear throughout the world. Whose fault principally can that be said to be ? I do not believe in keeping quiet merely because another power is involved; we must speak plainly in regard to it, because only by doing so can we make clear that we understand what is the present aim of the ruling clique  of Russia and only in that way will it ultimately be possible to achieve any . collabora'tion . with them. Just how is Australia making out in terms of the conduct of its foreign policy? So much has been said by the appropriate Government spokesmen on these issues, that a few words on our foreign policy, if any consistent one is really discernible, are justified. The first observation that I want to make is that Australia, is much less secure to-day than it was immediately after hostilities ceased. I do not think that any one can dispute that. An inference is to be drawn from the trend of world events from that time, and if that trend be not arrested, disaster may well overtake us again. Since the war ended, the Government has pursued a path which, in all its  twistings  and windings, would not be unfairly described as tortuous. Perhaps I can excuse every other member of the Government except the Minister for External Affairs,- who seems to have had complete control of foreign policy. The best that can be said of it' is that, generally, it has supported the principles underlying the United Nations, principles in which, I have said more than once, I strongly believe. I have also said in this chamber, riot only in recent days, but also for the Inst two or three years, that I do not believe that the nations of the world have yet progressed far enough along the road of civilization to be able to embody those principles in an organization that will be capable in the foreseeable future of ensuring the peace of the world. Great though .the ideals inherent in the United Nations Charter are, unquestionably ir. would be plain stupidity to believe that the United Nations at present possesses, or is likely to possess within the vital period that lies immediately ahead, any machinery for ensuring peace. The Charter is based on the assumption that all nations are equal. In ray judgment, that is just as meaningless as is the proposition that all men are equal. Peace can be obtained only through power. Where power does not reside, there is no home for security. Whatever one may say hither and thither, the hard, cold, unalterable fact is that power to-day, apart from that of the British Commonwealth, which is not sufficient of itself, to ensure peace, resides in two great aggregations of people, those of the United States of America and Soviet Russia. To talk of equality of all nations is, in my judgment, nothing short of juridical nonsense, and the sooner that fact becomes embedded in our minds the better will it be for all of us. At least, I believe that it will more clearly set the course which we should sail. </para>
                    <para>I want to make it clear that I do not believe that Russia's purpose at the moment is to engage in war; quite the contrary. But everyone knows that when the world is split more and more between two massive ideologies and groupings, and when they extend their domination or their influence more and more over the world's surface, ultimately some small incident may prove to be the detonator to the explosive force thus created. Nor do I believe that Russia is by any means nearly so strong as its propaganda pretends that it is. In short, I believe that it has been playing a colossal game of bluff. In my opinion, the iron curtain which supposedly has been screening Russia's preparations against the rest of the world has been used just as much, perhaps more, to screen its internal weaknesses, brought about very largely by the system which it has been imposing upon its 200,000,000 people. i confess that while 1 was overseas I was unable to discern what Australia's foreign policy is. What is our policy for world security? There have been many splendid statements in this Parliament in terms of ideology and international philosophy, but they do not bear on the realities existing in the world to-day. That is the burden of my song. I have been forced to the conclusion - and I find that my opinions are shared by many others - that we have been engaged, within the general limits set by the United Nations, in a pretty but,  from  the Australian point of view, a futile game of what can best be described as " prestige politics ". Ever since the pattern was set at the San Francisco conference there has been too much banging of the conference table, too much "talking big" conduct that deceives nobody, and which, despite what so-called foreign correspondents may say, usually succeeds in making us appear a little silly. "Prestige politics" does not increase the stature of a nation. It is calculated rather to inflate artificially the personality of individuals. One day we attack Russia ; another day we side with Russia against the United States of America or the United Kingdom. In short, no one knows from one day to another where we are or where we are going. The only nation that is happy about it all is Soviet Russia, whose every action in the Security Council reveals with what contempt it regards the deliberations, except as a forum for the advancement of its own propaganda. We concern ourselves with forms rather than with the realities of power. There is more rejoicing in the appointment of an Australian as the head or as a member of this or that committee than there is in the achievement of any solid advance of the cause of world security. We reveal a strange fascination for documents, which can of themselves neither create nor solve anything, and for which Russia shows the most profound disregard. We talk roughly and , then smoothly to General Macarthur; we alienate sym pathy in quarters where we need it most. The net result of all these " strong-hand " methods is exactly nothing, except, of course, in term of " prestige politics ", in the advancement of which there is always available some convenient spokesman who will dish out the usual sop of " prestige ". So far as the world can determine - to the limited degree to which the world is at all interested - on the various questions which have arisen for deliberation in the Security Council, Australia has revealed no consistent line of action. A glance at the way in which Australia has voted, or abstained from voting, on the issues which have from time to time come before U.N.O. should be sufficient to establish that fact. The only consistency Australia has revealed is in its objection to the veto, concerning which the Minister for External Affairs and Australia's representatives overseas have at all times been so vocal. I agree that there are philosophical objections to the veto, but to pursue those objections to the degree of directing attention to them at every opportunity gets us nowhere unless Russia is prepared to sacrifice its right of veto. We are reaching the stage where, unless Russia is prepared to do that, the other nations of the world will have to organize together for the peace of the world. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. Most of this talk about the veto is on a philosophical plane and has little to do with the realities of world politics. If there were any sense of realism at all in our foreign policy, it ought to have been realized that to exclude the veto and still expect Russia to remain, with the United Nations was about as effective as a dog's howling at the moon. On the one matter which is essential, namely, that of meeting the threat of Communist domination, Australia has done next to nothing; and what it has done, or has permitted others, such as the Communistcontrolled Waterside Workers Federation, to do in the name of Australia in relation to issues, of which the Indonesian trouble presents a good example, has either played into .the hands of Soviet Russia in jits constant penetration of other countries not within the orbit of its immediate domination, or has actively aided Soviet policy. </para>

                    <para>It is time that we awakened to our peril. Solely as a result of Soviet policy, another war is in the making. The sooner it is understood that the British peoples and those of the United States of America have one common fate the better. Unless they survive the bid for world domination that the Communist party of Russia clearly is making, they will become the victims of the Asiatic cruelty which has been the lot of all people who have fallen under the " dictatorship of the proletariat ", the cover-up phrase for "tyranny of the Communists ". The sooner this is realized the sooner may we hope for some evidence of a positive policy from Australia to meet that challenge. Russia's policy has been brought home to many people for whom we went to war. T refer particularly to the people of Czechoslovakia and Poland who are now under the complete domination of this so-called democratic power. By cruel means, as well as by ideological teaching, Russia is seeking to weaken the democratic nations. That brings me to the danger to Australia from Communist activity. Soviet Russia's policy includes the undermining of all other countries not now within its orbit of domination through -the highly organized and well-known techniques of industrial disorganization, penetration, disruption and spying propaganda with which informed people are- already unhappily so familiar. What does the Government intend to do about this menace, this cancer in our midst? I was Minister for the Army in the period before Russia entered the war and I say that in 1941 there were numerous files, which are still available, containing evidence of the activities of the -Communist party in Australia which show that it was  the  direct agent of Soviet Russia. </para>

                            <para>- The Comintern then existed whose acknowledged function was to direct from Moscow the fifth-column activities of the Communist party in every country throughout the world, always, of course, in the interests of Soviet Russia. Ko one with any knowledge of the history of the world before 1943 can deny that the Comintern was an instrument of Russian foreign policy. There was a direct connexion, as was shown in the evidence tendered before the royal commission in Canada, with Communist cells and parties all over the world. It was not any wonder that the Communist party in Australia opposed the death struggle in which Australia was engaged in 1940-41 as an "imperialistic war " and did its utmost to sabotage the war effort in exactly the same way, and in almost exactly the same terms, as it did in Canada, India, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt and Palestine, and, indeed, in every part of the British Empire where there was a Communist party or cell - and they were everywhere. Those activities ceased when Soviet Russia came into the war, but not the world-wide activities of the  comintern.  The party's line was varied. .Soviet Russia, which was fighting with us against fascist Germany, engaged then in one of the cruellest pieces of deception any ally could be guilty of. It announced to the world in 1943, with appropriate propaganda and fanfare, that the  comintern  had been dissolved. This was deliberately intended to fool its allies. Actually, it continued to exist and function in secret. Documents produced before the royal commission in Canada, which was inquiring into the spy activities of Soviet agents in that country, established this fact beyond the faintest shadow of doubt. It continues to direct from its head-quarters in Moscow the activities of all Communist parties throughout the world. Thus we find on proven evidence that it was operating in Canada and .the United Kingdom while still fighting as our ally, a vast secret, network of espionage whilst, since the cessation of hostilities, the Communist parties in every country, whether their members know it or not, are .being used as the direct instrument of Soviet foreign policy. Is it to be assumed that the Communist party in Australia is any different from those operating in Canada, the United States of America, the United </para>

                    <para class="block">Kingdom, and in every other part of the world ? The Labour Government possesses information on its files to give substantial support to my allegations. The Comintern head-quarters, operating from Moscow, have files on every leading Communist party member in Australia. That much may be deduced from the information which came to light during the inquiry into Communist activities in Canada. Foreign policy cannot avoid dealing with the activities of a foreign power in Australia through the Communist party. Yet what has been the record of the Labour Government to date on this score? It legalised the Communistparty in 1942, an act for which the Minister for External Affairs was' largely responsible, thus giving it a status which has permitted it to extend its activities widely, and with apparent impunity. It has refused to hold an inquiry into the activities of the Communist party as was done in Canada. </para>
                    <para>If we have any regard for the future welfare of this country and for its democratic institutions- in which most members of the Commonwealth Parliament believe or ought to believe, . the Communist party cannot be allowed to function any longer in Australia. It9 activities must he stamped out as quickly and ruthlessly as possible. We know that any attempt to do this will be met by the Communists - who use the forms of democracy to cover their activity - with charges of " fascist " and " undemocratic ". They will describe any attack on their party as an attack on the freedom of political organization and the freedom of speech, and in this they will receive the support of fellow travellers, some Labour politicians, and some woollyminded intellectuals. Of course, it would be nothing of the sort. There is no such thing as freedom to say or do anything you wish irrespective of its effects upon the institutions of government, or irrespective of what it is that you say or do. Under our Constitution, a man is free to hold and advocate any political opinion he wishes, even the opinion that Communism is the best form of political organization for the people of any country; but he has no such freedom to advocate the bringing about, or to do anything to bring about Communism in a country by revolution. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.']</inline> He has no right to advocate the achievement of such a change by the forcible destruction of democratic institutions of government. Neither has he the right to belong to an organization, which, whether he knows it or not, is " an instrument in the hands of the Soviet Government for creating unrest, provocation, &amp;c", as it was described in evidence by  Groshenko,  the Russian cypher officer, who gave evidence before the royal commission in Canada. The right of freedom of speech and freedom of organization presupposes the existence of a democratic government, and every schoolchild knows that no such freedoms exist in Russia. No one, under the cover of such freedom, can be allowed to work to destroy democratic institutions, and certainly not by unconstitutional and revolutionary means. Yet that is precisely what the Communist party does. Moreover, no democratic, or other, government, can permit any organization or group of persons to function, knowingly or unknowingly, as the agents of or in carrying out the policy of, a foreign government. Yet that is precisely what the Communist party is doing. </para>
                    <para>The other objection which will be raised - one cunningly cultivated by the Communists themselves - is that if you declare the Communist party illegal, you will drive its members underground, so making it more difficult to watch their activities.1 This has as much sense as to argue that if "Murder Incorporated ", a body which actually existed in the United States of America, were f  found  to be functioning in Australia, it ought not to be attacked as an organization, otherwise you might drive its members underground. Such an argument is just plain nonsense. Since the Labour Government gave to the Communist party in this country legal prestige and status its power has increased enormously. Its legality, created by the Labour Government, provides what the Communist himself calls a " roof ", which is a legal front for illegal activities. If the suppression of the Communist party results in driving its members underground - their operations are underground now - then the further underground they are forced the better for democracy in this country. </para>
                    <para>The only other so-called argument against the course I suggest is that the Communists are of little significance, as evidenced by the small support they obtain at elections, and that it would be inexpedient to waste ammunition on such a negligible force in the community for, by so doing, you would increase their importance. Perhaps the Prime Minister thinks like that because not long ago I remember hearing him say that in his opinion the influence of the Communists was overrated, and that he thought of them only as the boys who, at union meetings, proposed long-worded resolutions he could not understand. Yet who can deny that the Communists are now penetrating deeper and deeper into the life of the community? Therefore, the Communist party must be suppressed as an illegal organization - completely and thoroughly. I am aware that my views are not shared by some members on this side of the House, but I am expressing my profound conviction. Membership of this organization, or any substitute front under which it may continue in any way to operate, should disqualify a person from holding any position in the Public Service of this country or from being a member of any registered trade union. Will the Labour party, or the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who also has the direction of this country's foreign policy, do anything in this matter before it is too late? Judging from the Government's past record we shall, no doubt, have plenty of high-sounding words, but precious little action on its part, to combat this most serious challenge from within to our democratic institutions and our democratic way of life. The Government must face up to this threat. I refrain from making at this moment any suggestion as to what the Government should do. All honorable members I am sure believe at least in principle in the foundations of democratic government. We have gone a long way along the road in respect of our external policy to accommodate ourselves to Russia; but Russia by the exercise of the veto stultifies any action on the part of the United Nations and, indeed, canalizes anything that is done by that body only along lines consistent with the policy which Russia is determined to pursue. Therefore, we must meet the challenge implicit in that policy both within and without Australia. I draw the attention of the Government to this menace, which I believe to be a serious ill in this country and a challenge to our democratic way of life; and I want to hear in this debate from spokesmen for the Government what it proposes to do about the matter. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> is at the table, because being the Minister primarily responsible for the success of the post-war conduct of the industries of the Commonwealth and a fellow Victorian he will, himself, no doubt, be concerned over what is happening in Victoria at present. In that State we are in our fifth week of gas rationing. That matter is serious enough in itself, when one has regard to the serious inconvenience caused to the public, and particularly to the housewives of Victoria, who necessarily make considerable use of gas for domestic purposes; but it is having a wider effect in the restrictions which are being placed upon so many Victorian industries. There may be factors operating which make a shortage of coal in Australia at present inevitable. I am not by any means convinced that that is so; but I am prepared to accept the fact that this Government is not capable of immediately overcoming the shortage of coal throughout the Commonwealth. However, the burden of my criticism today is that one State of the Commonwealth should not be called upon to carry a very much greater proportion of that restriction than are the other States. To the best of my knowledge no restriction is placed upon the use of gas in New South Wales, which is also an important industrial State; and, perhaps, that observation applies also to other States. There is a responsibility upon the Government, particularly upon the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, to ensure an equitable distribution of such coal as is available. I have raised this issue on previous occasions in this House. I do not believe that a fair distribution is being made, particularly for industrial purposes, from the limited stocks of coal available; and I am not satisfied that this state of affairs is due to shipping difficulties or to hold-ups on the waterfront. The Minister should take up this matter with the Commonwealth Coal Controller and urge that Victoria is entitled to a very much better deal than it is now receiving. I do not raise this matter in any parochial spirit, because any restriction of industry in Victoria adversely affects many industries throughout the Commonwealth which are dependent for their materials upon production in Victoria. I shall welcome any information which the Minister may be in a position to give, but if he cannot now reassure us on this point I ask him to state clearly that the Government will investigate the position immediately with a view to improving the supply of coal for domestic and industrial purposes in Victoria. </para>

At one time I hadsomething to do with the allocation of coal supplies to the various States when I was a member of a committee which inquired into their requirements. The honorable member knows that there is a very grave shortage of coal throughout the Commonwealth. I have not seen any figures recently dealing with the basis of allocations, and I am not able to say whether the allocations made have been filled. I shall obtain that information for the honorable member and supply it to him later. </para>

                            <para> <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have not seen the actual proposals referred to by the honorable member, but I understand that on the 15th July, 1940, a bill was introduced as stated by the honorable member into the United States House of Representatives resolving that on and after the 1st January, 1950, the world calendar as set out in the bill should be the official calendar of the United States of America and all territories subject to its jurisdiction. I shall be pleased to make available to any honorable member for inspection a copy of the bill referred to (No. HR7041). I also understand, however, that the passing of a resolution to submit bills to Congressional committees for their examination does not necessarily imply that hearings on the issues involved will be undertaken immediately. The Government has not yet considered the drafting of legislation along the lines suggested by the honorable member, but any suggestion received from the  President  of the United States would obviously be given due consideration.  Recently, I received a communication from the honorary secretary of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science drawing my attention to the bill which the honorable member has referred to, and also to the fact that the question of a world calendar is under consideration by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The subject of a world calendar was considered by the Economic and Social Council at its fifth session on the 21st July, 1947. The United States . delegate proposed that, in view of the heavy agenda of the Council and the more pressing economic problems requiring the immediate attention of governments, consideration of this matter should not be taken up at present. This view was supported by the Union  of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and India. The Council thereupon decided to drop the matter from the agenda. The most effective way of obtaining general concurrence in the proposed world calendar is through the United Nations, and it is considered that active steps to secure its adoption should not be taken until the time is more propitious for its ^examination by the Economic and Social Council. </para>

                        <para>It is a fact that, for the financial year 1946- 1947; Queensland was the only State which did not receive any portion of the tuberculosis  grant under section6 of the Tuberculosis Act 1945-1946. Thereason why Queensland  did  not  receive  any portion of the grant for the financial year 1946-47 was that this  State  did not make any application although urged to do so. During the present financial year 1947-48,  a  proportion of the grant has been claimed by the Queensland Government and paid. The  State  Government believed  that  the financial burden of the States in implementing the Government's scheme would be greater than that of the Commonwealth. The State was already, except in the case of single sufferers and sufferers with a wife only, making payments in excess of the ceiling rates recommended by a conference of officers of the Commonwealth and of the States on 18th December, 1946, and accented by the Commonwealth. The State Government was advised that the grant of £250,000 per annum from the Commonwealth was not regarded as adequate for the complete relief of necessitous sufferers and their dependants; but that the Commonwealth provides financial relief to tuberculosis sufferers in the form of invalid pensions and sickness benefits on a substantial scale. </para>

                        <para>As a result of allegations that  a  big black market was developing in respect of timber in New South Wales, the  Deputy  Prices Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herlihy,</inline> announced that special steps would be taken to uncover the irregularities. As a result of investigations it is now believed that the majority of timber merchants are not engaged in black marketing; some irregularities have been discovered and the details are being examined with a view to prosecution. Prices of all building' materials are being carefully watched and the Government has appointed a special advisor in building to assist the Prices Commissioner in the practical problems associated with the construction of homes. </para>

                        <para>The Postal Department is proceeding with a comprehensive programme which will involve an expenditure in the order of £30,000,000 during the next three years on works necessary to rehabilitate and improve the postal and telecommunication services throughout the Commonwealth. The plans include the provision of telephone facilities on a large scale, the installation of &gt; modern switching equipment, the establishment of many new exchanges, the remodelling of existing premises, the erection of -many additional trunk line channels and the installation of a large number of public telephones. </para>
                        <para>The Government is fully behind the proposal to meet the serious position which exists, and has appointed a Cabinet sub-committee to controlthe programme. It is the firm intention to restore depleted' reserves of plant and equipment to enable adequate and up-to-date tele- phone facilities to be made available for resients in city and country areas as soon as possible. </para>
                        <para>In addition to materials which are now being received, orders have been placed for 120,000 lines of automatic equipment, 330,000 telephones, 250,000 pair miles of underground cable, and carrier wave systems for 800 trunk channels, and it is proposed to install 500 rural automatic exchanges in country districts. </para>
                        <para>Much has been done by the department to foster the manufacture in Australia of telecommunications equipment and components, and a large proportion of the apparatus required is now being produced locally in the departmental workshops or by outside organizations. Negotiations are proceeding with interests in the United Kingdom and the United States of America for the establishment of factories in Australia for producing automatic switching equipment. The present factories for making telephone cables cannot cope with the demands, but arrangements have been made for further factories to be erected in the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>The exceptional measures which have been taken by the department to meet the unprecedented demand for new services and to overtake the arrears which have accumulated will be evident from the fact that since the war ended, and despite the abnormal difficulties associated with new buildings', technical materials and skilled labour, 174,000 telephones have been installed throughout the Commonwealth and 525 new trunk lines have been brought into service. </para>
                        <para>The importance of overtaking the arrears of applications for telephones is appreciated fully by the Government and the Postal Department, which has set up a special organization to achieve this objective. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member may restassured that the Post Office is sparing no. efforts to. rehabilitate and improve its services, and that every means whereby greater expedition can be' secured will be adopted. </para>
