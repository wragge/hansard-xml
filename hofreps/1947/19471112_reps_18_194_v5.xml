                    <para>- I have received petitions from the electorate of Eden-Monaro protesting against the nationalization of banking, and seeking a referendum. Whilst a number of them are not properly addressed for presentation to the House, others addressed to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> are couched in courteous and respectful language, concluding with a prayer, and, so far as I can judge, are otherwise in conformity with Standing Orders. Furthermore, I have, as T considered it is my duty, taken steps to have those petitions investigated to ensure their authenticity. The results of these investigations show whole pages of signatures which,  in the opinion of hand-writing experts,##'## have all been written by the one person. A number of people to whom these signatures have been referred##'## have stated that the signatures are not theirs, and that they would like to prosecute the individuals who forged them. The investigations have also revealed that more than 10 per cent, of the signatures on the petitions are those of juveniles, 15 per cent, are the names of persons who cannot be identified in the districts for which their addresses are given, and, furthermore, that the signatures, include a number such as ##"##Adolf Hitler##"##, ##"##Benito Mussolini##"##, ##"##Josef  Goebbels##"##,  who, whilst they would probably have been against the nationalization of banking,, cannot be accepted as electors of Eden-Monaro. For those reasons, I have no intention of presenting the petitions. </para>

Brown, the well-known Communist, decided last night to organize economic and industrial action against the Governments of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia should those governments persist in their intention to challenge the validity of the Banking Bill? Is it also a fact that the Victorian branch of the Australian Railways Union has asked the Australian Council of Trades Unions to summon an immediate conference in order to combat ##"##by any means considered necessary##"## any action taken by those governments against the implementation of the Banking Bill? Did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> make pointed reference to the dependence of Victoria and South Australia on New South Wales for supplies of coal? Is the right honorable gentleman aware that the miners##'## federation and the Seamen##'##s Union are reported to favour the proposal made by the Australian Railways Union? Does he approve of industrial action intended to thwart the proper and constitutional activities of the-Victorian Government, which was elected only a few days ago by an  overwhelming majority of the people of that State ? Will the Prime Minister condemn the reported attitude of the unions mentioned, and take such action as he can to prevent the adoption of sectional, ##"## stand-over ##"## tactics of that type ? </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen any report of the particular matter to which the honorable member has referred, but I am aware that the salaries paid to officers of the Commonwealth Bank have always been regarded by the officers of private banks as a standard which they should endeavour to get the court to grant to them. The Commonwealth Bank has set the standard for salaries in banking institutions. I understand that some officers of private banks have approached the State Industrial Court for increased remuneration. The bill now before the Parliament provides that where an existing award grants certain advantages to officers of private banks such officers shall not lose anything when the private banks are acquired. </para>

                        <para>When it comes to making investigations, I remind the honorable member that we could make a lot more . . . and we may do it some day. We do not need an investigation into one fact that has come to our notice recently and that is that the honorable member has used his stamp allowance to pay his account at the Government Printing Office. </para>

                    <para>These observations by the Minister had nothing to do with the question that I asked, but they inferred that I was doing something illegal or improper in my capacity as a member of this chamber. In refuting this insinuation, I should like to say that I, in common with other honorable members, have had copies of speeches that we believed might interest electors, printed by the Government Printer for a certain fee. Although it had been customary for <inline font-style="italic">me to make</inline> payment for these speeches by way of cheque, on one or two occasions I used stamps to pay small amounts. I did so because, although I had not previously taken advantage of this privilege, I understood it was permissible to do so, and that it was a customary privilege exercised by honorable members. This assumption was borne out, in fact, by the acceptance by the Government Printer of the stamps I tendered to meet those small accounts on the one or two occasions I have mentioned. After the statement made by the Minister, which I have quoted to the House, and which I believe was calculated to besmirch my character and standing as a member of this honorable House, I telephoned the accountant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McIntyre,</inline> at the Government Printing Office, who stated that, although he now had instructions to discontinue the practice of accepting postage stamps in discharge of honorable members##'## accounts, this privilege had been used recently by members, and, indeed, it had been the custom for years. To show that it is customary for speeches of honorable members to be paid by the Commonwealth, I direct attention to a letter I recently received from the Minister acting for the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> in answer to a query by me, stating that a certain pamphlet was issued by the Attorney-General in his ministerial capacity at the expense of the Commonwealth. Those facts must have been  known to the Minister for Information, and, therefore, I can only look upon his insinuation as an attempt to intimidate me and prevent me from asking embarrassing questions. </para>

The custom for many years has been to permit private members to do that, but, as a Minister, I do not do that sort of thing. Had the honorable member not insinuated all sorts of things against the Postmaster-General##'##s Department keeping dossiers and operating a censorship, and had he not besmirched the splendid character of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> I should not have needed to retaliate. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Wentworth yesterday charged me with having opened a letter that belonged to him. After he made the charge, I made inquiries in my office, because the letter had never been placed in my hands. It came in the general mail, which is opened in the office by a member of my staff. Immediately he realized that the letter was not addressed to me, the officer who opened it returned it to the box of the honorable member for Wentworth. The letter was not in my hands at any time. The honorable member implied, by referring to a previous incident some years ago, that it was my practice to open and read letters belonging to other people. He was relying on the lapse of time since that other occasion to which he referred to delude the people into believing that that is my practice. That letter was addressed not to the secretary to the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> but to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> himself. In order that the public may judge where the blame should rest in regard to that incident I merely relate the salient features of it. At the time a royal commission was inquiring into banking operations in this country. That royal commission was constituted as the result of a motion by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> McEwen),  who had expressed great dissatisfaction with the activities of the private banks in Australia. The commission was at that time taking evidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roland</inline> Wilson, the Commonwealth Statistican,  was to go before the commission the following week to give evidence. On the day when the letter came into my possession, the Labour party then being in opposition, a special messenger arrived at Parliament House with a letter in an envelope addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> G. Casey, the then Treasurer. The messenger had been given instructions that the letter was to be placed in the hands of ##"## <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> and nobody else ##"##. Whoever gave the instructions failed to tell the messenger which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> was intended. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> had a private secretary having the same name as myself. When the special messenger arrived at Parliament House he insisted, because he thought that the letter was for me, t  that I should take it. At the time I was speaking in the House. An ex-member for Reid, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gander,</inline> wanted to take the letter and promised the messenger that he would deliver it to me when I resumed my seat. However, the messenger insisted that he must give it to me personally, so important was it. When the envelope was finally handed to me I noticed that it was addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> and I immediately handed it back and said, ##"## This is for the Treasurer##"##. The messenger said, ##"## Take no notice of the name on the envelope. My instructions are to deliver it to you personally ##"##. Then I opened the letter. I shall now tell the honorable member for Wentworth something that he has never at any time seen fit to tell to the public of this country, namely, what was contained in the envelope, which was of the utmost importance. The public was being asked to bear the expense of holding a royal commission to inquire into banking operations and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Boland</inline> Wilson, who was to give evidence before the commission the following week- </para>

                                <para>-  That envelope contained a copy of the evidence which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roland</inline> Wilson proposed to give before the royal commission the following week. With that copy was a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wilson</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> in which he stated : ##"## I have also submitted a copy of my proposed evidence to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sheehan##"##</inline> - who was then Secretary to the Treasury - ##"## and no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sheehan</inline> will blue-pencil much of it##"##. I regarded that as an effort to ##"## doctor ##"## evidence that was to be given before a royal commission. When I tackled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> about the matter in this Parliament, he said that no significance was attached to the contents of the envelope because it was merely a private joke between himself, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wilson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sheehan.</inline> The public of Australia can judge as to whether I did the proper thing. I had to consider whether by divulging the contents of the envelope ray own position would be misunderstood or whether I had a public duty to perform, and I decided that my public duty must come first and that, when a royal commission had been appointed to inquire into a particular subject, no government official, or Minister, should be permitted to ##"## doctor ##"## evidence to be given before that commission. First. I tell the honorable member for Wentworth that his filthy insinuation that I am accustomed to opening letters addressed to other people and that there is something sinister about the delivery of a particular letter to my office has no foundation at all. The envelope was never even in my possession, and the Minister for Information acting for the Postmaster-General is now conducting inquiries in order to ascertain how it was misdirected. Secondly, when the honorable member wants to refer to any incident in which I am involved I suggest that, as I have nothing to be afraid of, he should relate the whole of the circumstances surrounding it. </para>

No honorable member will object to his proposal that the House shall meet to-morrow at 10.30 a.m., but I should like to know whether the ##"## guillotine ##"## will be applied to the bill. Many honorable members desire to speak on a number of clauses, and make their attitude clear to the country. Therefore, I hope that we shall have ample opportunity to do so. </para>

If so, has this decision been taken because strikes have made it impossible for this target to be reached? Has the Minister##'##s attention also been directed to the reported statement of a leader of the coal-miners in Sydney that, ##"## You can take it from me, we will have our three weeks holiday ##"## ? If so, does this represent defiance of the decision of the Joint Coal Board? What action does the Government propose to take for the purpose of ensuring that industry and the public shall not be denied essential coal supplies over the Christmas period? </para>

                        <para>- I have received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwin</inline> Tyrie, Bullenbong  South, The Rock, New South Wales, referring to twostatements which appeared on the same page of a recent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Wagga Advertiser.</inline> One report stated that the Minister for Agriculture of New South. Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham,</inline> said that the delayin importing cornsacks was caused by lack, of shipping, and that, in order to avoid confusion, farmers should store about 25,000,000 bushels of wheat on their farms. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Tyrie  points out that theadoption of such a course would result in great confusion on wheat farms. Thesecond report stated that a ship is expected to arrive in Fremantle early in December, bringing 860 immigrants from Balticcountries, and that it was proposed to send a naval vessel to Fremantle to transport them to the eastern States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Tyrie</inline> wishes to know whether it wouldnot be possible to accommodate the immigrants temporarily in a staging camp at Fremantle, so that the naval vessel could proceed to Calcutta to transport a consignment of cornsacks to this country.. He suggests that the naval vessel could,, on its return to Fremantle, transport theimmigrants to the eastern States. Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture confer with the Minister for Immigration to ascertain whether some sucharrangement could be made? </para>

                        <para>- Under the agreement into which the Australian Government has entered with the United Kingdom Government Australia sells and exports to the United Kingdom the whole of its surplus butter production, other than a token quantity of 500 tons, which is utilized for export to those markets which took large quantities prior to the war. It is true that Australian butter is sent to Lebanon, Egypt,##'## Malaya, Hong Kong and a number of other markets, but that is done at the request and, in fact, the direction of the United Kingdom Government. That Government, as the honorable gentleman knows, has arrangements in respect of garrisons, British residents and quite a number of other factors. These arrangements require that Australia shall ship butter to those various destinations, at the direction of the United Kingdom Government. </para>

As the subject is constantly under review by the Government, particularly by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, I cannot see that any good, purpose would he served by appointing such a committee. </para>

In view of the importance of primary industries to the national economic structure, will the Prime Minister institute inquiries into the root cause of the small increase of the number of persons employed in the industries that I have mentioned, and, at the same time, will he take appropriate action to enforce rigid economies in the Commonwealth Public Service ? </para>

The right honorable member for North Sydney and other honorable members referred someyears ago to the declining number of persons employed in primary industries as compared with secondary industries. It is true that the number- of persons employed in primary industries has not kept pace with the increased volume of primary production, but that is due to the introduction of machinery. In some instances a machine worked by one man is able to do the work formerly done by a dozen men. However, I shall look into the matter raised by the honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen any statement from him on the subject. No doubt, correspondence has passed between me and the Federal Executive of the Australian Labour party since its last meeting here, but I cannot remember writing any letters on the subject mentioned by the honorable member. Representations have been received from various unions regarding the nationalization of coal mines and the iron and steel industry, and in reply to them I have pointed out that the Australian Parliament has no power under the Constitution to nationalize those industries, even if the Government wished to do so. Therefore, it is sheer nonsense to talk of the Government##'##s plans for nationalizing such industries. I know that the Federal Executive of the Australian Labour party will meet in Canberra next week. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not know what it intends to discuss with me, and when I do find out I do not propose to tell the honorable member for Balaclava. </para>

I refer in particular to the return recently of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ##"##Joe##"##</inline> Alexander, who was for three years First Secretary at the Australian Legation at Moscow. I desire to ascertain conditions existing in Russia in respect of the system of incentive payment, particularly the operation- of what is known as the Stakhanovitch  system, under which workers are paid according to output. I, and other honorable members on this side of the chamber, desire this information in view of the opposition by Communists in this country to the principle of incentive payment. Can the Prime Minister arrange for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> to make available to honorable members, not diplomatic information, but commercial information relating to conditions in Russia? </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I wish to inform the House of the decisions of the Government on proposals communicated by the Government of the United States of America for the award of American decorations to members of the Australian Defence Forces. The Government received 229 proposals for the bestowal of American awards on Australian service personnel which required extensive examination and correspondence with the service departments, and cablegrams to the United Kingdom, in the light of the rules governing the acceptance of foreign honours. The Australian Government has not drawn up rules of its own to govern the acceptance of foreign honours. It has applied to the Australian forces the rules which were adopted by the United Kingdom Government and communicated to the Australian and other British Commonwealth Governments in 1942. One of the rules was that the scale of acceptance of United States awards by .members of the Australian forces should, in general, be one acceptance for each British award granted to American forces in the South-West Pacific Area. The Government represented to the United Kingdom authorities that it would bn loath to contemplate the wholesale rejection of awards sponsored by our American ally for operational service for no other reason than that they would involve a departure from a numerical balance. Further, by virtue of the close association of the American and Australian forces throughout the war in the South-West Pacific Area, the Government believed that it was fitting that acceptance of awards for operational service should be permitted on a generous scale for the final series of recommendations to mark the end of hostilities. The United Kingdom authorities have agreed with this view, and consideration of the proposals has proceeded without regard to any of the limitations which would have been imposed if the one for one rule had applied. </para>

                    <para>The Government has accepted 102 American awards for gallantry or heroism, or for outstanding service directly in, or associated with, operations in an operational area. They include awards for Allied Intelligence Bureau parties which landed in enemy territory, for intelligence patrols, heroism and good service in action, coast watching in enemy territory, operational flights and strikes against the enemy, the rescue of survivors of crashed aircraft in enemy territory, and many other instances of gallantry and outstanding service in operations. The Government has expressed its appreciation of the offer of the American Government for the bestowal of the American awards in these cases and its pleasure in accepting them. The Government regrets that it is unable to accept American awards in the following cases, and for the reasons stated : - </para>

The only possible effect that this course could have upon the Government##'##s timetable would be to postpone the termination of the present sessional period for one day. The alternative is the postponement of discussion of these two important matters, perhaps indefinitely. There can hardly be any difficulty in making a choice between the courses. </para>

                        <para>. - Whilst agreeing with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> on these questions, I wish to make my protest as a private member. I had proposed to take advantage of the opportunity offered by private members##'## business to deal with certain matters, three of which I shall name : The first is the delay in the payment for land acquired at Puckapunyal early in the war ; the second is the injustice of provisional tax deductions, and the effect of these deductions upon primary production ; and the third is the necessity for immediate action by the Government to organize our machinery resources for the harvesting of wheat and oats. In regard to the last-mentioned matter, I have a plan that I proposed to outline to the House. As the House rose last Friday at 1 p.m. and is, I understand, to rise next Friday at the same time and rises on other sitting days at from 11 p.m. to 12 midnight, when many honorable members are absent, we are not able satisfactorily to take advantage of the motion for the adjournment of the House to raise matters of importance to the community. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> should preserve, not destroy, the privileges of private members. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, to allow private members to raise to-morrow matters with which they are concerned would only mean an extra sitting day this sessional period. The duty of honorable members is to try to do what they can for the people, not to hasten away from the Parliament as soon as they can. I do not know what all the hurry is about. Ever since I have been a member of this House, I have contended that the Parliament should sit throughout the year if necessary to deal with matters of urgent public importance. The motion submitted by the Prime Minister is unjustifiable. On the last occasion on which private members should have been able to exercise the privilege of moving and debating motions standing in their names they were not allowed to do so because of the passage of a motion similar to this, and, on the previous occasion, it was only because a certain debate did not last so long as the Prime Minister expected it would that honorable members were able to exercise their privilege. The Prime Minister claims that he has the constitutional right to proceed with the Banking Bill. Surely honorable members have the constitutional right to raise on the day set aside for that purpose matters that affect them or the people generally. I know that the Prime Minister has the necessary numerical strength behind him to force this motion through, but I do not think he ought to use that power against honorable members who want to raise matters like those I intended to raise, or that referred to in the notice of motion of the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> which seeks the convening of a Committee of Privileges to deal with charges made against the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain),</inline> with whom 1 was associated for a long while. I appeal to the Prime Minister to withdraw the motion so that honorable members shall be able to debate matters in which they are interested. </para>

                            <para>- I merely wish to point out that I am not the only person who regards the matter as important and urgent. Ex-servicemen are deeply concerned that there should be .an opportunity in this Parliament for it to be debated. Normally the Standing Orders would provide the opportunity to-morrow for honorable members to decide whether the honorable member for the Northern Territory should have the chance of clearing his reputation of a dreadful accusation. The motion moved by the Prime Minister is within the ambit of procedure, of course, but it is designed to alter the normal course laid down in the Standing Orders. The effect on the honorable member for the Northern Territory of being without an opportunity of clearing himself of this accusation is serious. The slurs cast upon him that he improperly used his gold pass in order to get preferential treatment from the Japanese, and is a man of low mentality and the lack of an opportunity to have such statements refuted mentally distress the honorable member.  His  distress is shared by thousands of  decent and honorable Australians. I recall the ancient legal maxim that justice delayed is justice denied. To delay justice to the honorable member is to deny him justice. He was a gallant soldier and is a man of the highest ethical standards.  His  loyalty is unquestioned. He volunteered his services to his country in two wars. He has shown his probity and honour in this House. It will be to the eternal shame of the Government if it delays for months his opportunity to clear his name. This man endured torture at the hands of the Japanese, Is he to receive mental torture at the hands of the Australian Government? Are his own colleagues in the Parliament to deny him the opportunity of refuting scurrilous reflections cast upon him? He has received communications from his commanding officer, who says- </para>

                            <para>- No, sir, but your ruling with regard to the question of privilege would ##'##be under discussion if this motion were permitted to proceed. If matters of a personal nature are stood over in this House so that we have no opportunity to resolve them, then that is a gross reflection upon the members of this House who are denied the right to stand up for their own privileges. The Prime Minister may find such motions very embarrassing to him because they are of a personal character and affect the good standing and prestige of members of this House. However, that should not deter him. Surely honorable members have privileges, and surely it is incumbent upon the right honorable gentleman to give them the opportunity to clear themselves of accusations that have been made against them. I ask the Prime Minister, notwithstanding any embarrassment to himself, to give us an opportunity to proceed with the business set out on the notice-paper. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill extends the principal provisions of the Tradesmen##'##s Rights Regulation Act 1946 to the trades in the boot, shoe, sandal and slipper manufacturing industry which were subject to the National Security (Boot Trades Dilution) Regulations. During World War II., as I explained to this House in July, 1946, when the Tradesmen##'##s Rights Regulation Bill was introduced, the Australian Government and representatives of the employers and unions, in order to meet the exceptional demand for munitions and other essential supplies, entered into agreements whereby existing trade customs and practices in the skilled engineering trades were relaxed to enable semiskilled and partly-trained workers to perform work normally performed by fully qualified tradesmen. However, it was part of these agreements that the employment rights of recognized tradesmen should not he permitted to be prejudiced through the creation of a new class of added or dilutee tradesmen, and this principle was given clear expression in the Dilution Regulations, which were subsequently made under the National Security Act. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the dilution schemes in the engineering trades, the Australian Government in June, 1942, after negotiations with representaives of employers and the Boot Trades Union, issued the National Security (Boot Trades Dilution) Regulations and thereby established a dilution scheme in the boot and shoe manufacturing industry. When the Government  wa9  negotiating with the parties concerning the liquidation of these war-time dilution arrangements, the representatives of the boot and shoe manufacturing industry arranged to have further discussions concerning the future of this particular scheme, as their postwar problems arising from the operation of the National Security Regulations were not affected, as the engineering trades had been, by the trade training and experience which men had received whilst serving in the forces. Accordingly, the boot trades were not covered by the </para>
                    <para class="block">Tradesmen##'##s Rights Regulation Act and the National Security (Boot Trades Dilution) Regulations have continued in force by virtue of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act. </para>
                    <para>The Government has now completed discussions with . representatives of the employers and the union following representations by the union that the Government should restore normal trade practices in accordance with the dilution agreement. In making these representations, the union has agreed to the inclusion of provisions for the training and employment of suitable ex-servicemen in the boot trades, and their acceptance as recognized tradesmen upon completion of a satisfactory probationary period. I am happy to be able to inform the House that the principles which are embodied in the present measure are supported by both employers and the union representing the industry. </para>
                    <para>The bill adds to the act another par i and schedule, and makes amendments consequential thereto, so that recognized tradesmen in the boot trades shall be entitled to the same priority in employment in their trades as recognized engineering tradesmen receive in the engineering trades. That is to say, in the case of engagements, by the provision in section 43, an employer may not employ on tradesmen##'##s work a person other than a recognized tradesman if a competent recognized tradesman is available and offering for employment; and in the case of dismissals or retrenchments, by another provision in the same section thai a recognized tradesman shall be the last to go unless a local committee otherwise permits and subject to an employer exercising his award rights regarding summary dismissal. </para>
                    <para>The bill also provides for ex-servicemen to qualify as recognized tradesmen by a probationary period of training in employment under the supervision of a local boot trades committee. These probationary tradesmen will receive the full tradesman##'##s rate of pay during their probationary period. Applications by ex-servicemen for authorization of their employment as probationary tradesmen must he made, unless there are special circumstances, within six months after the date of discharge from the forces ot  the same period after the coming into operation of these amendments, whichever is the later. </para>

                            <para>- I can. The control and overseeing of the scheme is exercised by a central and, in each State, a local boot trades committee, similar in composition and functions to the committees of union and employer representatives which administered the dilution scheme. It is proposed that the representatives who are at present members of the committees appointed under the National Security (Boot Trades Dilution) Regulations should continue as members of the committees established by the bill. As the bill arises from the Government##'##s desire to honour the Commonwealth##'##s undertakings in regard to the restoration of trade practices and customs in this industry, I commend it to the House as a measure to be accepted by all parties. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to provide for the constitution of an Australian Egg Board to regulate and control the export of eggs and egg products from Australia. In July, 1943, responsibility for the stabilization of egg prices and control of the marketing of eggs was assumed by the Commonwealth Egg Control organization, constituted under the. National Security (Egg Industry) Regulations, and continued in force under the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1940. When this control ceases on the 3.1st December, 1947, responsibility for mar keting of eggs will revert to State egg boards, which will be responsible for stabilizing prices and marketing the production of their own States at prices more than 50 per cent, higher than the previous highest figures which obtained under their control in 1942-43. The anticipated surplus of production in excess of local requirements is such that the Government has been impelled to encourage the establishment of an Australianwide egg marketing organization. However, the creation of such an organization is only possible if the proposal receives the support of every State government. It is now apparent that such an organization cannot be established in time to take over from the Commonwealth Egg Control organization on the 1st January, 1948. The Australian Government recently concluded a long-term contract with the Government of the United Kingdom for the purchase of Australian eggs in shell, egg pulp and egg powder for the seasons 1947-48, 1948-49 and 1949-50. The prices to be paid for those products until the 30th June, 1949, have been agreed upon, but those for 1949-50 are to be discussed in January, 1949. To assist in the orderly marketing of the anticipated surplus, and to ensure that the conditions of the long term contract are fulfilled, the Government has decided to establish an Australian Egg Board, which will supervise the disposal of that portion of surplus production which is of suitable quality for export. </para>
                    <para>Clause 13(e) of the bill empowers the proposed board to buy and sell on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, eggs and egg products intended for export which comply with the provisions of the Export (Dairy Produce) Regulations. In addition, the board is authorized to deal with all matters relating to the export of eggs and egg products from Australia, to make such experiments as are likely to lead to the improvement of the quality of Australian eggs, and to promote their sale overseas. The export, and distribution after export, of Australian eggs will be controlled by the board which will issue a licence to any person desiring to export eggs from Australia. The licence will be issued subject to such conditions and restrictions as are prescribed. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides for the establishment of a board of ten members, who will represent the following interests: - Egg producers of Australia, one from each State, 6; persons with commercial experience, 2; employees engaged in the handling, grading and processing of eggs, 1; Australian Government representative, 1; total, 10. The egg producers who will be represented by six members on the board of ten will have a definite majority. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made for the election of representatives of producers, but time may not permit of the members of the first board being elected. For that reason provision is made in the bill for the selection of members after consultation with representatives of producers##'## organizations. Members are assured, however, that wherever possible elections will be held. </para>
                    <para>During the operation of the long-term contract for the export of eggs and egg products, the board  will  handle each year Government finance of from ##£##4,000,000 to ##£##6,000,000 and for that reason the Government considers that it should have the right to appoint the  chairman. </para>
                    <para>The bill gives the person presiding at a meeting the right to dissent from any decision of the board. This is necessary because of the Government##'##s financial interest in the conduct of the board##'##s operations. It is essential that the chairm an should have the right to bring to the Minister##'##s notice immediately any resolution which he thinks may affect the Government##'##s policy or its finances. </para>
                    <para>The remaining clauses of the bill are purely machinery in character, and their inclusion is necessary to give effect to the major clauses, to which reference has already been made. </para>

I have had a look at the hill, and also have before me the act of 1924. The Minister is reaching the stage when he ought to explain some of the things which he has not attempted to explain in answer to questions that have been asked by members of the Opposition, in regard to the position of the Australian wheat industry and the re-exports of wheat in manufactured form by the Dominion of New Zealand. If the Minister will undertake to give those explanations, preferably now, or if not immediately at some future stage in the proceedings, I shall be quite happy to resume my seat. But I put it to him that an explanation is long overdue, particularly as we have information of a reduction of the price of bread in New Zealand, accompanied by an increase of its price in Australia. The matter takes  :i  little piecing together. I have never token on the task of solving a jigsaw puzzle. The Minister must be fairly proficient in that respect, otherwise he would not have ##"## got away ##"## with the wheat contract with New Zealand for as long as he has. If he will give US the information that we seek, I shall be deeply indebted to him, and every wheat grower and flour user in Australia will share in my appreciation. </para>

This bill simply deals with duty on goods not the produce of New Zealand. Naturally, I cannot undertake to engage in a debate as to whether wheat or wheat products sent from Australia to New Zealand are likely to be re-exported. Not by the wildest stretch of the imagination could it be conceived that New Zealand, having imported Australian wheat, would re-export it to Australia in either its natural or in a manufactured 9tate. I am su re that the honorable member will agree with me in that respect. A debate on the wheat contract with New Zealand, the price at which New Zealand received Australian wheat, or any allied subject, could not be brought within the ambit of the provisions of this measure. </para>

The act has been in operation since 1924, a matter of 23 years, yet up to now, apparently, it has functioned very well in its present form. The honorable gentleman very carefully evaded a direct explanation of a question that I put to him a little while ago. Now that we are in committee, he should be able to give us the fullest information as to the reason for the proposed amendments of the act. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to know the type of goods which it is suggested might come within the category listed. We are at a disadvantage in studying the bill, because no information has been given as to what is meant by the proposed amendments. We have become somewhat accustomed in this chamber to matters being not altogether what they seem to be. We have noticed in certain legislation that is before the Parliament at the present time that certain definitions have been taken, which are not the definitions accepted by those who originally saw that particular measure. The Minister has told us that wheat will not come within that category. </para>

                    <para class="block">New Zealand is buying our wheat at about 12s. a bushel below world value. According to the budget estimate for this financial year, that will cause a loss to the Australian taxpayer of ##£##2,000,000, and will represent a subsidy of that amount to the New Zealand Government and consumer on wheat grown in Australia. Under this measure the New Zealand- Government might, under given conditions, re-export certain goods which it has obtained from Australia. Wheat is the commodity which we are sending in largest quantity to New Zealand, at a loss to the Australian taxpayer of ##£##2,000,000 in this financial year, under the terms of a contract that was entered into by either the Minister or his predecessor, a contract that was frequently denied, but was subsequently admitted when the matter was pressed. That is really a gift from the Australian taxpayer to the New Zealand Government. It has been suggested that there are certain precautionary provisions. Wheat is worth in Australia to-day very much more than the 5s. 9d. a bushel which the New Zealand Government is paying for it. I do not know who buys Australian wheat in New Zealand. The Minister might tell us. Is it the New Zealand Government; and, if it is, what does that Government do with it? It does not, of its own accord, process it into flour and bread, but must sell it to various millers and manufacturers throughout the country. What is there to prevent any of those manufacturers who receive from the New Zealand Government cheap Australian wheat, from re-exporting it to somebody in Australia, and making a profit of about 12s. a bushel, less the cost of transport each way? At what price is the New Zealand Government selling Australian wheat to the New Zealand miller? If it is selling to the miller Australian wheat which it has bought at 5s. 9d. a bushel, what authority can it exercise to prevent the re-export of that wheat? Those are questions that we are entitled to have answered. In the matter of the sale of Australian wheat to New Zealand, we have had a series of denials by the Minister and his predecessor of any contract having been entered into, and there were no disclosures in this Parliament until those gentlemen were pressed by </para>
                    <para>Ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Anthony.</inline> the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> into making certain admissions. I remind the committee that those disclosures came about only as the result of a member of the New Zealand Cabinet having given certain information to the New Zealand Parliament in regard to the terms of the contract with Australia. Up to that time, we who sit in the Australian Parliament did not know anything about the matter. I am certain that it was intended that the Australian wheat-grower should be the loser as the result of the contract having been made at a price which is now about 12s. a bushel below world value. </para>

                            <para>- The bill provides an opportunity for speculators in New Zealand who are able to get Australian wheat at a low price to re-export it to Australia at a profit. What safeguards are provided against that kind of thing happening? The Minister at the table says that he cannot conceive of any circumstances arising which would render it likely that Australian wheat would be  re-exported from New Zealand to Australia, but what is more likely than that New Zealand millers, who can buy wheat at 12s. a bushel less than the world price, should re-export it at a profit? I want to know what safeguards are provided against such things happening. I am not satisfied with the hill without an explanation. My experience of the lack of candour on the part of Ministers of the present Government does not justify full confidence in them. </para>

                        <para>. - Unfortunately, the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and a few other honorable members opposite have a flair for attributing to other honorable members statements which they have not made. The honorable member for Richmond said that I denied that there was a contract for the sale of wheat to New Zealand. I did deny it, because at the time of my denial no contract had been entered into. And so I fling his accusation of lying back in his teeth. The honorable member has resorted to misrepresentation on a number of occasions, but never has he indulged in greater misrepresentation that he has to-day. There is no foundation in fact for his statement. This is a bill designed for no other purpose than to adjust the method by which ad valorem tariff duties are imposed on products which may be re-exported from New Zealand to Australia. The bill does not alter the incidence of tariff duties, but only the method by which they are calculated. For the information of honorable members who have taken this opportunity to discuss an agreement about wheat, I point out that there are no ad valorem duties on wheat. </para>

                        <para>.- Other goods and commodities besides wheat are affected by this bill. Not long ago clothing made in New Zealand from Australian-made piece goods, which were exported to New Zealand at a time when such goods were in short supply in Australia, were brought here from New Zealand. Suits made in New Zealand of Australian piece goods costing ##£##3 a suit length were re-exported to Australia and sold to- Australians at ##£##26 a suit. I am convinced that the majority of the people of Australia would not object to the export of goods required by New Zealand, but they would strongly object to their re-export to Australia under those conditions. ##"##We on this side are concerned that this bill may provide an opportunity for a repetition of such happenings, and enable certain people to make profits to which they are not entitled. Although the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> may see fit to say that at a certain time there was no agreement for the sale of wheat to New Zealand, he cannot even convince himself that an agreement did not exist. The fact is that wheat waa sold to New Zealand at 5s. 9d. a bushel before it was admitted that an agreement had been entered into. </para>

It may be that. the agreement had not been signed, sealed and delivered when its existence was denied, but the Minister cannot deny that a member of the New Zealand Government said that if the Labour party were returned to power in that dominion the people would be able to have a cheap loaf for four years, whereas, if the Government were defeated, they would probably have to pay as much as ls. 9d. for a 4 lb. loaf. Whether or not the agreement had actually been signed matters little, when the fact is that the agreement had been entered into many months earlier. Wheat is not the only commodity that can be re-exported to Australia. The bill constitutes a danger to Australian interests. </para>

Honorable members should demand from the Government an explanation of the .agreement with the New Zealand Government for the sale of wheat, and if this Government had any sense of responsibility it would allow the leaders of the Opposition parties to see the agreement, if it has been reduced to writing. Then the leaders could inform the members of their parties regarding its contents. However, if the agreement is one of those friendly family arrangements - which generally end up with somebody paying somebody else - we should be informed just what kind of an arrangement it is. At any rate, it must be a pretty binding arrangement when the </para>

The first inkling that we had of the existence of the agreement was when certain statements were made on the subject in the New Zealand Parliament.

Many hundreds of thousands of yards of cloth have been exported to New Zealand, to the disadvantage of the people of Australia, including ex-servicemen. I, myself, have been attempting for weeks past to get a suit length for a suit of clothes so that I might go about without a patch on my pants. </para>

                            <para>- It is connected with the export of cloth from Australia to New Zealand, and the manufacture of that cloth into suits in New Zealand, and their re-export to Australia, where they are subject to an ad valorem duty. If cloth manufactured in Australia is sold in New Zealand, the effect is to deprive Australian tailors of work - and I am not interested only in the tailors of Tooley-street ; I am also concerned for the welfare and prosperity of tailors in Australia, and I believe that we should make cloth available to them so that they may make suits for the people. It tends to raise the price of clothing in Australia when cloth is sent from here to New Zealand, made up there into suits, and then re-exported to Australia. The result is that one has to pay us much as ##£##26 for a suit of clothes. No doubt, there are other items, also, which, are re-exported to Australia, and on which high duties have to be paid. For instance, I understand that wheat is exported from Australia to New Zealand, where it is made up into breakfast foods, dog biscuits, ##&amp;##c, and sent back here. </para>

It is most unfortunate that the people of Australia should not be able to get clothing at a reasonable price. I suggest that the bill be withdrawn, and the whole of the schedule examined with a view to reducing the duty on suits coming into Australia. I also suggest that suit lengths should not be exported from Australia for the benefit of tailors in New Zealand, while Australian tailors are idle for lack of cloth. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill is complementary to another measure, and makes certain consequential amendments, but it is appropriate that certain tilings should be said while the bill is under consideration, because debates on customs matters are now rare. I wish to refer, in particular, to woollen textiles. I have asked many questions in this House, some on notice and some without notice, seeking to find out the quantity of textiles exported from Australia. While I believe in the development of international trade, it should not be carried on to the detriment of our own people. I was amazed to be inf ormed, in <inline font-style="italic">answer to</inline> a question, that such a huge quantity of cloth had been sent to Russia, and that New Zealand came next on the list. While it is desirable that we should trade with New Zealand as much as possible, it should be remembered that our trade balance with that country has always been favorable. In fact, the New Zealand authorities have asked us to buy more from New Zealand. Apparently, however, in accordance with the policy which has dotted the world with Australian trade commissioners, we are virtually forcing our goods upon New Zealand. Naturally, the trade commissioners want to show good figures. I believe that we have been over-generous in the granting of export permits. It is impossible to obtain a suit of clothes in Melbourne within six months of the time of ordering it. </para>

                    <para class="block">The bill is to approve the supplementary sugar agreement made on the 17th October last between the Australian Government and the Government of Queensland. Under this agreement the Australian and Queensland Governments agree to amend the existing sugar agreement to provide for an increase of ##£##4 2s. 8d. a ton in the wholesale price of refined sugar of 1A grade, and for the prices of sugars of other grades as at present fixed under the Sugar Agreement Act 1946 to be increased commensurately. The new maximum prices compared with the existing prices will be as follows: - </para>
                    <para>The effect of the increase of ##£##4 2s. 8d. a ton on the wholesale price will be to raise the retail price of refined sugar by ##£##4 13s. 4d. a ton, that is, by ##£##d. per lb. The new retail price in capital cities will therefore be 4##£##d. instead of 4d. per lb. The remaining clauses of the present sugar agreement will remain intact. The only purpose of the supplementary agreement is to increase the prices set out in clause 5 of the existing agreement. The decision by the Government to recommend to the Parliament the amendment of the existing sugar agreement to provide for the increased prices was made after consultation with the Queensland Government, which had requested the price increases on behalf of the sugar industry, and after a close survey of the present position and future prospects of the sugar industry. When the present agreement with the Queensland Government was signed in October, 1945, the Commonwealth Government gave an assurance to the sugar industry that, if during the currency of the agreement cost levels in Australia increased substantially, it would be prepared, on representations from the Queensland Government, to give consideration to instituting an inquiry into the industry##'##s position in relation thereto. However, the Government has been increasingly aware of the difficulties the industry has had to face during the war years and since, and is now convinced that because of the urgent nature of the industry##'##s need for assistance immediate action to provide a stimulus to the industry is necessary. </para>
                    <para>Australia, in pre-war years, was one of the major sugar exporting countries of the world, its export quota of 400,000 tons under the international sugar agreement being exceeded only by Cuba, the Netherlands, the Philippines and the British Colonial Empire. Australian production was then about 800,000 tons per annum. However, owing to unavoidable circumstances brought about by the war, production fell considerably during the last seven years. In 1943 the total output fell to 523,000 tons, which was the lowest since 1927. Production since 1943 has also been well below normal. Last year the crop yielded only 548,000 tons and this season##'##s yield will be about 575,000 tons, which is still 225,000 tons below the pre-war average. As a consequence exports fell consider ably. It is essential that the total production be restored to its pre-war level as quickly as possible, not only in order that we may export as great a quantity as possible to the United Kingdom to meet that country##'##s present needs, but so that we may at least maintain our export quota when the international sugar agreement is being reviewed. </para>
                    <para>The sugar industry in recent years has suffered not only from a serious fall in production but also in a number of other directions. The net return from sales of sugar on the domestic market has always been recognized as the major stabilizing factor in the industry##'##s economy owing to increased costs of transport jute sacks, refining and selling, the net return available for distribution by the Queensland Sugar Board to growers and millers from sugar consumed in Australia has declined from ##£##24 a ton in 1939 to ##£##21 18s. a ton in 1946. The Premier of Queensland has estimated that if the price of sugar is not increased the return to the industry for the 1947 season##'##s crop would be lower again. In addition to the higher costs borne by the industry on sugar after it has been milled, growers and millers have also had to meet much higher production costs on the sugar during the growing, harvesting and milling stages. Labour costs are a big item in production of sugar and an indication of how these have increased may be given by a comparison of the wages of representative employees. For instance, the wages of field  workers  employed on cane farms increased by 43 per cent between 1932 and July, 1947, over the same period the wages of mill hands increased by 48 per cent. Wages are now higher than in 1.930, when the retail price of sugar was 4##½##d. per lb. Prices of materials used by both farmers and millers have also risen  sharply.  The cost of farm materials, including fertilizers, horse feed, oils and repairs have risen by approximately 40 pei* cent. Mill materials have risen by varying amounts, the principal items, coal and firewood, having varied by over SO per cent, and 33 per cent, respectively. Prior to the war the Australian sugar industry was amongst the most efficient in the world, and the industry was justifiably proud of its high productive efficiency, with high yields of cane and sugar per acre. Under war-time conditions, however, the efficiency of the industry declined owing to factors beyond its control, such as shortages of man-power, fertilizers, materials and shipping. The result of this was the lengthening of the crushing season, deterioration of sugar due to long delays in milling and transport of sugar to refineries and reduced yield of sugar per acre. The average tonnage of cane per acre fell from an average of 21 tons in 1936-38 to 16 tons in 1947. The sugar industry is highly mechanized. In the cultivation, harvesting and milling of the cane the machinery is heavy and complex and represents a large portion of the final cost. For the past six or seven years the industry has been required to ##"## mend and make do ##"##. Replacement and repairs have now to be undertaken at greatly increased costs. The industry, having strained its resources in the past, cannot now find from current profits the increased costs demanded. The combined effect of all the factors I have mentioned has been to increase the industry##'##s overall costs by between 40 per cent, and 50 per cent. These have <inline font-style="italic">had</inline> to be carried notwithstanding a fall of ##£##2 2s. a ton in the net return from home-consumption sales. Admittedly, export prices have risen, but this has been of little benefit to the industry because of the substantial decline in the quantity of sugar exported. The industry cannot be expected to carry on under these difficulties without compensation. </para>
                    <para>The increase of ##£##4* 13s. 4d. a ton in the retail price of sugar will enable the industry to bear these increased costs and will facilitate its rehabilitation. It will encourage a return to pre-war production levels. Although the retail price of sugar will be increased by ##£##4 13s. 4d. a ton, the growers and millers will not benefit to that extent. Out of this amount an additional 10s. 8d. a ton will be paid to retail grocers, and an additional ls. 8d. a ton will go to sugar wholesalers. These increases are proportional to the margins already received by retailers and wholesalers. In addition, the sugar industry will no longer receive the benefit of the subsidy of 10s.  a ton allowed on coastal freights. This subsidy will be withdrawn as from the date of operation of the new prices. </para>
                    <para>The effect of these reductions will be to lower the amount payable to growers and millers out of the increase of ##£##4 13s. 4d. a ton to ##£##311s. a ton of refined sugar. The actual return to the industry, however, would be in terms of raw sugar produced. Conversion to a raw sugar basis would reduce the net return to approximately ##£##3 7s. a ton. However, in order to arrive at the net return to the industry for future production, it would be also necessary to take into account further increases in costs. It is calculated that the price increase will raise the net return to growers and millers from home consumption sugars of the 1947 crop by approximately ##£##3 a ton of raw sugar. I might mention that not one penny of the extra moneys resulting from the increase in price will accrue to refiners, the object of the increases being primarily to raise the returns to growers and millers of sugar. The amount of assistance to the fruit industry will not be altered. The new price of sugar to manufacturers will still be amongst the lowest, if it is not the lowest, in the world. The price to manufacturers in New Zealand is ##£##53 a. ton; in the United States of America the lowest price is ##£##51 10s. a ton ; and in the United Kingdom it is ##£##60 a ton. </para>
                    <para>During the war, Australian manufacturers of products containing sugar have been immune from the violent fluctuations in sugar prices overseas. In many countries the prices of sugar rose to fantastic heights, and in some countries these prices still prevail. Exporters of manufactured products will continue to be protected by paragraphs in the agreement providing for the payment of export sugar rebates in the event of the world parity price of sugar falling below the equivalent Australian price. Australian consumers have also received the benefit of retail prices, which have been amongst the lowest in the world, and which have remained constant at their present level since the reduction of##½##d. per lb. was made in January, 1933, in accordance with the principles of the Premiers Plan. The new retail price of 4##½##d. per lb. will still be generally lower than that in any other country. The prices in certain other countries, expressed in Australian currency, are as follows: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>From the foregoing honorable members will notice that it is obvious that Australian consumers of sugar are in a much more advantageous position than in other countries. Further, Australian consumers have not only been supplied with sugar from local sources when it would have been impossible to have obtained supplies from other countries, but they have also been safeguarded against the very high world prices which existed during the war and still obtain. The measure of assistance now proposed is fully justified and will assist in rehabilitating the industry to its former level, and will maintain for Australia a virile white population in the vulnerable coastal areas of North Queensland. It is unnecessary for me to reiterate at any length the immense strategic value of the industry in that part of Australia. The events in the last war proved that very clearly. I commend the bill as one worthy of support. </para>

                (Kooyong- Leader of last, it has been quite clear that the Prime Minister
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline>
                would have to choose between two courses - one to bow to public opinion, which would be the democratic course, and the other to face up to the implications of last Saturday##'##s events, and hurry on with the bill and get it over in the expectation that the sooner it is over the sooner somebody may forget about it. The right honorable gentleman has chosen the second course. The time schedule now before the House covers a total period of approximately 24 hours. In other words, we have approximately 25 minutes in which to discuss each of the 61 clauses in this most important hill. In spite of some expressions that I have heard from the other side of the chamber, that provision is grossly inadequate. The Prime Minister himself will be the first to realize that this is an extremely complicated measure, and that it is not possible in a second-reading debate on a matter of this magnitude to go into the details of the bill itself. The committee stage, therefore, is the first and only opportunity that we shall have to do that. In these circumstances, the time that has been allowed is grossly insufficient.
            </para>
            <para>I also point out to the Prime Minister that this business of applying the ##"## guillotine ##"## to debates could, if we were to follow our existing practice, produce some curious results. The ##"## guillotine ##"## Standing Orders refer always to the allotment of time for items in the Estimates, for a second-reading debate on a bill, for the committee stage, and so on, and they explain what is to happen at the expiration of the allotted time. I should have thought that the intention was that the time allowed for consideration of an item should be fixed, not as a period expiring at a certain hour, but as a total number of hours, so that if it were intended that the committee should have six hours in which to discuss a certain group of clauses, then six hours should be the time indicated. I realize that there has been some variation of the practice on this matter,but I point out to the Prime Minister that if the time limitation is to beas in the motion now under discussion, namely, a period expiring in the case of the first group of parts of the bill at 9.30 p.m. to-day, and in the case of the second group at  9.30  p.m. to-morrow, then the Government may completely frustrate that proposal by intervening with other legislation, consideration of which will eat into the time allowed, so that the ##"##guillotine##"## may ultimately fall after little consideration has been given to the business in hand. </para>

This motion will undoubtedly be carried, but as one has  a  feeling that this is not the last we shall hear of the ##"##guillotine##"## - one fell violently last Saturday, I am thankful to say - I suggest to the Prime Minister that he should consider whether it would be better, from the point of view of all concerned, to impose ##"##guillotine##"## times in the form of a total number of hours, rather than by fixing terminating times. In that way genuine protection could be given  to  members of the House in carrying out the work of discussing legislation. I do not propose to occupy any more time on this matter for two reasons; the first is that other members may wish to speak on the motion, and the other is that the five minutes allotted to me under the Standing Orders has expired. </para>

                    <para>.- The motion provides that the discussion of parts one, two and three of the measure shall conclude at  9.30  p.m. These parts contain eight clauses, and it is in this section of the measure that I wish to move two amendments that I foreshadowed some time ago. I should like to know whether <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> eight clauses may be discussed together, thus giving mc an opportunity to move my amendments; otherwise, discussion of prior amendments may occupy the full time allotted for the consideration of the eight clauses, thus debarring nic from moving my amendments. </para>

                    <para>. -  I oppose the motion. After one of the most searching and prolonged second-reading debates for many years, honorable members are asked to consider the  61  clauses of the bill in the totally inadequate time of about 24 hours. W&lt;shall have only about <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> hours to consider Parts I., II. and III., which contain the eight basic clauses. That time is also totally inadequate. The timetable has been decided upon by the Government because it considers the measure urgent. The Opposition, and,  I  consider, the majority of the people of Australia, certainly of Victoria, believe that it is not urgent. It is a revolutionary measure that the people of Australia have not been allowed the opportunity of deciding whether they want or not. </para>

                    <para>- That is so. Although we have been told that the measure is urgent, we have not been told why the Prime Minister considers the time he proposes to allot for its remaining stages is adequate for a searching examination of the bill. Seventy-one honorable members spoke almost invariably for the  45  minutes allowed by the Standing Orders on the motion for the second reading of the bill. The Prime Minister spoke at length in moving the second reading and closing the debate. So about  60  hours must have been occupied in the second-reading debate. Yet only  24  hours are to be allotted for the committee and the concluding stages. It cannot be claimed that honorable members on this side abused their rights during the second -read ing debate. Government members took their full time. Every honorable member who thought he had something to contribute to the second-reading debate may also desire to contribute to the committee discussion. There are  61  clauses. So each honorable member will have only about twenty minutes to debate all or any of the clauses. What justification does the Government claim for the proposed allotment of time? We have not been given any special reason why the bill is so urgent. No financial or national crisis makes imperative the passage of the bill in the time proposed. The time schedule, is the latest example of the Government##'##s contempt of the Parliament##'##s right to a full discussion of important matters. It is time that the Parliament and the public realized the depths into which the institution is being plunged by the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> always uses occasions like, the? to cast aspersions of undemocratic sentiments on the Government, but if he pursues this line he can claim little regard for democracy and none for constitutional- practice. He has had our respect, but the line he has taken recently and things he has sought to defend place him in grave danger of losing it. Because the bill is urgent the time for its consideration is to be limited. The ##"## guillotine ##"## is not new. It has been applied and accepted through the years. Even honorable members opposite have told me that it is the most democratic way of ensuring the reasonably speedy passage of legislation. When the ##"##guillotine##"## has been applied before honorable members opposite have indulged in endless and tiresome repetition. The time proposed to be allotted is reasonable. If the Opposition parties organize their speakers and confine themselves to the essentials, they will find the time adequate. Democracy is endangered by the paltry approach of the honorable member for Fawkner for the sake of party advantage. </para>

                    <para>. - In spite of the unctuous sermon of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke),</inline> the only name for this motion is ##"## the gag ##"##. It will prevent the Opposition from voicing its opinions of the details of the bill. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has lip-served the traditions of the Parliament. He has proclaimed and will proclaim that he gave ample time during the second-reading debate for honorable members to express themselves. But what is a second-reading debate other than an opportunity for honorable members to talk in general terms about a measure? In committee they analyse it clause by clause. Yet ##"##the gag##"## is to be applied to our consideration of the remaining stages of this bill. We are becoming accustomed to the application of the ##"##gag##"## by this Government, and particularly by this Prime Minister. He adjusts it with very pleasant words, and with a nice smile on his face; but, nevertheless, it is as effective as though it had been forced upon us with a bludgeon.  1  want to show exactly what this motion means. There are  61  clauses in the bill. the most momentous measure ever presented to this or to  any  other Australian parliament. The Leader of the Opposition has shown that only 24 hours of discussion will be allotted to the 61 clauses. There are 75 members of this House. The allotment of time will give 25 minutes for the discussion of each clause, or less than half a minute for each member. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, perhaps ! On previous occasions, when the ##"## gag ##"## has been applied, Ministers have risen and stone-walled, using time that might otherwise have been availed of by Opposition members. There is a clause in the bill dealing with employees of the private hanks. We shall have half a minute per member to discuss that! There is a clause providing for the establishment of a Federal Court of Claims, which, in essence, represents a departure from the principle of the High Court.##'## We shall be allowed half a minute per member for that! To put the matter  in  another way, with only 25 minutes allowed, on the average, for each clause, one member on each side of the House will be able to make part of a speech on each clause. That is the kind of democracy that we have under this Government. The Prime Minister discounts any suggestion that he is a dictator wielding totalitarian  power.  I have looked at the records of the Nazi party, but I cannot recall anything done by the leader of that organization which exceeded the deeds of this Government in the suppression of the  voice  of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.- It is always amusing, when the ##"## gag ##"## or the ##"## guillotine ##"## is applied, to see Opposition members make use of the incident for propaganda purposes, and, taking advantage of the fact that proceedings of the Parliament are now broadcast, to suggest that such things were never done before. There was one famous occasion, as I have seen in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> when the ##"## gag ##"## was applied 89 times in one day by honorable members opposite when they were in power. The proposed allotment of time, which provides for discussion of the Banking Bill to expire on  the  19th November, is adequate when one considers how thoroughly the issues of the measure have been canvassed over the last two or three weeks. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> asserted that during the second-reading debate honorable members could discuss only general principles, not the clauses of the bill.  Of  course, that was completely untrue ! It is perfectly true that windy generalization was a characteristic of Opposi tion speeches, and that there was no analysis of the bill except by a very few members, such as the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> who dealt with many clauses. However, because the Opposition has been mainly concerned with the Victorian elections for the last two weeks and has, therefore, raised bogus issues, it has no right to say that adequate time has not been provided for discussion of the measure.  The  clauses of the bill will be analysed by honorable members according to their interests. Therefore it is absurd to suggest, as the honorable member for Richmond did, that every honorable member is likely to discuss every clause so that the allotment of time will work out at an allowance of half a minute for each honorable member on each clause. I have no doubt that, with the usual false emphasis which the press gives, that absurd statement will be recorded as a very striking truth. Usually, only two or three honorable members speak on any particular clause, and, therefore, the ##"##guillotine##"##, which will allow this bill to be discussed from the 12th November to the 19th November, is adequate. By the standards applied to many measures which honorable members opposite introduced when they were in power, it is even generous. </para>

                    <para>.- If there is one thing that characterizes the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> above all things, it is his selfsatisfaction. He sits down with great pleasure in himself and smiles benignly, having convinced himself that the Government##'##s procedure is democratic. He believes that the meagre allotment of time proposed for the discussion of the most revolutionary bill brought before this Parliament is adequate. The honorable member talked about broadcasting. I hope that his voice was heard in Perth, because the electors there will not be able to hear him much longer. The allotment of time proposed is quite inadequate. The fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> pursues his dictatorial course shows his obtuseness. The time available for discussion of the bill in committee will be even shorter than was indicated by the right honorable gentleman. The  Chairman  of Committees will recall that, when the Estimates for 1947- 4S were being discussed, although there was an allotment of time for each item, and although millions of pounds of the taxpayers##'## money was involved, votes for entire departments were whisked through the committee without a word of discussion because Ministers rose at various times and spoke for an hour on end. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister rarely pays me a compliment. 1 remind him that the occasion to which he refers was the debate on the Ottawa Agreement, which lasted in this Parliament for almost a year, during which whole items of the tariff were debated. I took action to expedite the discussion only when certain of his friends, then in the left of his party, were completely obstructive on trifling items of tariff. As the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> has said, there has never been an enactment of such significance as the Banking Bill debated by this Parliament. The Prime Minister, declaring that the people are just shouting for this kind of socialization and defying the democratic waves in Victoria, has ordered the tide to turn back. Therefore, the tide must turn back in the next few hours. He proposes to allow us only a few hours in which to discuss a matter that concerns the destiny of every citizen in Australia. He is condemned by his own action. What is the urgency in this matter? Was the right honorable gentleman so scared by events in Victoria that he feels that he must hasten and have this measure discussed quickly in the hope that the people will forget it? They will not forget. The Prime Minister may cut it as short as he likes ; hut the people will remember this infamy, and shortly, he and his Government will be sent packing as was the Cain Government in Victoria. </para>

                    <para>.- Whenever a motion to limit the duration of a debate is submitted to this House, honorable members on this side of the chamber are obliged to listen to the same arguments as those which have been advanced to-day by members of the Opposition. We hear always how unreasonable the Government is in making the allotment of time, on the ground that the period allotted for the consideration of one division of the bill is disproportionate  to the period allotted for the consideration of another division. </para>

I merely ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> for purposes of information, whether it is proposed to take the clauses of the bill one by one, or to expose to debate all the clauses covered by one ##"## guillotine ##"## period. It might very well meet the convenience of all honorable members if we were to treat all the clauses covered by the ##"## guillotine ##"## period a? being concurrently before the Chair for consideration. Then, at the end of the discussion, the clauses could be put in that way. Otherwise, we may find that the time becomes very ill-distributed. </para>

When honorable members receive the call they could foreshadow their amendments and move them later. I suggest that that is the only practicable course open to the committee if we decide to take the first three parts of the bill as a whole, and I think that that course would meet the wishes of honorable members, insofar as that is at all possible under the Government##'##s proposal. </para>

I do not need to labour the argument. In the last few weeks there has been a great deal of discussion as to whether the Government has any mandate to introduce the bill and as to whether it has any popular approval or backing for the bill. We have long since realized that the Government does not pretend to have an express mandate; but honorable members opposite have devoted a great deal of energy, and a certain amount of ingenuity, in an endeavour to establish that in reality the people of Australia are behind them. It turns out that they are miles behind them; but supporters of the Government have been trying to convince us that the people are on their side. It is remarkable how much energy has been expended in efforts to persuade the people of Australia, to say nothing of members of this chamber, that the agitation against the Government##'##s proposal is a bogus one, that the petitions which have been presented are faked, that they are the result of pressure applied by the banks, and so on. </para>

However, let me dispose of that fallacy by pointing out that at the elections the Australian Labour party candidates secured a total of 475,000 votes against 597,000 secured by the Opposition parties##'## candidates; notwithstanding that the only three seats which were not contested were held by members of the Opposition. Therefore, the votes secured by three Opposition members are not included in the total. All the ingenuity in the world- </para>

                        <para>- All the ingenuity in the world - and that remark does not, of course, include the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan)</inline> - will not overcome the fact that up to that stage there was a majority of voters against Labour of 122,000, a majority which will be increased as further votes are counted. If honorable members will give themselves the trouble to have a look at the record of the last federal election, in the State of Victoria, held only twelve months ago, and will cast up the Senate figures, they will find that, in the same State and with the same voters, the Labour Senate team had a majority of 127,000. That majority has now been replaced by. a minority of 122,000. All the sophistry in the world - and of course it is mere pretence - will never get rid of that, because it is the most crushing reversal of form in the political history of Australia. Never before in the political history of Australia has a government with the enormous majority which this ##"##Government secured in the State of Victoria, in gross abandonment destroyed it so utterly in twelve months by the introduction of one measure, which has inspired public indignation and public resistance to this Government. The reason why the Government rejects a referendum is that it knows - and every honorable member sitting on the other side knows; the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke)</inline> knows; they all know - that if we were to have a federal election next week, half the members sitting on the other side would ##"## lose the number of their mess ##"##. Because of this tremendous expression of opinion by the one body of voters given a chance to express their opinions, it is imperative, if the decencies of democracy are to be observed, that this bill shall go to the people for their approval before it goes to the Governor-General for the Royal Assent, f do not propose to labour the matter; others want to speak about it. This is the clearest case that could possibly be presented to any parliament for taking the opinion of the people, and abiding by that opinion when it has been received. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment before the Chair, moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> quite obviously is based upon Hie result of Victoria##'##s recent election. Whatever the right honorable gentleman may say in regard to <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> views, I am competent to and do express them myself, leaving him to express his and to take responsibility for them, as I do for mine. With the fullest confidence, I say that honorable gentlemen opposite, and the bankers who, I believe to their discredit, have used them in this bitter fight, know very clearly that only in the heat of political feeling have they a chance of defeating the Government, or of reversing the move which we have begun. Harsh things can be said ; I do not propose to say them. But I draw the attention of this Parliament and the country t.o the fact that other men in other countries have pursued a similar line. Hitler could have had an election in Germany shortly before he gained power. The election would have been held in comparative calm, in which atmosphere the German people could have voted to decide what their government, their rulers, indeed their fate, should be. Hitler did not trust the people in a period of calm, so he organized the burning of the Reichstag. In Victoria, a year at the most would have elapsed before an election would have been held. By that time, there would not have been the feeling which was deliberately stirred up in the most vicious and discreditable campaign which this country has known. In a year##'##s time the issues would have been calmly considered. But that is not what was wanted. The  Speaker  of the Victorian Parliament was a member of the Liberal party and a titled gentleman, who presumably is a democrat and cares for the welfare and freedom pf the people of this country. He had only to leave the position which he occupied, and the election would have been held as soon as it could have been organized. There were two independents who kept the Government in power. They, too, opposed the views of this Government on banking. But they did not precipitate an election. So, when it was found that the democratic processes could not bc used to force an election in a period when tempers ran hot because of the discreditable and distorted case that, had been put up, the undemocratic processes of the Victorian Upper House were used, just as the arch-dictator of all time staged his election, knowing that, in a period of calm, he would not come to power in Germany. </para>

                <para>There are other issues which must be faced. I have had letters sent to me.  1  received one to-day, in which a gentleman whom I do not know from Adam informed me that he has never been a Labour supporter. He has set out his views on banking and other matters. In it he has stated that he lives in a year of terror, this year of  1947,  and he has asked me not to disclose his name. Honorable members opposite laugh. They know that these things are going on. If they want proof, I have rend that letter to a representative of one of the most influential newspapers operating in this Federal Capital. </para>

The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline> in a very fine effort last night, quoted from a leading financial figure in this country, who had 3aid on another occasion that an issue so technical as banking should not be submitted to the people of Australia. So we have the Leader of the Opposition, at a time when he was the recipient of pressure politics, recording his view as a democrat, a public figure, and a leading constitutional lawyer, that a government which would succumb to pressure politics would be false to its trust to the people. </para>

                        <para>- It is said that the people##'##s demand for a referendum was demonstrated clearly by the result of the Victorian elections last Saturday. I have compared the action which precipitated them with the action of certain people in the republic of Ger many in whom democratic tendencies were not prominent. There is an amazing similarity between those two instances which must cause every real democrat and every true Liberal - if such a person exists - grave disquiet. Different opinions regarding Hitler are held throughout the world. Some say that he was a patriot who, fired by a love of Germany, was forced by inexorable circumstances to pursue a policy which led to the ruin of not only Germany but also manx other countries. There is a lesson to be learned by honorable gentlemen opposite from the experiences of Hitlerite Germany. They would do well to consider seriously before they precipitate the democratic system of government into a state of chaos, or before they subvert constitutional practices associated with true democracy. A man who occupied the responsible office of  Speaker  of the Victorian Parliament kept in office a government to whose policy he did not subscribe by refusing to precipitate an election. That was his democratic and political right, but a reactionary chamber, an anachronism in a democratic country, forced an election. But its members did not have to go to the people to see whether they supported its actions. The policy and actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Knox, the  Speaker  of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, was justified. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Prank</inline> Clarke really believed in democracy and was a true democrat, or if he believed in constitutional government, his way was clear and his duty plain; he should have stood for election. He might have challenged the Premier of the State, whom he sent to the country, in the Premier##'##s own electorate. If he was not willing to do that, he could have tested public opinion by contesting a doubtful seat, thereby showing whether or not the people of Victoria supported his action. We on this side do not agree that a referendum should be held. </para>

                <para>Is the Government##'##s proposal a far step from existing banking practice? Those who believe that it is should read the history of banking in England from its inception in the 17th century to the present time. I invite honorable members to study the works of the great economists and the flood of literature on banking which has been published in recent times. If honorable members read what has been written in an earnest desire to learn the truth, and not merely to find support for conclusions already reached by them, they must agree with me that, far from being a radical or revolutionary step, this is merely a logical step in the long evolution of the banking system into a publicly owned instrumentality. The history of banking bears out that contention. Developments during the years have shown that the banking system has grown from a large number of unit banks until to-day banking is conducted by great institutions which wield enormous powers. Instead of being an organization entirely free to follow its own ideas and to pursue the policies of its directors, a bank to-day is, either by practice or by law, bound by the most rigid rules and forced to do the will of the elected people. That is true in all countries, especially in what is said to be the citadel of private enterprise - the great republic of the United States of America. Banks in that country are bound by rules to a degree that does not exist in any British country. On evidence provided by recent happenings in Victoria, a state of chaos and agitation is the only situation in which those who demand a referendum will put their faith to the test. I have shown that the Leader of the Opposition and the  chairman  of the Associated Banks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline><inline font-style="italic">McConnan,</inline> do not believe that a referendum should be held in regard to technical matters, or in response to pressure groups. By references to the history of banking, the development of the banking system, and the state of affairs that exists to-day it could be demonstrated that from the 1945 act to the nationalization of banking is merely a brief, but logical, step. No referendum is required because the Government has a mandate to control the banking system. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> All the arguments that have been used by the Opposition, and particularly the argument used by the electors of Victoria last Saturday, show clearly that the people believe that a referendum should be held to determine whether the private banks should be nationalized. During the debate, we have heard a good deal of the Commonwealth Bank being the people##'##s bank ; but I submit that all the banks are the people##'##s banks. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke)</inline> said that when a bank is taken over by the Commonwealth it becomes a publicly owned instrumentality. We could say the same of the taxation branch of the Treasury Department. Once a public instrumentality is instituted it comes under the control of the government of the day, not of the people. We have heard many wild statements about the depression; Government supporters have claimed that there will be another depression if the control of finance is left in the hands of the private banks. They argue that the private banks created the last depression, but they appear to have forgotten that that depression was world-wide. I have frequently heard Labour supporters say that the depression in Queensland was due to the actions of the Moore Government in that State, but now it would appear that the banks caused it. Would they go so far as to say that the private banks of Australia created the world depression? That the private banks helped Australia during the depression has been affirmed in this House by the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> who said that those institutions had played a great part and had helped the Government. I ask honorable members who helped the primary producers of Australia if it was not the private banks? If, during the last depression, the private banks had not existed, the primary producers would not have obtained the increased return of 30 per cent, on the sale of their products due to the imposition of the exchange rate on Australian money as compared with sterling. The Opposition claims that these proposals should be submitted to the people at a referendum, because they realize the falsehood of the Government##'##s claim that it must have control of the banking system so as to ensure that the people shall have spending power in the event of another economic depression. The fact is that the Commonwealth Bank has full power to create and control credit to-day, and the Government controls the Commonwealth Bank. The private banks have no power to create credit at the moment. </para>

                        <para>- The private banks have no power under the law to create credit. In this respect, the private banks are under the control of the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank also has authority to fix the interest rates charged by the private banks, and in tins way the Government,  through   the Commonwealth Bank, can control the profit made by the private hanks. Thus, there is no force in the argument that the private banks are in a position to exploit the people by charging high rates of interest. In spite of this the Government, and its irresponsible supporters outside the Parliament, including the Communists, say that the Government must assume control of the private banks, the available assets of which are set down at 400,000,000. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> proposes to standardize railway gauges at a cost of ##£##220,000,000. The Government has all -sorts of fantastic ideas for spending large amounts of money. Where is all this money or credit to come from? The Government seems to think that if it seizes the private banks it will have unlimited resources. True, the Government will assume control of available assets not already invested on long terms and valued at ##£##400,000,000, but it will have to make an immediate outlay of ##£##100,000,000 in order to obtain them. The Commonwealth Bank already holds deposits from The private banks valued at ##£##267,000,000, for which it. pays only 10s. per cent, interest. Some of that money was probably lent to the banks on long terms at a low rate of interest, and when it comes into the possession of the Commonwealth Bank, that bank may have to pay a higher rate of interest for it. Leaving out of consideration for the moment these available assets of the private banks valued at 400,000,000, let me point out that the Government, by taking over the private banks, will destroy their business and goodwill - something to which the Government, apparently, has given no thought whatever. It will destroy the expert knowledge, and the contacts, and the business associations which have enabled the private banks to foster the development of the great rural industries of Australia, to assist in the construction of harbours and wharfs and the development of secondary industries. Thesegreat enterprises were carried through by private individuals who risked their own. assets and, in addition, were able to call on the private banks for what assistancethey needed. It was such people, assisted by the private banking institutions of Australia, who established and developed the great iron and steel industry of Australia; yet those people, and the institutions which assisted them, are now regarded by the Government as the enemiesof the people. </para>

                <para>When the Government has destroyed the private banking system, with assets totalling ##£##400,000,000, it will also have destroyed the business which those banks are now carrying on. This will prevent the free flow of money, and will destroy the confidence of those who might want to invest money in the country##'##s industries. No longer will people believe themselves to be in a position to reap the reward of their own pluck and industry. The nationalization of the banks will also tend to discourage people from overseas who would have been prepared to come to Australia to invest capital, and to work  in the development of industry. Australia has an area as great as that of the United States of America. The Government proposes to abandon the banking system which was responsible for the development of the United States of America, the greatest country in the world to-day, and one which was developed entirely by private enterprise, with the assistance of the private banking institutions. The United States of America continues to adhere to that policy; and so do Great Britain and all the British dominions. They are turning away from socialism in order to preserve freedom of private enterprise and utilize the assistance of private investors, which has made possible our development up to date. We must turn to the United States of America in this respect, because we must rely upon that country to a great degree until, at least, the Mother Country has fully recovered. But this Government is turning towards Russia, and following Russian ideas without having any mandate from the people to do so. I support the amendment, because we must be guided in this matter by the vote cast hy the people of Victoria in the recent elections in that State. That was a vote against this legislation; but had this issue been submitted directly to the people of Victoria, the vote against the Government##'##s proposal, which is estimated on the final count to show a majority of  200,000,  would have been even greater. F repeat that had this matter been submitted directly to the people of Victoria that majority would have been much greater, because many people who voted for Labour candidates did so because they were persuaded by Government supporters that the issue at stake in the Victorian elections had no relation to this legislation. </para>

During the second-reading debate, the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> quoted from a. book written by the right honorable member, in which he expressed his own opinion with regard to what he called ##"## pressure politics ##"## in this country.

However, I have discovered that the private banks are intimidating their employees to make them assist in the collection of these petitions and in organizing mass communications to members of Parliament. The public should be informed that the private bank officers themselves are not unanimously opposed to the Government##'##s proposals. As a matter of fact, were a secret ballot taken among the bank officers, I believe it would disclose a majority in support of this legislation. I have in. my hand a circular  which shows the manner in which the banks are intimidating their employees in this matter. Operating among the bank officers is a body known as the Bank Nationalization Committee. It consists nf bank officers who are supporting the Government at great risk to themselves, because they know that so long as the private banks remain in control they will face victimization in their employment. This circular was handed to me by a bank officer who is a member of that Bank Nationalization Committee. It has been distributed by the National Bank of Australasia Limited, Adelaide, and I propose to read it in order to expose this ##"## spontaneous protest ##"## referred to by the Leader of the Opposition.

If the private banks are so anxious to have this matter submitted to the people, why do they not arrange a properly conducted secret ballot among their own officers in order to see where those officers stand on it? </para>
                <para>The Constitution provides that this National Parliament can obtain additional power only with the consent of the people expressed at a referendum; and that is the only method that would be adopted by this Government if it required additional power. But in this matter the Government is exercising a power already conferred upon the Commonwealth Parliament under the Constitution, and no reasonable argument can be advanced why a referendum should be held on this subject. I put this to honorable members opposite: Why should a referendum be held particularly on this proposal to nationalize the private trading banks? In the past innumerable questions have been submitted to the Parliament of the utmost importance to the people of Australia, but the Opposition never demanded that a referendum should be held on any of those matters. Only recently honorable members opposite talked about the expense involved in this proposal, stating that the people should be consulted before they are committed to an expenditure of ##£##100,000,000. The International Monetary Agreement, which was supported by honorable members opposite, involved an expenditure of ##£##125,000,000- </para>

                        <para>- Under the Premiers plan pensions were slashed and wages were cut, but there was no demand on the part of the Opposition for a referendum before it was put into operation. Was there a demand for a referendum on the proposal to extend the area in which our conscripted military forces were to fight? The crippling of the Commonwealth Bank in 1924 as the result of legislation establishing the Commonwealth Bank Board was also a matter upon which the people were not consulted. What would be the position in this country if, on every occasion when protests were made against a measure or somebody was dissatisfied with it, a referendum had to be held? We should have a succession of referendums, the people would be confused and the expense incurred would be colossal. Every measure introduced into the Parliament has its opponents; no measure satisfies everybody. Is it suggested that a referendum should be held whenever groups in the community write to the press or petition the Parliament protesting against some piece of legislation. Should there be a referendum on this issue merely because honorable members opposite, who are the mouthpieces of the great private banking and financial interests in this country, at the bidding of their masters demand it? In his book, <inline font-style="italic">The Forgotten People,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition expressed disapproval of the use of pressure politics, but he has had to swallow his words in this discussion because he has received his marching orders from his political masters in what he was pleased to call the second battle for Australia. As the commander-in-chief of the reactionary forces he has to obey, and has now to fall back on arguments completely different from those which he advanced in his book. </para>

As the result of the gerrymandering of the electorates Labour has been unable to secure adequate representation in the new Parliament. Honorable members opposite have used the Victorian election results as an argument in favour of the holding of a referendum on this proposal. I am not at all convinced that the Victorian people are opposed to the banking proposals of the Government. Likewise I am unconvinced that the majority of the people of Australia would be against it if they had an opportunity- </para>

                        <para>- I am not at all satisfied that the majority of the people of Australia are against this proposal. In any case, the people will be given an opportunity to pass judgment upon the administration of this Government at the elections in 1949. Had we taken notice of the claim by honorable members opposite in 1945, that the banking legislation would not be supported by the people, what would have been the result? Notwithstanding that that legislation was made an issue during the 1946 elections, the Labour Government was returned to office. Had a referendum been held in 1945 in connexion with the Government##'##s banking legislation the people would have recorded their endorsement of it. Honorable members opposite now contend that the people should have the final say in this matter. In the 1946 elections the people showed conclusively that they approved of the Government##'##s banking legislation of 1945. But what did the Opposition, parties, the private banks, and the wealthy financial interests do? Did  they accept the judgment of the people? Not at all. They successfully challenged the validity of a section of the Banking Act of 1945 in the High ##'##Court, but that judgment was contrary to the wishes of the people as expressed at the 1946 elections. Never in my experience of the Labour movement have I seen such unanimity and solidarity among its members as there is to-day in regard to this proposal to nationalize the private banks. </para>

If ever a proposal would bring discredit to parliamentary government, surely that would. The proposal was that by offering a bribe an attempt should be made to induce twelve members of the Labour party to bring about the defeat of this hill.##'## </para>

The people of Victoria knew only too well that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cain</inline> and the Prime Minister worked hand in hand. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cain</inline> had no hesitation in using the taxpayers##'## money to oppose the case in the High Court in which the Melbourne City Council successfully challenged the section of the Banking Act 1945 which was designed to force municipal authorities to bank with the Commonwealth Bank. It is unfortunate for the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke)</inline> that he chose to cite what has happened in Victoria as something akin to what has happened in Germany. What happened in Germany was that the unfortunate people there allowed their centralized control to be put in the hands of Hitler. That is what this Government, without the criminality, but also without the efficiency, is asking the people of Australia to do now. In this insular world of Canberra honorable members opposite are out of touch with the Australian people. The Victorian election results should be a reminder that the will of the people cannot be flouted indefinitely. </para>
                <para>In his reply to the second-reading debate last night, the Prime Minister advanced some interesting theories. He related, for instance, the story of a hoy who had passed his leaving certificate examination, but had been unable to obtain a job in the Commonwealth Bank.

The story of the boy who failed to obtain a job in the Commonwealth Bank was actually put forward, by the Prime Minister of this great country as one reason why the trading banks should be nationalized. The right honorable gentleman has a. phobia regarding finance. He speaks of the ##'##thirties as if the word were actually graven on his heart as a Queen Mary of old said that the word ##"## Calais ##"## would be found on her heart. The great events of history such as the two world wars have left the right honorable gentleman unmoved. He claims that the depression is his reason for taking this action, although nothing of this kind has ever been done before by an English-speaking people. The right honorable gentleman pointed out that the Bank of England had been nationalized. That is true. It has been made a central bank; but the joint stock companies and the trading banks in the United Kingdom have not been touched. The Government of which the right honorable gentleman was a member was defeated in 1932 because it proved itself incapable of solving the problems that confronted it and the task of restoring Australia##'##s economic stability was left to subsequent anti-Labour governments. The depression was world-wide and was due to the fall of the prices of basic commodities. It was not the creation of the banks here or anywhere else. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the bracket that is behind it all. Honorable members opposite have not the courage to stand up to the Communists. Instead, they seek to impose this infamous legislation on a democratic people. I say deliberately that nothing but a federal election or a referendum - and that is the purport of the amendment which I strongly support - will stop the present wild financial extravagance by incompetent administrators, and the appalling waste of the resources of our people. This bill is undemocratic; it is totalitarian; it is a piece of national socialism, and this government, marching blindly along, taking no cognizance of what has happened in Victoria, is marching to its doom. It would be much better if the Prime Minister were to show himself as a man who can take notice of events, by saying, ##"## I shall put this measure aside until the people have had an opportunity to speak on it##"##. So far, only the citizens of one State have expressed their opinion. Let the people of the whole of Australia say whether or not they support this proposal. If they approve it, then the Government need have no hesitation in proceeding. In refusing to hold a referendum, the Prime Minister is acting as a dictator, and his administration is a dictatorship. </para>

Every time, honorable members opposite have opposed democratic legislation, they have said much the same thing as they have been saying to-night and for the past three or four weeks, and as their supporters and money-masters - the bankers - have been saying outside the Parliament ever since the Government announced its intention to introduce this beneficial measure. The Opposition is not only fighting the 1947 proposals; it is also fighting the 1945 legislation over again. Honorable members opposite have never indicated honestly where they stand in regard, to the 1945 act, which the last Parliament passed, and which the people endorsed when they elected the Eighteenth Parliament, and all the things that they, and the bankers, are saying now were said in the respect of that measure. I draw the attention of the committee to what was said in 1945 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McConnan,</inline> who, as most honorable members are aware, is one of the heads of the National Bank of Australasia Limited.

                <para>But the public, taking cognizance of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McConnan</inline> said in 1945, voted this Government back to office in 1946. What more can our opponents say about our legislation in 1947 than they said in 1945? And if the people returned us in 1946, after all that had been said in 1945, what is the use of having a referendum? What good purpose could be served by going back to the people and saying, ##"## Have you changed your minds ? Have you thought things over again? Do you want##'## to turn this Government out?##"## I have not the slightest doubt that if the next elections are fought, and I am cer- tain they will be fought, on this Government##'##s actions in regard to banking, thi1 Labour party will again be returned to office. </para>
                <para>Let us consider the Victorian election figures. Honorable members opposite can derive little solace from the final results when they realize that, in spite of the atmosphere of extraordinary heat, all the abusive argument, the wild speculations and dire prophecy, the uninformed criticism and unfounded charges, and the amazing recourse to any other sort of villainous argument that could be used against the Labour party, Labour candidates still secured the votes of 48 per cent, of the people. It is true that the Labour party has only fifteen members in the new Victorian Legislative Assembly, but look at the set-up in Victoria ! Under the worst form of gerrymandering obtaining in any Australian Parliament, there are 33 members representing country electorates, each having 10,000 electors, and 32 members each representing approximately 25,000 voters in metropolitan electorates. If we divide the total number of votes cast by the number of seats obtained, we find that every Labour man in the Victorian Parliament represents 32,000 electors, and every anti-Labour man represents 12,000 electors. So, when the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> uses the Victorian election results, in an endeavour to prove that the people as a whole are opposed to the nationalization of banking and want a referendum on the subject, he is resorting to specious, false, and mendacious arguments. I am certain that if the leaders of the Victorian Labour party had taken the advice of some people in the federal sphere, and fought the election on banking instead of avoiding this issue, they would not have lost as they did. However, the circumstances were such that they had no real control over the issue. Every newspaper in Australia has ##"## ganged up ##"## against the Government on this legislation. No matter what is said by opponents of the legislation, never a word is published in disavowal or criticism of the most extraordinary remarks made by them in this free community. A man who within a few days may be a Minister in the Victorian Government so far forgot himself as to say over radio station 3DB, one Saturday evening recently - </para>

As Abraham Lincoln said, ##"## You can fool some of the people all the time and all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time ##"##. No matter how many millions of pounds the banks may spend in this campaign - and they spent about half a million in Victoria to get what they achieved last Saturday - they still cannot withstand the tide. The private banks are finished in this country as they will soon be finished throughout the world. Every country is moving towards nationalization of banking. The Bank of France is nationalized, the Bank of England is nationalized and the Bank of New Zealand is nationalized. </para>

                        <para>- The Bank of Russia was always nationalized. It was a national institution -before the Bolsheviks came -to power. When honorable members opposite talk about nationalization of banks in Russia, they ought to remember that the Rank of Russia nationalized in Czarist days before the Kerensky revolution of February, 1917, or the Bolshevik revolution of :October, 1917. The people of this country have the right to determine financial policy through their elected representatives, as tariff and taxation policies are determined. They do not allow the Taxpayers Association to determine how much tax they will pay or the manufacturers or importers to determine the tariff policy. Why should a few people who conduct trading companies called banks be allowed to assume or to arrogate to themselves the right to determine -financial policy? The making of monetary and credit policy ought to reside in the National Parliament and is not a -question for a referendum. Why should about 60 bank directors determine that which should be determined -by the ##'##75 elected representatives of the people asssembled in the House of Representatives. I -cannot imagine why honorable members opposite spend so much time and energy in trying to prevent a development which is inevitable. Even if this Government were defeated before it brought this policy to fruition, it would come back at a subsequent election endorsed by the people and do the thing that we want to do now. Before honorable members opposite press their claim for a referendum, let them be honest with the people and say where they stand in regard to the 1945 banking legislation. Do they accept that or not? </para>

They hope to gain power by subterfuge in order to repeal the 1945 legislation. Once they did that there would be no protection against a return to the conditions of 1931. They want to return to the days when the bankers ruled and sent orders to every government in Australia, Commonwealth and State, directing the number of people they should employ, the wages they should receive; and what pensions they should pay, in fact, directing the whole parliamentary life of the nation. All the parliaments had to submit to conditions laid down conjointly by the privately dominated Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank and the directors of the private trading banks. The case put forward by the Opposition is based on falsity, misrepresentationand mendacity. It has nothing to commend it. It is an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people. I have no doubt that when eventually the people decide this issue, as they will two years hence, they will return this Government and that posterity will bless those who, when the vote was taken on the second reading of the bill last night, voted against the forces of reaction and for real democracy and progress. </para>

                    <para>.- If the electors of Victoria who cast their votes on Saturday against the Victorian Labour Government could have witnessed, as well as heard, the performance of the Minister for Information (Mr.Bagwell), they would have felt that their votes had not been cast in vain. He danced around the table, he threw his hands about, he screwed up his mouth, and he shrieked all sorts of maledictions upon his enemies. The complaint of the Minister for Information, and the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> is that the people of Victoria have spoken. They would have denied them the opportunity to express their views. The Minister for Information did his utmost to draw red herrings across the trail during the election campaign. I pay him this tribute, that he had the courage to go to Victoria and try to save the ship. The Prime Minister (Mr.Chifley) would not do that. Although he could go to Melbourne to attend the races on the day of the poll, the right honorable gentleman would not raise his voice on behalf of this measure, which he has described as being of transcendent importance to the people of Australia. I shall not follow the scent of the red herrings used by the Minister for Information and the Minister for Transport. The issue is very simple. It is this : Are the people of Australia entitled to vote on an issue that will have a revolutionary effect upon their lives? Honorable members on the Government side of the chamber, who are nervously counting the days until the next Commonwealth general elections, have said that the vote in Victoria represents nothing. The Minister for Transport has said that it did not reflect opinion on the banking issue. I shall cite the results of voting in some of the Victorian electorates. </para>

                <para>The Essendon electorate was represented by the son of the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford).</inline> He won at the 1945 election by 6,000 votes. He lost this this time by approximately 300 votes. How do Government supporters account for that swing? Oakleigh had been represented for twenty years by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> At the previous election he won by 5,600 votes. This time he was defeated by 500 votes. Dandenong was represented by the  Deputy  Premier and Minister for Education, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Field.</inline> At the previous election he won by 500 votes. This time he was defeated by 3,000 votes. Dundas had been the stronghold of the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Slater,</inline> for 30 years. At the previous election he won by 3,700 votes. This time he lost by 1,500 votes. </para>
                <para class="block">The Wonthaggi electorate, in the mining district of Victoria, returned the Minister for Mines, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie,</inline> at the previous election, by 2,000 votes. This time he was defeated by 2,000 votes. The Labour candidate for Mildura, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garlick,</inline> was returned by 200 votes at the previous election. This time he was defeated by 1,400 votes. Those are the figures for a few electorates selected at random. The result in every part of the State, including the metropolitan area, was the same. Yet Government supporters have the audacity to say that this was the result of propaganda and pressure applied by the banks. Did they not have the same opportunity to use propaganda as had the banks? They put their case to the people, and now they quarrel with the referee##'##s verdict and say that it is not fair. They will not submit this measure to the people by referendum because they know now, if they did not know before the Victorian elections, what the result of a referendum would be. </para>
                <para>I, and other members of the Opposition, have been presenting petitions from electors in relation to banking for weeks past. I have submitted petitions from uo fewer than 27,000 people in the Richmond electorate. Other honorable members -have presented petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of citizens. Slurs have been cast upon these petitions by Government supporters, who claim that signatures have been obtained under duress and that some of the signatures have been faked. Was the ballot in Victoria faked? There can be no doubt on that issue. Nevertheless, they attempt to excuse themselves by saying, ##"##But that is a gerrymandered State ##"##. Have they ever heard of the State of Queensland, and have they considered the Upper House of this legislature, the Senate, in which 33 senators represent 51 per cent, of the electors and three Opposition senators represent 49 per cent, of the electors? The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> is that, before this bill is given the Governor-General##'##s assent, not less than one month nor more than six months after its passage through both Houses of the Parliament, it shall be submitted in each State to the electors qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Representatives. In other words, the right honorable gentleman asks for a referendum. Is it beyond the capacity of the Government to grant this request? The Government has already given notice of its intention to introduce a bill providing for a referendum on prices in January or February next year. That is only two or three months hence. Would it add to the cost of the referendum to place on the ballot-paper an additional question on the banking issue? The only extra cost would be that of the printer##'##s ink. </para>
                <para>The Minister for Transport declares that this is a fight on behalf of the trading banks to prevent the nationalization of those banks. This is a fight to prevent the nationalization of the liberty of the individual in Australia! That is the issue, and that is why tens of thousands of people in Victoria have changed, in a period of about twelve months, from support to opposition of the Labour party. We know very well that the Prime Minister was the originator of this proposal. It is evident that he has dragooned the whole of his party. The Minister for Transport said that he had never seen such solidarity in the Labour party. I have never seen such fear on the faces of men as I now see on the faces of Ministers and their supporters. It was evident from the way in which the Minister for Information carried on earlier this evening that he was actuated by the most deadly fear. It was not fear of what might happen to the poor and the needy; it was fear of losing his private car, his trips around the world, and all the other privileges which Ministers enjoy. </para>

                        <para>- Those are the privileges that Ministers and their supporters are fighting for, not those of the common man as we have been told. The common man is merely an instrument by means of which these folk create their privileges. . There is nothing to prevent the Government, if it be a democratic Government, and if it desires to consult the wishes of the people, from putting this matter before the people by means of a referendum. Its supporters say that  in two, years##'## time there will be an opportunity for the people to express their wishes. But did not. the Prime Minister say that he intended, to ##"##scramble these eggs, so that nobody could ever unscramble them##"##? Is that the honest way of submitting, a scheme tq the people ? He proposes to present them with an accomplished fact which, in his view, can neverbe altered. Is that honest and decent?  The  amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition provides the Government with an opportunity- to. give the people, the right to voice their opinion on this issue, arid I##"## heartily support it. </para>

I believe that if we did take a referendum on the Government##'##s banking proposals, we should be breaking the Constitution. Apart altogether from that, I am one of those who believes, as I have said frequently in this chamber, but, again, it will bear repetition, that a government is elected to do anything and everything within the Constitution that it thinks fit in the interests of the people of Australia. Since this Government is convinced that this legislation is in the best interests of the people of Australia, there is no need for it to take a referendum on the subject. </para>

                <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> pointed out last night, when replying to the second-reading debate, that the Bruce Page Government was asked by a minority of its supporters to hold a referendum on a certain matter.When the Bruce-Page Government refused to do so, it was defeated in the House on the issue. In asking for a dissolution, the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> writing to the Governor-General, made it quite clear on behalf of the then Leader of the Country party, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page, and himself, that there was no constitutional basis for a referendum on any subject other than an alteration of the. Constitution. Therefore, we have clear proof that one who purported to be a great leader of a political party which was a forerunner of the present Liberal party - it was called by a different name in those days, but that is nothing new for political parties opposed to the Labour party in this Parliament - took the same attitude on this matter as I am taking to-night. There is no constitutional basis whatever for holding a referendum on any subject other than an alteration of the Constitution. </para>

When discussing the proposal that this matter should be submitted to the people by way of referendum, I suppose that I shall commit more indiscretions, but one of them is not original. About twenty years ago, I heard referenda being discussed by a person who, at the time, was prominent in South Australian politics.

                <para class="block">Water lilies are beautiful flowers. This quotation from a speech by the honorable member for Barker, relating to whether referendums should or should not be held, is most appropriate to the present debate. I have always held that a government is elected to carry out its legislative programme in order to benefit the people who have elected it. At the time of its election it is given a complete mandate to use in the interests of the people all the powers available to it under the Constitution. Any government which was so weak-willed as to place an issue such as thi9 before the people, when its members knew in their own hearts that it was the right thing to do, would be guilty of a breach of the trust reposed in it by the people. I cannot perceive any logic whatever in the argument that a referendum should be held simply because the Victorian elections went against us. If one were to accept that as justification for holding a referendum, all the vested interests would have to do to defeat any progressive legislation would be to get a reactionary body such as the Legislative Council of Victoria to cause some disturbance to precipitate a local election. That is exactly what occurred when the Victorian Legislative Council withheld supply from the Government of that State. It is quite obvious that action of that kind is the very antithesis of democracy. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> suggested, because the elections in Victoria went badly for the Australian Labour party in that State, that the people thereby expressed quite clearly an adverse opinion on the question of nationalizing the banks. The plain fact is that the nationalization of banking was not the issue before the electors; the real issue was the refusal of supply by the Legislative Council. It is true, of course, that honorable members opposite endeavoured to make the nationalization of hanking the principal issue. but it was not accepted by the people as such. Logically and constitutionally, the nationalization of banking was not in issue before the electors at all. It may be a fact that a large number of people in Victoria voted against the Australian Labour party because of the misleading propaganda disseminated by members of the Opposition parties which suggested that the nationalization of hanking was the main issue. The fact remains, however, that no opportunity was given to advocates of the nationalization of bank ing to put their side of the question to the people. </para>

                        <para>- Did I hear some one say, ##"## Why did we not accept the nationalization of banking as the issue ##"## ? That i9 rather a ridiculous suggestion. Because an issue is raised in a State Parliament and the Legislative Council of that Parliament withholds supply from the Government, thereby forcing the Government to an election, is that to be taken as putting in issue before the people a proposal of the National Government? If that were so, any reactionary body which chose to precipitate a State election at any time could argue that proposals of the National Government had been placed before the people of Australia for their verdict. Obviously, that would reduce responsible, democratic government to a mere sham. It is completely illogical to suggest that the National Government should accept the nationalization of banking as the issue on which the electors of Victoria voted merely because the Legislative Council of that State so desired. Therefore, I do not accept the contention of honorable members opposite that the result of the election in Victoria expresses the considered opinion of the people of that State on the Government##'##s present proposal. Furthermore, I believe that if the nationalization of banking had been placed fairly before the people as the real issue, and the people had been afforded an opportunity of hearing the other side of the story, the result of the election would have been very different. </para>

                        <para>.- We have just listened to typical speeches from the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman).</inline> The utterance of the Minister for Information was an hysterical one; in fact, it was more hysterical than usual. So far as the specious arguments of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction are concerned, we have listened to them before, and they do not carry any weight. The honorable gentleman whom I have mentioned endeavoured to argue that a referendum was unnecessary and unconstitutional because no specific provision is made in the Constitution for a referendum to be taken on matters such as the present proposal. However, I remind the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction that referendums were taken, not once but on two occasions, in regard to conscription, a matter which is not mentioned in the Constitution at all. I also remind the honorable gentleman that the people of this country have expressed a very definite desire that a referendum should be taken. Honorable members opposite have contended that the result of the Victorian elections cannot be regarded as a verdict on the Government##'##s present proposal. The fact is that the issue before the electors was perfectly clear, although members of the Australian Labour party did seek to divert the attention of electors to consideration of the continued existence of the Legislative Council of Victoria. Indeed, that topic was introduced by practically every Labour  speaker.  Nevertheless, the result of the election showed quite clearly that the electorate considered that it was voting on the National Government##'##s proposals for the nationalization of banking. </para>

                <para>However, some doubt appears to exist even now in the minds of honorable members opposite as to the real feelings of the people of Australia in regard to its proposal, and in order to dispel that doubt I propose to mention a few simple facts. In my own electorate there were, prior to the Victorian election, nine State electorates, of which six were represented by members of the Australian Labour party. Those Labour representatives have been swept away; as the Germans say, they have vanished without a trace. Their political disappearance is due solely to the Prime Minister##'##s drastic proposal, and they have gone, not to return for a very long time. In case any further proof of my contention is needed, I propose to examine the Victorian election figures closely. Various figures have been cited by honorable members opposite in the course of this debate which are quite wrong. Those figures were prepared without regard to a number of significant facts concerning certain electorates. In 1945, candidates put forward by the Australian Labour party were returned unopposed in eight Victorian electorates. In eleven other electorates the retiring Labour members were not opposed by non-Labour candidates either in this or the 1945 election. </para>

                    <para>.- The committee having disposed so briskly of the clauses which preceded the present bracket of clauses, owing to the operation of the ##"##guillotine##"## imposed by the Government earlier to-day, is now required to consider almost equally expeditiously the next seventeen clauses of this measure. As those clauses are some of the most important in the bill, I shall indicate to supporters of the Government what they mean. They include a statement against discrimination against any depositor; provision for the acquisition of shares ; references to notice being given to the banks before shares are required; provision for appointment of directors ; and the notorious provisions granting a tax concession to those who are prepared to ##"## come quietly ##"##. It is proper that some honorable member on this side of the chamber should point out what those clauses include because, obviously, supporters of the Government were in complete ignorance of the contents of the bill until it was presented to the Parliament. That great lover of humanity who addressedus last night - I refer to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> - the man who is so concerned with the wellbeing of the people that he will not let them say for themselves what they want to happen, introduced a bill providing for a most revolutionary change in our economic and commercial life without even letting the members of his own party know what was in it. No back-bench member of the party knew what was in the bill before it was presented to the Parliament. </para>

How can honorable members vote intelligently on the bill, and exercise judgment in doing so?

Is this not a mere sop to the feelings of the people? I defy honorable  members  opposite to point to anything in the clause which imposes a penalty on an officer of the Commonwealth Bank who might discriminate in the giving of credit. This is a most important issue. Labour men who have supported socialism in other countries have consistently opposed the creation of a State banking monopoly because of their fear of discrimination.

When it came to an issue between the claims of one person and another, it was tetter, he said, that the decision should be made by some one other than a Cabinet Minister. Now let us come closer to home, and see what some of the Government##'##s own advisers have said on this subject. Professor Mills, and Professor Ronald Walker, both of whom hold high and responsible positions in the government service, collaborated in the writing of a book called <inline font-style="italic">Money.</inline> Professor Mills was a member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, so he ought to know something of the subject. He is now Director of the Commonwealth Office of Education. In the early part of the war, Professor Walker was an economic adviser to the Government, and is now adviser to the Australian Legation in Washington. I quote the following from their book, which was written a few years ago - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It is clear that nationalization of banking might lead to discrimination between borrowers on various grounds, for example, to starve industrial monopolies of credit, or even to foster the growth of nationalized industries. And indeed, if a political party wished to transform society into a socialist State by the gradual nationalization of important industries, it would be wise, for obvious reasons, to start with banking. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The only protection which this bill purports to afford against discrimination is contained in the clause now before the committee, and this clause, when analysed, is seen to afford no protection at all. It is merely a bald statement of a point of view. There is no authority behind it, and it imposes no sanctions against an officer of the bank who may exercise discrimination. The clause is placed in the bill merely to delude those who might entertain a fear that the Government would use the legislation for discriminatory purposes. In every part of the world, where governments have assumed control of banking, such control has been used for political and discriminatory purposes. This is what happened in Russia, Germany, and Italy, and it is happening to-day in Argentina. We have no confidence that the present Commonwealth Government would not act as those other governments have acted, once this power is in its hands. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> referred to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> in ironical terms as ##"## this lover of humanity ##"##. I assume he meant this to he a slur upon the right honorable gentleman. If so, I throw it back in his teeth. The honorable member for Fawkner now warns us of the dangers of socialism, but a few days ago he told the House that he himself was a socialist until he was 30 years of age. </para>

                        <para>- This bill represents a move by the Government to control the credit resources of the nation. Either the Government must control financial policy, or the private banks, in their own right, will expand and contract the credit of the nation. _ The honorable member quoted from a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Money,</inline> written by Professor Walker and Professor Mills.  His  quotation was accurate; but I point out that those authors also said that it was no more important to nationalize banking than it was to nationalize the industry of bread baking. That statement, I submit, is obviously absurd. Banking by its very nature must be conducted as a monopoly; if it be conducted otherwise chaos must result, whilst in baking a monopoly is impossible. And we know that throughout the history of private banks, they have never engaged in competition. However, Professor Mills and Professor Walker, in a later edition of their book, showed that they had seen the light, because they stated that the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems recommended that private banking should be continued only . if the Commonwealth Bank was a powerful central bank capable of controlling the banking system. In that edition they revealed a very great change in the views they expressed in their earlier edition, when they declared that there was no greater need to nationalize banking than there was to nationalize the industry of bread baking. The honorable member for Fawkner dealt with a number of other matters, the principal of which was the provision in this measure compelling the Commonwealth Bank to refrain from discriminating between customers. The honorable gentleman pointed out that there was no way to compel the bank to observe that provision. That may he true ; but the simple fact remains that there is nothing in the wide world to-day to prevent private banks from discriminating among customers who apply to them for advances. Whether the provision in this measure can be enforced or not, the instruction conveyed to the bank in this legislation is a much stronger guarantee that discrimination will not be shown among customers. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that hanking cannot be conducted on a competitive basis, because banking must, of its nature, be a monopoly. The report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems supports my statement that, banking cannot be effectively carried on on a competitive basis. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">.(Mr. .Spender),</inline> in his second-reading speech, said that there was no competition between the private ba&lt;nks in respect of rates and charges, but that competition existed between them in respect of margins of security. Such competition is of the most dangerous type and cannot be justified in the banking system of this, or any other, country. The fact is that when the banks experience falling prices the margin of their collateral security disappears, and then, not because of any desire on their part, but .by force of circumstances, they are obliged to call in credits, because the values against which they made- advances begin to disappear and realization in all probability would not recoup them in respect of the advances. With widespread competition in respect of margins of security, banks are forced to lend on more risky ventures, and when prices fall the result of such competition so far as the people are concerned is much more severe than that of competition of any other kind. When honorable members opposite misrepresent aspects of the banking system they must be prepared to pay the penalty of having their statements exposed by honorable -.members on this side of the chamber. </para>

                <para class="block">We have witnessed the spectacle to-night of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> revelling in the fact that he had opened a letter which came into his possession in error. The letter was not addressed to him, and, after reading the opening sentence, he must have realized that it was not intended for him. Nevertheless, he read the whole of the contents of the letter and its enclosures, and, knowing that he illegally possessed a letter intended for somebody else, he deliberately publicized its contents in this chamber, not on one occasion, but on several occasions, and even as recently as to-night. If that is the kind of indecency and dishonesty to be shown in the conduct of the Commonwealth Bank by responsible Ministers of the Crown, who, through the Prime Minister and Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> can instruct the bank what it shall do, and, bearing in mind that there will be no other bank in existence, such practice will be in accordance with the practices and usages customary among bankers, because it will be done by that single monopoly bank. On this point I wish to inform the committee of incidents during the war, with regard to the Commonwealth Bank, which will show <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the people exactly how the bank used the censorship of communications within Australia in order to obtain information which had no connexion with the war or the winning of it, and then to hand this information on to those who were in no way entitled to have it. There was submitted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ettelson,</inline> Controller of Post and Telegraph Censorship, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rusden,</inline> officer in  charge of Exchange Control, Commonwealth Bank, certain particulars required by the bank which it desired to have abstracted from letters written by members of the public. In those instructions - I quote from a statement issued to the press by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> - there appeared the phrase, ##"## In the interests of good government in Australia, or would be helpful in banking, finance or exchange control in this country ##"##. Those were instructions regarding information to be taken out of letters of members of the public during the war for use by the Commonwealth Bank. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rusden</inline> said that the terms of those instructions were amended in April, or May, 1944. That was about one month after the appointment of the parliamentary committee which was appointed to inquire into censorship. Giving evidence before that committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rusden,</inline> under cross-examination by myself, said he could not remember whether the words, ##"##In the interests of good government in Australia, ##&amp;##c##"##, were his words. He added - </para>

                    <para>I cannot see how I can avoid taking the responsibility for them. I admit they are peculiar words, and that boiled down they amount to a ##"##blanket clause##"## which would enable us to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Ettleson  for information simply on the grounds that in our opinion such information was in the interests of good government in Australia or helpful in banking, finance and exchange controls. </para>

                <para class="block">The clause of the bill to which I am addressing myself contains instructions governing the conduct of affairs of the Commonwealth Bank. The bank  i3  instructed, in particular, not to divulge any information except in accordance with law or the practices and usages customary among bankers. That will mean practices and usages laid down by the single monopoly bank, the Commonwealth Bank. Let us see what happened during the war. In one case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> V. Nixon, who was one of the honoured advisers to the Commonwealth Treasury during the war, when he was Director of Finance, Munitions Department, giving evidence before the Parliamentary Committee on Censorship, said that he  wa3 <inline font-weight="bold">chairman</inline> of directors of Moulded Products (Australasia) Proprietary Limited, and that a formula had been sent to his company by the Monsanto Company, of America. That formula, which had nothing to do with security, was abstracted from the letter, and the company found enclosed, by error, in the envelope, which was marked ##"## Opened by censor ##"##, a copy of a departmental letter instructing that a copy of the formula should be circularized in the department concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nixon</inline> said that his company was not being obstructive in any way, and that if the Government had asked Moulded Products Proprietary Limited for the formula the company would have made it available, but that the company objected to it being taken without its knowledge. That is one instance of the improper use of the censorship. During the war there was published monthly by  Colonel Ettelson,  Controller of Post and Telegraph Censorship, a publication known as the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Military Censorship Summary,</inline> in which appeared extracts taken from letters of business firms. Copies of these summaries were circulated among the forces. Here is a typical extract - </para>

                <para>Apparently it went on to indicate what the process was. An extract was also made from a letter written by a firm in Australia to a firm in England giving a review of plant and machinery requirements for a five-year period after the war and the policy to be adopted by the Australian company. Other secret information was similarly extracted and disseminated widely throughout the services. We have heard the story of a letter dealing with banking matters which was stolen from the censorship and quoted, too, over the air- </para>

With the assistance and approval of the governments of the day, the banks made certain arrangements to recommence operations. The English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited, which, as honorable members know, is registered in England, proposed that all deposits up to ##£##50 be paid in cash, and that an amount of ##£##838,000 due to governments and for note issue liability be also paid in cash. If evidence be required of the need for State and local government authorities to bank with a government bank that evidence is surely supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Wilson.</inline> He goes on to say that the banks were obliged to call up a sum of ##£##900,000 from their shareholders to pay moneys, due to the Government and for note issue liability. Honorable members are aware that at that time the private banks issued their own notes and that when they closed their doors the notes were not worth the paper upon which they were printed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> gave the terms of settlement of the balance as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">What I want <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> to answer is whether it is not a fact that the English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited, through its directorate, approached the tory government of the United Kingdom to have certain legislation passed which in the first instance gave it access to the court, and secondly, whether it is not a fact that the rate of interest was subsequently reduced to 3 per cent, as the result of the action of private banks. It is of no use for him to endeavour to protect his hank from criticism by arguing that this reduction was brought about by the court; it was definitely brought about by the action of the private banks. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> then said that the stock immediately became marketable, and that stock-holders could dispose of their stock if they wanted to do so.

So, whilst, as the result of the action of the hank, the unfortunate depositors were deprived of access to their money, after the value of the stock  had become depressed on the market, the bank took advantage of the position to reduce its indebtedness by purchasing some of the stock itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> then made a great feature of the fact that last year - approximately 50 years after the closing of the bank - it was able to discharge its last liability. He denied that this action had been taken because of criticism offered by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> during the discussion of the 1945 banking legislation.

                    <para>However described, all these interminable securities had two features in common. The first was that they were payable only at the option of the bank; the second, that the low rate of interest fixed was not subject to revision. In effect, this converted them into fixed capital, entitled only to a low rate of interest. The conditions described are open to adverse criticism on the ground of rigidity. The rate fixed may have been fair at the time and in the circumstances, but it became definitely inequitable in later years when higher rates of interest prevailed and the banks concerned earned large profits. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> talked of letters that he had received asking for a referendum on the Government##'##s banking proposals. Since I made my statement in this Parliament, and publicly, I have received a number of letters from unfortunate people concerning the bank crash of 1893. Some of them have related the experiences of their parents, who have since passed away, and others, now advanced in years, have told of their personal experiences. Yet honorable members opposite say, ##"## Why go back so far ? ##"## When we refer to the depression days they say, ##"## Let us talk of events of to-day ##"##. The people of this country should remember that antiLabour interests never change their policy </para>
                <para>Or  their tactics. They only await favorable opportunities to benefit themselves, even though it means striking at the welfare of the community. The private bankers to-day can dictate to antiLabour governments, and during the regime of such administrations they can secure the passage through this Parliament of any legislation that they desire. The anti-Labour parties are the political mouthpieces of the private banks. We could have another depression in this country, and should another depression come, it would not be these individuals who to-day are causing unrest in the community who would suffer, but the unfortunate people some of whom are falling for this antiLabour propaganda. They would learn of their mistake by bitter experience. </para>
                <para>There are still in this Parliament certain non-Labour members who voiced no protest when effect was being given to the Premiers plan. They talked about the economic position of the country, but they did not worry about the great distress that was caused throughout the land. They had no vision and no faith in the future of this country. They did not recognize, as the Labour party has recognized, that idle resources, whether they be man-power, materials or equipment, are a national loss. We have embarked upon a policy of full employment, but the Leader of the Opposition does not believe in full employment. I recall the criticism that was offered in this Parliament when the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> attending the San Francisco conference as a representative of this country, sought to have provision for full employment incorporated in the United Nations Charter. The Leader of the Opposition said on that occasion that the Minister was endeavouring to circumvent the will of the people as expressed in the referendum of 1944, and that he did not favour the inclusion of the objective of full employment in the charter; I referred, in my second-reading speech, to an article by the financial editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about the great advantages of another depression in this country in order that discipline in industry might be restored. </para>

How did it get into the Minister##'##s hands and why did he quote it with such satisfaction? Talk of censorship ! Every letter that was sent to me in the two years I was overseas during the war was censored. The letters were thrust back into the envelopes in any old  manner.  Evidence that they had been taken out, read and returned was provided by the marks of dirty teacups on them. If the Government wants to censor bank correspondence it can. I do not believe that even though the war is ended, censorship will not continue. </para>
                <para>During the Victorian general election campaign I travelled in the city and the country and learned that the people there are affronted that such a policy as this should be even contemplated. I asked wheat-growers whether they believed that the private banks forced them off properties. Their reply was, ##"## No, on the contrary ! ##"## There is confidence between the customers and the private banks, especially in the country towns, where the bank managers are frequently able to advise their customers as to the buying and selling of stock, plant and the like. Even with the. best intentions in the world, a government institution, whatever government be in power, losses efficiency as compared with privately conducted ones. There is no possibility of secrecy in a government institution. A person seeking an advance has to answer a multitude of questions on various forms, which are then sent to the head-quarters. This legislation will disrupt the goodwill that the private trading banks have developed in this country in the last 130 years. Banking is an essential adjunct to commerce. </para>
                <para>As to the possibility of there being secrecy in a government bank, there is no secrecy even about small accounts to-day. I have seen letters addressed to bond holders asking them to convert their bonds. The letters bear the bank account numbers of the people to whom they have been sent. So there is a close connexion between the Treasury and the Commonwealth Bank. Therefore, it is useless for the Government to try to lead the people to believe, by the insertion of that clause in this bill, that secrecy will be observed by the government monopoly bank. Secrecy is impossible in such an institution. Moreover, what possibilities for political pressure will exist ! This weakkneed Government will not be able to stand up to militant unions, particularly those dominated by the Communists, which, intending to call their members out on strike, demand financial accommodation so that they shall be able to  pay strike money to them. The totalitarian Treasurer will not be able to refuse them. To-day the right honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> is Treasurer. To-morrow the Treasurer may be the .turbulent honorable member for East Sydney. He could not show the detachment necessary in banking affairs. It is likely that as he lives constantly in the atmosphere of class antagonism he would favour the claims of people who used pressure on him. He would vent in commercial transactions some of the spleen that he exhibits in the Parliament. The kind of banking that we know, which is in the British tradition and is the envy of other nations, is to go because the Prime Minister, nursing a grievance and brooding over the repressions of the past, suddenly decided that they should go. </para>
                <para>It would be interesting to hear the result of a secret ballot of a Labour caucus on this matter. ##"##We hear a lot about secret ballots of unionists, but a secret ballot in the parliamentary caucus would be splendid. ##"##We understand that the Prime Minister declared for the liquidation of the private banks when the High Court, upset his plans and agreed with the Melbourne City Council that it should not be compelled to bank with the Commonwealth Bank. This bill is the denouement. The caucus sheep must follow the Prime Minister##'##s lead. It is provided that the Prime Minister may decide that the bank directors shall go. <inline font-style="italic">Ipso facto</inline> they are to be dismissed.  He  will be able to appoint directors to carry on. Who will they be? The Government pays lip service to preference in employment for ex-servicemen, but, as with the appointment of all but one of the conciliation commissioners, doubtless the directors will come from the ranks of union secretaries and organizers and various other - I was about to say hangers-on - people in that category. We have seen dumped in country towns prefabricated buildings for use as branches of the Commonwealth Bank. Actually, shopkeepers are being evicted to make room for further banks. I have already raised this matter with the Prime Minister, and the right honorable gentleman promised an investigation. These vital clauses, 18 to 25, which will get such cursory consideration to-night and which have to be disposed of early to-morrow will become law. The employees of the banks, who belong to a union over 20,000 strong, will become industrial conscripts and will be transferred willy-nilly to the Public Service; bank managers, who have risen to their positions through long and faithful service to the community, will be paid off by some nebulous body, and the shareholders possibly will be paid in inflated currency, because no provision has been made in the Estimates or elsewhere for the ##£##100,000,000 that has to be found for this purpose. This is iniquitous. The whole bill is infamous and revolutionary, and the clauses emphasize how bad it is. I take the strongest exception to it. It is not democratic. In fact, it is quite contrary to democratic ideas, which means that many people, if not everybody in Australia, will suffer. </para>

It is quite obvious that they made substantial profits during those years and that the sufferings caused by the conditions which existed then had to be endured by the mass of the Australian people. The very purpose of this legislation is to ensure that such conditions shall not recur and that the mass of the people shall not suffer while private profit-making financial institutions flourish. When the honorable member said that the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in those days were full of advertisements offering Government Savings Bank passbooks for sale at 10s. in the ##£##1, he conveniently omitted to mention that both the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which published the advertisements and profited from them, and the private financiers, who purchased the passbooks to the loss and suffering of those who were compelled to sell them, are to-day among the chief opponents of this measure, which will prevent such a condition of affairs recurring to their benefit and profit in future years.

                        <para>--I am glad that I have at last succeeded in making a statement on this matter which is in order. The honorable member for New England spoke to-night in a more confused manner than he usually does. Although I listened to him -with considerable attention, I do not know whether any honorable member was able to understand clearly the points that he tried to make in connexion with military censorship or their relation to this bill. If the honorable member, or any other member of the Opposition, had wished to show that secrecy would not prevail in a public banking system, that there would be discrimination in the treatment of customers, or that there would not be adequate banking facilities for the people of Australia, surely he would have dealt with actual cases from his own experience and the experience of the Australian people in relation to banking. However, he seemed only to join with the honorable member for Balaclava in a protest, against the way in which military censorship was exercised. The view of the honorable member for Balaclava appeared to be that military censorship should not have been applied to letters which he received while he was overseas. I do not know on what ground the honorable member for Balaclava should consider himself to be superior to any one else in matters of censorship in war-time; but he did say that those who were in charge of military censorship decided which letters should be opened. I contend that if those authorities decided that all letters addressed to the honorable member for Balaclava should be opened, then no doubt they judged in accordance with the facts. </para>

                <para>Censorship in war-time was a matter of military security. At that time, the security of the Australian people had to be placed above everything else. It has no relation whatever to the peace-time conduct of banking. The fact that the Opposition had to rely upon such members as the honorable member for New England and the honorable member for Balaclava to put the case on this important clause; the fact that they failed to produce any illustration of discrimination among the 3?800,000 customers of the public hanking system of this country; the fact that they have not been able to produce any examples of the breach of secrecy provisions in the conduct of public banking; and the fact that they have failed to show any lack of adequate facilities in the Commonwealth Bank indicate the measure of the success of public banking in the past, and the best assurance that the clause now under consideration has been suitably drafted; so as ##'##to provide, in future, an assurance for the customers Of private banks which they have never previously been able to obtain. I ask: Will any honorable member in this chamber deny that the control of private banks has rested solely in the power of money to purchase shares ? A man might have absolutely no knowledge of banking and no sense of responsibility to the public, yet if he possesses a sufficient amount of money to purchase a controlling interest in a banking company, he can become the sole authority to decide its policy. </para>

                        <para>- I refer to any private trading bank. The present directors of the private banks in Australia have other industrial and financial interests which can cause them to require discrimination to be practised by the managers and staffs of those banks against others whose interests in those industrial and financial matters may be in competition with their own. There has been no statutory provision, and no legal protection for the customers of those banks against the exercise of discrimination, and while no example can be quoted of discrimination in the conduct of public banking, examples were quoted during the second-reading debate of discrimination applied to customers of private banks, because the directors had financial interests in similar types of business to those for which advances were sought. This clause does provide for the Australian public a protection which it has never had before; a complete legal assurance both to the customers and to the staffs of the banks in carrying out their functions; and the observance of secrecy in conformity with the conduct of the banking profession, in such a way as to provide adequate banking facilities for the public. </para>

In regard to the policy which is to operate when the issue of licences for imports from dollar areas is resumed, the Minister for Trade and Customs has stated that, although a limit has been placed on the amount of dollars which may be used for importing books, the sum allocated should be adequate to meet Australian requirements of the more essential type of books. </para>

The establishment of this section follows inquiries made <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Coal Utilization Research Committee set up by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and discussions held with the late Professor T. David Jones during his visit to Australia. The activities of the Mineral Resources Bureau have been intensified in the search for petroleum, natural gas and methane gas. It is not, however, intended to act precipitately in entering into large-scale experiments in the production of synthetic fuels. The form which these experiments should take can be determined only after exhaustive investigation and appropriate inquiries are being made. </para>

                        <para>- On the 28th October the honorable member for Deakin (Mr.Hutchinson.) asked a question regarding government subsidies to the coal industry and further to my promise on that occasion I desire to inform the honorable member that as at the end of August last, costs at an annual rate of approximately ##£##3,900,000 were being incurred by the coal-mining industry over and above the costs of the industry when ceiling prices were introduced. On the 3rd November, the average price of coal was increased by 5s. a ton. This increase did not entirely remove the necessity for subsidy, which will be continued at the rate of approximately ##£##750,000 a year. </para>

                        <para>The Postal Department is fully aware of the adverse effect of the railway passenger train restrictions in Victoria upon country mail services, and it has been active in arranging supplementary services by road to outlying centres. As a result, motor vehicles on over 30 routes have been subsidized and the mail frequency to a large number of towns in Victoria has been restored to normal by this means. </para>
                        <para>The department is concerned that the populous and important Mildura area has been reduced to four mails weekly by train, but in the absence of a regular road motor servicebetween Mildura and any suitable connecting point, it has not yet been practicable to arrange additional mails. The honorable member may be assured, however, that the matter is receiving close attention with a view to effecting an improvement in the Mildura mail service at the earliest possible moment. </para>

The league was advised on the 2nd October, 1947, that the department was giving consideration to a proposal to employ suitable disabled men on switchboard operating. It was pointed out that this class of work has, in general, hitherto been performed by female telephonists, but that arrangements were recently made for the employment of adult males on night operating, and provision had been made by the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator for an appropriate amendment to the award governing the conditions of telephonists. The league was also advised that the amendment of the prescribed industrial conditions would possibly enable the department to employ suitably qualified disabled ex-servicemen as telephonists, but that it would be necessary in the first instance for certain medical aspects to bo investigated in conjunction with the Director-General of Health and the Commonwealth Public Service Board. </para>
