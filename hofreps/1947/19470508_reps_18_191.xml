            <para>- I have no doubt that the honorable member has in. mind the position in Victoria. The output of bran and pollard in that State is at a very high level, but so is the demand, due. to the capacity of wheat farmers and poultry raisers to use this class of feed, because of the remunerative prices they are receiving for their products. I do nol know that anything can be done to overtake the shortage. During the war, under delegated national security powers, tha Government of Victoria supervised the distribution of bran and pollard in order to ensure  priority  of supplies to those who needed them most.  During  the debate on the financial statement, members of the Opposition clamoured for the removal of control from different kinds <inline font-style="italic">,</inline> primary production. In the circumstances, I am afraid that it would be impracticable for the State of Victoria to exercise control of the distribution of these products, as it did formerly. However, I shall be very glad to make an inquiry with a view to determining whether distribution can be accelerated. There may have been a temporary interruption of distribution during the recent unfortunate industrial disturbance in Victoria. </para>

            <para>- I have not read the&#39; figures cited, but I heard references to the matter by the right honorable gentleman or some other honorable gentleman during the recent debate on the financial statement. I have had a report prepared on the subject showing the number of persons employed by the Commonwealth Government at the present time, as compared -with the peak period of the war, and showing also what has been done in regard to staffing in the various departments. It is a very long report. I would not like to embody it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> because it would involve too much work at the Government Printing Office, but I will make it available to the honorable member and to the press. </para>

In regard, to Nuremburg Jews, I have established, in. co-operation with the proper authorities, two committees to represent persons of partly Jewish blood. One of these committees will concern itself with those who profess the Protestant faith, while the other committee will represent Catholics. The committee &#39; to represent the Protestants is in Melbourne and is presided over by Professor Woodrow, the secretary being Miss Margaret Holmes. The Catholic committee is located in Sydney, mid the secretary is <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. J.</inline> Harcombe.  I think the honorable member is misinterpreting the news item if he thinks that the Jewish people have been given  advantages  over other persons of Christian faith who are partly of Jewish origin.

The number of British people&#39; who came to Australia between V-P Day and the 31st January, 1947, was 38,413. That figure includes temporary visitors and returning Australians. The number of new British migrants to come to Australia between V-P Day and the 31st January, 1947, -was 22,274 and 2,605 foreign migrants, of whom about 700 were refugees, were admitted up to the 31st December, 1946.

          <para class="block">Australia was 2,873. The number of allied ex-servicemen who received their discharge in Australia was 917, of whom 812 were American and 105 Dutch. Approximately 196,193 applications have been lodged  by  Britishers at Australia House for free and assisted passages to Australia and for the right, as it were, to enter Australia of those willing to pay the fares of themselves and their dependants. There are two agreements with the United Kingdom under our migration schemes. One provides for free passages to Australia for suitable ex-service men and women of the United Kingdom armed forces and merchant navy, together with their dependants. Under that scheme, the whole of the passage money is paid by the United Kingdom Government as part of its rehabilitation scheme. There is also an assisted passage agreement whereby the approved migrant is obliged to pay: (a) &#163;10 sterling if nineteen years of age or over, (6) &#163;5 sterling if fourteen years and under nineteen years, and (c) nothing if under fourteen years of age. The difference between these rates and the amount charged by the shipping companies is met by the United Kingdom and Australian Governments. The actual amount paid by the governments varies on different ships inasmuch as the rates charged by the companies vary. 1 answered this question in this form because I did not desire to take up the time of the House by asking for leave to make a statement. </para>

            <para>- On previous occasions I have dealt with the matter of replies by Ministers to questions without notice. There was a growing practice - and I have to admit that it was a growing practice before this Government took office - of Ministers making lengthy replies to questions asked the previous day. In view of that growing practice, 1 ruled that a Minister, in order to reply to a question asked the previous day or some period before, would have to obtain the permission of the House. In my long experience of this Rouse, the practice has been for some honorable members to indicate to Ministers what they intended toask, and the Ministers would then give either a short or long reply. I do not think that there is anything to prevent an honorable member from doing that. In the Senate, it is the general custom to do so. It does not offend against any standing order. </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the statement in question; but it is true that, due to transport difficulties, and the fact that there has been a severe drought in New SouthWales, it has become necessary to reduce the hours that will be worked in many New South Wales flour mills. The Commonwealth Government is paying a subsidy of1s. 6d. a bushel in respect of all wheat shifted interstate to New South Wales in order to assist in keeping mills in that State running, even at reduced hours. I emphasize that Great Britain will not suffer as the result of the reduction of output referred to by the honorable member, because any wheat not shifted from Victoria for milling in New South Wales will be milled in Victoria, in which State there is sufficient capacity to process it. With regard to the latter part of the honorable member&#39;s question, some inquiries were made regarding the practicability of bringing wheat to New South Wales in hulks. The information conveyed to me on that subject was that it would not be a practical proposition. </para>

            <para>- In reply to the first part of the honorable member&#39;s question, which relates to permanent personnel of the Navy, a large number of applications have been received from men desirous of being released. Such of the applications as are based on compassionate grounds receive most sympathetic consideration. It will be appreciated, however, that the number of applications is so great that if all were granted the strength of the Navy would be very substantially depleted. By the end of this year the department expects to be in a position to indicate the possibilities of releasing those who are now seeking their discharge. As to the second part of the honorable member&#39;s question, as has already been indicated by the Minister for Defence, a statement will be made to the House in the near future indicating the post-war strength of the three service.?. </para>

However, I will with the Minister for Supply and Shipping examine the honorable gentleman&#39;s question to ascertain whether it is possible to supply him with a reasonably short answer that does not require too much - investigation. </para>

In the light of this situation,&#39; will the Minister for Commerce and .

This scheme, it was stated, called for the co-operation of graziers and stockowners. Will the Minister tell the House in what manner the co-operation of graziers and stock-owners is sought, and what is expected of them? He has refused to answer the question on each occasion on which it has been asked. </para>

On a. previous occasion, the nature of the answer that I -furnished to him was governed by my belief that he was fully aware of the scheme that had been propounded by the Australian Meat Board to assist Great Britain. The honorable gentleman knows full well that the graziers, backed by organizations of ex-servicemen in New South Wales, have, agreed to co-operate with the Australian Meat Board in a scheme whereby graziers may consign their stock to works indicated by the board, aud that stock is to be . earmarked specifically for consignment to Great Britain at the ruling export prices.

There is nothing to  hide about the activities of the board.

              <para>- I think the honorable member will realize that the conditions governing payments were agreed upon and incorporated in the act in the light of the experience gained in the payment of gratuity after World War I. I receive many requests for the early payment of gratuity, so that the money may be used for business purposes. We know that many returned soldiers from World War I. lost the whole of their gratuities by making bad business investments, and that is why the conditions have been made fairly strict now. However, I shall look into the matter, and discuss it with my colleagues in Cabinet. </para>

            <para>- I have moved the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, &#34; The extent to which the Commonwealth Literary Fund is being used to subsidize Communists and former Communists in the production of Australian literature&#34;. When I learned that the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> must have known the facts- regarding the career of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> at the time when he made an unwarranted attack on me, I asked myself why he was seeking to make such a diversion - why he was trying to draw a red herring across the trail. I asked myself whether this member of: the advisory co&#39;mmittee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund was trying to cover up something in connexion with its activities. Then, when the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> refused me the timehonoured right to make a personal explanation in reply to gross personal misrepresentation, I became convinced that there was something which the Government was trying to hide. I have always believed, and I still believe, that the Commonwealth Literary Fund is a good thing, but I was of the opinion that its function was to assist Australian authors of talent. I assumed that the controllers of the fund would inform themselves regarding the record and character of an author whom it was proposed to assist from a fund provided by the public, and particularly that they . would assure themselves that his work was free from bias. I believed that assistance would not bc given to men and women whose work was of an extreme character. Since the attack upon me by the honorable member for Parkes, I have examined the nature of the control of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, and I have learned that no safeguards exist to ensure an a bsence of bias in the work of those whom the fund is used to assist. The fund is not established by statute. It depends on an annual appropriation hy the Parliament. It seems to be somewhat like Melchizedec - it had neither father nor mother, and it has neither beginning nor end. There is an advisory committee which is supposed to. inquire into the qualifications of a candidate for assis tance, and to make recommendations to those .authorized to approve or disapprove the application. For the members of this board I have the greatest respect. They are the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and the Leader of the -Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> It- is as good a body. a.s could be appointed, but as its decisions depend largely upon the recommendations made to it by the advisory committee, it is imperative that those recommendations should be unbiased, and should state the facts of the case. What can happen under the present system has been. exemplified in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling,</inline> and it is evident that there is urgent need to overhaul the system. The honorable member for Parkes, who is a member of the&#39; advisory committee, is on the horns of a dilemma as the result of his attack on me the other day. Either he knew the history of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> at the time he advised the board regarding the making of a grant - in which case he was guilty of making a bad recommendation, and also of making a dishonest attack upon me - or he had not made full inquiries regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling,</inline> and had therefore been remiss in his duty. In either case he has shown himself to be unfit to be a member of the advisory committee. This incident emphasized the. need for a full inquiry into the work of the advisory committee. </para>

        <para class="block"> I conic now to the particular case under review. As an admirer of the poetry of Charles Harpur, I was interested in his biography. I knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cecil</inline> Salier and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Robinson,</inline> of the Queensland University, were recognized authorities on the life of Harpur, and had done years of study &#34;and much writing on his works. Therefore, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> was appointed by the advisory committee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund to write Harpur&#39;s biography, I made inquiries at the Mitchell Library for information regarding Rawling, so that I might learn why he had been chosen in preference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salier</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Robinson.</inline> The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Evatt)</inline> is, I believe,  president  of the Mitchell Library, so he is well aware that under the State law, this library receives  copies of all books published in New South Wales, and rarely misses buying those published in other States. It keeps an index of all articles, as well as of all books brought to it, on Australian subjects. In the Mitchell Library there is no evidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> ever wrote a single article on Charles Harpur. There is an extensive index in the library and it is the only place in Australia where a proper examination of Harpur&#39;s works can be made. I found that there was no record of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> ever having consulted the library officials in relation to Harpur&#39;s works. My inquiries there revealed that the only works written by Bawling were these: <inline font-style="italic">Hitler&#39;s Threat to Peace</inline> - a sixteen-page pamphlet printed ten years ago for the Friends of the Soviet Union, and the Front Against War and Fascism, a body with headquarters in Moscow. It was concerned more with opposing defence in Australia that with Hitler. <inline font-style="italic">Speakers&#39; Notes for the Communist Party</inline> (1938) <inline font-style="italic">on Conscription.</inline> This was printed by Forward Press, a printing business then owned by the Central Committee of the Communist party, through a nominee, and taken over in 1940 by the Government when the papers which it printed were suppressed. In this document it was suggested that there was no danger from Japan and that the real objective of those who demanded compulsory military training was to secure trained forces to aid the Imperialist aggressors of Britain to attack Russia. Another publication was <inline font-style="italic">Who Owns Australia?</inline> This was a 64-page pamphlet of Communist propaganda directed against big Australian concerns, particularly those such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which assisted the defence of Australia to a material degree. It was part of the propaganda by which the Communists sought before the war to assure that if a crisis came this country would be defenceless. It was published by Modern Publishers, the official Communist publishing house, and printed by the Forward Press, the Communist party&#39;s official printer. There was also <inline font-style="italic">A History of the Australian People,</inline> written from the Communist angle, and published in parts by Modern Publishers, an official Communist publishing house, and printed by Forward Press, the official Communist press. It consisted of a series of pamphlets, and carried on its covers advertisements for other Communist publications. It gave a Communist twist to the whole of our early history. In addition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> wrote various articles in the <inline font-style="italic">Communist Review,</inline> to which he was a regular contributor every month until just before it was suppressed in 1940. He seems to have been the originator of the idea which led to the Young Communist party changing its name to Eureka League of Youth. These works represent the whole literary output of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling,</inline> as recorded in the Mitchell Library.  His  qualifications as an interpreter of the life of an Australian poet are entirely negative, since, for twenty years, he has been steeped in the viewpoint of Russian Communism. &#39; </para>
        <para>On the 26th March, 1947,I accordingly asked the Prime Minister a series of questions. I ask honorable members to note carefully their wording, because they constitute a. contradiction of everything that has been said about me in regard to this matter. The questions were - </para>

          <para>As to my qualifications to write a life of Charles Harpur - they are these: I specialized in history for my B.A. at Sydney University; I gained my M.A. in Australian history for a <inline font-style="italic">Life ofD.H.

        <para class="block">In view of the appeal in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> letter to the Prime Minister, I replied thanking him for his courtesy in sending me the letter and was prepared to let the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> past communistic activities drop, as the statement referred simply to the present position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> indicating that he was not now a member of the Communist party.

        <para class="block">I made no insinuations. I asked several questions. Let us look at my questions and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> letter and record.

I asked was he the chief publicity officer of the Communist party for some years, who- wrote the Communist party&#39;s official history of Australia, which was published by the official Communist publishing house. If he was not the chief, he was the most prominent publicity officer of that party.  His  history of Australia has a definite Communist twist, and was published by the official Communist publishing house. How then, if I ask a question which is substantially true, am I assassinating any man&#39;s character? And, how can I be making &#34;vicious misstatements made on hearsay &#34; when I am quoting the official records of the Mitchell Library, which are substantiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> letter? Those records and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> letter prove the substance of my statement. The honorable member for Parkes accused me of &#34; assassination of character &#34; and &#34; vicious misstatements made on hearsay&#34;. As they are statements of fact, how then can he justify the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> to this fellowship if he holds these views on communism? <inline font-style="italic">\ Extension of time granted.&#39;&#93;</inline></para>
        <para>Why, also, in view of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> expressed wish that the matter should be left in abeyance, and my willingness to do  30  after the pathetic appeal by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> in his letter to the Prime Minister, does the honorable member drag this matter up, in my absence from the House, two days before the elections in Kew South &#34;Wales and&#39; Queensland? </para>
        <para>Whatever I say inside this chamber I am prepared to say outside. I am willing to say outside this chamber what I said about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling.</inline> But I dare the honorable member for Parkes to repeat out side what he said about me. . I would issue a writ for defamation within five minutes of his doing so. </para>
        <para>This narrative proves that, first of all, the Prime Minister has not answered my questions. He has answered questions of his own as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> is, or is not, a member of the Communist party. He does not admit publicly what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> has told him - that he was the publicity officer of the Communist party and subsequently saw the error of his ways. The Prime - Minister says nothing about the qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> as compared with those of men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> W. Salier, or <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Robinson.</inline> But the establishment of my bona fides is a small matter beside the policy of the advisory committee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund as to the conditions on which, and to whom, fellowships should be bestowed. This may be important for the future of Australia. Communism is now seen by every thoughtful person of all parties as the cancerous growth that is destroying our industrial life, impeding our production in Australian and doing its utmost to destroy the British Empire. No public funds should be spent that could even be suspected of fostering subtle sources of Communist propaganda. If, however, the past records of all aspirants for Commonwealth Literary Fund Fellowships are treated in this light fashion - as in this case where the facts are beyond dispute and have been brought to light merely by chance - it is evident that a full inquiry and overhaul of the whole system of awarding such fellowships should be made to prevent a repetition. &#39; </para>

          <para>. -  The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> suggested that the origin of the Commonwealth Literary Fund is uncertain, but it was established in 190S by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and has been continued ever since. In 1939, when the  grant was only &#163;400 a year,  the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> suggested a further development of Australian literature and a means by which Australian authors should be encouraged. The Prime Minister at that  time was the lateMr. Lyons, who readily acceded to the proposal, and a committee was established, consisting of himself, the then Leader of the Opposition, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> and the right honorable member for Yarra, who made the suggestion in the House. The scheme has continued in its present form since then. I shall refer in a moment to the character of the work done by the Commonwealth Literary Fund. In my opinion, its achievements represent a great contribution to the encouragement of Australian letters. The record of the fellowships granted is excellent. I will deal separately with the one referred to by the right honorable member for Cowper. The right honorable member ought to know the facts, because, afterthe right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> succeeded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> as Prime Minister in 1939, he wrote to the right honorable member for, Cowper, who was then Leader of the Australian Country party, pointing out that up till that time the Australian. Country party had not functioned independently of the United Australia party, and inviting him to nominate a representative of the Australian Country party to serve on the committee.I have read the letter. Apparently nothing was done to comply with that request. The fellowship granted number no fewer than 33. and only one has been criticized by the right honorable member for Cowper. </para>

        <para class="block">These books cover a wide field. None of them deals with politics or political propaganda of any kind, except, perhaps, the biography of statesmen in the early days of federation. They are literary in character, and cover all phases of literary activity. I had supposed, and until to-day it had been thought, that all parties were in favour of this plan, and were carrying it out for the encouragement of Australian authors. </para>
        <para>I desire now to deal with the references to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling.</inline> The right honorable member for Cowper stated accurately the question which he had asked in the House, namely, was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> a publicity officer of, or was he otherwise associated with the Communist party? The fact is that he had been associated with it. There is no question of that. But the manner of his leaving the Communist party was a matter of such public, notoriety during the early stages of the war - in 1940, to be exact - that the slightest inquiry would have revealed to the right honorable gentleman the fact that, at or about that time Soviet Russia attacked Finland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> broke with the Communist party. From that time to the present day he has been one of its most bitter critics. I believe that it is fair to say that the Communist party would regard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> as its No. 1 enemy. </para>

            <para>- It is what he says now. In 1940 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> made a broadcast over the national stations giving the reasons why he considered that he should dissociate himself from the Communist party and its war policy. Ever since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> has been an active opponent of the Communist party. The omission of that fact from the right honorable gentleman&#39;s question was calculated to cause very  grave injury to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling,</inline> who served in World War I. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">In his letter to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Chifley),  he stated that he had been sympathetic with the experiment of Soviet Russia, had joined the Communist party and had been active in it. All that is correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> also wrote certain material to which the right honorable gentleman has referred. Then, in May, 1940, he made a complete break with the Communist party, not privately or by resigning from it, but as the result of an open public controversy in which his articles appeared in leading metropolitan newspapers, probably throughout Australia and certainly in New South Wales. That raises the very important question which, after all, is the only point that does arise from the subject associated with the motion submitted by the right honorable member for Cowper. Should the fact that a person has strong political views, and has been a member of the Communist party, act as a perpetual bar against his being qualified to write on some aspect of Australian literature and history? </para>

              <para>- The contention which the right honorable member for Cowper submitted is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> should be disqualified. If no other authors are available, and he is chosen, the same result is reached. The object of Commonwealth assistance to Australian authors is not to encourage political propaganda, but to foster good literature, and reward literary .merit. If the House agrees that that is the object of the fund, I contend that. the political views of the author do not and should not enter into the matter. Imagine what kind of a standard would have to apply if, in determining whether the fund should assist authors in Australia, we were obliged to make a preliminary investigation of the political views, past and present, of every candidate! Apply that to what is the chief glory of Eng land - that is its literature ! Let us look back at the history of English literature, and at the great procession of poets and authors who have made the name of English literature famous  throughout the world, and apply a political test to them! The right honorable gentleman is carrying this matter further than I have ever heard it carried before. The book which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> is to write is not a Communist publication, and will not have a seditious or subversive tendency. The man who is writing it has chosen a literary subject, namely, the life of the Australian-born poet, Charles Harpur. Is this author to he excluded from competing for a fellowship on such .a subject? The right honorable gentleman&#39;s contention cannot be accepted as a principle. It is completely wrong. One has only to refer to great names in English literature - Shelley, Byron, Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, Robert Burns, the great Scottish poet, and William Blake, and ask oneself, &#34; If a literary fund had been in existence in their day how would they have scaled the first barrier?&#34; These great men of genius, whom every body acknowledges to-day, wrote in the early portion of their careers under the influence of the &#39;French Revolution, and were somewhat sympathetic towards it. Wordsworth and Southey later became Poet Laureates of Britain. </para>

          <para>We cannot apply this rule of exclusionto people simply as persons. Yet that is what the right honorable member for Cowper is attempting to do. He admitted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> is not writing on the subject of communism, or present&#39; political trends. There is nothing political in the biography of Charles Harpur. Why, then, should <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> be disqualified? If literary merit is to be encouraged, it should be encouraged as literature and not as propaganda. Political opinions have nothing to do with the matter. It would be different if we &#34;were considering a political work. That might be a relevant factor. When he makes, as a test of literary merit, conformity to political or social stand-points the right honorable gentleman is adopting the policy of the Hitler regime. That was the approach of the Nazi propagandists to this problem. On the 10th </para>
          <para>May, 1933, the Nazis decided to show that a new regime had been introduced into Germany under Hitler and Goebbels. The occasion was celebrated by the burning of the books of 160 authors. The subject matter of the books did not mat&#39;.er; the Nazis who burnt them had probably never read any of them. But the books had been written by people who, as persons, were regarded as antipathetic to the Nazi regime. They included some of the greatest German poets, such as Heine, and their works were burnt in a bonfire. One commentator wrote at the time - &#62; </para>
          <para>And as the ingenious ceremonies wore on hour after hour, before a crowd of fortythousand celebrants, the world outside may well have sensed that a new spirit, and a new agc, had begun for Germany, an age of Brown Darkness ... </para>
          <para class="block">The .request for information by the right honorable, member has nothing whatever to do with this point. The fund is of a non-party character. If the political views of candidates are to be considered in relation to authorship, we shall have a new form of censorship which would be as intolerable as any the world has ever known. The works in the list to which I have referred include biographies of the Australian writers by Tom Collins, works by Ernestine Hill, Marjorie Clark, Marjorie Barnard and others. The new rule suggested by the right honorable member for Cowper, to the effect that the personal political opinions of applicants should be taken into account when considering the granting of fellowships, and not their purely literary work, would be so intolerable that I cannot believe that the right honorable gentleman himself would wish to see it applied. </para>

              <para>- It is obvious that the right honorable member has changed his ground. The point now being advanced is not the issue that was raised between the right honorable member and the honorable member for Parkes. It was alleged, first, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> was a Communist, had engaged in Communist propaganda, and had written Communist articles, and that, therefore, he was debarred from writing a work of any value to Australia. I suggest to the House that there is no substance in that contention. If honorable members will examine the records of the authors and poets, of this country they will discover that very few of them could successfully withstand the application of such a test: Henry Lawson was associated with Australian workers and Australian unions in his early life and he wrote for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Worker.</inline> Practically all the early poets who contributed to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> had strong radical tendencies, and some of them were even republican in their outlook at certain stages. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Balaclava shows, by his interjection, his incapacity for analysis. The point is whether a man&#39;s political views shall, or shall not, be taken into consideration, and in certain circumstances be regarded as disqualification for writing on literary subjects insofar as&#39; the Commonwealth Literary Fund is concerned. The answer to that proposal must surely be clear&#39; to everybody. No one could really justify such a rule. A perusal. by honorable members of the list of fellowships that have been granted, and of the books and authors in respect cf which help has been given will reveal that a very good job has been done.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ARCHIE</inline>CAMERON (Barker) | 3. 55&#93;. - I was deeply interested in the reply of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to the concise and incontrovertible statements of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> The Attorney-General has travelled all round the question. He reminded me of a late member of the South Australian Parliament, who said of a fellow Irishman. &#34; The honorable member talked ali round the truth for an hour and a half and did not touch it once &#34;. That is the position in which the Attorney-General  finds himself. One objection that honorable members pf the Opposition have to the present method of administering the Commonwealth Literary Fund, is that it seems to provide a nursing home for Communists. Unless a man is &#34;red or pretty pink &#34;, he has not much chance of favorable consideration. I am not altogether unaware of what has been going on in connexion with this fund for some time past. I asked a question about it as long ago as the 26th March, 1946. In my view we have reached a stage in the history of the fund when there should be a public showdown, so that we may know exactly what is going on. There certainly has been a change lately in the advisory committee &#39; of the fund. I understand that the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> is a comparatively recent addition to the committee. If the views that that, honorable gentleman expresses in this House - I do not know anything about his literary qualifications - be taken as a criterion, I should say that there will be a confirmation of the policy that, only the &#34;reds and pinks will get a go &#34;. This fund is not being used to-day for the purpose for which the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> worked in 1939 when that right honorable gentleman took a_ very important part in its development and administration. The fund is undoubtedly being used to-day for other than its original purpose. I know of persons receiving grants from the fund in relation to the publishing of books which have consisted, in the main, of reprinted articles which were published, in the press in Sydney years ago and paid for. I ask the Attorney-General whether it is not a fact that the purpose of the fund is to encourage people to write original  matter, particularly on Australian subjects. Does the AttorneyGeneral consider that the giving of fellowships is justified when the books produced consist chiefly of reprinted articles which were published and paid for years ago? </para>

            <para>- I can do so, but T will not do it publicly at this stage. I asked a question, upon &#39; notice, in the House quite a long time ago, about a well-known person named Jean Devaney. I do not think that it will be denied that she was a member of the Communist party. Yet, in the height of the war, when members of this Parliament could not enter certain areas in Queensland, because they were defence areas, this woman was given a fellowship and permitted to enter those areas, where some of the most secret of our  defence measures were being applied, allegedly for the purpose of writing a book on how people reacted under wartime conditions. The Attorney-General knows how they reacted in the electoral Division qf Capricornia, for that was disclosed at the last general elections. </para>

              <para>- I should expect it to be. There is another case that I could go into, but I will not do so now. The state of affairs which has been reached in connexion with the Commonwealth Literary Fund is such that there should be a public inquiry at which people would be obliged to give evidenceupon oath, and would be protected in regard to their evidence. Nothing else will satisfy me. The machinations of someof those who have been helped by this fund should be brought&#39; to light. I have been dealing with this matter behind the scenes at least since March, 1946. </para>

          <para class="block">I am not interested in .the case of Rawling. &#39; If this man has &#34; seen the light &#39;&#39;, as the Attorney-General has suggested, there has been a lapse of seven years in which he has not produced one pamphlet to put in the Mitchell Library in contradiction of the stuff that he wrote previously. When a man finds that he has been following a wrong principle for a number of years and has been politically converted, one naturally expects that, having &#34; seen the light &#34;, he will be prepared to give his testimony in writing, and let it go . oil record alongside the misleading statements which he formerly made. This man has not done that. His good faith can be tested by his failure to do so. The AttorneyGeneral has asked whether the political views of an author should be taken into consideration. The Australian taxpayer has a very strong objection to providing money for the subsidizing of communism. &#91; contend that the views of a man who. writes a story on the life of Charles Harpur or anybody else will be coloured by whether he is a Communist or a tory, or has any other background. The Attorney-General has written a work entitled <inline font-style="italic">Labour Leader.</inline> He gave me a copy of it, for which I thank him. Can it be said that the right honorable gentleman would have described the life of Holman in the terms that he has used in that work had he not been a Labour man? Would the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> or the honorable member for Kew England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> take the same view- of Holman&#39;s life as has been taken by the Attorney-General? Would the honorable, member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> or the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann),</inline> if they became authors and wrote <inline font-style="italic">The History of the Bum Rebellion,</inline> adopt the same attitude towards it as has been adopted by the Attorney-General ? It has been proved up to the hilt that immediately a man becomes an author his views of another man, whether that man bc associated with literature, politics; science, industry or anything else, are coloured by that man&#39;s political outlook. My objection is, that the Commonwealth Literary Fund is being used in too many instances by men who, if not -ed or pink, aire at any rate &#34; fellow travellers &#34;. </para>

          <para>Something has been said during the debate about the burning of books. I believe that the Attorney-General referred! to that matter. There have been notorious instances of the burning of books.&#39; Adolf Hitler did not start the practice. The Attorney-General is sufficiently an historian to know that a good part of the great library of Alexandria was burned by Julius Caesar, and the rest of it by the first Mohammedan conqueror, who took the view - a very political view - that if anything in -the Alexandria Library was in conflict with the <inline font-style="italic">Koran</inline> it was dangerous, and if any of it was in agreement with the <inline font-style="italic">Koran</inline> it was superfluous. On that point, I am giving to the Attorney-General a first-class cue as to the line that should be taken when it comes to an argument concerning dominion governors : There is no view except that of the man in authority. </para>
          <para>I close on this note : Any man can take a part in the writing of articles. He can be a litterateur. He can write a play on&#39; Eureka, or a work on the life of Charles Harpur;. but if his political views are such as have been disclosed today by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> - and disclosed under pressure, I may state - then that man has to remember what Longfellow wrote about &#34;footprints on the sands of time&#34;. Also, he has to remove those footprints, those stains, by proving his loyalty to the new cause which he has taken up. In this instance, such proof has not been furnished. </para>

              <para>- This sudden concern of members of the Australian Country party for Australian literature, is amazing. According to the statement of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who is a literary figure in this country and a man of unimpeachable veracity, the Australian Country party was invited to assist us to build up an Australian literature. The then Prime Minister appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Thorby.</inline> I should not suggest that that gentleman had a very true appreciation of literature. He attended one meeting of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, but in the last eight years no member of the Australian Country party has attended the meetings. </para>

          <para>The statements of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> were too bucolic for me quite fully to grasp. By some devious means he is attempting to destroy that which we have built up tortuously - an appreciation of Australian literature, and encouragement of Australian writers. I could have understood his enthusiasm had the subject under discussion been the payment of a subsidy on the production of butter fat, I doubt whether he has read&#39; anything except the results of butter fat tests in the Grafton <inline font-style="italic">Examiner,</inline> or his own speeches in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline> Yet he puts himself forward as a literary authority! I want to &#34; test the credibility of the witness &#34; in regard to Australian literature. After eight years of abstention by himself and his party from any attempt to assist Australian literature, he has made a statement in this House about an author and has asked a question concerning that man&#39;s political beliefs. Although he claimed that what I had done was scandalous, I stand by it, because the whole of the Atlantic Charter, including the four freedoms, has been built round the right of freedom &#39;of expression. This author has an expression to make, and he is entitled to make it. The discussion must not be dragged down to the cow-yard level. If the right honorable member for Cowper had been honest, he would not have waited for a radio audience before which to make his answer. Yesterday, I asked him to speak on the- motion for the adjournment of the House. Although I told the Whip of his party that I intended to mention the matter in the course of my remarks in another debate, he deferred his reply until he had a radio audience. That is characteristic of the sanctimonious humbug and hypocrisy with which he decks nearly every statement that he makes in this House. The classical example is his contributions to the subject of food for Britain. This man, who is known as &#34; the tragic Treasurer &#34;, could not, while Treasurer, cause two and two to make four; yet, when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> had announced to his Cabinet the proposal to make a gift of &#163;25,000,000 to Great Britain, he quickly added that up, and made a story of it to suit himself politically, and brought the matter into the field of party politics. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General has established that the man whose name has been mentioned, although a former Communist, has not for some years written a Communist tract. The right honorable gentleman has also established that the list of persons who have been awarded fellowships by the Commonwealth Literary Fund contains the names of many famous Australians, and that there has not been one attempt at political propaganda in the books published as a result of the fellowships granted by that fund. The . right honorable member for Cowper paid a great tribute to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> and deservedly so; but he then commenced to cast slurs on and to smear the members of the advisory committee - an old Communist trick. Leaving me out of account, because I am a political opponent of his, let us have a look at the personnel associated with the fund. Would the right honorable gentleman suggest that Professor Osborne, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, is a Communist, that he is interested in the production of Communist tracts, and to that end is using funds of the Commonwealth Government? Would he suggest that the Librarian of the National Library, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Binns,</inline> is a Communist? Would be suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mackaness,</inline> of Sydney, who I am sure would not mind being called a tory, would be a Communist, and would spend the whole of his time and voluntary effort in encouraging the writing of Communist tracts? The idea is ridiculous. The germ of it, of course, is not to be found in any of the statements of the right honorable member, but must be sought outside this House. Surely members of the Opposition, including members of the Australian Country party, will not accept the proposition that there should be political censorship of any literary fund. That would be intolerable and impossible. The. AttorneyGeneral has shown why the Commonwealth Literary Fund has had to be free and unencumbered. It would be a shocking thing if a gestapo were to be employed against the writers of this country, because some members, of the Australian Country party are timid of the prospects of holding their seats in the future and seek a little brief publicity at the moment. The criticism that has been launched on this occasion cannot be sustained, for the reason that the Commonwealth Literary Fund could not exist if a censorship were imposed on the politics of the men concerned. By reason of the intelligence of the advisory committee, and later the revision of the literary committee, some consideration can be given to the subjects discussed, and it has been .the law that politics cannot enter into any serious writing by persons who receive fellowships. But the real story, if it must be told, is that a disgruntled man outside this House has related in strong terms to the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> and the new recruit, the right honorable member for Cowper, the story of his disappointment in failing to secure a fellowship himself. On every occasion on which the literary committee has made an appointment, he has come forward with a fresh lie. We have had to stand up to a vendetta by this man Ellis and his employer, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> who are haters of Labour and of the Communists. </para>

              <para>- In deference to the honorable member who interjected, I may say that I did not properly hear what he said. Half a dozen stories have been written about the life of Macquarie. I understand that the man whose name I have mentioned wrote a story which was rejected by _ the Commonwealth Literary Fund. I apologize for having contradicted the honorable member. I merely &#39; wanted to brush his remarks aside, because I have so few minutes in which to make my speech. The whole of this sordid brawl has been occasioned by the right honorable member for Cowper, upon <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> information tendered outside this House by a disgruntled man. The Commonwealth Literary Fund, and the small part that I have played in it during the last few years, will stand the closest investigation. Before I conclude, I warn the House that if it wants to destroy Australian literature, if it wants to remove all liberties from this country, as well as a growing appreciation of what this land stands for and what makes it live, that object can be achieved by imposing a censorship which will destroy all  that we have tried to build up in 150 hard, brutal years, by putting policemen in charge of those who select our literature. A final word: The AttorneyGeneral has said that it was on the 10th May of a certain year that books were burned by Hitler. . To-day is the 8th May. The Australian Country party has two days in which to complete the task that it has begun. </para>

              <para>- The honorable, member for Parkes must accept some responsibility for a Communist receiving a fellowship from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. I make no charge against the literary committee of the fund, which consists of the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> whose integrity is beyond question, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> but I point out that the literary committee merely adjudicates upon the claims submitted to it by the Advisory Committee, of which the honorable member for Parkesis a member. It is obvious that the Prime Minister, for instance, has not the tune to read all the works published in Australia in the course of a year. For guidance in this direction he must rely upon the members of the advisory committee, and the member for Parkes, a member of that committee, digs up as an applicant for a fellowship some one with a Communist background. I had never heard of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> until this incident occurred, and it is unfortunate that he should receive such publicity now if it is true that he has recanted his Communist views. However, the whole incident was created by the attempt of the honorable member for Parkes to make political capital at the expense of the right honorable member for Cowper. </para>

              <para>- It is all Communist propaganda. If we are to judge a person&#39;s qualifications and sincerity, or to decide whether or not he is biased, we can only go back to what he has written or said. If he has not repudiated the opinions expressed in his writings or utterances, we must assume that he still holds those opinions. In a letter referred to by&#39; the right honorable member for Cowper, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> has stated, I understand&#34;, that he no longer holds Communist views. If that is so, good luck to bini, but the mere fact that he has recanted his Communist ideas does not of itself qualify him to write the life of Charles Harpur, or to receive a fellowship worth &#163;400 from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. It is unfortunate that the matter should have been raised in this way, and that the history of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling,</inline> if he is no longer a Communist, should bc made the subject of debate in this chamber. However, as I have said, the responsibility for this lies on the honorable member for Parkes, who sought to take advantage, of the absence of the right honorable member for Cowper to score a political point. I hope that the information which the right honorable member for Cowper has placed before the House will be taken into account by the members of the literary committee. I believe, as I think does every honorable member on this side of the House, .that the Commonwealth Literary Fund is an excellent institution. There is a long list of persons of merit who have been assisted from the fund. There may be some who received assistance without meriting it, but it is notable that the only case upon which doubts have been cast has occurred since the honorable member for Parkes became a member of the advisory committee. When the .honorable member for Parkes talks about the cowyards and the Aus- tralian Country party he had better look to himself. </para>

            <para>.  -  I think it is necessary that I, as  chairman  of the literary committee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, should say something about this matter. The committee consists of the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and myself, as  chairman.  I always believed that the Commonwealth Literary Fund had been created - not by this Government, but by a previous one - for the purpose of assisting in the development of Australian literature, and to render financial assistance to those who might have the ability to produce worthwhile literature. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> said that the real question to be decided was the capacity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling.</inline> As a matter of fact, the original question asked by thu right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> had nothing to do with the literary capacity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling.</inline> It was the right honorable member who introduced politics by referring to communism. </para>

          <para>Mp. CHIFLEY.- There is no doubt that it was the right honorable member himself who raised the issue of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> political beliefs. I am sure that the right honorable member for Yarra and the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me when I say that the literary committee takes full responsibility for the awarding of fellowships, no matter what recommendations may have been made by the advisory committee. As a matter of fact, many applications and recommendations have been rejected. Our decisions are made, rightly or wrongly, according to what we believe to be the literary capacity of the applicant. If the literary committee is to turn itself into a gestapo to inquire into the political history of every applicant for a grant, the sooner the committee is abolished the better. Having regard to the diverse political views of the members of the committee, it would be absurd to suggest that it should concern itself with die political views of applicants rather than their literary ability. I go further than did the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> : If the committee is to continue - and I hope it will, because it has been of considerable value - I will never be a party to the proposition that when an application or recommendation comes before the com mi tree, it should dredge thoi sewers to find out the political views of the person concerned. </para>

              <para>- I do not care how extreme it may be. The purpose of the committee is to assist the development of Australian literature, not to turn themselves into policemen in an effort to find nut the political views of writers. I lay down two rules which I suggest the committee should follow in considering applications for assistance from the Commonwealth Literary Fund : First, that; applicant* shall have a literary capacity to warrant the granting of assistance; and secondly, that when assistance is given, tin.! recipient shall not use the money i;o engage in political propaganda on behalf of any party, whether it, be the Labour party the Australian Country party, the Liberal, party or the Communist party. When the present Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister he issued an invitation to the Australian Country party to nominate a representative for appointment to the committee; but so great was the interest of that party that its representative attended only one meeting. Since then the Australian Country party has not taken the slightest interest in the committee. </para>

The Attorney-General has a copy of it and if the right honorable member so desires he may read it. I shall not go into the question as to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> is, or was. I have stated the two principles which guide the com mittee. If they were departed from there would be set up immediately a sort of political gestapo which would concern itself more with the political philosophies of writers than with their literary capacity. . I do not propose to depart from these principles and if they &#39;were departed from I would disband the committee at once. </para>

            <para>.- I rise principally to endorse what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has said in. connexion with this matter. As a member of the committee I take my share -of responsibility for its actions. Whilst 1 appreciate the personal references made to the members of the committee, I am not prepared to allow it to be said that we had no rights, that the committee merely did what it was told and accepted the recommendations of the advisory committee without question. Anybody who says that knows nothing whatever about the workings of the committee which has been in existence for eight years. The advisory committee is composed of literary men who inquire into the merits of the work of those who seek assistance from the fund. The advisory committee sends its recommendation, together with all appropriate information, to the literary committee for consideration. The committee examines the recommendation and the facts surrounding the application, and decides either to accept or reject the recommendation. It is true that we have accepted the majority of the recommendations of the advisory committee; but it is also true that we have rejected a good many of them. Sometimes the members of the advisory committee feel somewhat hurt by our rejections,  but we have our own reasons for our decisions. The  literary committee is composed not merely of three busy parliamentarians who. meet and say, &#34; We shall endorse this or tha t recommendation &#34; ; on the contrary the committee goes into the matter very thoroughly. To the two busy men on the committee, the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> who have greater responsibilities to the Parliament than I have as a private member, I pay tribute for the time and attention and earnest consideration they have given to the matters placed before them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I regret that the Commonwealth Literary Fund anil die committee that administers it should he dragged into a political fight in this .Parliament. I joined the committee, as the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has said, eight years ago, after I hail resigned as Leader of the Opposition because, of ill health  and was no longer able to take an active part in the hurly-burly of politics. 1 felt  then  that I owed a public duty to the people T. represented and to the Australian people generally,- and 1 raised in this House a matter that had troubled  my  mind for many years., namely, that year after year we were accustomed to vote millions of pounds for the assistance of industry of all kinds, primary producers, manufacturers and others, by way of subsidies and payments of various kinds, but we entirely neglected one body of people in the community which was making a contribution to our national life and literature. I agree that some journals were giving assistance to men of letters, notably the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> which did more for Australian writers than any other publication, particularly in earlier years. That journal had provided opportunities for literary mcn, particularly in the early days of its publication, which was of the greatest national value, but the need for assistance to Australian writers was completely ignored by the Australian Parliament. If I had thought that because of my association with the committee I would have been dragged into a party political fight or accused of sponsoring communism I would have ceased to be a member of the committee immediately and the other members would have done likewise. Can one imagine the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or me sponsoring and subsidizing the propaganda of com mun ism, and using the Commonwealth Literary Fund to foster the breeding grounds of Communist propaganda? Does not that stretch the imagination too far? Since the fund was established it has granted 33 fellowships, and it has been responsible for the printing of a number of manuscripts which otherwise would never have seen the light of day. Some of them, I am glad to say, have not only been published but have also paid the costs of publication out of sales. </para>
          <para class="block">Most of these were of a. kind which ordinary commercial publishers would not touch. About, S6 of these publications have been .sponsored by the fund and this is the first occasion on which criticism of the kind voiced by the right honorable,  member  for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle</inline> Page)  has been levelled at. the fund. Suppose thai, everything thai: has  been  said about this case is correct. The committee is not infallible; it is capable of making mistakes. Why besmirch the fund and the great ideal.* that lie behind it by dragging them into a party political fight? I endorse what the Prime Minister has said, and I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will do likewise, and say that never once have we asked what were the politics of any person whose work was submitted to us. All we were concerned about, was the subject of the work and the way in which it was treated. I have not seen in any of the publications that, we have sponsored one line of political propaganda. I do not claim to have rend every line of every work submitted for our consideration, but I have read a great deal; I have burned the midnight oil in going through them. I would not. think of saying that an applicant for a fellowship should hold the same political opinions as I do. One has only to look at the list of fellowships granted to see that this fund has not been used as the nursery of Communist ideas. I implore honorable members to look at the list. Here are a few names that, appear on it,: <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Ernestine</inline> Hill, for the completion of her&#39; work <inline font-style="italic">Matthew Flinders - Lover;</inline> E.

          <para>As to the specific case mentioned by the right honorable member for Cowper, I admit that I knew nothing about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> private politics. I would not question them. I have sp vivid a recollection of the persecution of Labourites in days gone by, of men. who were not allowed to work m the mines because they had accepted office in the Labour party, of the injustices meted out by politically biased persons, that I would not think of asking about the political convictions of any person who sought assistance from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. <inline font-style="italic">| Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline> I have since had inquiries made in order to ascertain how far these attacks upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> are warranted. It is true that he was a. Communist.; but he has re.pented of his ways and has- become a strong critic of the Communist party. The fact that he has not written books, since he. ceased to be a Communist sup.* porter does not prove that, his political convictions have not changed. I believe that for some years he has been employed as a teacher. He went into the1 Army at eighteen years of age and served with distinction in World War I, He became a Communist after his- return toAustralia, but now he is listed, ,as he says, as the Communist&#39;s enemy No.  1.  As far as his personal character is concerned, we have before us a document showing that his application for a fellowship was sponsored by the well-known and reputable, headmaster of one of our greatpublic schools in Sydney. I believe it was Newington-. I would havenothing to do with sponsoring communism; nor .would I be associated with a political censorship of literary works. I would not be a member of the committee if I had to ask an applicant for assistance from the fund, &#34; How did you vote at the last, elections ? &#34; Does any honorable member imagine that any member of a committee, which consists of members of differing political views, would do such a thing? In the years during which I have been a in em ber of the committee I have never had a difference of opinion with the Leader of the Opposition on any question raised or any recommendation submitted for the consideration of the committee. , . </para>

              <para>- The procedure is simple. The committee has literary men to advise it. They are well known in literature. They read the manuscripts and give us all the particulars. Sometimes members of the committee re-read manuscripts. I have often presumed to re-read a manuscript. We all do it where there is a doubt. The manuscripts are passed around the members in order that they may read them and decide whether to endorse the recommendations of our advisers. I do not claim that we set ourselves up as greater literary students than they are. I take my share of responsibility for our decisions, but would lake no responsibility for examining the political opinions of nien whose literary work comes before us. It is a poor outlook if it is claimed that a man who has committed an offence, even though he has repented, shall not be forgiven. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> is the only man whose fellowship has been attacked. The honorable member . for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> made a few points about other things, but he cannot set himself up as the last word on literature. It cannot be said that the experts who advise us have no literary knowledge. If any member of the Australian Country party feels that his presence on the committee would improve it and the work it does, I shall be glad to have him join us, but I decline to agree that the committee must examine a man&#39;s political conscience before deciding that lie be granted a fellowship. When I proposed the present system I had in mind a number of Australian writers who had not been given the opportunity to develop their talents. I pointed out that when they were worn out as writers and no longer capable of giving of their best they were pensioned, but that when they were young and vigorous and capable of fine work, given the opportunity, they were made to fend for themselves. One man among many I had in mind was working on jobs in the bush and in brickyards and was going blind. He was writing beautiful Australian po? try. Given financial relief and encouragement, our writers&#39; will rise to greater heights and Australia will produce literature equal to any in the world. </para>

As Leader of the Australian Country party, I make it. clear that never to my knowledge has :my party been invited <inline font-style="italic">*,o</inline> he represented on the advisory committee.

              <para>- In view of the political set-up, I am surprised that we have not been invited, and I protest against the discourtesy to us by our not having been asked to help. This is not a statutory committee. I emphasize that. It is appointed annually. But not once since 1939 until now has the Australian Country party been invited to be represented on it. I direct attention to the manner in which we have been ignored in many other ways. Honorable members may rest assured that we shall exert pressure to ensure against a repetition of  such treatment of an important section of the Commonwealth Parliament. It is  it  lasting disgrace that the Australian Country party has not been invited to be  represented on the committee, and I deeply resent our having been accused of not ha ving any interest in the committee. </para>

          <para>The right honorable member for Yarra, exercising his shrewdness and groat ability in debate, sought to distract honorable members from the main issue. The right honorable member for Cowper was reluctantly compelled to take the action ho took to reply &#39; to accusations made against him in his absence by tha honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
          <para> Haylen). The weight of numbers on the Government side was exerted on Tuesday to prevent the right honorable gentleman from making a personal explanation about thi? matter when he asked the indulgence of the House- to do so. The main issue is .whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> is a fit and proper person to writ&#34; the biography of the first Australian poet, Charles Harpur. . The right honorable member for Cowper based his ease on the merits or demerits of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> compared with those of other available authorities, who, he said, were more qualified to write a proper&#39; biography of Ha.ri,ur. The only  authentic records of Harpur&#39;s life are filed and indexed at the Mitchell Library. Not one article, let alone one book, has been written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> on the life and work of Harpur. That is verifiable at the Mitchell Library. It has no record of any request made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> to examine the material on Hari,lir that it has available. The Mitchell Library maintains a record of every borrower and the books he reads, and the officials have never heard of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> as an authority on Harpur. The Attorney-General is  chairman  of (he Mitchell Library Trust, and he shouldask the librarian what requests he has received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> for access to the Harpur records. No research into Harpur&#39;s life could be undertaken except at the Mitchell Library, for there is no other source of information. No evidence exists that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling,</inline> who has been preferred to other authorities, has ever interested himself in the authentic information that must he used to write Harpur&#39;s biography. The right honorable member for Cowper has made out an unanswerable case. Efforts made to counter it provide sufficient evidence, if evidence should lie needed, of the desirability of bringing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s.</inline> fellowship into the light of day in order that the taxpayers may know what is being done with their money. </para>

              <para>- The statement made was that before the war there was no evidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> could write. I bought a book written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> that appeared in instalments called, <inline font-style="italic">A Short History of the Australian People</inline> It contains some original research on early exploration, as is shown by the marginalia and the bibliography. I can honestly say, from considerable reading of history, that I have never read a better account of the work of .Dampier than that written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling,</inline> in matter, interpretation, and literary style. Therefore,&#34; to .assort, without a. tittle of evidence, ae the honorable member for Richmond did. that there is no evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawlins&#39;s</inline> literary merit is to assert something totally untrue. Apart from whether he was, or was not, a Communist, or whether any one else, who has been given a fellowship, is or is not a Communist, there is another question. It concerns civil liberties. No one knows who speaks for the Liberal party, because the tune sung by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> is entirely different from that of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> and I am glad to see the honorable member for Barker nodding agreement. The Leader of the Opposition made a clear statement after the last general elections that the policy of the Liberal party was not to ban the Communist party but to prosecute it for any overt or illegal act done by it. It would not ban the Communist party on political philosophy as such. Therefore the policy of the Liberal party is to recognize the Communist party as a legal party. On what grounds, then, would the Liberal party exclude Communists from receiving fellowships from the Commonwealth Literary Fund? Obviously, if it made the Communist party illegal, it would have the right to exclude Communists. The policy of the Australian Country party is at least consistent. It declares that it will ban the Communist party; hence, its objection to Communist authors or those accused of being Communists, &#39; is coherent and consistent. But that is. not the policy of the Liberal party, and I should like to know just how deep&#39; is the concern of members of the Liberal party for civil liberty because </para>

          <para>Hillside  this House they want one thing, and inside the House, they either sit in silence while the Australian Country party goes through its usual opening gambit, or certain of its members, like the honorable member for Barker, if he can be described as a Liberal, support them. In my mind, the word &#34;liberalism &#34; is associated with Gladstone, Campbell-Bannerman and Lloyd George. To call the honorable member for Barker a liberal is as jarring to ray sense of the fitness of things as it would l&#62;e to put coronation robes on an orang-outang. </para>
          <para>Among the authors who have received a grant from the. Common wealth Literary Fund, there is one who, I understand, is a Communist. I am not following the usual practice of smearing people under the cover of parliamentary privilege. She is Katherine Susannah Pritchard, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. K.</inline> S. Throssell. I understand, that she has never sought to conceal the fact that she was a Communist. She received a grant to write a .novel set in the gold-fields of Western Australia. I presume that the novel, is her recent work, <inline font-style="italic">The Roaring Nineties.</inline> I read the novel with great interest. With her political views,  I disagree entirely. I have heard her speak publicly, and I disagree entirely with what she stated; but if the Commonwealth .Literary Fund had deprived Australian literature of the novel which she wrote, it would have done a disservice to Australian literature. I consider that nothing could dramatize the whole issue which is before the House better than this clear separation of her political convictions whatever we may think of them, and her literary ability.&#34; The list of persons who have received assistance from the fund is very extensive. Some of the authors are Frank Dalby Davison, Xavier Herbert, Stella Miles Franklin, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Ernestine</inline> Hill, Marjorie Clark, Marjorie Barnard, of Barnard Eldershaw fame, E. J. Brady, and Roy Connolly, who wrote a novel dealing ivir.li freakishness in heredity. Looking at honorable members opposite, I believe that this book is probably a very valuable piece of research. Other well known names in the list of distinguished authors are - S. J. Baker, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Katrine</inline> Susannah Pritchard, J. H. M. Abbott, Dame Mary Gilmour and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Daisy</inline> Botes. </para>
          <para>Summing up, I desire to make certain comments on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling</inline> himself. I heard a broadcast that he gave over the national stations. If I remember aright, the broadcast took the form of an interview with an announcer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> broke with the Communist party over the Russian invasion of Finland. He considered that the habit of the Communist party of apologizing for every item of - Russian foreign -policy was reprehensible. -He stated that Russian actions, as he saw them, had nothing to do with the philosophy of communism. In that broadcast he accused the Australian Communist party of being not Communists but Stalinists, who might aptly be described as they were drawn in Low&#39;s cartoon. All the little boys were in bed with &#34; Eather Joe &#34;, and if father burned, they all turned. That was his description of the Communist party at this time; not that the fact that he might be a Communist or was once a Communist has anything to do with the question whether he should be awarded a grant to enable him to write on a literary subject. But since bis literary ability has been impugned, it is necessary for me to state these facts. .If the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawling&#39;s</inline> literary ability is provided in his <inline font-style="italic">Short History of the Australian People,</inline> then the committee, iri deciding to make this grant to him, had good grounds for so doing. When the Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> objected yesterday to the right honorable member for Cowper being granted leave to make a statement, I personally disapproved of his action. </para>

              <para>- At any rate, enough has been said by honorable members on both sides of the House about personal liberty, but the issue implicit in the submission of the right honorable member for Cowper is this: Is there, by .some accident or through inadequate vigilance on the part of the committee controlling the Commonwealth Literary Fund, a danger that some of this money, which is provided by taxpayers, will be used to enable certain people, who themselves would deny to us the right of free speech, to undermine and white-ant the democratic institutions of (his country? One of the most remarkable features of this debate is that, although members of the committee presumably investigated the literary record of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling,</inline> the only person to submit to the House to-day evidence of those activities was the right honorable member foi- Cowper. No one has suggested that M r. Rawling has written matter other than that contained in the list provided by the right honorable member for Cowper. We are told that although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bawling</inline> has written on the subject of communism in the past, he is now a convert, who is so moved to continue his literary activities that he has applied foia Commonwealth Fellowship. However, T point out&#39; that he has refrained from producing, during the last seven or eight years, any literature which would give a denial to the views which he previously expressed in print. Why, if he has this consuming desire to record himself in print on one subject, has he not been prepared to publish statements which would undo any damage which his previous utterances had caused? </para>

          <para>The fears of the Opposition go beyond the issue raised in this particular instance. We are concerned, because we find on the part of this Government a reluctance to bring to the light of day the activities of people who are conspiring to undermine the Commonwealth. The Government refuses to say where the funds are obtained that enable four publications to bc carried on by the Communist party in Australia. We hear that certain persons are no longer members of the Communist party. How many of them have gone underground because they look to the day when the activities of some of their comrades might deprive them of the opportunity to carry out their foul work in white-anting our democratic institutions? If the Government desires to repudiate the charges levelled against it on this occasion, and wishes to allay the concern, and misgivings which the Opposition and many people throughout Australia feel on the subject of communism, let it face this issue as a real challenge ! Let it examine the activities of the Communists in Australia, and bring into the light of day the source of the funds which enable the Communists to publish those journals! </para>

Without this action, the authority to collect duty under these proposals will expire on the 14th May, 1947. The proposals which it . is desirable to validate principally, gave effect to the reductions of duty introduced by the Government in connexion with its 1946-47 budget. No absolute period of validation has been prescribed in the bill. This follows -the course established in previous validation bills introduced into the House, and will secure uniformity with validation acts which are at present operative.

            <para>. - I do not intend to oppose the passage of this bill, but I consider it necessary to point out that it is time that honorable members wore given an opportunity to discuss the specific tariff items involved. When the last Customs Tariff Validation Bill was before the House the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> gave an assurance that, ata very early date, honorable members would be given an opportunity to discuss the tariff schedules, yet here is another validation bill and we still have not been provided withthat opportunity.

          <para class="block">That, however, does not give any indication that a tariff debate will be arranged at an early date. Moreover, the Minister pointed out that the validation now being sought is for an unspecified term. We may therefore be precluded from engaging in a tariff debate for many more months, or even, in some circumstances, for years. Other tariff validation bills may follow this one. This procedure does not do justice to the responsibilities of honorable members in relation to tariff policy. In view of the great development of our manufacturing potential during the war years there is every reason for requesting an early tariff debate. Itmay be that some of the industries which are at present receiving protection may not need it, or they may not need such high, duties as are at present being applied. Other manufacturing industries now in their early stages of development may require a greater degree of protection than they are receiving. It maybe that at this moment some  of  our newer industries are having the headman&#39;s axe applied to them in the overseas discussions to which I have referred. In these circumstances a fulldress tariff debate is vital to the welfare  of  industry in Australia. I strongly protest against the frequent introduction  of  validation hills of this description, and urge the Government to provide an  early  opportunity for a proper tariff debate. I ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that the promise of the Prime Minister that a tariff debate would be arranged at an early date will be fulfilled. This is necessary in the interests of Australian industry generally. </para>

            <para>. -I should not have risen on this occasion had the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> given me the assurance that I asked for a few moments ago, that an early opportunity would be provided for a debate on the individual items involved in the several schedules covered by these validating bills. I had the honor to negotiate the original Southern Rhodesian preference agreement while I held the portfolio of Minister for Trade and Customs, so I am well aware of the implications inherent in this measure. I am not out of step with the desire of the Government to validate the duties included in the schedule that was tabled last November, but I reiterate that a full dress debate on wor tariff policy is necessary in the interests of Australia. We ought to knowwhere we are heading in our customs tariff policy. It will doubtless be of interest to honorable members and to the country at large to be reminded that tariff receipts for the first eight months, of the present financial year show an increase of  &#163;17.  000,000 over the estimate. The total is made up of &#163;11,000,000 from customs duties and &#163;6,000,000 from excise duties. Thu estimated budget collection for the full financial year is &#163;89,000,000. The revenue for the ten months ended thu 30th. April, totalled &#163;34,224,860. The collections up till the :50th April were &#163;21,858,600 more than the corresponding ten months of the previous financial year. The total collections for April alone were &#163;S,S77,900 which was &#163;1,807.000 mw. than for April of last year. There will probably be a continually increasing revenue from customs and excise duties until the depleted stocks in the stores of this country have been replenished. It may suit the Government to have a &#34;rocketing&#34; customs revenue and tha;: very circumstance may prove an incentive to it to defer a full consideration of customs policy for as long as possible. In that event we may expect a continuation of the policy of introducing validating bills of this description; hut the abstraction of money from the pockets of the people by such means is not. justifiable. That is another reason why there should be a prompt; review of customs policy. I cannot fathom why the Government should wish to continue to abstract money from the people in the way that it is doing by both direct and indirect, means. It is thereby imposing a financial burden, on the people which I am sure they will not bc willing Vo carry much longer. The Government&#39;s policy is impoverishing industry to an extraordinary degree and it is hindering full recovery. I consider, therefore, that it. is incumbent upon me to impress upon the Minister and his colleagues the need for an early tariff debate so that, to use an expression of which Government members are fond, we may &#34;streamline&#34; our tariff policy. The present policy of the Government is undoubtedly having an adverse effect on some worthy importing enterprises. </para>

            <para>.- I listened with interest to the two speeches tha t were made on the validating bil) which the House has just passed, and I was somewhat surprised that the Minister who introduced the measure <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> did not give an explanation ki honorable members of the need for it. Everybody knows that anything done in validly is illegal. Consequently when the Parliament is invited to pass a bill to validate something that has already been done, it may be assumed that the invalid action was illegal. If something illegal has been, done honorable mein hers should be informed of the full facts. The bill now before us contains the expression, &#34;all duties of customs demanded or collected &#34;. That means, I presume, that duties which have already been collected have been illegally collected. Therefore the illegal action needs validation. Presumably, duties to be collected, in the future under the tariff proposals to which this bill relates would also be illegal if this validating bill were not passed. I submit therefore that the Minister should explain the reason why such a. measure as this is necessary. </para>

            <para>. -  I desire to refer to the points raised by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang).</inline> The action taken by the Government in relation to these tariff matters was not illegal. Under legislation passed by this Parliament many years ago duties specified in tariff schedules that were tabled became operative at once. The reason for such action is clear. If the duties did not become operative immediately they were notified there would be a. temptation for people immediately to rush forward prospective -imports, or to remove goods from bond. For tthat reason duties .become effective immediately schedules are tabled. Another law passed! by this Parliament provides that tariff schedules which have been laid on the table must be validated within a given time - I believe within six months. That period, in respect of these schedules, will expire in a few days, and unless the Parliament passes a validating bill covering a further period, the duties will lapse. I remind the honorable member for Reid that while I was Prime Minister numerous tariff schedules were introduced,  by means of which existing industries, and iiic finances of this country, were protected at a very serious period of our history, and the foundation of many more valuable industries was laid. Eventually, the Parliament validated those schedules. Now, because the law has been amended, the period during which tariff schedules can continue to operate without validation is only six months. It does not matter what may be the number of schedules, they have to be laid on the table of the House, and should a majority of the Parliament, so decide, any one or all of them may be disallowed. Such action is not taken, because the Parliament always approves of them. </para>

            <para>.- This proposal is rather unfair to the House, even though the matter may be urgent. What the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has said is true enough, but he did not tell the whole story. Validation bills were brought down during his period of office and that of the Lyons administration, as I know full well, having been Minister for Trade and Customs for six years, because of lack of time in which to discuss them. For about five years there has not been a tariff debate in this Parliament, and it is high time there was one. The protest of the honorable member for Reid (Mr.Lang) is timely. Yesterday I pointed out to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> that the Minister for Trade and Customs should be a member of the House of Representatives and should not be stowed away in the Senate, but the right honorable gentleman did not deign to reply to me. That Minister is responsible for the administration of the trade of this country, the collection of a large part of its revenue, and multifarious matters which concern customs duties, which in large measure were fixed when the Ottawa Agreement was ratified in 1933. All sorts of restrictions upon imports and exports have to be administered by officials, who are doing the best they can within the compass allowed to them. Undeniably, Australian commerce i3 getting into a very chaotic condition because of the absence of parliamentary discussion. I am sure that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> will agree that a tariff debate is needed. He deals with export matters, and has not the necessary facilities for obtaining all the information that he needs. Every&#39; honorable member knows that when a question in relation to a customs matter is asked in this House the information sought cannot be supplied, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has to promise to obtain it from his colleague. I challenge any honorable member to name one of the customs duties that are affected by these bills. I cannot be told what amount has been collected, what the primage is. or anything else. I protest against being asked to agree to the passage of a validating bill in those circumstances, and request the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to place the matter before Cabinet with a view to having all tariff schedules debated in this House. It is true that when a tariff schedule is laid on the table the duties it imposes become operative. I realize that we cannot do other than allow the bill to pass. </para>

            <para>. - It is many a long day since there was a tariff debate in this House. The last occasion which comes to my mind at all vividly was, I think, late in 1939, when the government of the day met its &#34; Waterloo &#34; one night in connexion with oil duties. The tariff has a. vital influence in the country areas of Australia. I believe that the Minister for Commerce &#39; and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> appreciates that point at least, because the costs of production of primary industries in Australia depend largely upon the nature of the tariff, that we keep in force, and in addition the possibilities of those industries securing markets overseas are affected thereby. At the present time I am prepared to concede that the Government is represented at a. tra.de conference that is being held at Geneva. My guess as to what may be the results of that conference is as good as that of anyone else. The Minister and I may agree in that respect, and that would be rather dangerous. My prediction is that, for all useful purposes, the results will be practically nil. So the most which the Government can urge in support of this validating bill is that it desires to see the shape of what is produced at Geneva before involving the Parliament in .a  firstTC.la.ss  tariff debate. If we could have an undertaking given from the treasury bench that immediately the results of the Geneva conference were known the Government would initiate a full tariff debate rand the various interests affected could begin to look at the -tariff, with 4ll its .complexities and varieties,, from .the  (Standpoint  of postwar Australian conditions, .then I should &#39;be  quite  &#39;happy to let the bill pass without further comment. But I put it that the Government cannot expect the Parliament *to validate tariff .-schedules indefinitely nosy &#39;that we are in a period which, ,at :any rate, passes lor peace, when Australian primary /and secondary industries .should have some concrete idea of wharf will b.e the conditions under which they  will  be permitted to operate. I frankly admit that all sorts of considerations in regard to exchange, preference and so forth, are associated with this matter. If we are to  be  guided  by  press statements bearing upon the attitude of the United States of America in regard to wool duties which have appeared within the last few days, then the outlook is rather a murky one. Nevertheless it  may became  clear. I put  it  to the Government very firmly that there should be a full-dress tariff debate before the end of this year. Let us arrive at an understanding of what is to be the tariff policy of Australia for the next few years. </para>

            <para>.- I wish to add. a brief comment to those of other honorable members who desire that there shall be a .full review of our post-war tariff policy. I concede, with them, that there are very great practical difficulties in the way of a complete review by the Government to-day. But surely the Government recognizes that both primary and secondary industry is in a state of uncertainty as to future possibilities! The question is not one merely of tariff protection, or of .the degree to which excise duties, imposed to meet the emergency needs of war. are likely to become a permanent  &#62;part  of our revenue-raising methods of the future. There are also administrative developments, which have occurred during the war and are continuing to-day, and in respect of those developments the commercial and industrial community of Australia needs some guidance if it is to be enabled to plan efficiently for the future. One of those developments is governmental control of the importation of goods, sometimes for the .purpose of conserving exchange, and at other times, perhaps, with the object  of .&#39;enabling Australian industries to obtain an abnormal share of the markets that are offering for their products. During the war there were security reasons which made reasonable the imposition of these abnormal restrictions. But we are now .approaching ,the second full year of peace, and some of those emergency provisions are in line for review. What is true of the restrictions on -the importation of goods is also true in like degree of the restrictions which operate to-day on the export of many, of the &#39;products of Australia. Far too much responsibility has been left with departmental officers, and too little with the body which should safeguard the interests of the community as a whole - the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Perhaps that was inevitable during the war years. But the time is long overdue, for the rea.sserti.on by this Parliament of its financial authority, its right to control what are really great policy issues in respect of these commercial -matters. Within recent months, and even years, the determination of the right kind- of policy to pursue in -relation to the importation of goods and the restrictions which should be .imposed  011  the export of goods has been left to departmental officers. Their decisions may have .been, in the main, sound. Nevertheless, in the past decisions of that kind have rightly been reserved as being among the most important of those which this Parliament should make. So I suggest to the Government - and here T somewhat cut across what has been said by my colleagues - that before the conclusion of the discussions at Geneva we should have a clear indication of -the Government&#39;s future policy in relation to these administrative procedures. I hope that,  if  .the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Pollard) does not feel fully equipped to deal with the .issues at this moment, he will have them -in mind as the subject of an early -statement to the Parliament. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> has asked to be  Assured  that the Parliament will have  an  early opportunity to discuss tariff problems generally. That is  a  perfectly reasonable request, and I assure him that  it  will be so considered. Immediately the circumstances reasonably permit an opportunity will be afforded for a debate on tariff and excise policy generally. On the other hand, as the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> has pointed out, it is impossible at the moment to state specifically when that event will occur. The honorable member for Barker has referred to the conversations that are proceeding at the International Conference on Trade and . Employment, at Geneva. It would he im practicable for the Government to bring down revisionary tariff  or  excise proposals before the outcome of those conversations and of the conference discussions bad become known,because  it  would not know whether there would be an almost immediate need to make  af  urther revision, and the time of the Parliament would have been wasted, whilst there might ensue a state of chaos in industry generally and a state of industrial disturbance all round. In the circumstances, I hope that the Opposition will accept my assurance that  a  tariff discussion will take place immediately the circumstances make it reasonable. I do not know that  it is  desperately urgent; because, as the result of war activities, and of the fact that Australia has come out of the conflict less injured  in  regard to its industrial capacity than has any other country, our secondary industries,  in  particular, are happily  in  a rather sound position. It is a rare thing to receive from the representatives of any secondary industry a request for additional tariff protection, and as for the primary industries, insofar as they are affected by the country&#39;s fiscal policy, it is seldom that any complaint is heard. I agree substantially with the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> who argued that export and import restrictions and prohibitions should be reduced to a minimum. I hope that the International Conference on Trade and Employment at Geneva will be successful, and that when the agreements reached there eventually come before this Parliament for ratification they will be discussed in a  non-party  manner&#39;, and that honorable members, when considering them, will  be  actuated only by a desire  to  raise the general standard of living in this and other countries. </para>

          <para>. - I should like  to  learn from the Government just what  is  the present position  of the.  shale oil industry, because there  is an  excise duty upon shale oil. When the original legislation was passed setting up  a  shale oil industry in Australia, I was  on the  other side of the House, and I was somewhat critical of the proposal. I did not believe that it would be successful, and I said  so.  I said that not enough  money  was  being  appropriated for the  purpose,  and I added that  if  the Australian Navy had  to  depend for oil on what was produced at Glen Davis it would never get to sea at all. That was before the war. We have not had a complete story of what has happened since, and it would be a good thing if the Minister were to make a statement setting out the financial commitments of the Commonwealth under the Glen Davis scheme. I understand that, by the exercise of certain powers during the war, without reference to this Parliament, the Commonwealth commitments have been increased. Under the original arrangement, New South Wales was to provide 25 per cent, of the capital for the enterprise, the proprietors of Davis Gelatine (Australia) Proprietary Limited were to provide 25 per cent, and the Commonwealth was to provide 50 per cent. I should like to know what are the financial commitments of the three parties under the existing arrangement. What losses have been incurred by the Commonwealth on this interesting enterprise, and how much crude oil has been produced at Glen Davis? I have no authentic information on the subject from government sources, except what I have gleaned from the Auditor-General&#39;s report, and such reports, although sometimes very revealing, are in many respects unsatisfactory. It is doubtful whether the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> who is in charge of this measure, is .able to give the information which I seek. Therefore, I suggest that when the hill gets into committee further consideration should be postponed until the information is available. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I understand that excise duty is to be collected on spirit distilled from wheat, just as it is collected on spirit distilled from sugar-cane products. A great deal of Commonwealth money has been expended on the erection of power alcohol distilleries in Australia. Some of us believe that there was a good deal of party political influence exercised in determining the location of the distilleries, even though we might believe that, in no circumstances, would a government stoop to placing a distillery in a particular locality in order to improve the political chances of an independent member, who was one of the Frankenstein, brothers. </para>

            <para>- If the Minister will look up the records, he will see that I criticized the Glen Davis project from the beginning, and he must now admit that my criticism has been justified by events. I could never understand why we should expect a man, who had been successful in making gelatine out of calves&#39; hoofs to be equally successful in producing oil from shale. Thedistilleries erected for the purpose of making spirit from wheat are still in existence. There is one in the electorate of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull),</inline> and another in the electorate of the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Russell),</inline> while others are scattered in various places throughout Australia. The war is now over, and we ought to be told what is the policy of the Government regarding such enterprises. Some of the revenue from excise duties levied upon other industries has been used, I have no doubt, to build power alcohol distilleries. . </para>

          <para>.- Before the suspension of the sitting we were endeavouring to debate a bill which had been brought  before  us by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> regarding the invalidation of certain excise tariff collections. I purposely said that we were endeavouring to debate the bill because honorable members had been reduced to complete inability to do so intelligently because of the absence of information regarding the items on which the duties are to be validated by the bill. Just how meagre was the information given to the House may best be illustrated by a perusal of the notice-paper for  to-day in which, under government business, we find notice of motion No. 3, which reads - </para>

It is obvious that he must have known because when I asked, by interjection, what items were involved, the honorable gentleman replied that they embraced petrol, petroleum, shale products, coke and coal distillates. I ask the House, and the wider audience which the Government has been good enough to make aware of our proceedings, if it is not complete abrogation of the purposes of the Parliament to bring down a bill of this kind and without any explanation of its purpose expect honorable members to vote on it? In my spare time during the suspension of the sitting I endeavoured to discover what was proposed. 1 have not the slightest doubt that honorable members arrayed behind the ministerial bench, who may be depended upon to fall into line and vote for all government measures, have not the foggiest idea of what this measure is designed to achieve. Not one of them can say by interjection just what is proposed. </para>

        <para class="block">Why, we are constantly doing our best to avoid being inundated with explanatory memoranda by the Government. I am trying to discover what circular was issued to members in the month of November, 1946, which related to excise duties. The bill does not say whether these excise duties relate to beer, petrol, tobacco, or carbonic acid gas; it merely refers to duties of excise. The Minister has told us the month and the year in which the explanatory memorandum was circulated, and upon that foundation we are expected to proceed to work. In respect of ordinary legislative matters I have said frequently that the Government hasreduced the Parliament to a mere rubber stamp. Legislative proposals are endorsed in the Labour caucus room where final decisions are made. They are then submitted to the Parliament for approval, the Government invariably using the weight of its number to bludgeon them through. As Omar Khayyam said - </para>

We are not even treated with the courtesy of being told what items of excise duties are to be validated, whether they relate to beer, tobacco, playing cards or the numerous other items that are the subject of excise duties to-day. By devoting much time to research, I have discovered that the bill relates to the Government&#39;s proposal to reduce the excise duty on petrol by1d. a gallon - with some trimmings, of course - but there is something about beer in it. The schedule defines beer and provides that the rates are to be unaltered.. We can perhaps agree to that with appropri ate disappointment. </para>

            <para>- There is exactly nothing in the bill beyond the fact that its purpose is to validate certain collections of excise duty. From my researches I have discovered that the schedule to which the bill relates refers among other things to petrol, petrol products, benzine, and napthalene, on which an excise of 8&#189;d. a gallon is imposed. I understand that the purpose of the measure now before us is to reduce the excise duty on those items by 3d. a gallon,- the excise being formerly 9&#189;d. a gallon. The Minister says there is nothing about a reduction of excise duty on petrol, but it is obvious that, the only purpose of the bill is to reduce that duty by1d. a gallon. </para>

            <para>- To its great credit a government formed by the present Opposition started that project. It is, however, not responsible for the calamitous loss incurred on the venture. The project was designed to enable this country to some degree to avoid dependence on imported petrol and it is regrettable that it was not as successful as its originators hoped it would be. Private citizens as well as governments are financially involved in it. The balance-sheet of National Oil Proprietary Limited shows that of the total capital the Commonwealth invested &#163;2,000,000, the Government of New South Wales &#163;166^000, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Davis, of New South Wales, &#163;325,000 in the venture. The project was never regarded as anything but experimental. As I have said, its objective, which was to make this country to some degree self-sufficient, was of the highest national importance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davis</inline> and his associates have not received a penny in return for their investment, and are no doubt in jeopardy of losing the whole of it. Had I been given time to consider this legislation properly I probably should advocate that the excise on the product of the National Oil Proprietary Limited, might well be abolished, instead of reduced by only id. a gallon, because the Commonwealth Government owns 90 per cent, of the shares. But, having been denied the opportunity of considering the implications, I do not commit myself to that. The House is entitled to time to consider all proposals that come before it.. Mem-  bers ought not be forced say, as I have had to say, &#34;I am not sure what I would do if I had time to consider the matter &#34;. </para>

        <para>This proposal refers also to excise on petrol produced by The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. The capital invested in the company is &#163;750,000, as near as I have been able to discover in the little while I have had available to me since the bill was brought down. The Commonwealth Government holds 5 per cent, of the shares,, and an overseas company the remainder. The balancesheet for 1946 shows that this  governmentcontrolled enterprise sold its products at such high prices as to reap a net profit of nearly &#163;224,195 after paying &#163;690,000 tax. The company is half-way towards socialism. We have been told by members of the Labour party that the object of converting an enterprise from private ownership to government ownership is to protect the people against exploitation by great companies and financial organizations. Socialized enterprise is supposed to be non-profit making. Labour claims that most of the terrible things that afflict mankind spring from the profit motive. Yet that company in 1946 made a gross profit of nearly &#163;1,000,000, which, after payment of taxes left a net -profit of &#163;224,195, on which it paid a dividend of 12 per cent. This legislation may or may not be approved, but the Parliament is at least entitled to be told its implications by the Government. Yet the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> made a secondreading speech of only five lines. Private motorists and people dependent on petroleum products for industrial purposes in this country might well consider that the Government could do with less revenue from the company of which it is the parent. Under ho previous administration has it been able to exploit the people as it must have exploited them last year. Casting my eye over its profits I find that in recent years, in round figures they were &#163;224,000 in 1946, &#163;156,000 in 1945, &#163;197,000 in 1944, &#163;95,000 in 1943. &#163;15,000 in 1942, &#163;13,000 in 1941 and &#163;93,000 in 1940. I have not been able to ascertain the profits in 1939, but they decline on a steady curve to &#163;57,000 in 1936. . If an enterprise established on governmental capital is to be used to exploit the people to that degree, it should be understood that that is the way that the Labour policy operates. This has a far-reaching effect not only on the people that buy the products of The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited but also on the profits of its competitors. Sales of The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited are incomparably smaller than of other petrol companies. Who sets the tune? Do the great British and American companies, the Shell Oil Company Limited and the Vacuum Oil Company Limited set the price level or does The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited? If last year the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited which made a gross profit of &#163;946,000 and a net profit of &#163;224,000 is as inefficient as most governmental enterprises how much higher must have been the profits of its competitors with their vastly greater turnover and more efficient management? The Labour party has something to answer there. </para>
        <para>I hope thu G overnment does &#34; not think that we are so inept that it can get away with this sort of thing. We will not let if. It is time the cynicism of the Labour party towards parliamentary government was brought to a halt. Every time the Government treats the parliamentary institution, so cynically as to introduce an important measure like this with a fiveline second-reading speech we will expose it. We will noi: tolerate the Parliament being made a rubber stamp to endorse, the decisions of the Labour caucus. We will bring that policy to an end or expose it to the public gaze whenever it is applied. </para>
        <para>The bill proposes to validate the collection of an excise duty of Sid. a gallon on petrol. Perhaps when the petrol duty was originally imposed, it was of importance mainly to private motorists, but, increasingly? petrol is becoming a highly important factor in industry, both primary end secondary. It is of immense importance to men on the land, on whose behalf I speak. Vet. we were to have been tricked into missing the opportunity of expressing opinions on the maintenance of a punitive tax of 8-}d. a gallon on petrol, which is only Id. less. than the warlime rate. That small reduction has been made when the Government is embarrassed, not by a shortage of revenue, but by the excess of revenue pouring into the coffers of the .Treasury. When the Federal Aids Roads Agreement Bill is introduced I shall have something to say. about the distribution- of revenue from petrol. I content myself now by condemning the Government for the manner in which if is treating the Parliament. We will oppose and expose every instance of that sort of treatment of the Parliament by the Administration. </para>

          <para>. - I quite innocently raised the question why this and other like bills were brought down. On the face of it. this is a bill to validate collections of excise. It aroused my curiosity. Why does the Government want to make legal something that is illegal,? The first measure which the Minister introduced was the Customs Tariff Validation Bill. Not knowing the procedure of this House thoroughly, I looked on and marvelled. When the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Pollard) introduced the second bill, 1 asked him for an explanation. The right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was good enough to .explain to me that in .1932, when the financial and economic depression gripped the world, he had been compelled to take extraordinary measures in order to combat its effects in Australia. Then the Minister rose to enlighten me further; but a discussion developed on another matter, and he overlooked me. The House is now considering the Excise Tariff Validation Bill, and it has aroused my innocent curiosity. During the suspension of the sitting. I examined the tariff proposals which the Minister laid upon  the table of the House last November. He explained that those proposals must be validated before the 14th May next. If they are not validated, they will become inoperative. Even so, the Government should not attempt to rush this legislation through the House. The Government should not say. &#34; Time is pressing, and we must pass this legislation as a matter of urgency. &#34; From the stand-point of the Government there is no urgency, because it controls the sittings of the Parliament. However, the Government chooses to ignore that fact. </para>

        <para class="block">Government cannot claim that it is pressed for time, because it controls the days and hours of sitting.

Of that reason I have no knowledge. It may be good, and I may be prepared to accept it when I am told what it is.

Honorable members will notice that an asterisk is placed against these three bills on the notice-paper, indicating that they have appeared on the notice-paper for the first time. .In other words, the Minister did not obtain leave to introduce them one day, present them and move that they be read a first time on the second day, and then move the second reading on the third day. The Government hopes that these bills will be hurried through the House in a few moments. I hone that they will not. Making a rough scrutiny of the annual report of the AuditorGeneral upon the Treasurer&#39;s statement of receipts and expenditure, I found several interesting items. -For example, on page 1&#39;3G I found under the heading of &#34; Power Alcohol Distilleries &#34; which are covered &#34;by the Excise Tariff Validation Bill- </para>

The Government also .made a stupid and silly attempt .when it wasted Commonwealth- money on the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. </para>

Excise duties account for millions of pounds of .revenue annually. Although this Parliament might be regarded as the senior firm in the business of this country, honorable members are being asked to sign a blank cheque, and have been denied the courtesy df information to which they are justly entitled. &#39;When the Minister was asked by interjection for some information which he failed to give in his speech, he replied curtly, &#39;&#34; Shale oil, &#38;c. &#38;c. &#34;. Only ten seconds ago I was able to &#39;look at this schedule. I wish to know from the Minister how .much is involved &#34;.in the excise duties &#39;referred &#39;to in the &#39;bill. </para>

It should surely be possible for the Minister to give us specific figures in relation to the duties collected on imported refined and locally refined liquid fuels.

            <para>- Surely the Minister could, inform us of the amount of duty collected in respect of fuels manufactured from local, shales and the amount collected on imported refined petrols. This matter is of considerable importance also to farmers who are being compelled to use petrol-driven &#39;tractors, and therefore to pay tax on the petrol so used, in preference to kerosene-propelled tractors, which, .unfortunately, .are not available in. sufficient numbers to meet the demand. I realize that it may bo difficult to police these matters; but it is important that farmers should know exactly how they are affected by this situation. I should -also like some information about the excise duty on tobacco. Is that matter involved in this bill ? </para>

        <para class="block">That applies to the honorable member for Indi.  Had  he been present in the House when I introduced the  first  of these validating bills this afternoon he would have realized that the schedule referred  to  therein provided for a reduction of customs duty  of1d.  per gallon on petrol. The measure now before the House validates a reduction of excise duty of1d. a gallon. The first-mentioned amount relates to oils and petrols imported in refined condition; the second-mentioned,  to  oils and petrols refined from shales in this country. The reason for the reduction of1d. in each case was to preserve existing margins. In that respect the Government is honouring an undertaking given  by  previous governments, including the Menzies Government. The margin operating in respect of imported refined petrols and oils is 51/5d. a gallon, and that in respect of petrols and oils refined from  local shales is 7.5d. a gallon. When the original proposals were introduced an undertaking was given by the Menzies Government that the margins would be preserved until 1955. The introduction of this measure, therefore, honours a. promise of the  Menzies  Government,. In these circumstances, I am astonished that the honorable member for Indi should have spoken in opposition to the bill. I am surprised, also, because the reduction of excise is beneficial to the users of tractors in primary-producing industries, as well as, of course, to other people. It is for the reasons that I  have  given that I consider  that,  the honorable  member for  Indi has been responsible for a display  of  mock indignation. Had  be  taken the trouble to refresh his mind on the history of this subject, he would not have spoken as he did. Apparently, the honorable gentleman did not read his notice-paper this morning, otherwise he would have realized that these measures were listed for consideration to-day. </para>
        <para>I hope that the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Lang) does not consider that. I have been guilty of any studied discourtesy to him. I believe that he will admit that since  he  has been a  member  of this House I have carefully refrained from indulging in discourtesy towards him. The time was, of course, when I was  in the  habit of being courteous to  him.  I  have  had no occasion to be discourteous. The only reason why I did not reply to the second-reading speech of the honorable gentleman was that 1 was forestalled by the right honorable member for Tarra. If I had followed along the lines of that right honorable gentleman&#39;s speech, I should have been guilty of tedious repetition. </para>

          <para>. - The purpose of the clause is to validate the collections that have been made under the excise tariff proposals that were introduced in this Parliament  last November. In those proposals, there is a reference to the imposition of differential duties on the products of National Oil Proprietary Limited. In view of the statement that, for each gallon not exceeding 10,000,000 gallons produced in any one year commencing on the 1st duy of January the duty shall be 3d. a gallon, and for each gallon exceeding 10.000,000 gallons in each year commencing on the 1st day of January the duty shall be Sid. a gallon, it would appear that a differential duty of 5&#163;d. a. gallon operates as soon as the production exceeds 10,000,000 gallons a year. I. should like to know whether the Minister has been good enough to obtain the information for which I asked before the suspension of the sitting, with a view to enabling the committee to have some idea of how this imposition of excise is affecting the production of oil from shale at Glen Davis. T am deeply concerned about this matter because, as the Minister will recall, I was severely critical of this project when it was first brought down by the Government. I have noted from the Auditor-General&#39;s report that the Government&#39;s commitment has increased from an initial amount of &#163;334,000. To-day, the capital invested is &#163;334,000, but there have been additional loans from &#39; the Commonwealth amounting to &#163;2,246,000. The losses are rather staggering. This duty may be affecting the ability of the company to pay dividends. Up to date, the company has not paid a dividend. The committee should have before it information which would enable it to decide whether the rate of duty is affecting the ability of National Oil Proprietary Limited, as it is now called, to pay a dividend to its shareholders. The losses would not be so great were it not for the undisclosed amount of duty which the company is paying. Those losses have been : On the , first year&#39;s operations in 1940, &#163;1S0,000; in. 1941, &#163;177,000; in 1942, &#163;263,000; in 1943, &#163;296,000; in 1944, &#163;303,000; and in 1945, &#163;343,000. One is . led to ask what is the effect of the differential duty upon the profit and loss account of National Oil Proprietary Limited. What strikes me most forcefully is that the annual loss becomes greater with every Wales. . I do not know whether the State increase of Government advance. The committee is at a great disadvantage in arriving at a decision,, because of a complete lack of information. The Minister has not been prepared to take us into his confidence, and tell us what is the annual rate of production -at Glen Davis, how much of its production is bearing an excise duty of 3d. a gallon and how much a duty of 8-Jd. a gallon, either during his second-reading speech, or on that other famous occasion last November to which he has referred in such forceful terms in reply to the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen).</inline> If the committee had that information, it would be in a position to arrive at a decision. This is not the end of the Commonwealth&#39;s commitments. The Auditor-General has shown that the Commonwealth Bank loaned the company &#163;250,000. The Commonwealth Government must have repaid that- amount to the Commonwealth Bank at some time in 1944. It would appear that the Commonwealth Bank considered that the duty imposed was a little too &#34; hot &#34;, and that the security was not, sufficiently . good. Therefore, the Commonwealth Bank came to the conclusion that the financial &#34;baby&#34; had better be carried by the Commonwealth Government rather than by itself. That is another important point. The Auditor-General has stated that the loans advanced by the Commonwealth for the purpose of this undertaking amounted to &#163;3,091,000 at the 30th June, 1946. Since then, the company has had another advance of &#163;325,229, and a. bank guarantee of &#163;100,000; with what bank has not been stated. It is estimated that a further amount of &#163;250,000 will be necessary to finance the undertaking to the stage of production. An advance of this amount was approved by Cabinet in June, 1946, and &#163;200,000 of it had been paid to the company when this report was being compiled. Interest accrued, but unpaid from the 1st January, 1942, to the 30th June, 1946, on advances made by the Commonwealth, amounted to &#163;287,000 a year, in addition to those duties that are due to the Commonwealth, which are very definitely affected by the amount of excise which the company will have to pay on whatever the production may be. There is also the interest that is due to the State, of New South is receiving that interest or not. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> might have been able to enlighten us, but for the fact that he has been out of office there for a considerable time. I have noticed that he has seemed a little diffident in finding his way about in this rather peaceful place, having come from the more stormy atmosphere of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. The point that. I want to arrive at is, whether the Minister will make a statement before the passage of this validating measure or, in the event of the Government once again using its brutal majority to push it through the committee, whether he will salve our wounded feelings to the extent of undertaking that, in due course, lie will make a. statement to the House showing very clearly the production, and the commitments and projected commitments of the Commonwealth in respect of National Oil. Proprietary Limited. I am most anxious to have the figures relating to production, because, when the legislation went through the Parliament originally, I was one who severely criticized it, and said that, if we had to rely on Glen Davis, as it was then called, to provide crude oil for the Australian </para>

          <para>.- Clause 3 is the operative clause of the bill. Its purpose is to validate the collections that have been made under the excise tariff proposals, and to perpetuate until there is further legislation the collection of excise at the rates fixed. At the second-reading stage, I made clear a point which I shall now repeat, namely, that I support the proposed reduction of excise duty. Unfortunately, I cannot move an amendment which would have the effect of increasing the amount of the proposed reduction. At the second-reading stage I also made it clear that if I had any criticism to offer it was that the reduction was- not sufficient. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> misrepresented me when he said that I was opposed to the reduction. </para>

        <para>My general criticism of the measure arose from the fact that the explanation given by the Minister was inadequate. The Minister has again addressed himself to the subject, but he has left us still substantially uninformed. I shall not persist in a hopeless effort to obtain full information, but I wish to ask the Minister a question about one matter which concerns my constituency perhaps more than any other - What is the excise duty on benzol? It appears in the schedule under the general classification of coal tar and coke distillates. Most of the tobacco produced in Australia is grown in my electorate. Some years ago, the industry was&#39; almost wiped out by a. disease known as blue mould, which attacked the plants as seedlings. Due to the magnificent work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Angel,</inline> it was discovered that seedlings could be raised by growing them in an enclosed place containing trays of benzol. This research was carried out, not during the regime of the present Government, but under that of the Lyons Government, which established a special fund for the purpose. If benzol were not available it would be impossible to continue the tobacco-growing industry, a statement with which all tobaccogrowers, in Victoria at any rate, will agree. I do not know what the position in regard to blue mould is in tropical districts. </para>

            <para>- Then it is the same all over Australia. It follows that if the industry would be wiped out through benzol being unobtainable, its existence could he seriously threatened if benzol became too expensive. I am being invited to vote for this measure, and I ask the Minister in charge of the hill what is the excise duty on benzol? He is now going off to make an inquiry of some one else, showing that he has come hero in charge of this bill without knowing much about it. According to the schedule, the duty could be 3d. a gallon or 4-J-d. a gallon, or there could be no duty at all. </para>

          <para>.- There is no desire to hide &#39;from Parliament any particulars regarding the operation of National Oil Proprietary Limited. Honorable members are aware that this enterprise was embarked upon during the term of office of the Lyons Government, the idea being to produce from shale petrol that might be available in case of emergency. I have no quarrel with the original objective. I was not in Parliament at the time; but I was always very doubtful of the prospects of success, even, though the Newnes shale deposits happened to be in the electorate which I hoped to represent. The technical advice submitted in tlo; first place was apparently very bad. As a result of this advice, retorts of a kind used in Scotland and Czechoslovakia were installed, but at Glen Davis they did not produce the expected results. Newnes shale has a very high oil content,- and the retorts at first used were not capable of recovering much more than half , of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keith</inline> Buller, manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited in Newcastle, is  chairman  of directors of National Oil Proprietary Limited, and he has great faith in the ultimate success of the enterprise. He is giving his services absolutely free in this capacity, not even drawing expenses, and he has been able to give valuable advice on the technical side.  His  confidence in the undertaking is so great that the Government is prepared to continue its support, in the hope that this confidence will be justified. I do not believe that all the capita&#93; which has been put into the project can be recovered, but if a reasonable amount is written off it might be economically successful. As Treasurer, I should have liked to make a statement to Parliament setting out the financial position, but I have been asked by those associated with it to let the matter stand over until they can prove that the reorganization now being effected is capable of producing results. I am responsible for the Commonwealth money being used, but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler</inline> is so confident of ultimate success, we are prepared to give him an opportunity to justify his confidence. </para>

            <para>- I understand that the production of oil per ton of shale has already improved greatly. With the old retorts it was approximately 50 gallons a ton, whereas it had originally been hoped to recover between 90 and 95 gallons a ton. The new retorts, I believe, are recovering about 80 gallons a ton. A full statement regarding the enterprise will be made in due course. </para>

          <para>.- I am grateful for the explanation offered by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> As a Minister of the Government which was in office in 1941, I remember that we were very much concerned over the losses being sustained in this venture. It was originally proposed that the deposit? should be worked by a private company, which would receive assistance from the Government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Government. The company contributed &#163;166,000, the Government of New South Wales a similar amount, and the Commonwealth Government &#163;334,000. However, as time went on, the company more or less disappeared from the picture been use it found that its finances did not permit it to carry, on. The Com mon wealth, being committed t,o the project, waa compelled to go on, particularly as war had broken out, and it was necessary to get petrol at any cost. In 1937-3S the Commonwealth Govern- ment advanced &#163;334,000; at the present time, its total contribution to the enterprise amounts to &#163;2.500.000. The Prime Minister said he was hopeful that, as a result of receiving new technical advice, and in-tailing new retorts, some success would be achieved. That was the story told us in 1941. It was then said, &#34; Only give us time. The original company made a great mistake in installing obsolete retorts, which were uneconomic in the production of shale oil. Let us get new retorts from the United States of America. <inline font-style="italic">W</inline> the Commonwealth will only put in a little more money, we will make good.&#34; That, was in .1942. Since then the losses have been as follows: - </para>

        <para class="block">Those are the Auditor-General&#39;s figures, and they show that every year the loss has been increasing. The Treasurer is the custodian of the taxpayers&#39; money, and I should like to know how m Tic:h patience ho has in the expenditure of that money on an enterprise which is not giving a fair return. I realize the immense difficulty of making a decision in a case like this, but there must, be some point beyond which the Government will not continue to advance money for unproductive work. The old story of the retorts being obsolete has had a fair trial. I. hope that the Prime Minister, who has close personal knowledge of the Glen Davis project, will inform the House of the latest costs, because the figures supplied in the Auditor-General&#39;s report bring us up to 1945 only. We do not know what, losses were incurred last year or this year, or whether the company has yet turned the corner towards success. Honorable members are entitled to up to date information on these matters. The Minister might also furnish figures relating to production. </para>

            <para>- Tt is more or le.-s a formality to impose an excise duty im the product of the company and at the same time recoup it for its losses. Excise of 3d. a gallon levied on 10,000,0011 gallons produces a &#39; revenue of &#163;125,00(1. an amount less than one-half the loss sustained by the company in one year. The excise charge is merely a bookkeeping entry which, as far as. excise revenue is concerned is misleading. The Treasurer should look into thu matter with a view to relieving the company of the excise charge until such time as the venture becomes a profitable undertaking. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>POLLARD  (Ballarat- Minister for Commerce .and Agriculture &#91;9.32&#93; . - The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> and the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> requested information concerning the production of oil from shale a,nd other aspects of&#34;, the great undertaking at Glen Davis. The Labour Administration first took office in 1941 and cannot be held responsible for the situation that existed prior to that year. The company&#39;s figures show that for  1.94.1.-42  the quantity of oil produced from shale was 1,769,000 gu 1 1 on s . a n d  1 1 1 a t th e re venn e. collected thereon in the form of excise was &#163;29.483. In 1.942-43, under the direction of a Labour government the output was so improved as to read a total of 2,142,&#39;l.Sl gallons, the yield of revenue in the form of excise amounting to &#163;35,09S. By 1943-44 there was a&#39; substantial drop in. production, due to lack of man-power and the fact that we were then in the most critical stage of the war, and also, no doubt, to some deterioration of the plant. In that year production dropped to 1,322,000 gallons, and the revenue from excise to &#163;22,000. In 1944-45 production improved slightly, the output being 1.492.000 gallons, the excise being &#163;24,000.&#39; In 1945-46 due to the factors referred to by the Prime Minister to-night, and no doubt to the very efficient management supplied gratis by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and to improved plant and better methods of operation, the output increased to 2.032,000 gallons and the excise to &#163;34,000. It may appear strange, as the honorable member for Richmond has said, that, notwithstanding that the losses incurred by the company are still being met by the Government, excise duty is still imposed on the company&#39;s products. That is possibly due to the fact that some machinery has to be established for the collection of the excise from the consuming public. That is a matter for the financial wizards of the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Cus-toms to work out. If excise duty were not imposed it would be difficult to collect the full price from the consuming public. Another factor which must be borne in mind is that a small quantity of oil from shale is produced elsewhere than at Glen Davis. </para>

            <para>- It is easy to be critical. I remind the right honorable  gentleman that he was a member of the Government responsible for the establishment of the undertaking and that its management has not changed during the period that Labour governments have been in office Though we are searching assiduously for flow oil in this country, 1 believe that we shall have to depend to a great degree on oil from shale to meet a portion of our future requirements. It is too early yet to form an opinion as to whether flow oil will be discovered in sufficient quantities to meet our needs. Up to date the prospects of obtaining oil from that source are not hopeful. Shale is to be found in &#39;fairly substantial quantities, not only at Glen Davis, but also at Latrobe, in the electorate of the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duthie).</inline> The deposits at Latrobe are said to show a high oil content. Expenditure on the production of oil from shale during the war years, when oil was so badly needed in Australia, may have been costly, but the war-time experiment has been of great value in showing us bow best we can produce oil from shale in the future. I rose to make that point. I should like the Leader of the Australian Country party to say what he would have done. Would he have cut the loss and closed Glen Davis and ceased investigations? Would he have said that the undertaking cost the taxpayers too much? I think so. That has been the policy of the Opposition parties for years. They have never persisted in investigations in any field. They  cannot deny that they established the Glen Davis project. This Government was clothed with&#39; the responsibility of pursuing investigations there. I hope we shall lie able to continue them, for I believe that ultimately they will be fruitful. </para>

          <para>.- The discussion has centred on shale oil at Glen Davis. I rise to correct the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> about how the Glen Davis project was established.  It was established purely as a defence measure. I know, as a member of the Cabinet at that time, that it was never expected to be economical. Development was delayed for years. The proposal to re-oven it was brought down by the then Minister for Defence, not by the Minister for Commerce, because it was n defence measure. It. is certainly not in the same category as the Labour Government&#39;s distilling of power alcohol from wheat. That was a criminal thing to do in a world starving for food. The petrol from Glen Davis is produced from shale of which there is an abundance. It was intended to be used if our supplies from overseas were cut off. It was valuable in that it did produce some petrol whereas wheat: did not produce any. </para>

He did not expect to make any money out of it. Anyway, the Glen Davis project must be regarded as a war measure. We hope that wars are finished, but we suspect not. The question is whether it is worth preserving as a defence auxiliary. If we still think that we are in danger, as we well may be, there are three courses to consider. One is to discontinue operations and keep the plant in good repair for use in an emergency. If employment is a factor and it is considered that to close down the plant would create unemployment, other measures must be examined or operations may continue but it is ridiculous to levy excise on petrol produced at Glen Davis and it must be lifted. </para>

        <para>Confusion has existed on this bill. One would think from the discussion that it was brought down to validate an agreement on the enterprise at Glen Davis. It is nothing of the kind. That is incidental. It is a bill to validate the collection of excise. An act of the Lyons Government included an amendment moved by a member of the Australian Country party and accepted by the then Government, although it had the necessary numbers to reject it, to ensure that schedules of customs and excise must be &#39; considered by the Parliament within six months of being tabled. We agreed to the propriety of  a provision designed to ensure a full debate of all tariff items in a schedule. Clause 3 of the bill provides - </para>

            <para>- We  always did, unless the pressure of work was too great, in which case the items were debated soon after validation. This Government has been in office for years, but in that time, we  have  never debated a customs or excise schedule. The tariff needs revision. L defy any Minister or customs official to say that customs and excise imposts are right. There are multifarious items on which customs and excise have been collected without parliamentary authority. Thisbill and the bill that preceded it validates those collections. Millions of pounds is involved. If an item were not validated the Government would be liable to heavy refunds to the payers of the duty. I hope that this debate has taught the Government a. lesson and that it will heed our protests and promise that future tariff proposals will be discussed within a reasonable period. </para>

          <para>.- The somewhat dreary atmosphere of the House scorns rather appropriate for me to embark upon the gloomy responsibility that devolves upon us from time to time to examine the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> in moving the second reading of the Income Tax Assessment Bill, suggested that he was conferring substantial concessions by way of income tax reductions upon the community. Because we have just concluded a debate on the financial statement of the Treasurer, it is not necessary for me to cover with the same minuteness the general question of the income tax as I might otherwise have done. The Leader of the. Opposition (Mr.Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and many other speakers debated all aspects of the Government&#39;s financial policy. There is good reason for not going into too much detail on the second reading of this bill, because the memorandum circulated amongst us contains about 100 pages explaining the amendments to be made to the principal act. Consequently, we shall have a heavy discussion in committee when we deal, with the detailed amendments. The bill sets out primarily to give effect to the aspects of the Treasurer&#39;s financial statement dealing with income tax. We have been led to believe by the Treasurer that the proposed income tax concessions for next year will amount to &#163;34,000,000 and will bring the income tax remissions since the end of hostilities to &#163;71,000,000 a year. I propose to examine that claim in a moment, but, first, I will examine the circumstances in which these concessions are being offered. During the last general election campaign the right honorable gentleman said in criticism of the Opposition policy that the tax concessions provided for in it could not be made. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party said that they could be made at that time with advantage to the community and without damage to the economy. That submission has been clearly supported by events and the financial experience of the Government since then. So, in order to get over any difficulty which might present itself when he relates what he said then to present-day conditions, the Prime Minister says that these tilings are now possible because of the period of prosperity through which the Commonwealth is passing. It is one of the tragedies of our administration at present, that this Government insists on thinking in financial terms, and not in realistic terms, which are not necessarily represented by figures. What are the real tests of the prosperity of a country? Surely, the real test is its capacity to provide a rising standard of goods and services, adequate housing and clothing, ample food for its people,&#39; and security of employment. It is quite true that we in. Australia have a condition of full employment, because any one who really looks for a job can obtain&#39; one. In financial terms, the country is &#34; ticking over&#34; with a. national income of about &#163;1,200,000,000. </para>

            <para>- If the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> will supply the exact figure, I shall be obliged to him. However, &#163;1,200,000,000 is approximately the figure which I have had in recent times from those who are in a position to give the information. If we examine the real situation of the Commonwealth, we shall find that we are experiencing shortages of housing on an unprecedented scale and that there are other shortages which become almost inexplicable, on the Government&#39;s own argument, when it tells us that since the end of the war some hundreds&#39; of thousands of men and women have come back into civil production. So, if we apply the test of realism to the claim of  prosperity, it is obvious that the claim must fail. Therefore, I suggest that Ave apply a similar test of genuineness to the Government&#39;s claim that it is now making the substantial concessions of tax that the Prime Minister has indicated. </para>

        <para>The right honorable gentleman is a remarkable man - a financial wizard. He reminds me of a celebrated juggler who was able to keep eight balls in the air at the one time. The right honorable gentleman keeps about eight taxes in operation at the one time. Directing our attention to one of the taxes, he says that he has substantially reduced it, and hopes that by a rapid movement of the remaining ones he will distract our attention from the fact that we are bearing heavier imposts in other taxes. I put it to the House that the real test of whether these concessions have been made in the time that the Prime Minister claims is to ask ourselves, &#34; What is the quantum of taxes still being collected by the Commonwealth Government, and what number of taxpayers are represented by that quantum ? &#34; I propose to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> back to the end of hostilities, which is the period to which the Prime Minister referred. Our population has not changed substantially since then, and we can take it, foi- the purposes of this argument, as being a static figure. In 1944-45, just before the end of hostilities, the actual collections from income tax and indirect taxes amounted to &#163;345,000,000. fu the following year, 1945-46, although we were given various tax concessions, the estimated&#39; collection of &#163;343,000,000 proved, in the result, to be &#163;358,000,000. In 1946-47, again despite these tax concessions, which were to give much relief to the people, the estimated collection was &#163;348,000,000; but we know that, on the Government&#39;s own figures at the end of nine months of the financial year, the estimate will be greatly exceeded. </para>
        <para>Therefore, let us test the claim of the Treasurer that remissions of taxes, amounting to &#163;71,000,000, will have been granted, against the collection of &#163;345,000,000 at the conclusion of hostilities. The remissions of &#163;34,000,Q00 which the Treasurer now 251&#39;&#176;POS(3S to make will give, on his claim, a total of &#163;71,000.000. That leaves tax remissions of &#163;37,000,000 that he claims he has already given to the people. So, if we take the &#163;37,000,000 from the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;345,000,000,</inline> which was. the figure at the conclusion of hostilities, it is reasonable to suppose that we are paying &#163;308,000,000 in taxes to-day; However, I remind the House again that the Government, on its own admission, estimated that it would collect &#163;348,000,000, or &#163;40,000,000 more than the figure which should be collected if the remissions are genuine.  In the result, it will collect very much more. Quite obviously, what is happening is that, as the Treasurer reduces the rate of income tax, but retains  heavy  indirect taxes such as sales tax, excise, customs and pay-roll tax, he is more than able to recover his losses. The real test is: How much is the Commonwealth taxpayer paying to-day compared with what he had to pay during the war? The remarkable thing is that a government which claims to have given substantial tax relief is to-day collecting from taxes as much as, if not more than, it was during the war. </para>

He makes a reduction of one tax and invites us to watch it closely. While we are doing that an increase is made elsewhere--not an increase of the rate of tax, I admit, but an increase in quantum. After all, if we are dealing with the same number of people and are getting, broadly speaking, the same quantum of tax from them, how in the name of- all that is holy can we claim that we have reduced taxes? The realistic test which the country must apply is: What do we still pay?

            <para>- This matter is directly linked with this bill. I claimed that Australia i3 the heaviest taxed country in the world. Last night the Treasurer undertook to supply a table of figures refuting thai, statement. .&#91; regret that wo have not that information, before us now, because I shall&#39; be interested to see whether that tabic includes not merely income tax but also indirect taxes. Last year, on the figures which Hie Government .supplied as its estimate of tax receipts, out of a total of &#163;34S,000,000,  an  amount of &#163;120,000,000 was to be collected from indirect taxes. If the Government reduces income tax consumers will have additional money to expend on goods, thus increasing collections from talcs tax. excise and customs. That has been the experience of the Government in recent months. When the Treasurer supplies the- table I. suggest to him that he should not merely show the rates of tax in Great Britain. I agree with bini that taxes are very heavy in that country. At this distance I do not presume to criticize the domestic policy of the United Kingdom Government; but I am not prepared to accept as a guide for proper governmental policy in Australia what the Socialist Government in Great Britain is doing to the people of that country. I should like the Prime Minister to inform us how our rates of tax - and in rates of tax I include not only rates of income tax - compare with the taxes per head of the population in the United States of America, Canada, South Africa, and even New Zealand. I believe that it will be found that rates of tax in those countries are very much lower than they are in Australia. </para>

        <para>Earlier  this evening, the. Treasurer said,  o&#34;  another matter, that he  would  like to be fair to every one. He has been thoroughly unfair to Australian taxpayers in the manner in which he has allocated these remissions of income tax. To establish this particular point, I bring to the notice of the House the proportion of the national income which is still coming into the hands of the Government by way of revenue collections. If my overall figure, of &#163;1,200,000.000 for the national income is roughly correct, then it is also broadly true to say that the Government is now collecting approximately one-third of the total national income. We do not have to think very deeply in order t... appreciate what sort of. a burden that, is for any producing economy to carry. In reducing taxes, the T rea surer has seen fit to remove a substantial burden of the tax from a very large proportion of the Australian public. That has much to commend it. One can make a powerful argument in terms of social justice in favour of reducing taxes on the lower incomes to an absolute minimum, if not to vanishing point. That is not merely a matter which gives rise to a powerful argument; it can also bt. politically very popular. By the same token, it can be economically unsound if it is carried to such a point that the burden of taxes remaining on the rest of the taxpayers is such that thenceforth the. community does not give the production of which it is capable. That can easily happen. The goose that is laying the golden eggs might, lose its appetite for the task; and those with the job of carrying production for the rest of the community might find that the task has become too onerous. Then the total volume of production, might decline. No government can consider that it has handled this problem successfully if it. keeps production at the same level. In a country which is developing, as Australia is, we should be able to point to a steadily rising volume of production, a steady growth, of the national .income, and, in consequence, a progressive improvement of pur standards of living. Because I have found repeatedly a complete failure on the part of honorable members opposite to realize just what the impact of this tax burden can mean to the small business, or small country property-holder, I suggest that it would be a very good thing if every honorable member upon his election, to this Parliament were given his three years&#39; salary in advance and compelled to invest it in either a business or a property. If he did so, I am . certain that he would realize just what the impact of excessive tax rates can mean to the development - of the small business or property in which he invested his money. Every business which is carried on in the Commonwealth is a gold mine for the Commonwealth Government, whether it lie successful or not in the long run. or whether it returns reasonable profits to those whose money is invested in it. 1 shall comment briefly upon the experience of a small business.  First,  it has to pay tax on the pay-roll of its employees. The  employees themselves pay tax on the wages theydraw from the business, if the business purchases capital goods in order to continue in production it pays sales tax on those goods. All petrol used in the conduct of the business, and every telephone call that is made, or every stamp bought in the business, yields additional revenue to the Commonwealth. And when the goods themselves are manufactured and purchased by the genera! public, the sales tax paid on those goods further helps to swell the revenues of the Government. Finally, if after having contributed all this to the coffers of the Treasury, some profit remains to those who have invested their money and put their work into the business, the Government steps in again and levies further tax on those profits. That, of course, is not something I attack as a point of criticism; I am merely trying to impress upon the Government and its supporters the need to encourage all industry great or small, primary or secondary. Every industry conducted in this country, and every property from which production proceeds, is a source of revenue and wealthto the people of Australia. If the Government is going to ask a steadily diminishing number of taxpayers - because the Government is removinga great body of the wage-earners from the income tax field - to carry indefinitely a burden of tax which was imposed under the emergency conditions of war, we shall not obtain that development in Australia which we would otherwise achieve. All of us appreciate the fact that customarily money expended by governments is not expended with the same advantage as money expended by the private individual; and when the Government collects approximately one-third of our total national income, it means that, there is that much money less available to the community for the development that would normally take place if investments could be made by those with whom the funds would otherwise be left.I mention that point because our wartime experience in respect of taxation, what we believed to be the emergency policy of governments of those days, has quite clearly, under this measure, become the settled policy of the present Government. Those on the lower ranges of income should get what they are justly entitled to from our economy. But quite frequently there is loose thinking on the part of Government supporters on this matter. They seem to think that because persons earn good incomes on paper they are to be shot at for taxes,whereas the effect of harshly taxing such incomesso often retards some Australian industry which would be capable of giving additional employment and helping to improve the standard of living of the community. By way of contrast on this matter I direct the attention of honorable members to the experience of the United States of America and Soviet Russia. In the United States of America., where  tax  rates prior to the war were comparatively light, we witnessed the most remarkable industrial development in the history of any country, and associated with that development was a steady rise in the standard of living of the American people; whilst in Soviet Russia to-day, on the best evidence that a wide field of reading can produce, the standard of living of citizens in that country, which is a completely socialistic state, is very much inferior to that in countries which still rely upon private enterprise for their development. </para>
        <para>I emphasize that the capacityofthe Government to reduce taxes is not only affected by the reduction of government activities in various directions; it can also be affected by the economy with <inline font-style="italic">which money</inline> collected by the Government is expended. I have said before, and I believe that this view is shared by many honorable members, that we have surrendered far too much supervision of finance by the Parliament to the Government. 1 am at a loss to know why the Treasurer refuses to give to the Parliament an all-party committee such: as was recommended to him by the retiring War Expenditure Committee which would be able to scrutinize public expenditures. If the Government believes that these expenditures are being made to the best advantage, what has it to fear by removing the misgivings and concern of private members on that score? We believe that much of the Government&#39;s expenditure is wasteful. We believe that there is much departmental activity today which is simply a carry-over from i he war years, redundant and bureaucratic activities which have no place in a peace-time administration. I claim rh. at only through an all-party parliamentary committee on public expenditure shall we be able to supervise Government, expenditure to thu degree that is desirable. Therefore, I again ask the Prime Minister to consider that request, which was made to bini, not only by members of the Opposition, but also by honorable members opposite who were formerly members of the War Expenditure Committee, and which they believe proved its usefulness by being able to apply a brake on extravagant expenditure, and even by its very existence acted as a curb upon reckless and unwarranted departmental expenditure. It is commentary not merely on the apathy of the Government, but also on the aapathy and lethargy of the Parliament as a whole that honorable mem hers have not. insisted upon the appointment of suc.li a body. </para>
        <para>Finally, I wish to deal with the simplification oof our taxation legislation. I know that all governments set themselves the goal of simplifying the taxation law, so that not. only the Parliament but also private citizens can understand it. I read during this week that in France recently a. man. who had wrestled with his income tax return for three weeks had hanged himself. I am sure that many of us have often felt like doing that when we have had to wrestle with the returns that we are required to make periodically, and the tax assessments that we receive. If that is the situation in connexion with the filling in of returns and the study of tax assessments, what situation is caused by the mass of tax law that is now embodied in our Income Tax Assessment Act? Although this is merely an amending bill, the explanatory memorandum in connexion with it consists of 100 pages. Wc have placed before us a bill of somewhat similar proportions almost every year. Speaking frankly, as one who has had some training in the law and some experience in this Parliament, I have not begun to understand one-tenth of what is contained in our Income Tax Assessment Act. If that is true of me, it is also true of most honorable members, and certainly of 999 of every 1,00.0 members of the community generally. So, as wwe- have passed through the emergency period of the war and can reflect on some of the problems that were then created, I ask the Government to give real consideration to the simplification of our tax laws. Many amendments are proposed by the bill, and other desirable alterations have doubtless been brought to the notice of all members of the Parliament by interested organizations and parties. I. shall not, refer to them at this point, because T. oan do so at the committee stage nf the hill. But I do put it finally to the Prime Minister and his colleagues, that they cannot expect to maintain a healthy national economy if they continue indefinitely a burden of tax collection which represents one-third of the national, income. No country, particularly one that has an ageing population and vast resources to develop, could hope to carry on with such a burden and provide the reasonable standard of living which can be given if development is allowed to proceed as it should. We have to get out, of our minds the matter of political expediency and get into our minds a realization of what is sound for the economy of this country, not merely that which is popular with the electors at any given time. If that be done, not merely will a greater measure of justice be meted out to all sections of the community, but in addition Australia will advance as it should. </para>

          <para>.- .My remarks will be devoted principally, not to the bill itself, but to the resolution on which it is founded. I invite honorable members to study that resolution. At one time, our tax law embodied the sound principle that he who pays tax should be able to work out his own assessment. To the present-day income tax experts, that has become an old-fashioned idea. The position has now been reached at which even the experts have lost themselves in the maze which they have created. The act, its various interpretations, and the rulings upon  it,  have become so complicated that no two tax assessors are likely to arrive at the same conclusions. We must depend more upon their interpretation, not of the act but of the interpretations of the act, and much more upon their ability to understand ddepartmental rulings&#34; in respect of  it. Because of the way in which the matter is handled to-day, a tax assessment lias become a kind of lottery. Identical returns by two different taxpayers with l bc same amount of earnings in the same industry, and with the same claims for exemption, produce two different assessments. The returns are alike in everyway, but when the assessments arrive they are entirely different. The average taxpayer has given up attempting to work out what bc ought to pay. Until this new school of tax experts undertook the work of the taxpayer, each individual made out his own tax  return aand  knew what his assessment would be. When he had lodged his return, he knew to the penny what he would have to pay.  His  exemptions were fixed. He deducted from those his gross income, and. the calculation of the amount which he had to pay was a matter of simple arithmetic. It has now reached the realms of higher mathematics. It is about as easy to understand the theory governing atomic energy as it is to understand the tax tables. Even when the mathematician has finished his calculations, there is the unknown factor - the Commissioner&#39;s discretion. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#39;}</inline> The Commissioner has discretion over everything, no matter what the law may be. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Instead of introducing this measure which, no doubt, will make confusion the more confounded, the Treasurer would have been much better advised to have brought in a bill simplifying taxation procedure. Surely it is possible to reduce the amount of tax payable to a matter of simple .calculation. The present practice is to regard every taxpayer as a potential crook, so taxation law has been devised to close every possible loophole against evasion. But what has been the net result? The big tax evader has been able to find plenty of methods to outwit the experts; but the majority of taxpayers, honest, conscientious, and anxious to <inline font-style="italic">meet</inline> their just commitments, need no such refuge. Under the present system, they have no way of knowing what their commitments will be. So they are all placed in the position of being probable law-breakers. How many members of this House could. work out their own tax assessments bv applying the provisions of the resolution upon which this measure is founded ? Yet we are called upon to approve that resolution. The taxpayer is not even in the position of having the act or this bill before bini. I draw the attention of honorable members to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the resolution, which states - <inline font-style="italic">{a) If</inline> the tH.val.ilc&#39; income floes  not eexceed  &#163;1,000 the rate of tax for every &#163;1 of taxable income up to and including &#163;250 filial! lie nil and the rate of tax for every &#163;1 of taxable income in excess of &#163;250 shall be 25.032 pence increasing uniformly by .032 of one penny for every &#163;&#93; bv which the taxable income exceeds &#163;251. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fuller)</inline> has finished interjecting, I shall proceed. This House will shortly have fro vote on the taxation proposals that I have quoted, and of course they will become law; but I still say to honorable members, in. a friendly way of course, that an effort should be made to introduce some reforms. That criticism is not aimed at the Government but at the officials who are responsible for these things - the men who make governing and the task of members of Parliament difficult. How many people know what a &#34;notional income&#34; is? I do not know, let alone understand, how the tax on a &#34; notional income &#34; willbe w orked out. I have not heard of &#34; notional income and I doubt if any other honorable member has heard of it. How in the name of all that is good will this tax be worked out? The purpose of income tax legislation is surely not to produce a race of taxation experts, or to create mathematical wizards. In the past, it has always been believed that the purpose of such a measure is to raise revenue. So long as that purpose is realized and taxpayers are treated justly, taxation law should be as simple as possible, and that is what I am putting before the House. The stage has now been reached where the taxation law has become so complicated that the only way out appears to be an entirely new approach, and a new set of taxation principles. Every Treasurer knows how. much money he needs, and how much can be released in the various income groups by applying different scales of taxes. Should it not be possible to raise the revenue required by some simple formula ? If the Government&#39;s present experts are unable or unwilling to understand this elementary necessity for a reform of our income tax laws, then this Parliament should undertake the task. A committee of members of this House should be able to provide a practical set of taxation rules that would provide as much revenue as the present complicated system. That is what I am asking should be done. The same amount of revenue would he raised, but it would be done by a simple system easily understood by the people who have to pay. It is now provided in the act that the odd pence in an assessment are to be ignored. If a man&#39;s tax works out at &#163;25 7s. 7d., he is required to pay to the nearest1s., yet, on the way to the final figure, it is necessary to make twenty or more involved calculations, some of them to three places of decimals, not of a1s. but of a1d. Then, when all that is over, the department wants the tax to be paid to the nearest1s. That example demonstrates better than anything else the need for clarification and simplification. This Government should again try to evolve a . system under which a taxpayer can work out. his own assessment, and know just how much he has to pay. While the Income Tax Assessment Act is in its present chaotic condition we shall always have to be tinkering with it. When one taxation formula is tested in the courts, and found not to produce the results desired, a new formula has to be substituted. The Government will be well advised to examine the whole position without calling in the experts. A taxpayer, under the present system, may employ a taxation expert, even one who has comefrom the Taxation Department itself, who will make out his return from books accurately kept, buthe will not be able to say what the assessment will be. That is wrong and unjust. The act should be simple, honest and straightforward. If it were simplified, as I suggest, it would prevent a lot of ill feeling which at present exists. Most people are prepared to pay their taxes, but they resent the hardship and inconvenience now associated with making returns. </para>

          <para class="block">There are many more, but those which 1. Iia ve read illustrate the urgency of the matter. I have been informed that the sales tax section of the Taxation Department proposes to take over certain doors of Grace Building. Because of its central position, this space could be very useful to the Repatriation Department. Apparently the out-patients&#39; clinic is to remain at Randwick. I do not know whether other honorable- members have been there, but I was in hospital at Randwick during the war and, although I cannot express an opinion upon it from a medical practitioner&#39;s viewpoint, I gather that the clinic is out of date and unsatisfactory. That opinion has been expressed fairly generally by medical authorities. The establishment is a product of World War I. Grace Building is in the heart of the city. If the clinic were transferred to that location disabled j 1eli would not have to make the long journey to Randwick and would be saved considerable suffering and inconvenience. Specialists who now sacrifice time by travelling to and from Randwick would be able to devote more time each day to&#34; the treatment of the men who need their help. The department already uses six floors in the Grace Building. The tenth and eleventh floors are the ones in question. Preliminary plans prepared by the department provide for an outpatients&#39; department, a doctors&#39; room, a treatment room, and a dispensary on the tenth floor. A specialists&#39; room, and an X-ray plant and other equipment could he provided on the eleventh floor. The establishment of these facilities in the heart of the city would be of inestimable benefit to disabled ex-servicemen. 1 ask the Government to treat this as a matter- of urgency. If the space in the Grace Building cannot be made available, it should secure equivalent accommodation for the repatriation services which I have mentioned in another central situation. Everybody agrees that disabled ex-servicemen deserve the greatest possible consideration. The best way in which we can serve them is to provide good equipment for them in an easily accessible position. I hope that the Government will review the situation and arrive at a decision which will be satisfactory to all ex-servicemen. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. - I support the plea made by the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howse)</inline> on behalf of disabled ex-servicemen. I have no doubt that other honorable members received sheaves of telegrams from exservicemen who will be adversely affected by the proposed change in the plans of the Repatriation Department, caused by the demand of another department for office space in Grace Building. The area in question was reserved for the use of disabled ex-servicemen. Honorable members will recall that, when the Government first proposed to take over Grace Building, it met with a host of objections raised by commercial interests in Sydney. I was instrumental in arranging for deputations to wait upon various Ministers to ask that they should not be deprived of this space. The Government&#39;s answer to them was that it proposed to take over Grace Building for a specific purpose, namely, the housing of the administrative sections of the Repatriation Department under one roof. The Government pointed to the need of the Repatriation Department to have a central office in Sydney. Ministers said that this would be of very great advantage to ex-servicemen. They made a feature of the fact that an out-patients&#39; clinic would be established in the building so as to avoid the necessity for limbless men and others requiring treatment to traipse long distances to the Repatriation Hospital at Randwick. They pointed out also that Grace Building was conveniently situated for medical officers. who would be able to give more time to the treatment of ex-servicemen. Over SOO ex-servicemen are attending outpatient clinics of the Repatriation Department already, and the number is steadily increasing. Honorable members will appreciate the difficulties experienced by these men when they have to travel considerable distances from the city and move from one place to another in order to receive treatment. The Government; now has an excellent opportunity to centralize the whole of the out-patient branches of the Repatriation Department in one clinic. Everybody interested in this matter expected that it would take advantage of the opportunity. However, a branch of the Taxation Department now proposes to take over the office space which ought to be reserved for the needs of disabled ex-servicemen. It appears that, if there is a clash of opinion between ex-servicemen&#39;s interests and those nf some government department, the Government is prepared, in the main, to allow the ex-servicemen&#39;s claims to go by the board. Apparently the rights and privileges of ex-servicemen aare, not very important in the eyes of the Government. lt is. not -surprising that we receive bundles of telegrams protesting against the proposal. Ex-servicemen&#39;s organizations are protesting that their members will be inconvenienced to an extraordinary degree. . Men who have already had clinical treatment are vociferous in their appeals for our .assistance. They have had to tolerate a great deal of discomfort, and they have made many sacrifices and rendered valuable service to the community. I do not know what the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> thinks about this matter. In the past, Ministers for Repatriation have been &#34;game&#34; to stand up for the rights nf ex-servicemen against Cabinet opposition. Some of them were prepared even to resign their posts&#39; in the defence of the rights of ex-servicemen. The present Minister for Repatriation is entrusted with a very special duty. Apparently, some Ministers are prepared to overlook their obligation to ex-servicemen. Such Ministers, of course, have no personal knowledge of the difficulties experienced by ex-servicemen. They arc prepared.- when pressure is applied to them in Cabinet, to say : &#34; Yes, let the Repatriation Department be housed anywhere. &#34;What does it matter if ex-servicemen suffer? They have fought for the country, but their period of service is over ; they are broken and maimed, and they can be of no further use to us. Let us push them into -o-me corner, no matter where, and we shall find some excuse for doing so&#34;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister is charged with the definite and onerous duty of preserving the interests of ex-servicemen. His task is to make -sure that their needs are not neglected and to interpret the wishes of a grateful country with regard to ex-servicemen. If pressure has been brought to bear upon him by his Cabinet colleagues on behalf of some revenue-seeking department, his duty is to resist such pressure and to ensure that ex-servicemen secure the maximum amount of consideration that can be given to them on behalf of a very grateful community. The Government, which is supposed to represent the community, should bo no less grateful than are the people. It will be a standing disgrace to the Government if it refuses to yield to the pleas of those who ask that medical services of the Repatriation Department, be established at a central position in Sydney. If it fails to do as we ask. it will be revoking a definite undertaking by yielding to pressure exerted on behalf of a revenue department to the exclusion of the rights of disabled ex-servicemen, who will be forced to travel great distances at considerable inconvenience in order to secure clinical attention which is their right and which, in common justice, should he made readily available to them. Before public opinion becomes so overwhelming as to force the Minister to change his attitude on this matter, I ask him to take action to grant ex-servicemen the just treatment that is their due. </para>

As I pointed out previously, when the Bavin Government went to the country in. New South Wales, that honorable gentleman promised the electors that he would abolish the unemployment relief tax of 3d. in the &#163;1, but when he was returned to power he increased the tax to ls. in the &#163;1. He has been one of the greatest tragedies that this country has ever known, and it is one of the greatest regrets of my political life .that I followed him. </para>

            <para>. - I am somewhat amused by the attitude of some members of the Opposition. I do not include the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howse)</inline> in this category, but I do include the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> who has for a long time past, and particularly during the war years when accommodation in Sydney was so difficult to obtain, accused the Government of &#34;spreading out&#34; all over the city and needlessly occupying space which could have been made available to ex-servicemen who wished to re-establish themselves in business. Now, when if, is proposed that the Taxation Department should occupy portion of its own building and vacate other premises which might be made available to the ex-servicemen for whom he is so solicitous, he says that that is wrong. The plain fact is that in the view of the honorable member the Government is never right and never  erin  be right. </para>

          <para>Possession was taken of Grace Building in August, 1942, under a hirings order issued under National Security Regulations, and during the war the building was used for United States Forces&#39; and Royal Navy and Commonwealth services. The property was acquired by the Commonwealth on the 8th November, 1945. by compulsory process, &#34; for the purposes of the Commonwealth &#34;, while the building was still occupied by the defence services. It is a fact that the Repatriation Commission initiated the proposal to acquire the building, .but at no time has it been understood or intended that the building was for the exclusive use of the commission. Statements in the press that the appeal lodged, by Grace Brothers against the resumption was made mainly because it was planned to establish <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> repatriation clinic are not correct. The appeal was lodged solely against the Commonwealth power to acquire the property and the validity of the Lands </para>
          <para>Acquisition. Act, and tailed on that ground. </para>
          <para>Subsequent to acquisition, space in the building was allotted, as follows : - </para>
          <para>Basement and ground floor - PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department. </para>
          <para>First . floor - Department of Postwar  Reconstruction  and Department of .Labour and National Service. </para>
          <para>Second floor - War Service Homes Commission. </para>
          <para>Third floor - Department of Postwar Reconstruction. </para>
          <para>Fourth to ninth floors - Repatriation Commission. </para>
          <para>Tenth floor - Taxation Branch. </para>
          <para>Eleventh floor - Repatriation Commission. </para>
          <para>The tenth floor was originally allotted to the Repatriation Commission to be used in conjunction with the ninth and eleventh floors as a clinic. It was intended that the tenth and eleventh floors should be used as the outpatients&#39; department of the commission, but those floors are still occupied by the Royal Navy, which is now arranging to vacate. The very urgent need for additional space of other departments led to a  reexamina1 ion  of all allocations in the building by a sub-committee of Cabinet. Following an inspection of Randwick Hospital by Ministers and careful consideration of the matter by the Cabinet sub-committee, the Minister for Repatriation agreed that the Repatriation Commission should, in company with other departments in Sydney, reduce its present requirements to an absolute minimum and release the tenth floor for occupation by the Taxation Department on the understanding that it would revert to the commission at the earliest possible date. The allocation of the tenth floor to the Taxation Department is not considered as permanent. Further, those parts of the clinic intended to occupy the ninth and eleventh floors will do so. It is, therefore, not correct to say, as reported, that the occupation of the tenth floor by the  Taxation Department has stopped the move of the clinic from Randwick. </para>
          <para>That is the history of Grace Building up to three months ago. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Calare raised, in very temperate fashion, the matter of the outpatients&#39; clinic at Grace Building. It is perfectly true that when I became Minister for Repatriation the ninth, tenth and eleventh floors of that building were intended to be used as an out-patients&#39; clinic and the military hospital at Randwick was no longer to be used for that purpose. Randwick Hospital has been used as an out-patients&#39; clinic since World War I., and while it is a fact that it is out of the way, hard to reach and inconvenient, the fact remains that for many years past it has been used for that, purpose. It is also true that the fares of all out-patients who travel to Randwick are paid by the Repatriation Department. I agree with all that has been said about Randwick as an outpatient centre. It is unsuitably located and lacks conveniences. It would be ideal to have the out-patients treated at Grace Building in the centre of the city. The head office and the out-patients department would be under the one roof. The intention is that that ideal shall ultimately be realized. In any large city, however, it is hard to get accommodation for Commonwealth departments. The public has a similar problem as building has not kept pace with expansion of industry in the last few years. Because of expanded activities, the Taxation Department must have additional space. Sydney has been searched for it without avail. The Repatriation Commission was faced with  the  fact that it did have accommodation, admittedly unsatisfactory, at Randwick for out-patients. It was put to me th&#39;at wc .should therefore try to squeeze up a little in Grace Building to allow the Taxation Department to have at least one floor until other accommodation could be found for it. I agreed. In fact I made the suggestion that if the department would he satisfied with one floor, and my colleagues in the Ministry agreed, they could have  it  I take full responsibility for the arrangement. I shelter behind no one. I agreed to the proposal and that decision will stand. As soon as the Royal Navy vacates the tenth and eleventh floors the Taxation Department will go on to the filth, and the eleventh will be occupied by a part of our out-patients department. 1 r was originally suggested that we should occupy the tenth floor, and not the eleventh, but because of the layout, of the eleventh planned by the Repatriation Commission we agreed to let the Taxation Department have the tenth. Whatever is said or done, and regardless of how many telegrams I receive and how many representations may be made &#62;by honorable members, that arrangement will stand as far as I am concerned, because I believe it is the best that can be made in the circumstances. It gives equity to all concerned. Weeks ago I told a section of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#39;s Imperial League of Australia what was proposed. Only now are protests being lodged. Honorable members opposite are not the only people who have received telegrams. I have sheaves of them. I received many to-night. I believe that I am doing no injustice to ex-servicemen, because I think the Taxation Department&#39;s occupancy of the tenth floor of Grace Building will not inconvenience the Repatriation Department for long. Statements that the Government lacks appreciation of the services of ex-servicemen and has no knowledge of, or interest in, them are irresponsible, and show little concern for, and do a disservice to, them. </para>

              <para>- No; I realize that. It will not provide for &#39;all out-patients, but it will provide for X-ray and other technical treatment. Men needing that treatment will not have to go to Randwick any more Two things are being done: Attention is being provided for them in the central office &#39;and congestion is being relieved at Randwick. Everything is being done to meet a difficult situation. Shortage of space is at the bottom of the problem. We are doing our best in this difficult period to give equitable treatment to every one concerned. As soon as the Taxation Department can be provided for elsewhere, it will vacate the tenth floor, because, as the Prime Minister said to me, &#34;Grace Building is recognized as the home of exservicemen and is to be made available to them at the earliest possible date&#34;.  </para>

The most recent vessel which loaded for Singapore, <inline font-style="italic">Marella,</inline> has all her freezer and cooler space allotted to service and civil affairs cargo and this position also applies to <inline font-style="italic">M angola</inline> which is the next vessel to load for Singapore. Generally speaking apart from refrigerated space there is little or no shortage of shipping space for Singapore .it the present time for ordinary cargoes. </para>

              <para>TheInternational Emergency Food Council replaced the Combined Food Board which was established in June, . 1042. The members ofthe board were the United Kingdom, United States of America and subsequently, Canada. A number of commodity committees functioned under the board and made recommendations to the board for the distribution of foodstuffs in short supply. Australia was represented <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> some of these committees. With the termination of the war, the board&#39;s war-time functions, viz. - determination of the best use and distribution of Allied food supplies and effecting economies in their transport - were adapted to the needs of the transitional period andmem- bership of its commodity committees was expanded. The special meeting on urgent food problems, held at Washington in May, 1946, under the auspices of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, recommended the replacement of the Combined Food Board by a new body representative of all important food importing or exporting countries. This body was called the International Emergency Food Council and initially, its commodity committees were those of the Combined Food Board, Membershipof one or more commodity committees entitled a country to a seat on the council. Membership of a commodity committee is open to any country having an important interest in the international trade in the commodity in question. Australia being represented on a number of commodity committees was thus qualified to sit on the council and accepted membership. </para>

            <para>The facts of the matter are that by Prices Regulation Order No. 1 the price of hides was raised by 20 per cent, above the levels ruling on 1st September,1939. This price increase is passed on by the merchants in the form of a&#34;surcharge&#34; varying in accordance with the differences in the costs of different types of leather. These &#34;surcharges&#34; range from 16 per cent, on sole leather to 201/2 per cent, on sheep skins.In no way is this &#34; surcharge&#34; a tax or impost by the Government, it being purely a method of fixing a price schedule for leather based on the 1939 level of prices. </para>
