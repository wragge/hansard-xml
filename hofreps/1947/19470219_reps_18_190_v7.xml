                        <para>- The manufacture of wire and wire netting is still suffering from the effects of the war. Whereas in pre-war years about 12,000 tons of wire was produced annually, of which a fair proportion was exported, at present only about 7,8.00 tons is being produced each year. In the circumstances, the Government has prohibited the export of wire and wire netting. About twelve months ago my department took over the control of the manufacture and distribution of wire used in making wire netting with the result that the production has practically doubled. The Government is encouraging the manufacture of wire for essential purposes and has received assurances that additional factories for the manufacture of this commodity will be established. One new factory is expected to commence production by the end of this year, and it is hoped that Australia will soon again enter the export market for this commodity. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware of the matters to which the honorable member has referred. All industrial tribunals have that power. So far as I know, practically all shire and municipal councils in New South Wales are working under State awards. Commonwealth Public Service employees are in precisely the same position; the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator can, on application by the unions covering such employees, increase within the limits of the formula, the marginal payments to such employees. The unions covering Commonwealth Government employees number 22, and they have presented a claim to the Public Service Commissioner, but not to the Public Service Arbitrator. It was realized that that number of unions could not be heard separately, and so the High Council of the Public Service unions - a body representing 22 unions of Commonwealth Government employees - requested that five representatives of the High Council should meet the Public Service Commissioner, and myself if necessary, to discuss their claim. It was  pointed  out that postal employees were not affiliated with the High Council, and . it was decided to ask their representative, Mr. Dwyer, the federal secretary, to join with the representatives of the High Council in discussing the matter with the Public Service Board, and with me, as the Minister administering the Public Service. The discussions began on the 14th February, and ' have continued. The representatives of the unions again met the Public Service Commissioner last week. Certain offers were made regarding adjustments, and I understand that they have referred the matter to their unions. So far, no claim has been submitted to the Public Service Arbitrator, who is the person to determine the matter, but I understand that a move will be made very shortly. I cannot give the honorable member any further information at this stage. </para>

                            <para>- I can give the right honorable gentleman an assurance that T. have not submitted in writing any figures at all. It is true that on one occasion, when representatives of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions were in Canberra, they raised the subject of taxation, but I cannot remember whether it related specifically to taxation of incomes under £300 a year. I do not think it did. As I remember it, the  president  of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions asked me for information about any proposed tax reductions, and it is true that I made some remarks on the subject, but I did not submit any figures. I may have mentioned some amount in what was a very short talk, lasting five minutes perhaps. The Minister for Health &gt;(Senator McKenna) addressed a union conference in Melbourne, and I think he discussed taxation, and submitted some figures, but no proposals regarding taxation were made by Senator McKenna or by me. As for the second part of the right honorable gentleman's question, I am always delighted to give him all the information I possibly can. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable member knows, the Federal Aid Roads Agreement terminates on the 30th June next. The Minister for Transport and a sub-committee of Cabinet have been examining the agreement in order to ascertain whether it should be continued, and if so, in what form, and what amount should be paid to the States under it. An opportunity has been taken to hear the views of the various authorities associated with road transport, and the Minister for Transport has discussed the matter with the State Transport Advisory Council, and with representatives of those shires and municipalities which are' making claims for some share of the moneys set aside for road construction and maintenance. Representations have also been made in the matter by other bodies, including the Royal Automobile Club. I hope that within the next week the Government will be able to announce its decision in regard to the allocation of moneys for this purpose. </para>

The matter will be taken up first with the Government of the United Kingdom and other British governments, and then with governments of the Allied Nations.

It must be quite obvious that when claims of this nature are pursued we must act jointly with other allied countries concerned. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that the personnel of the Joint Coal Board has to be approved by the Premier of New South Wales and myself as also has the person selected to act as a Coal Industry Tribunal, which is the industrial authority under the relevant legislation. Great difficulty has been experienced by the Premier of New South Wales and myself in getting suitable men to occupy the positions. Apparently there was a general fear that the task of maintaining peace in this troublous industry would be very difficult. Ultimately, three men were selected and their names announced, and nearly every part of the act has been proclaimed. There has been a little delay in the gazettal of the names of the members of the Joint Coal Board due to some legal difficulty in regard to the terms of the agreement with these particular individuals, but the  chairman  actually commenced his preparatory work on the 1st January, and, I understand, the other members, although their names have not yet been gazetted, are engaged in surveying the position. I am hopeful that these names will be gazetted within the next week. Some difficulty has been experienced also in connexion with the appointment of a Coal Industry Tribunal. The appointment is for seven years, and as certain legal qualifications are necessary, an endeavour has been made to secure the services of a member of the legal profession, acceptable to both the Premier of New South Wales and myself. I hope to be able to make an announcement in regard to the tribunal to-morrow night. It is true that I have received information about the possibility of a general strike in the industry. It is not the first intimation of that character that I have received. </para>

                        <para>.- On the 8th November, 1946, the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) asked the Prime Minister questions relating to published allegations that the electoral rolls used in the Ashfield by-election held on the 9th November, 1946, contained the names of more than 1,000 persons who did not live in the electorate. The Prime Minister instructed me as the Minister responsible for the administration of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to have an investigation made with the object of ascertaining whether there was any truth in the allegations. Accordingly, the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth was directed to undertake a searching inquiry. </para>

I understand that Meggitts Limited, of Sydney, is already taking some steps by which it is supplying seed to certain people from whom in turn it will buy the linseed.

The Commonwealth Department of Commerce and Agriculture will cooperate. </para>

                                <para>- The point raised by the honorable member arises in regard to the training of all classes of ex-servicemen. I have previously explained to the House that it is the intention and the objective of those who are in charge of the training scheme to have a flow of trainees coming out into the community at a rate at which they can be absorbed. It is not always possible to ensure that the number of trainees being released for any particular industry will coincide exactly with the number that can be absorbed in that industry. Perhaps the trouble is more acute in respect of agriculture than it is in respect of other industries. One reason why it is impossible to ensure that all the trainees will be placed in industry or, in connexion with agriculture, will be placed on farms, is that the necessary accommodation, and the training staffs needed for their training, are not available except in so far as they can be obtained from State governments. Consequently, we have to ensure that the existing training facilities in the States shall be used continuously. This means that ex-servicemen must enter those training institutions in batches. Sometimes, when a number of men have completed their training it is not possible to absorb all of them immediately or, in respect of men proposing to go on the land, it is not possible to place them on farms immediately. The Government has considered that those individuals who cannot be placed in appropriate industries immediately their training has been completed ought to take every opportunity to find employment for themselves. They are encouraged to do so. At the present time, of course, more jobs are available in the community than there are men to fill them. Perhaps it is rather hard to expect individuals who have been trained for settlement on the land to take a job of some other kind. I shall examine that point, with a view to determining whether special' consideration can be given to trainees in that class. I point out, however, that in the last resort, since there are plenty of jobs available in the community, no absolute hardship is caused, because those men can obtain employment of some kind to bridge the gap between the completion of their training and the availability of their farms for settlement by them. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Prime Minister aware that because of the shortage of refined sugar, some fruit canneries in Victoria are obliged to refuse to accept pears for canning at the present time? At the moment, this statement applies, not to every cannery but to several important ones, and it is expected that within several days, every cannery in &gt;Victoria will be compelled to cease the canning of pears and peaches. Is the Prime Minister aware that if this shortage of refined sugar is not overcome, thousands of tons of peaches and pears, which are valuable items of food, will be lost to the Australian public and the people of the United Kingdom ? Does the right honorable gentleman know that this position arises as the result of 21 maintenance engineers in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited in Melbourne ceasing work? They acted upon the direction of their union, not because of any specific dispute that they have with the company which employs them, but because of the extension of a dispute with other employers. Will the Prime Minister state whether the Government has taken any action to expedite the return to work of these men in order to avoid monetary loss to fruit-growers, the loss of employment to orchard and cannery workers, and the loss of valuable food ? In addition, has the Prime Minister done anything, as an emergency step, to make good this shortage of sugar by arranging for the transport of supplies from other States? </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria, Mr. Cain, have been and still are negotiating for the purpose of obtaining refined sugar from other States. I understand that some thousands of tons have been guaranteed, if not already delivered. The honorable member asked whether anything has been done to get the maintenance engineers back to work, as their absence from employment is the real cause of the shortage of refined sugar in Victoria. Before I answer that, I suggest that the honorable member does not know all the facts, and should not have introduced that matter into a question. I do not desire to enter into a discussion of that phase of it. He had no reason to do so. ' If we investigated that phase of the matter, I should have to inform the honorable member that the company was a party to a lock-out. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member dragged in the " red herring ", and I could not let his reference pass without comment. The honorable member asked whether the Government had taken any steps to get the maintenance engineers back to work. The answer is that the Government has taken action. The matter has been referred to the court, as the honorable member probably knows, and Judge Sugerman - an appropriate name in this dispute - has referred it to Commissioner Mooney. The Commissioner called the parties together on Monday and told them that he had been requested to hear their claims and make a decision. He said that he would do so and commenced the hearing. Then - and this answers the honorable gentleman's question - Commissioner Mooney suggested that the hearing be suspended temporarily to ascertain whether an arrangement could be made for the men to resume work at the sugar refinery immediately. He suggested that the parties work out a formula which would enable the 30 men concerned - not 21 as stated by the honorable member - to go back to the refinery so as to relieve the situation, which is as urgent as the honorable member has said. The parties then met in an attempt to evolve a means of getting the men back to work on a " blank cheque " basis before the commissioner came to a decision. The parties had three difficulties to overcome. The first was whether the men would be paid, according to the final decision made by the commissioner, retrospectively to the day when they returned to the refinery. The second related to annual leave payments for the men, who wished to ensure that the break would not interfere with their rights. The third related to payments from the provident fund to which all employees at the refinery contribute. The men wished to have their rights in that regard safeguarded also. They have not been able to secure a satisfactory settlement on these three points, on which agreement ought to 'be reached. In nine out of ten instances in disputes of this nature, such difficulties are ironed out, usually without any trou'ble. Until 1.30 p.m. to-day, the parties had not found a solution of the problems raised, but they will be called together again by the commissioner to-morrow and I believe and hope that he will help to work out a' formula which will enable the men to go back to work. </para>

                            <para>- No. The men have been asked to go back to work before a decision is made in connexion with the general engineers' dispute. They may or may not get a satisfactory award. They have been asked to do so on account of the urgency of the sugar position. This would amount to them returning to work on a " blank cheque " basis. I consider that they were justified in asking that their leave payments and provident fund contributions should be safeguarded, and that the retrospective payment of any increase should be promised to them before they agreed to return to work. That was a. fair request. </para>

If there grave discontent among them? Do they complain of great delay having occurred in the hearing of a claim by the Public Service Arbitrator? Will the Prime Minister appoint a delegate of the Public Service Arbitrator to hear immediately the case of the officers represented by the delegation, and issue to him instructions to bring down an interim flat-rate award and then to proceed to the making of a final award and a re-classification of the Commonwealth Public Service? </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable gentleman expects me to answer his question, he should listen to what I have to say. The High Council represents 22 unions in the Public Service, and I assume that quite a number of rank and filers are members of those unions. It has been pointed out that the postal workers are not affiliated with that body. The High Council appointed five representatives, and the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union appointed one representative. Those representatives of Public Service unions have had numerous consultations with the Public Service Commissioner. I have always been available to meet them, if necessary, and discussed the matter with them at an earlier stage. A further final consultation was held last week, when certain suggestions were placed before the representatives of the unions. There is not, as yet, any claim before the Public Service Arbitrator, but I understand that one will be lodged very shortly - I do not know the exact date - by all the unions. Those unions that have made representations are the official representatives of all the Public Service bodies. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for External Affairs a question arising out of a statement made by the Minister for Transport in Sydney in December last. Addressing a meeting of his constituents, the Minister for Transport said, "No one is capable of judging whether Australia should be a party to the Bretton Woods Agreement or not unless in possession of the confidential files which were in the hands of the Federal Cabinet ". I now ask the Minister for External Affairs whether caucus was in possession of those confidential files when it decided that Australia should not be a signatory to the Bretton Woods Agreement. Further, can he say when the information contained in the files will be placed before the Parliament so that members also may be aware of the facts? </para>

                            <para>- The Government has plans, and is negotiating  with  the States, which are in control of materials. It hopes to get a reasonable allocation of the materials available. Last week the Government of New South Wales agreed to make available to the Commonwealth a quota of such materials. Negotiations with the 'other State Governments will continue, and it is hoped that a per centage of the materials available will be allocated to the construction of war service homes. Already over 6,000 houses have been built, and of that number more than 50 per cent, have been allocated to ex-servicemen. </para>

                        <para>- The persons referred to were military prisoners in the hands of the Dutch authorities because of their refusal to continue to serve in the Dutch army after trouble occurred between the Indonesian and Dutch peoples. They were sentenced to terms of imprisonment; but last year the Dutch Government granted them an amnesty. The Dutch military authorities handed the men over to the Australian Government for repatriation to Indonesia  when  shipping was available. As in the case of other Indonesians in Australia, these men refused to sail in Dutch ships, and the Commonwealth Government thought that the best and most humane way to deal with the problem was to care for them until such time as British or Australian shipping was available to take them back to Indonesia. Already about 2,200 Indonesians have been repatriated ; <inline font-style="italic">Esperance Bay</inline> has made one trip and <inline font-style="italic">Manoora</inline> two trips for the purpose. </para>

                            <para>- No. The Commonwealth Government is anxious to see the end of this problem, which is one of many which arose out of the war. The maintenance of these Indonesians is costing the people of Australia about £200 a week. There is no cost for guards, because the men in the camp are law-abiding, and are giving the authorities no trouble. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">byleave-</inline> The New Zealand Minister, Mr. Sullivan, visited Australia in December, 1945, and asked whether Australia could supply New Zealand with wheat for a period of five years at an agreed uniform price. It was recognized that if such an arrangement were made it would have to be at a price much lower than the rate being obtained for export wheat at the time - 9s. 6d. a bushel f.o.b. - but, on the other hand, it would be much higher than that to which, based on past records, prices might be expected to fall during the period of the agreement. The New Zealand Minister also pointed out that very high import prices would be followed by high prices for the New Zealand crop, and that even though very low prices followed, uneconomic production in New Zealand would be stimulated, and imports reduced in consequence. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Government ultimately decided, however, that it could not sell from the then current crop - 1945- 46 - under the ruling export price and a contract was completed for 4,500,000 bushels to be supplied out of that crop at 9s. 6d. a bushel f.o.b. bulk. The contract contained other details such as the extra price for bagged wheat and shipping arrangements. When this contract was under discussion the question of supplies for the following four years arose, and it was agreed that in due course a further agreement be negotiated. In discussing the price that might be included in a further agreement, we agreed that a fall in export prices was possible and that if prices did fall away in the following twelve months from the then current price, the price for four years would be a matter for discussion. It was agreed, however, that the price would be no higher than 5s. 9d. a bushel. It might be less but it would not be more. No other details were decided upon and no contract was made as in the case of the 1945-46 crop, the understanding being that it would be negotiated later and if it were made the price would be no greater than 5s. 9d. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - The statement read by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture reveals for the first time to the wheat-growers and the public the  attempt which was apparently made by the Commonwealth Government to sell a product which, in all equity, belonged to the Australian wheat-growers, at a price much less than half of its realizable value on any normal export market. This matter raises the whole question of the propriety of any government in this country arbitrarily taking possession of the products of persons and arbitrarily disposing of them, by virtue of its constitutional power, at prices substantially less than those which could have been realized had ordinary trading been permitted. This matter would never have come to the knowledge of the Australian wheatgrowers </para>

                                <para>- I take no exception to the interjection. We are accustomed to interjections of that kind from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I repeat that this matter would never have come to the knowledge of the Australian wheat-growers had not the New Zealand Minister for Supply fortuitously revealed, to the embarrassment of his Labour colleague in the Australian Government, that an " undertaking " - to use his own words - had been given by the Australian Government to supply wheat to New Zealand, for a period of years, at a price less than half the prevailing world parity price. Over a period of months, I asked repeatedly in this Parliament for information about this matter, and the wheatgrowers' representatives outside Parliament also sought information. We asked whether any negotiations had taken place with a view to disposing of wheat to the Government of New Zealand at the price mentioned. However, we were met by a stone wall of silence, and only now has it been possible for me, and the representatives of the growers associated with me, to force the Government to recant its original intention, and conclude an arrangement which honours the undertaking to sell wheat to New Zealand at a bargain price by placing on the Australian taxpayers the burden of making good to the wheat-growers the money of which they would have been deprived had we not been attentive to their inter ests, and directed public attention in  such  a way as to compel the granting of this measure of delayed justice  to the  Australian wheat-grower. </para>
