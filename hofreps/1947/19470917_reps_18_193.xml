            <para>- The newspaper report to  which  the leader of the Opposi  tion  has referred is correct except that it is also proposeto exclude twotrustee savings banks in Tasmania, namely, the Hobart Savings Bank andtheLaunceston Savings Bank. Under the Constitution, State banks are excluded also, but. apart  from  these the Government, does propose to submit to Parliament a bill for the nationalization  of  Banking in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition also asked  whether  the Government intended to submit the issue to the people in a referendum or  in  some other  way.TheGovernment  has been informed by its legal advisers that, under the Constitution, the Commonwealth Parliament has complete power to legislate in respect of banking in Australia, other than State banks. That power was given to the Commonwealth Parliament by the people off Australia. The Government does propose to submit such legislation; itdoes not propose to hold any referendum on the subject. </para>
