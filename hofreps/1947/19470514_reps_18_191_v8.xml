                    <para>Owing to the failure of the Federal Treasury to honour an arrangement made in August, 1946,by the Sydney Office of the Prices Control Branch to pay Sydney Ferries a subsidy of 6d. per week for each employee of Cockatoo Island carried by that company between the island and the mainland, the ferry company has informed the management of Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company that it will discontinue all ferry services to the island after May 31st. This will mean that I and about 2,600 other employees of Cockatoo Docks will be deprived of our means of livelihood. </para>

<para> This matter was brought to my notice last night by the honorable member for Reid, who sent to me a copy of a letter he had received in respect of it. Early in the operation of the prices stabilization scheme, it became evident that, because of increased costs, these ferries could not continue to give the service required of them at the fares then charged. The Prices Stabilization Committee, not the Prices Branch, with a view to conforming with the Government's desire to keep prices generally stabilized, and to obviate an increase of the wages of the employees, to which they would be entitled if they were required to pay additional fares, decided that a subsidy of 6d. a week in respect of each employee at Cockatoo Island Dockyard should be paid to the ferry company. The matter of remuneration no longer has to be considered. I understand the position to be that the men are not prepared to pay a fare of 2s. a week and that the company will not continue to provide this transport service unless the fare is 2s. weekly. According to the document handed to me by the honorable member for Reid, the continuance of the service is dependent upon whether or not the men will bear the increased charge of 6d. a week. I can only say, in reply to the representations of both the honorable member for Wentworth and the honorable member for Reid, that I am having the matter re-examined. Involved in its consideration is the question whether the Government is to subsidizethe fares which workmen have to pay in order that they may be transported to their places of employment. If that were done in this instance, there would be a strong claim for the application of the principle in other instances. </para>

                    <para>- Previously, the honorable gentleman raised this subject in connexion with the International Children's Emergency Organization and post-Unrra relief generally. As the Prime Minister announced on Monday, Cabinet proposes that a total sum of £4,000,000 be allocated by Australia in the current year towards those and other objects. That sum includes the grant to the International Children's Relief Fund and general commitments for relief in the post-Unrra period, because the activities of Unrra will terminate in June. It also covers our contribution to the International Organization and educational rehabilitation work by Unesco. </para>

I also saw yesterday a denial by the Unrra organization of some of those charges, or a statement that they were greatly exaggerated. However,I shall look into the matter, and the departmental committee that will be appointed to suggest a method of administering the post-Unrra relief fund will be made aware of the alleged deficiencies in the organization of Unrra. The administration of Unrra in certain respects was criticized by its own director, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. La</inline> Guardia. It should be possible to avoid the recurrence of causes for such criticism in the new organization. </para>

The preservation of brands of Australian butter is an old problem. It is a very desirable objective, and anything that my department, or the Government, can do in that direction when normal trading conditions are restored, we shall be ready to do.

                        <para>- All developmental works, with the exception of those carried out exclusively by the Commonwealth itself in Commonwealth territory, such as the Northern. Territory or the Australian Capital Territory, are financed through the Loan Council. The States make application for their respective programmes. These programmes are prepared by theState Co-ordinators of Works in consultation with the Commonwealth Co-ordinator-General of Works, and an overall programme is presented to the Loan Council. It then rests with the Loan Council to decide what money will be made available through that body for particular works in each particular year. The establishment of. the National Works Council somewhat extended that scheme. Although that body has not the status of the Loan Council, Governments rely upon it to prepare a series of  works for a number of years ahead. The money made available at the last meeting of the Loan Council 'for various work? will not be fully expended this financial year. A. review of all works submitted by the States will be made at the next meeting of the Loan Council which will probably be held in August. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Attorney-General whether it is correct as reported in a section of today's press that he told the federal executive of the Australian Labour party that a move to declare " black " the Australian guided weapons testing range, launched by certain trade union leaders, was inspired and directed from sources outside Australia? Is it also true that lie told the executive that he had a. pie evidence to prove this? If so, will he now say what that evidence is? </para>

                        <para>- I have not  seen  the newspaper report referred to. It is correct that I discussed, at the request of the federal executive, the recent threat by some organization to declare this project " black ". I was not making a public address, and no note was made of it, so far as I know. I said that, in my opinion, the objection to the project was not based on concern for the welfare c-f the Australian aborigines, but was part of a plan to prevent the scheme from being operated at. all. I. also said that a pamphlet which was being circulated in Australia by the Communist party .showed clearly that their objection was to defence preparations, and was not. inspired by concern for the aborigines. That is, in itself, a very serious matter, mid the Prime Minister dealt with it in answer to a question yesterday. The pamphlet referred to, completely misstates the intention of the Government. The project is not an  aggresive  threat by Australia, but is directed simply to the defence of the British Commonwealth, so that criticism pf it is quite unjustified. That is the substance of what I said. </para>

                            <para>- I have no idea how many persons admitted as refugees since the war commenced have gone to live in Tasmania, but I do know, from figures furnished to me by the Commonwealth Statistician early this year, that of the 700 refugees admitted to Australia on landing permits issued since I became Minister for Immigration, the number who went to reside permanently in Tasmania was precisely four. I do not know that Victorians or South Australians or Tasmanians or Western Australians or people living elsewhere in Australia are justified in feeling anxious ' about any migrants who come to this country. Such persons are admitted if they are in good health and of good character. Those who seek to discriminate on racial or religious grounds between various sections of people who come to Australia are themselves not good Australians. </para>

 <para>I have not seen, the statement to which the honorable member has referred. The question, of the supply of linseed oil to the painting industry was dealt with fully last week by the Minister for Works and Housing, who indicated that, every effort was being made to get all possible supplies, including the quota that has been allotted to Australia by the organization that makes world allocations of linseed oil. Considerable difficculty exists in obtaining linseed oil from India due to internal difficulties in that country and not to any lack of initiative on the part of the Commonwealth Government. I assure the honorable member that the Minister for Works and Housing and the Government are doing everything possible to obtain maximum supplies of this necessary commodity. </para>

                        <para>- The Government is continuing to develop the fishing industry. About eighteen months ago the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction initiated an investigation of the industry to ascertain what could be done to assist its development. Conferences were heldbetween the Director of Commonwealth Reconstruction Training and the Fisheries Division of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and a plan was evolved to train approximately 360 ex-servicemen for the fishing industry. The plan was to talk two years to complete. The men were to be trained in four monthly periods. The first school was established in New South Wales and started operations in January of this year with 58 trainees. Instruction was given in navigation, control and operation of diesel engines, care of modern fishing equipment, the keeping of records, and the economics of the industry generally.  Any doubt that the ex-servicemen entering this healthy outdoor industry would be permanently employed upon completion of their training has been dispelled by a further investigation which shows that up to date there has been a continuous demand for all categories of employees from ordinary fishing hands to men capable of takig charge of trawlers. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro may rest assured that the Government has taken action that will be of permanent assistance to the industry, and that healthy employment is being provided for ex-servicemen suffering from certain disabilities as the result of their war service. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the very  greats importanceto Australia of the wool industry, which in pre-war years was responsible for approximately 42 per cent. of the total value of exports from Australia, and having regard to the fact that the United States of America is at present the second-largest purchaser of Australian wool. I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has taken any action to protest against the bill now before the United States Congress providing, amongst other things, for the imposition of  an  import fee of up to  50  per cent. ad valorem on all. wool imported into the United States of America in addition to the existing tariff of 34 cents per lb.? If such a protesthas been made, was it only directed through the Australian delegation to the International Conference on Trade and Employment? In view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Douglas</inline> Boyd,  chairman  of the Australian Wool Board, is reported to have stated that if the measure was passed by Congress " It might easily sound the death knell of the use of' Australian wool in America", I ask the right honorable gentleman whether any approaches have been made to the other great wool exporting countries, South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina, with a view to making a common protest to the United States Government against the measure? If not, will the Government immediately take up the matter with the governments of those countries?Will the Government also consider sending forthwith a delegation to Washington comprising  a  Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murphy, chairman</inline> of the  Australian  Wool Realization Commission, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boyd,</inline> chair man of the Australian Wool Board, to negotiate with the Government of the United States of America on the highest plane? </para>

                            <para>-The position is that the legislation, which is now before the American Congress, will give power to the Secretary for Agriculture to impose very high restrictions on the use of imported wool. Apart from that, of course, the present rate of duty on wool entering America is 34 cents per lb. I have no doubt that, if such a provision were made in regard to wool, it would probably apply also to woollen piece goods. The honorable gentleman asked whether a protest would be made to the United States Government. I do not know that it is the duty of the Commonwealth. Government to make public protests to any other government as to the type of legislations that it passes. That is not usually done. That is a matter for determination not by the Government, but by the people through their Parliament. Australia has delegates at the Geneva conference; at which this matter has come under discussion. The honorable gentleman may rest assured that the views of the Commonwealth Government, and,I imagine, of the other Dominion Governments, have been made perfectly clear on this subject. If the legislation should he passed, it could have very serious effects on the. general negotiations at Geneva. The honorable gentleman, asked whether representations had been made on, a ministerial plane. I myself, and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, who is handling this matter, have made clear in the proper way, not only to representatives of the United States of America but also to British Ministers, that this proposal would, in our opinion, seriously affect general negotiations at Geneva. In relation to ministerial: representation at the Geneva. Conference, I point out that during the last few weeks very little progress has been made in any direction at Geneva. I imagine that no great progress will be made until some time duringJune. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction isready to go to Geneva as soon as if is. considered that ministerial representation is. desirable. In the  meantime, the leader of the Australian dekgatiou, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs,</inline> is returning to Australia at his own wish in order to consult with the Commonwealth Government, probably next Monday or Tuesday. The honorable member also asked whether the Government was prepared to send a special delegation to confer with the American Government. The answer to that is " No ". Any representations made to the United States Government or its representatives will be made entirely on a governmental plane. I believe that there would be much resentment in America if a special  delegation were sent from Australia in order to try to exert pressure on the American politicians who are dealing with this subject. </para>

                            <para>- That report was brought to my notice earlier and I am already investigating the position. I do not think any shortage of rations is due to the- failure of the QuartermasterGeneral to forward supplies to the camp. 1 am confident that sufficient supplies reach it. I visited the camp recently, and not one complaint was made against the quality of the food that the men were receiving. If there is a shortage, it is evidently due to some men in the camp taking advantage of the rations sent there. Colonel O'Brien has-informed. me that he is already investigating the position. I hope to have the matter cleared up in a few hours. </para>

                            <para>- As far as I know, no time limit has been fixed. I take it that the honorable member's question is directed to the long period of time elapsing  before  completion of the trials. That, of course, is a matter for concern, hut it is equally a matter for concern that the defendants should be given an adequate opportunity of presenting their case at the trials. As an example, the trial of major war criminals in Japan, presided over by isi William Webb, has lasted many months longer than was anticipated. No time limit has been fixed for the completion of those trials and I. fear that they will not be completed for some months yet. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable, member knows there is a long story attached to the growing of tobacco in this country. Tobacco was attempted to be grown in a number of districts, and even American tobacco interests undertook extensive experiments in an effort to grow suitable tobacco in Australia. Unfortunately, the attempts proved unsuccessful in most districts, principally in New South Wales. The industry has .made some progress in Queensland, but there are complaints that the quality of leaf grown is such that- it cannot be used for manufacture unless it is blended with imported leaf. During the last few years it has been necessary to curtail the importation of American leaf, with the result that there have .been complaints regarding. the quality of tobacco manufactured in this country. I will consult the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to ascertain whether anything can be clone to improve the quantity and quality of Australian tobacco. </para>

 <para>I direct the attention of the Minister ifor "Works and Housing to a report in the press a few days ago relating to the march by more than 350 Australiaoi and British building workers to Parliament House .to demand better conditions at their quarters at Eastlake camp.

These war saving certificates were presented weekly as a gift to the servicemen while they were serving abroad with the armed foi;ces.

                    <para class="block">The object of this bill is to confer a measure of self-government on the residents of the Northern Territory. Tor many years prior to the warthe Territories of Papua and New Guinea had legislative councils. The Government believes that the time has now arrived when there should be a Legislative Council in the Northern Territory also.Up to the present, all ordinances and regulations relating to the Northern Territory have been made by the Governor-General in Council. The residents of the territory have had no- say in the legislation but as they live and work in the- territory, their experience and local knowledge would be of- real value in- the framing of legislation governing the country. The people of the Northern Territory and the northern parts of Australia, have- a real, live interest in the progress' and' development of the country. They may be relied; upon to elect representatives who- will cooperate with the- Government' representatives in the passing of legislation which will be for the benefit of, and' . in accordance with; the requirements of the territory. There will be considerable development in the northern parts of Australia, in. the near future, and the- people living there should, have some say in. the framing of its legislation, as is the case in the a.ad joining States-. </para>
                    <para>In view of the fact that the Northern Territory is not self-supporting financially, and that- the greater part of the expenditure, on its development, must be providedby the Commonwealth, the bill provides that there shall be a. slight majority of. Government members in the Legislative Council. It is further provided that; an ordinance, vote, resolution; on question, the object or effect of. which, is to dispose of or charge any, part  of  the revenue of the territory, shall- not be proposed inth e- Legislative Council except by the- Administrator,, unless its, proposal has been expressly, allowed' or directed by him. Estimates- of expenditure for the territory will continue to be providedin the estimates of the Department of the Interior.. </para>
                    <para>The Council will consist of the Administrator, seven official members, appointed' by the- Governor-General on the nomination of the Administrator, and six elected members-.. The preponderance of. official members will, therefore^ be two. The majority of the official. -members will be heads of departments. </para>
                    <para>In the Legislative Councils of Papua and New Guinea there was <inline font-style="italic">w</inline> larger preponderance of official members and the non-official members' were nominated, and not elected^ Consideration was given by the Government to- the nomination of the -non-official members of the Legislative Council! of the Northern Territory, so that the various interests- and classes in the territory could' he represented. It was decided^ however, that the members should' be elected- and' efforts have been made to- divide- the territory into electorates which will return- members representing all' the- various- industries and- classes. The territory will be- divided into five electoral districts; viz-. :  - Darwin; Batchelor; 'Pennant Creek,. Alice Springs, and Still art. </para>
                    <para>The Darwin District will be represented' hy two members, and each of the other, districts by one member. The Darwin District will! comprise the town of Darwin and the country immediately' surrounding it, as defined" in the Darwin Land's Acquisition Act, 194'5. Darwin is the capital of the territory and' the seat of the Administration. It contains a large percentage of the total population of the territory. </para>
                    <para>The Batchelor District' will comprise the whole of that part. of. the territory north of the 2.0th paralleL with the exception ofi the town of Darwin, and its surroundings and the town of Tennanti Creek. The greater, pant of this district is occupied, under, pastoral lease.. </para>
                    <para>The Tennant Creek-: District; wi-li comprise an  aiceai  within a- circle having'  a  radius of twenty miles' measured- from the' Tennant Creek; Post- Office. This is a' purely mining district. The- populationconsists of persons engaged in. mining' and the cornmercia-l community associated1 therewith-. </para>
                    <para>The Alice Springs District' will comprise an area* within as circle having- a radius, of ten miles measured from' the </para>
                    <para class="block">Alice Springs post office. Alice Springs is the second largest town in the territory. The composition of its population closely resembles that of Darwin. </para>
                    <para>The Stuart District will comprise all that part of the territory south of the 20th parallel, but omitting the Alice Springs District. The population of this district consists in the main of pastoralists. There is also a small mining community. </para>
                    <para>It is considered that the division of the territory into the five electoral districts mentioned should result in the elected members being fairly representative of. the various industries and communities. Members will be elected, whenever practicable, at the same time as the member for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives is elected. The first election, however, will have to be a special one. No salaries will be paid to members. The elected members will receive fees for the days they attend meetings of the council and travelling allowance for the period they are away from their homes. </para>
                    <para>The provisions of the bill have been drafted as closely as possible on the lines of those of the New Guinea Act. The Legislative Council will have power to make ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the territory. Every ordinance must be presented to the Administrator 'for assent, but those relating to (a) the granting or disposal of crown lands; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> the lease or grant of land or money or any donation or gratuity to the Administrator; or (c) aboriginals or aboriginal . labour, must contain a clause suspending them from, operation until the Governor-General's pleasure has been signified. Every ordinance must be laid before each House of the Parliament. </para>
                    <para>For a considerable number of years, the residents of the Northern Territory have been asking for some measure of local government. They have protested against the existing procedure, whereby legislation for the territory is drafted and enacted in Canberra. The bill will confer upon them the power to enact their own legislation and the necessary precautions have been taken to ensure that the finances will be protected. </para>

Making a request of the Treasurer may be likened to addressing oneself to a block of marble, which is smooth and hard. Polish granite as much as one may, its heart retains its tough consistency. The time has come when better consideration must be given to the position of the Northern Territory than is proposed to be given under this measure. The Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon)</inline> has just moved the second-reading of a. bill dealing with the administration of the Northern Territory.

                <para class="block">Fawkes after he had attempted to blow up the House of Commons. I do not think that the Government has cause to feel very happy about its prospects in the Northern Territory. That is not a poor man's country. Any one proposing to start in the grazing industry up there would need to have many thousands of pounds, and the man who proposed to engage in prospecting also would need a considerable amount of money, because financial risks would be encountered from the outset. Exemption from income tax for only five years would not be sufficient to induce people to invest their money in such ventures when they can do so much better, especially from the viewpoint of living conditions, in the southern States of Australia and Queensland. This proposal does not mee t the situation.' A point that I raised last night, and I am emphatic upon it, is that when exemptions from income tax of this character are . made, the Government should provide that a certain amount of the money which the individual saves shall be devoted to the improvement of his property. The effective settlement of the Northern Territory should be the first objective of the Commonwealth Parliament. Income tax exemptions should bc granted not merely as such, but also with a view to obtaining a better and closer settlement of the territory. This is one matter which really ought to be postponed. It ought also to be referred to a committee for proper investigation, because there is at stake the future of not only the Northern Territory but also New Guinea and the islands in the Southwest Pacific. Such subjects cannot be considered very carefully in a committee of this House to-day. There I leave the matter for the time being, feeling quite sure that it will bc raised again in due course. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> has frequently discussed this, matter with Opposition members, and I presume also with honorable members who sit on the other side of the chamber. He advised me, to my regret, that it would be impossible for him to be present this morning. The concession granted by this clause is an extension of the period of exemption from income tax from1 947 to 1952. A period of five years passes very quickly, especially to a. grazier or leaseholder in the Northern Territory, who has to invest considerable capital in order to produce a reasonable income. Mr.R. G. Casey, who recently visited the Northern Territory, has said that he would not recommend any one to go there, unless he had a capital of not less than £15,000, and that even that amount would be insufficient to meet the adversities which a settler might encounter. The Government might well study <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey's</inline> report; because, when all is said and done, whether he is a political opponent or not, he is an observer whose opinions are worth considering. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> has pointed out that; the present population of the Northern Territory is only about 8,000, that the Payne report stated that if the territory were properly handled itswhite population might be increased to about 30,000 within ten or fifteen years, and that under present conditions there did not appear to be much hope of a large increase. Those who reside in the territory have extremely adverse living conditions. They are occupying that part of. the continent to the advantage of all Australians. I believe that there is only one woman to four Or five men, which is a very small ratio. The consequence is that men have to " bury " themselves up there for very many years, deprived of the companionship of wives or other womenfolk. In order just to preserve the Northern Territory and to maintain the "White Australia policy, and in order to have an answer to the teeming millions of the East who want to know what we are doing with our empty spaces, we are expending upon the territory approximately £1,000,000 a year. That is the cost of the territory to the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth must be prepared to bear it; but the insignificant amount of total taxes which can be collected in the territory makes the imposition of tax hardly worth while, particularly if such imposts discourage settlement in those remote areas of persons who would otherwise go there. A possible inducement to settle in the territory is that after spending fifteen, or twenty years, or a. lifetime there, one would have assets which would be readily realizable sud thus be able to dispose of them : and spend the remainder -of one's liife in retirement in the eastern States. &gt;One of "the major inducements -for 'the possible settlement of "the . Northern Territory would 'be:complete. exemption fromincome tax -for a period -of 'years that -.would make the concession really . worth while. The Government has idone a very . praiseworthy thing in extending the . exemption for 'another five years:; but Izhe . Treasurer (Ma1. Chifley), yesterday, mentioned 'that the iGovernment ; taok a 'long range view of taxation to a greater degree than the . Opposition suggested that it might. I : d:o not believe that, in -respect of 'the Northern Territory, the granting of an exemption from income tax of ; five years represents a very long-range view,, having regard : to -fhe outlay involved in stocking aip, fencing and iin.provem.ents. I do not expect . the Treasurer to accept an . amendment at this stage, but I hope that, as the result -of suggestions made in this idebate, he will -consider . extending the proposed period . of exemption. When all is said and done,, the amount of tax which can be collected in , the Northern Territory is insignificant,; but the territory itself, in relation to the rest of Australia, is . of transcendent 'importance . and) we must encourage its . development. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree that certain -difficulties . arise in , this matter. The exemption from 'income tax of certain primary producers . in the Northern . Territory also creates anomalies. . That is . borne out by the statement ..cited by -the honorable member for Richmond . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. . Anthony)</inline> . that -a settler would require . a . capital of between £1-5,0.0.0 . and £20,000 to establish himself in the territory. When this matter came up for -consideration, T leaned to the view just expressed by . the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">((Mr.. Archie Cameron),,</inline> that profits made in . the Northern Territory should to some degree 'be applied in building' . up . the territory. However,, a good deal of the money invested in the . territory and . the return 'therefrom belongs to -people who do not live 'there. Those persons are, in effect, absentee owners. My own thought in the first place was that the . exemption 'from income tax should . apply 'Only in t'he case of a company, partnership or property, provided 75 per -cent, . or <inline font-style="italic">'SO</inline> per cent. 10'f the shares, or -initerest -was held : by 'persons residing in the territory. It is anomalous thalt. persons receiving sdividends . from companies established in the 'territory., but living iunder (the fsame . conditions 'as other citizens sno.utd receive this ; benefit. However, 'the 'Minister . for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnsoni)</inline> . agrees tbait a settler . in the Northern Territory 'requires more ithan the '-normal amount of . capital. Therefee, '.taking:the iview that .sufficient capital may '.not (be attracted unless some . exemption from 'income tax be granted, the 'Government (decided to 'extend -the period of exemption 'for another (five years. The matter 'can Jbe re-iexamined at the . expiration . -tff . that term. The poinits (raised Iby the 'honorable member for . Barker were Su'Ily considered. There is . substance in n&amp;at hoi)h -he &lt;and the /honorable member for Richmond have said. The latter iremaiiked. that, in -any case, the amount &lt;of tax ft'hat'conld be (collected in the territory wouM be insignificant. !However,, Treasurers nalturally take fthe view that everybody should make . -some contribution, to public 'revenue. 'There may be 'reasons why ^certain concessions may be given to certain '-people, but complete exemption of 'any section of ; thre fcommiunity from -'tax is 'not 'sound. All of 'the -points made "by both 'the honorable member? have been 'carefully considered, land will be further 'considered. </para>

                        <para>- I. do not know about that, but I say that they are not the best kind of settlers. They have not devoted themselves to developing the country. In fact, I think that their influence has been bad. I have in mind one property from which, at the time I visited it, not one female beast had ever been sold ; they had all died at the waterholes. On some properties, rather than erect fences; the management preferred to leave unwatered a strip of country twenty miles wide in order to hold the stock. I have nothing to say in favour of pastoralists of that kind. I believe that the territory needs a kind of Australian who has not been attracted to ityet - one who has had experience, and who possesses a reasonable amount of capital. If such men are not willing to go there themselves, at least they should be encouraged to commence enterprises there. The Northern Territory is not the place to which a man can go with a few hundred of even a few thousand pounds, and expect to establish himself in a few years. A man s'arting on the ground floor would have to spend half a life time there in order to achieve success. The territory -needs experienced men with £10,000 or £20,000 or £25,000 to begin enterprises there, backed by the Government. I have discussed pastoral possibilities in the Northern Territory with experienced men possessing the necessary capital, but they will not go there because living conditions are harsh. In the territory amenities are meagre,  and the people have to live in places remote from the centres of civilization. Therefore, a man with as much capital as is needed to settle in the territory prefers to invest it in some pastoralist enterprises in the more populous areas. I believe that something should be done to attract these people to the Northern Territory. Many young men ' with experience and with capital, although not prepared to live in the Northern Territory, would be willing to establish a pastoral enterprise there, to put a manager in charge, and to visit the property periodically. Such enterprises would be most useful. So, I put it to the Government that it would be well worth while to try the experiment, of giving a general immunity from taxation on income derived from private enterprises in the Northern Territory, qualifying it not by residence, bur. by some formula which would require the re-in vestment in those enterprises of a certain proportion of the revenue derived from them. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has put his finger on a point that I think should be discussed by the committee. The right honorable 'gentleman referred to the fact that some people who own property in the Northern Territory but do not actually live there are exempt from taxes on income derived from the Northern Territory. On the other hand, as the law stands to-day, we have this state of affairs, particularly in regard to mining companies: A man who has gone to the Northern Territory to carry on an. enterprise may have exhausted his capital, and having definite prospects before him, he may have been obliged to secure outside assistance. A company has been formed and registered outside the Northern Territory. The result is that this man who may live with his wife and family, under the most difficult conditions, in one of the most inaccessible and inhospitable parts of the Northern Territory, and has done an excellent job, is. called upon to  pay full Commonwealth income tax on all he earns from his property because the company of which he is a big share-holder is not registered in the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, in cases like that, the lender is always right. If the lender wants the company registered in his own State, he tells the borrower that he must either agree to that or do without the money. A simple amendment of the Income Tax Act would get over that difficulty and still provide' for what the Treasurer has in mind. In the main, I agree that the purpose of the exemption from the income tax of Northern Territory incomes is to encourage the development of the territory, and the residence of people in it, and not to encourage people to hold properties in the Northern Territory whilst' residing in Melbourne, Sydney or Adelaide, and enjoying the advantage of exemption from income tax on income derived from their investment in the Northern Territory. On the other hand, a slight amendment would provide for the case of a man who is associated with a company registered outside the Northern Territory, but who derives his living and his income from inside the territory. These are two points that might very well be examined, and a solution of the problems involved might facilitate a very much better understanding of the position than I have observed in certain Northern Territory transactions that I have dealt with in the last three or four years. </para>

                    <para>.- The point I wish to make is this : Immunity from income tax to-day is enjoyed by the people for whom the concession was primarily designed, namely, those who live in the Northern Territory, and engage in enterprises there; but it is also enjoyed by companies - some of them controlled overseas - whose capital structure is big enough to enable them to maintain a board of directors in one of the capital cities, and to comply technically with the law by sending a director to the Northern Territory for sufficient months of the year to be regarded legally as establishing substantial control and management of the affairs of the company within the Northern Territory. I understand this matter has been resolved in the courts. I hardly think that the Government desires to perpetuate this state of affairs. I sympathize with the Government in its difficulty in devising some formula to exclude these companies from this concession. I have no doubt that it was the intention of the originators of this provision to exclude absentee owners. However, with their resources and ingenuity, these organizations have been able to avoid exclusion and to entitle themselves to the benefits.. If they cannot bc excluded, why not extend the benefits to the Australian citizen with moderate capital, who, for perhaps family reasons is not prepared to live on the Barkly Tableland, in the Wave Hill district, or in some other part of the Northern Territory, but would be prepared to invest his money in a Northern Territory enterprise and visit.it now and again, provided, his income from his investment were tax free? After all, is our primary purpose to induce into the Northern Territory, people who own land there, or only people who will live there? It seems to be the policy of the Government to encourage people to live in the Northern Territory, rather than .to induce landowners to settle there. That is exemplified by the Government's policy of resuming all the land in the Darwin area from the original private owners, and transforming it into crown land, thus making it possible for residents of Darwin to be only lessees. I trust I shall not be misunderstood and be interpreted as arguing in favour of having non-owners there, because that i3 the very reverse of what I favour. However, if we cannot otherwise induce owners to live in the Northern Territory, and  that has apparently been proved over- the years,, let us widen the provisions of. this legislation by granting tax immunity to the kind." of people !' have described, the. managers,, employees, and those- who would, in- the circumstances I. envisage, invest their, capital in. and. make, available their experience for the development, of the territory. I*, am convinced that the Northern Territory could.' produce vast quantities of live-stock,, much of which could be killed in fat condition, the remainder being brought to the adjoining States for fattening and' ultimate killing, so contributing t'o the wealth of fliis country. The Northern Territory desperately needs a railway, not north from Alice Springs' where the pastoral country is" not' rich, but across' the border fronr Queensland ' to the B'arkly Tableland' <inline font-style="italic">T!</inline> trust tliat the construction of such a railway will1 be' tackled' as one of' the first steps' of" tile Government's railway construction programme: <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> have moved an amendment' to t'lie'cla-use'for'the reasons1  1'  have stated!

                    <para>.- T agree with the honorable member for l*udi; ('Mr: McEwen) tliat'.in this measure every encoura'gement should be given' to people to settle in the Northern- Terri^ tory. It is- obvious-" that the' development of' that territory lias been retarded-, principally Because the choicest lands have been held1 by prtstora.l' companieswhose sole interest in it has been the earning of dividen'ds- for shareholders resident in- other countries- or the- protection of thei'i" main investments in Argentina' and elsewhere. Many of our young ex-servicemen who1 were in the Northern" Territory during the war were able f!o' assess- its potentialities and' are now extremely eager to settle1 there-. I am not neairly so' pessimistic as! the- honorableineriiber foV Indii and. other honorable' members- who' contend that prospective settlers would need to have a capital of from  £1.O;00OJ  to&gt;  £20,000  to have any chance of' success-. When Che honorable member for. Indi wtfs Minister for' the: Interior <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> accompanied- him' on a visit to- the Northern Territory and met many men successfully established there1 who, when they. took. up. their* holdings, had very little- capital.. In developing our vast northern hinterland,, these . men. have rendered, wonderful service-, to Australia and. they are.- entitled to all the considera* tion and encouragement, it is possible to give them. I. am satisfied that a: young man. with- a capital of  £3,000.  or  £4,000  could establish himself successfully in. the Northern Territory, particularly, if he were able -to acquire some-of the excellent country, now held' by the big pastoral companies. I regret that this G'overnmeht ha.s. renewed the- leases- of' many of' these companies. Ifr the: Government! took a: realistic view of the situation i.ft would, also- assist new. settlers, by the provision of water, conservation, schemes.- and the like. </para>

Therefore, it has refrained' from doing so, as Commonwealth Go*vernments. did in Australia until 1941. In 19-20; in order to put the- matter beyonddoubt; the- British Government inserted a new section in the Einance- Act in the terms of the amendment which I now propose. The., taxing of scholarship- moneys by the Commonwealth Government is, in effect, one step in the process of' committing national suicide as- a democratic community. The- amendment has no party political, significance. It is designed to be more favorable to the sons and daughters1 of poor: parents than to the- children of rich parents-. For- that reason, I believe that: it should commend itself* to honorable members on: both sides of the chamber: as- a. measure that should be enacted. In another scholarship, one- from the University, of Sydney; the sum of £375 per annum is granted by the trustees to enable a student to study at one of the English universities, always with the view that the student will return to Australia to serve, his country. After the deduction of tax and exchange, the student is left with the grand sum of £1S0 per annum. The amount of £475 per annum granted to Gowrie scholarship holders is considered to be large. Normal scholarships from the University of Sydney provide amounts of about £375 or £350 per annum. Honorable members will realize that, even with a gross amount of £375, any student would have a great struggle to make ends meet. The reduction of" that amount by a wicked tax impost leaves many scholarship holders in an impossible position. The result is that a poor man's child is debarred from benefit. </para>
                <para>Australia is the only country in the world, as far as I know, that does this ridiculous and wrong thing. That a Labour government should insist upon this pound of flesh, to use a melodramatic phrase, is beyond my comprehension. Of all governments in Australia, surely a Labour government should be the first to yield to my proposition! My proposal has been submitted to Labour- Ministers again and again during the last three or four years, but each time they have waved it aside. I spoke last night of the " official mind ". I do not know what influence has prevailed 11 DOn the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and his colleagues in this matter, but every effort that wc have made to secure some amelioration. of the position has failed. If you tax learning, you do the worst thing that can be done in a democratic community. Furthermore, the practice is full of anomalies. Some scholarships are taxed,, and some are not. Obviously, the Commissioner of Taxation has a guilty conscience. He realizes that the practice is wrong and unfair. In respect of scholarships tenable in America, of all places, he does allow certain concessions which have the indirect effect of making the scholarship moneys not taxable. In the case of scholarships tenable in England he does not do so. He concedes something for the cost of books and university fees, but, as I have said, about nine-tenths of a student's expenses are, not for books and fees - those items are extremely small - but for living expenses. Because of this, the son of a poorman is penalized. I am repeating much of what I said in the second-reading debate last night, because I feel very deeply about this matter and I consider that all honorable members, and the public of Australia, should have the facts brought to their notice. I make no apology for dealing repeatedly with these anomalies. </para>
                <para>The taxation authorities make an extraordinary distinction in relation to the Rhodes Scholarship, the fund of which is abroad and therefore not readily accessible to them. If it can be proved that a Rhodes scholar is no longer a bona fide resident of Australia - in other words, if, although he was born here and domiciled here, he goes abroad and it can be assumed that he does not intend to return to Australia - then, for reasons best known to himself - no doubt because he has a guilty conscience - the- Commissioner of Taxation does not tax the scholarship payments. However, if a Rhodes scholar happens to have married in Australia and to have left his wife in this country, thus remaining a bona fide resident of Australia who is only temporarily absent, the money is taxed. That is a ridiculous position. All these anomalies point to the one thing: that this impost is utterly unjustifiable. </para>
                <para>Another anomaly is that if the scholarships are granted in a lump sum, the Commissioner does not tax them. The difference between a periodic payment and the payment of a lump sum, as far as taxation is concerned, escapes me. Someone in authority, flourishing his stick, has said, "We will tax these people " ; but, as the result of pressure, some concessions have been granted, and they are entirely illogical. Better legal minds than mine contend that the impost is probably illegal, because the money that winners of scholarships receive is not " income " in the normal sense. The recipient of a scholarship does not earn anything. What he receives is a gratuity or a donation to him for having qualified against competition to receive a scholarship. He cannot appeal against the tax because with cunning .and cleverness the Commissioner taxes the income <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> the source. He directs the  trustees  of the Sydney University, the Gowrie Scholarship Fund, the Walter and Eliza Hall Trust Fund, and other trustees of funds from which scholarships  are  provided to hand over to him the amount of tax levied and only the balance r.o the student. The result is that no one has the means or right of appeal. The student has no. link with the Commissioner of Taxation. So he cannot appeal, and the trustees of the funds have no right of appeal, either. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to have this tax challenged, but I suggest that if some student had the money to challenge the tax in' the High Court it would not stand for a minute. The ' final anomaly is that the Commissioner taxes the money on the basis of income earned from personal exertion, whereas any one familiar with the income tax law knows that if it is taxable at, all it, is taxable as income from property, which carries a higher rate, because the money is paid out of earnings from investment in property. That again  shows  the guilty conscience of the Commissioner. Of course the money is not turned from persona,] exertion. It. is a gratuity, a gift, an allowance that the scholar has won. If it be taxable at all, it must be taxed as income from property. ., is condition cannot be allowed to continue one moment longer. If the Commissioner of Taxation, backed by the inertia of the Government,  is  not prepared to revert to the practice that prevailed before the ruling of August, 1941, it is time that we placed on the statute-book the amendment that I have foreshadowed in order to protect learning in Australia. By protecting learning we protect democracy. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause exempts from tax for a further five years income derived by residents of the Northern Territory from primary production, mining or fisheries in that territory, and the amendment moved by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> McEwen)  would increase the period of exemption to ten years. The concession is granted to promote the development of the territory. I support the amendment because I consider it desirable that the people who will benefit from the concession should have a longer period of exemption assured to them in the hope that it will encourage greater development. I consider, however, that the concession has failed to achieve the development that it was hoped it would achieve. It has not led to greater investment in the territory. I think greater progress would be obtained if the exemption were extended' to income derived from investments in each of the three fields by people who do not live in the territory. I regard it as reasonable that' if income earned by residents of the territory from mining, fishing or primary production is to be exempt from tax for five or ten years, whatever be the case, income earned from the same sources by people who do not live in the territory should 'be exempt too. Such an exemption would undoubtedly encourage investments in the development of the territory by people with considerable funds to invest, but with other interests that compel them to live in another part of Australia. Of course, I do not advocate a system that would merely- provide people with a means of escaping income tax, but I do think that if my suggestion were adopted it would lead to considerably more development than has been achieved so far. There are vast mineral resources that could be developed. Even if those who make the investments that would lead to the development of those resources found it, inconvenient to live in the territory themselves, their investments would create employment and greater population. It is illogical to say that people should live where their capital is invested. Some investments flourish and others perish by the wayside and are forgotten, but successful investors in industry are not forgotten by honorable members opposite. Indeed, they are remembered with rage. They are regarded as cormorants that must be destroyed, instead of praised for the industries they have developed and the employment they have given. People who invest in the Northern Territory know what lies ahead of them - either loss of their capital or success that will be the envy of their fellow-men. They have to have courage to meet either, and we should give their courage stimulus by extending to them the concession of exemption from tax on income derived from the three categories of production provided for  in 'tliis clause. My 'purpose vis to urge 'the 'Government to '-accept the proposal  ior  'extension of -this privilege. If we want -to - develop the Northern Territory, why -should -it 'he necessary to 'insist on a 'man bringing his family with ''him and residing there'? -Many men who might invest their capital in ' the 'Northern Territory have homes in other 'parts of Australia, where far greater amenities are available to'their wives and families. "Why should 'the Government insist that they break up their homes and ta'ke their -children from school to move 'them to the Northern Territory ? By 'insisting  -On  -these things w,e . are discouraging the investment of capital in 'the 'Northern Territory, -not only 'by , peqpTe resident 'in Australia, 'but by . people "in other . parts of the world. During : the war th'e Government "proclaimed that it was exploring every avenue to induce -developmental investment in this country, and . said -that it w,as doing everything . possible 'to encourage investment by people in the United States of America and -in Great Britain. Bu't 'this . proposal must have the inevitable . effect o'f . discouraging them.. Wby should we adopt such a policy, . particularly when we realize that our . own efforts 'in the past -to develop the NorAhexn 'Territory have failed I The only 'logical course to pursue is to extend the privileges to prospective investors. "We must face . the . realities . of the situation,, which are that people will not invest money iin enterprises  in  . such isolated country . unless they . are offered . every inducement to do so. That applies particularly . to mining . operations. Whilst it as a fact -that -there are a number of . great industries on the verge . of development., those industries  tare  insignificant " -in . comipaa-ison with the known mineral  wealth  of the Northern Territory. People in -.other parts -of the world who are able to invest millions -of pounds in -dewelopmental en.terjpT.ises should not be required ; to take oip residence in the Northern Territory.  Lt  is not their presence which -the (development of that . country -requires, but itheir capital. In any event, the majority of large investors already have interests  in  Australia and in other parts -of the world which demand their 'attendance elsewhere. </para>

I remind the Treasurer '(Mr. Chifley) . that the first Labour Governmentin New South Wales, giving effect to the policy of the Labour party, introduced, in the face of considerable hostility, legislation providing for the granting ofbursaries to enable brilliant children of 'poor parents to attend and graduate at the university. </para>

                <para class="block">This excellent legislation has been a great credit to the Labour movement. If other countries financially assist brilliant students of poor parents to attend a university, it is improper that the Commissioner of Taxation should effectively debar them in Australia. As the result of the attitude . of the department, this class of student must stand . aside, and his place is taken by, a less clever student whose parents are able to pay for his university education. I cannot believe that the Government, after having been informed of the position, will . decline to rectify it. I shall be glad if the Treasurer will examine . this matter, and have the Taxation Department . alter this ruling. </para>
                <para>One of the proudest boasts of the New South Wales Labour party was that the legislation which, provided for the grant-. ing of bursaries to the brilliant children of parentsin comparatively poor circumstances enabled the son of a miner on the northern coalfields of that State to attend high school and eventually the university. Ultimately, he became Professor " J ohnny " Hunter. Had it not. been for that legislation passed by a Labour government, this brilliant mind would have been lost to Australia and the world. Unfortunately, a greater Power than we are called him away while he was still a comparatively young man, and 'we shall never know where his brilliance would have taken him. If the obvious anomaly created by the department's ruling is not corrected, a grave injustice might be done not only to a brilliant student but also ito Australia. At one period, critics of the Labour party declared that our principal purpose was l..o protect the interests of "Bowyangs" and that we were opposed to intellectual development. The lie . complete has been given to that view, because we realize that democracy, in itself, is not sufficient, and that w,e must have an educated democracy. Therefore, the Labour party believes that those whoendeavour , to improve our intellectual standards should receive . every possible . encouragement, and that no barrier . should be erected to prevent the brilliant , son or daughter . of the humblest person in the community from obtaining the highest education. In the circumstances, I urge the Treasurer  to give careful consideration to the suggestion of the honorable member for Parramatta. </para>

                        <para>- I consider that portion of the clause will stultify one of the finest pieces of legislation ever passed by any Australian parliament. I refer to the legislation which enables the child of the humblest, parents in the community to pass through the schools to a university. The system of bursaries enabled a brilliant son of humble parents on a northern mining field to pass through the State schools to a university, and eventually to be appointed to a professorship where he was able to teach the professors who previously taught him. .The brilliance of Professor "Johnny" Hunter has been . recognized throughout the world. In its present form the clause is likely to disfigure that great principle and, therefore, I cannot believe that the Treasurer will allow it to remain. I am confident that he will, either by accepting a!&gt; amendment or by a direction to the Commissioner of Taxation, ensure that a paltry few shillings shall not stand in the way of the continuance of thus excellent system. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Flinders . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> referred to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">q</inline> of section 23. Those who study it closely will know that originally it was thought that the paragraph applied to income derived from sources outside Australia, excepting dividends. Ex-Australian income, other than dividends, is exempt, from Commonwealth tax if it is taxable in the country of origin. It was also thought that ox-Australian dividends were taxed by section 44, unaffected by section 23 <inline font-style="italic">(q).</inline> The effect of a High Court ruling was that .dividends were covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">q</inline> of section 23. Consequently, the act is being amended to give effect to the original intention of the Government and the ruling of the Commissioner of Taxation. The proposal now before the committee is to adjust matters in the light of the High Court's ruling. </para>

I remind the honorable member for Parramatta that this matter has a wider incidence than its effect on scholarships and that therefore it calls for careful examination. As new points have been raised during the debate, ali I can promise is that they will be carefully considered. Indeed, I discussed some of the points raised with the Commissioner of Taxation last night. At this stage, the Government will not accept amendments; but the representations of honorable members will be carefully examined before the next session of the Parliament, and it may be that administrative action to meet their desires will be taken, or that legislation will be introduced to meet the position. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the remarks of the honorable members for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> and Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> in regard to the necessity for the exemption of scholarships from income tax. I emphasize the fact that when travelling . scholarships and bursaries, particularly, the Rhodes Scholarship, were first made available to enable students to go overseas to enlarge their knowledge, the value of them was no greater than would permit of a bare existence, and certainly no margin was provided which would cover the very heavy income tax that is levied in Australia today. The levying of income tax on students who have won scholarships places a bar on higher education entering the homes of young men of poor parents. Recently I have been reading a work entitled <inline font-style="italic">The American Rhodes Scholarships.</inline> In the first chapter, " The Vision of Cecil Rhodes ", the author, dealing with the seven wills which Rhodes made shows the' development of Rhodes's views on the desirability for the foundation of the overseas scholarships, which have meant so much to the world and have bound together the British and American peoples. Rhodes's idea was that these scholarships should be awarded to men who had outstanding qualities, not only of scholarship but also of leadership. In a letter that he wrote to Hawksley, his solicitor, who was responsible for the drafting of his wills from time to time. Rhodes gave directions for the drafting of the sixth will, in which he showed how one idea led to another. He reasoned that the residential college in South Africa for which he had provided might, if successful, tend to prevent South African students from going to England to study, and thus promote a feeling of separation, which would run directly counter to all his ideas. The remedy which he proposed was to supplement that bequest with a provision for scholarships at Oxford University. In his letter, the whole of the scholarship scheme was outlined, often in the very words of the sixth and seventh wills. The author has quoted the letter, in these terms - </para>

                    <para>On thinking over my will I discover that 1 have made a mistake, in fact made a gift, which if not supplemented may rather defeat my ideas. I refer to the foundation of a residential college at the Cape, which if successful might lead to check . South African students from coming home for three years to our University and therefore, lead rather to promote the feeling of separation through want of intercourse. I therefore propose to add to the gift that every year three scholarships should be given 'and that the amount should be £250 a year for three years for each or £750 per annum and that the successful winners should matriculate and reside for three years at the University of Oxford in England. </para>

                <para>That quotation from the letter written by Rhodes to Hawksley, used in the preparation of the drafts of his sixth  and seventh wills, shows, that the idea in his mind was that, scholars from. America,. South Africa,. Australia, NewZealand', and other parts of the. British Empire, should mingle together, and. at the expiration of their scholarships should return to their homelands well, equipped to play a prominent part with their qualities of leadership, knowledge and ability. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> has pointed out that the Commissioner of Taxation, has ruled that if an unmarried man, when about to go overseas,, can convince the Commissioner that he proposes to' relinquish his domicile in. Australia and to make his residence abroad after he has completed his university course at Oxford., he. will be. exempt from income tax;but a married man who leaves a wife in Australia is forced to pay income tax here, and it is a very heavy impost on the comparatively small scholarship which the Rhodes Trust is able to give him. The. Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> is actuated by a paltry spirit when he merely says that the matter will-' be looked into..Why can he not do the straight and' honest thing by those men who have won travelling, and other scholarships, included' in whose ranks was the late ProfessorJohn Hunter, one of the most distinguished' scientific men which this country has ever produced? While he was in the. second' year. of. his medical course at- the University of. Sydney, Hunter coached men who were in. their fourth year, in work' that' he had' not yet done: He was so far ahead of every otherstudent that he was- capable- of doingthat work. When he graduated, he brought to the study of medical' science a capacity- for original thought, which, this country had never dreamedwas possessed by any man produced by the University of' Sydney or any. other Australian university. I. recollect professors, at the University of Sydney, saying- at- the time- of his death that a brain like that of. John Hunter was" produced1 only once. in. a century..  His  was. one of. the most- brilliant brains which, this country, has ever produced1. Yet' he- was- the son of- poor, parents.. If bursaries and scholarships had/ then been- taxed as heavily asthey are to-day, probably John </para>
                <para class="block">Hunter would, never have been, heard, of in. the realms.- of. science. He died: at. the early age of 26 or 27' years; in Chicago, while- engaged- on research' work and lecturing on. scientific discoveries- that he had made in. Australia-. As the- honorable member for Parramatta, has- said,. Rhodes' scholars will, in effect through the action of the taxation authorities, be prevented from, returning: to, Australia, and thusthe objectives which Rhodes had in mind will be- defeated.. Even at. this late hour, the Treasurer shoiild accept the amendment forecast by the honorable member for Parramatta.. I hope that- the' honorable member will canty hist amendment to. a division, so that the people of- Australia may realize that there- is considerable hypocrisy among those who; are always pleading: that the sons of poor p.arents should have^ every opportunity to enlarge their education, and yet would deny, to anr. most: brilliant sons'oppor.tunir ties to go: overseas to. the* fountains, of research- and- learning- and to. return to.

There .can  be  wo doubt that taxation seriously limits the power of 'these trusts to advance the cause of education. .1 also believe  'that  many honorable members share the vision of an Australia of the future which will be  not  only « centre in the South Pacific of social legislation in advance -df 'that of the rest of the world, but also a centre of science, -culture and art. The day when that ideal can be realized will be 'very much -more .quietly reached if we have contact .with other parts o'f the world. It is a sad thought that .at this moment, when, 'at length, the whole of the people of Australia are -beginning to realize that we can no longer develop our possibilities to the full degree in .complete isolation, we should have any obstacle at all placed in the way -of the extension of the scope of our .contact with the outside world I believe that here in Australia, particularly in 'Canberra, where we have made possible the establishment df a National University, this should be ,au obvious po'int of view. I am glad .that the Treasurer has assured the committee that hi! will .give it his sympathetic consideration. I believe that when he has gone carefully into it, and considered all its ramifications, he will accept, if not the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Parramatta, at least .the spirit of that amendment,, and that we shall have a course of action taken which the honorable member urgently desires. T again congratulate the honorable member for Parramatta on bringing this matter before the -committee, and hope that he will achieve his objective in. the very near future. </para>

The Treasurer, having said that this matter will be carefully examined, and having, I believe, by a hint, indicated that my proposal will receive something more than sympathetic consideration, supported as it undoubtedly is by a strong body of opinion among honorable members opposite as well as by the Opposition us a. whole, I do not propose to press my amendment at this stage. I do not want this extremely important matter to become the subject of party hostility which might result in my objective being defeated; because, the Treasurer, so I am told, has  a  habit of what, is colloquially known as " getting his back up". I do not want to get any one's " back up " in this matter. I want to ensure that income in respect of scholarships for Australian students going abroad shall be exempt from tax and, regardless of the. method employed, I shall be content so long as that objective is achieved. Therefore, in view of the Treasurer's assurance, I shall proceed no further with the matter. I am obliged to the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang).</inline> I do not agree with his politics. Indeed, I dislike his politics and his past political history; but. when he spoke ro-day as he did, he spoke with the authentic voice of Australian Labour at its. best.

I am equally grateful for the support which has been expressed by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> and the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs. Blackburn),</inline> and also the unspoken sup port of honorable members opposite: 1 hope that it will not be long before my proposal is implemented.

In this I have been merely imitating Labour tactics. Members of the Labour party have made a speciality of repetition.

                <para class="block">This clause contains one of. the most objectionable provisions in the bill, and my amendment is intended to correct an anomaly. The effect of the clause as drafted maybe illustrated by quoting the case of a primary producer who sinks a bore which might cost £3,000, £4,000 or more. He can get a deduction in the year of expenditure and, if the expenditure is excessive for that purpose, the resultant loss may be carried forward for seven years. Upon the sale of the property, the taxpayer who sank the bore would not be assessable on any amount which he might receive in respect to the bore, but the purchaser, and any subsequent owners, will not be entitled to any depreciation on what they pay for the bore. At first sight, it would appear that the Crown is entitled to some consideration because of the full allowance in the year of expenditure, and that it should not be obliged to make a further deduction. If that be so, it is an open question whether it would be more equitable to require the one who sank the bore to submit to taxation what he received for the bore upon sale, but . not exceeding the amount of his expenditure, or whether the Government's proposal ought to deny the deduction to purchasers. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> may have chosen his method because the tax on the sale of t he bore, even when subject to the averaging provisions, may be very high. However, in my opinion, the Treasurer should not seek any <inline font-style="italic">quidpro quo</inline> for the allowance which, after all, is the Government's contribution towards encouraging primary producers to provide against alltoofrequent droughts.If expenditure on water improvements is contrasted with expenditure already allowed and now proposed to be allowed under section 75, e.g., preparation of land for agriculture, clearing and cultivation, draining of swam ps, erosion and preventive measures, it will be seen that the Treasurer is prepared to allow as a deduction for income tax purposes such expenditure which is admittedly of a capital nature; and he allows such capital expenditure without seeking any <inline font-style="italic">quid 'pro quo</inline> other than what he would indirectly get as a result of the greater productivity of the land. Consequently, the Treasurer ought to be similarly satisfied with regard to bores, and should reconcile himself to the one loss ashe does with regard to the other expenditure under section 75. A highly artificial position will be created if depreciation is denied, on certain  asset3  that normally carry depreciation, and intending purchasers will not know where they stand for taxation purposes. The secrecy provisions of the act will forbid the department to give information on the point. </para>

                    <para>.  - I am not sure how some taxpayers will stand under this clause as drafted.It is clear that the Government has at last given way, and accepted the proposal of the Opposition that money spent on the construction of bores and wells should be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes, but the clause does not make it clear . whether this concession will extend to expenditure or. reticulation schemes which, of course, are necessary in connexion with bore sinking. [ should also like to know what will be the position of the taxpayer who has spent money on such work in the past. Under the act as it stands, he is allowed so much a year for depreciation on a diminishing scale. This clause abolishes the allowance for depreciation in respect of expenditure in this and subsequent years, but the position in regard to past expenditure is not clear. I should be glad if the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> would explain the point. </para>

                    <para>. -  Paragraphb of the clause deals with soil erosion and specifically excludes from exemption expenditure incurred on fences used for preventing or combating soil erosion. I am accustomed to living iu. various parts of Australia in which soil erosion- is one. of the great curses inflicted on the farmer. One of the means by which it has been possible to stop soil erosion has been by the erection of brush fences or the expensive type of cord fence-. I cannot sea why expenditure on fences should be excluded. The whole question of soil erosion is of such importance to the Commonwealth that money expended to combat it, either on the. planting of trees, shrubs or grasses, on contour ploughing, on the trenching of hillsides or on the erection of fences, barriers or ditches, should be an allowable deduction. In. view of the many methods, which, may be employed, according to the. varying circumstances of soil erosion in various parts of Australia, I would be obliged if the right honorable gentleman would indicate why fences should be excluded while expenditure on other methods of prevention are allowed. </para>

                    <para>. - I, too, believe that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> should explain exactly what is meant by the term " fences "'. Recently, T had a small lucerne paddock which was being rapidly eroded. In order to counteract the erosion, I put in two dolphins where the water changed its course. These dolphins could be classified as a fence. They were built of timber and had logs thrown up against them. They were not used for the purpose of holding stock in a paddock, but solely for the purpose of diverting water.. For the "purpose- of preventing sheet erosion taking place as the result, of gulleys forming in the hills abovey another means of preventing erosion of that kind is by the erection of a wire, fence, which collects the: rubbish coming down with the water and. forms, a. kind of: dam thus, diverting the water to its proper course-. That, too-, might, be regarded as, a fence within the meaning of the clause. Unless there is a clear definition of what is meant by the term "fences" the. Commissioner may classify a dolphin such as I have described, or a wire structure intended to. create a small diversionary dam,, as a fence-. </para>

The greatest advocates of protection against erosion urge that certain portions of a property be fenced off from time to time and be regrassed. If money expended on the erection of fences for that purpose is not' made an allowable deduction, how. can the farmer afford to carry out the regrassing? All expenditure on fencing erected solely as a preventive against erosion should be an allowable deduction. It is of no benefit to  the-.,  fftrnier  for. <inline font-style="italic">the,</inline> commissioner to grant;, a- concession, in, respect;  of  expenditure.- on . preventive measures  of  one type-. and. to refuse, it. in 4 relation- to another.

Opppsitiom members, concerning, soil erosion, but representations have been, made to the-. Government by -.all. interested parties,, including, primary producers' organizations, and we have had . many con-i ferences. Any one . looking at the . problem, frankly, would, I . think,, be. reluctant tomakeiundue allowances for. . expenditure on soil erosion. because they are open . to. abuse and ' difficulti to, police.. I suppose -. that applies to 'all aspects, of . taxation-; I foresee all sorts -of ridiculous.- claims being lodged: The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. . McEwen)</inline> knows -that .  an . allowanceis. already- made- for the, depreciation, of fences . -and that expenditure on dog? proof and- rabbit-proof . fences! is also a. deduction;- Every one must . admit that some, of the- erosion has arisen from the carelessness, of property-owners who haveoverstocked, particularly on lightlygrassed areas.-. Their "bad husbandry has produced, the.'state of -affairs .  that . we now proposes to assist : them to remedy. That does not- apply to all ' land-holders, of course;- but i  many - of ' them . have been, guilty of over-stocking, and, thereby:  they have caused erosion. I know considerable stretches of country where the owners have got the last penny out of it by over-stocking. A dry period followed by heavy rains has then caused erosion that could have been avoided had owners not been guilty of bad farming. One sees fairly steep hillsides from which every true, has been cleared after ringbarking. That has invited erosion, because the soil has been left without protection. Even now one can see great stretches of country in which the trees have been ringharked before clearing. Of course, the owners will get a far better return for a while from their land, but the ultimate result will be erosion. Any fair man will agree that this concession is open to grave abuse. Our intention, is to assist people to overcome the troubles that they have brought upon themselves by their own bad management. I have been asked by the honorable member for Indi to examine the exemption from tax of money expended on the erection of fences to keep stock off areas prone to erosion. L cannot promise to give the honorable member's request favorable consideration, but it will bc examined when the Income Tax Assessment. Act is under review again. </para>

                    <para>.- Soil erosion has been dealt with considerably by other honorable members. I merely point out that regardless of the money expended and means of expenditure in the fight against soil erosion it should be receiving consideration from the Taxation Commissioner because of the serious nature of the problem, which is yearly becoming worse. I entirely agree with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> that it is .difficult to police income tax concessions in respect of expenditure on measures to provide against soil erosion. I also know how difficult it is for local governments, State governments and even the Commonwealth Government to induce primary producers to adopt protective measures against soil erosion. The right honorable gentleman said that if consideration were given to desires expressed by honorable members difficulties of policing would .be increased, </para>

I suggest that any scheme for combating soil erosion that is acceptable to the local governing authorities should be acceptable to the Commonwealth Government.

                        <para>- My main reason for speaking is to deal with allowable expenditure on the sinking of bores and wells. Men prospecting for water sometimes employ water diviners and sometimes, at greater cost, geologists, but more often the ordinary farmer bores till he finds water. After having lost two or three drills, he may find water that is too salty for the stock. That is an unsuccessful bore. Honorable members may know the quantity of .salt that stock will take. Four or five bores may be sunk before suitable water is found. That costs money, but no allowance is made for expenditure on unsuccessful bores. I know what it means, having had several unsuccessful attempts at boring for water myself. Provision ought to be made to cover expenditure on unsuccessful bores. Water is the greatest need in any farming community. Soil conservation is second. </para>

                <para>Speaking on the financial statement which the Treasurer presented to the House recently, I urged the right honorable gentleman to grant as an allowable deduction money expended in combaning the encroachment of salt on properties.

Combating the encroachment of salt is a big task, and considerable sums of money are expended annually in this way. I should like to hear the Treasurer's opinion on this proposal, I. have written to him about the matter, but I have not yet received a reply, I should also like to hear his views regarding my suggestion that expenditure on unsuccessful bores should be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes. </para>

                        <para>- The Murray River irrigation area in South Australia has experienced the problem since 1927. In Western Australia, the encroachment of salt has occurred in rather peculiar circumstances on the light lands, as the result of a wash-off apparently from the higher areas. The problem has also arisen in the Murrum bid gee area. I am not able to promise that the honorable member will receive an early reply to his letter, because 1 must examine all aspects of this matter. However, I shall reply to his communication as soon as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Government on its decision to grant the concessions set out in proposed new paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">g. h</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of sub-section 1 of proposed new section 70 of the principal act. At this time, when we are looking forward to great developments in Australia, it is appropriate that the Government should encourage people who are prepared to expend money on developing their properties. These concessions become even more important at the moment, because the heavy rates of tax which have been imposed for a number of years, have prevented land owners from saving money to pay for the development of their holdings. The decision to allow as a deduction money expended in combatingor preventing soil erosion or in constructing dams, bores and irrigation channels, on land used for primary production, will give definite encouragement not only to land-holders but also to those people who would like to settle on the land. In the long run, the Government will reap the benefits of these improvements to the land, because it will be an annual source of income which will be taxable for many years. </para>

                <para>I invite the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to answer the request of the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> for elucidation of the proposed concessions. I should like to know whether the concession, applicable to the construction of dams, bores, wells, underground tanks, irrigation channels or similar structural improvements, will be extended to piping. If it will not, the Treasurer should give earnest consideration to the advisability of allowing expenditure on that kind of improvement as a deduction for income tax purposes. Once a person has expended a large sum of money in establishing a dam, well or bore, he may possibly use the water to better advantage by reticulating it to surrounding country than by sinking another bore or installing another tank. He might, also reticulate country where he is not able to construct a dam or sink a well. This suggestion is worthy of careful consideration, because people to an increasing degree are making better use of existing water supplies instead of providing additional ones. The Treasurer, if . I understood him correctly, is rather obsessed with the idea that the bulk of soil erosion in Australia has been deliberately caused by land holders. </para>

                        <para>- When settlers originally came to Australia from the northern hemisphere, 'theyencountered an. entirely different type of 'country, and different . climaticconditions from those to "which they'ha'd bcen'acGustonred. They and their . successors ' had '-a . 'good udeal ito learn about Australian conditions, and unfortunately, they learnt iby trial and error. Individuals are 'not '.the only culprits in this 'respect. After World War L, "State . governments made iland available 'for* tie settlement of  i  exr'servicemen. They . encouraged 'settlers ; to clear "the land,. and "the . 'destruction 'of the trees has caused -soil erosion in those areas. 'In the circumstances, any suggestion : that soil 'erosion 'in Australia has . been deliberately man-inade "would "be "unfair and incorrect. The country I bears definite evidence of natural soil "erosion. . Huge areas of sand  dune3  which extend over large ..parts of the country were there before settlement took place. Obviously, that is natural erosion. Now that wo have acquired greater 'knowledge o'f what can be. done with different types of country, it is gratifying . to see that the problem of soil erosion has impressed itself upon the ,  public mind to -such a degree that the. government of the day is encouraging primary producers to combat this definite menace. I am in entire accord with the . proposal. However, I agree with those honorable members who-state'd that one of the methods of combating soil erosion is to fence the affected areas. By that means, those lands will be regenerated. During the last ten or fifteen years, this Parliament has heavily subsidized settlers in the marginal areas. Therefore, this Parliament has a definite interest in combating erosion. One of the best methods is to fence off the affected areas and prevent stock from intruding on them. I. am not' impressed by the objection voiced by the 'Treasurer , that expenditure on fencing for the purpose of combating and . preventing soil erosion, would be difficult to. police. . All methods for combating soil erosion will be . difficult to police. Channelling, contour ploughing and other methods for combating soil erosion may also be employed to conserve land before erosion begins. Whilst that in itself " is desirable, I believe that the' "Government does not intend . -to -allow expenditure- on: it as a' deduction for income- . tax purposes. Surely the 'fact that erosion. is. present is evidence of the need for-'the particular -method that is 'being used -to . combat it'! if 'that be so,' the same 'kind of -evidence' can be 'used in "/respect -Of fencing as can ibe used -in respect' of every . iother method 'for 'combating ithis menace. Attempts '-will undoubtedly she made . to evade the purposes of f the proposed"amendments, ''and people wilh endeavour to derive an. advantage to which they are not entitled. -However, those -'attempts 'will . not be rcon'fine'd. ito persons 'who . -fence .:off areas damaged by soil erosion. iEencing is one of the forms of . protection jin which this 'Government is vitally interested, -.because of the huge sums 'that : this Parliament . has provided for the regeneration of '.marginal areas. After having gone . so far ito -provide' this desirable assistance the ' Government will make a, great mistake: if it disregards this one suggestion which, -in my opinion, is one of the. most, important for. combating erosion. </para>

'This is a very ibigi-problem, -and 'anything -that the Government does to help land occupiers io counter it . deserves the . commendation o'f honorable members : of all.parties. I shall not quibble about ..the provision in regard to fencing,, although T consider it" . would have been more generous on the part of - the 'Treasurer ('Mr.' Chifley) had he omitted this qualification 'from 'the bill. Reference has 'been made, chiefly to soil erosion by 'water, hut we all know that wind, can also' be a destructive agency. When land 'has "been recently cultivated a strong wind- may rise" which will sweep thousands df tons of top soil away. The erection of fences can do something to prevent that heavy loss, just -as 'can the growing of 'a ^holding crop to ' bind 'the surface 'soil.

If by the erection of fences' soil erosion, may be minimized-, why should not the- amount expended for that purposes be deductible? In my experience, and I know also in- the experience of other land-owners; the erection of fences of one kind and another' is most, valuable for: the prevention of soil erosion in at least three ways. The first was mentioned by the honorable member for Indi. (Mr: McEwen), when he referred to fences, which; would prevent animals; from entering on' the1 land. Thesecond, is' the1 erectioni of: fences' around areas that have beem planted with suitable crops in order to bind the surface of the land. The third is by the erection of more solid fences, probably of timber, which would prevent stormwater from cutting gullies in certain areas. Why does the (Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> baulk at allowing deductions in respect of such fences as these? I agree that there might be some possibility of an abuse of the provision, "but seeing that committees are active in various parts of Victoria and, I daresay, in other States in relation to the prevention of soil erosion, their services coilld be invoked to ensure that abuses did not occur. </para>

                    <para>. Most honorable members who have  addressed  themselves to this subject have referred to erosion by water, but in northern  YictoYia,  and' also in many parts of South Australia, a great deal o;f soil erosion has occurred through wind. In some of those areas' there are great hills of sand as high as this building: Surely if the erection of fences would prevent erosion of that kind', an' assertion with which L do not agree, a deduction should be  allowable  in respect of the cost. Does the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley ) really mean that all expenditure incurred in- the prevention of soil erosion " otherwise than by the' erection of fences" shall' be an allowable deduction ?' I bring, to the notice of the right honorable gentleman the value of the sowing of rye corn for this purpose. Bye corn, is growm in our northern areas as" a means of countering soil'</inline> erosion with  very  good results, but,, generally  Speaking  it"  is  not a payable crop. If a farmer planted an area to rye  corn,  would he be permitted to claim a' deduction in. resp'eet of <inline font-style="italic">tef</inline> The' intension, must- have; been to" include' the' sowing' of rye co'Kn,- otherwise' it would have been' specificaHy' excluded. The- cost" should be1 allowed a"s'&gt; a deduction, seeing that"the;cro'p-is'mo"t,.as-a'. rule; a payable- one. Those" who" are" tiding to- combat soil'  erosion  tttroughoutf  the northern parts of Victoria will agree with that statement. I do not hold the view that fencing assists very greatly to combat soil erosion in northern areas. Those who most need relief by means of a deduction in respect of the cost of fencing have properties in areas in which soil erosion is considerable, and causes their fences to become covered. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is not one of making repairs. The fences disappear. I should like to take the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> to parts of my electorate in which the fences may be 10 feet under the surface of the sand. Many fences are only about 2 feet' high. It is on record that 7-ecently some men in a certain district spread the wire preparatory to erecting a fence and then went to their dinner. "When they returned, they could not find the wire, because, during their absence, it had been covered by dust. The knowledge of soil erosion that is possessed by many Government supporters is confined to the mud with which their cars become covered in the city after a dust and rain storm.  I have visited what a few years ago was a very productive farm, on which dairying operations were conducted. The construction of a water channel through the property put an end to natural drainage, with the result that the salt is coming to the surface and nothing can be grown on it. Such a condition of affairs can be combated only by drainage. The unfortunate farmer has to have the land specially drained, and that is very costly. I should like the Treasurer to state whether or not he is prepared to allow this cost to be a deduction from income. The problem is very serious, and I urge him to give the matter his kindliest consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- I understood the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to say that a reason for disallowing the cost  of fencing which had been erected to combat soil erosion would be the difficulty of policing the matter. That is a sound reason. Nevertheless, the objection could be overcome through the instrumentality of officers of the State Departments of Agriculture, who do not belong to local governing bodies or committees. They are the best type of public servant. 'They do a remarkable job, by advising farmers  as to the best methods of dealing with soil erosion, and are completely unbiased. If they were to recommend the erection of fencing to cheek soil erosion, they could give a definite estimate of the probable cost, and when the work had been completed they could make certain that their recommendation had not been exceeded. I therefore ask the Treasurer to consider an amendment to include the cost of fencing authorized by such officers. </para>

                    <para>. - - I am pleased that some assistance is to be given in regard to soil erosion. In South Australia, an expert has been appointed to give advice on the subject, and quite a lot of work has been done through the agency of State officers. Any action recommended, apart from the erection of fences, will be taken. Honorable members opposite have complained that the existing income tax return is complex, yet they are now submitting proposals which, if given effect, would increase its complexity. The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.  Howse)</inline> has asked that the cost of fencing erected on the recommendation of officers of State departments of agriculture should be allowed as a deduction. That would necessitate a statutory declaration that the fencing had been erected solely for the purpose of combating soil erosion.  There are some honorable members on this side of the chamber whose knowledge of soil erosion is fairly considerable. Many land-holders consider  that one of the best methods of preventing soil erosion is to subdivide their land into small paddocks, keeping the stock on one paddock and growing feed on the others. "What would happen if the cost of fencing were allowed as a deduction? When a man went on to a big area, he could subdivide it and then claim that he had done so solely for the purpose of preventing soil erosion. It is well known that subdivision considerably increases the carrying capacity of a property. The difficulty would be to prove that the subdivision had been carried out merely to prevent soil erosion, and not to increase the productive capacity of the land. Take a property which has a small sandhill in the centre. If stock were allowed to pass over that hill, the sand would gradually drift and there would be soil erosion which would embrace the surrounding area. If the owner of the property were to erect a fence around the sandhill, he could claim that he was preventing soil erosion, and that consequently he should be allowed to deduct the cost. Yet the probability would be that he had purchased the property ax a reduced price because of the existence of the sandhill in the middle of it. The only way in which to prevent soil erosion in many places is to subdivide the land and keep the stock off those portions of it that are likely to erode. I do not doubt that legitimate claims can be made that fencing has been erected for the purpose of combating soil erosion. If the cost of fencing were an allowable deduction, the person making the return would have to produce evidence which would satisfy the department that the fencing had been erected solely for the purpose of combating soil erosion, and this would add to the difficulties and complexities of the situation. The proposals of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> will be of great assistance to those who want to take measures to combat soil erosion. I compliment the right honorable gentleman, and appreciate the difficulties with which he is confronted. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> has argued that allowance should be made in respect of all that is done to prevent soil erosion. I point out that the object pf erecting fencing is not solely to combat soil erosion; it is essential if farming generally is to prove successful. We on this side of the House appreciate what soil erosion, means, and the need to fight it. We also appreciate the difficulties that will be encountered unless some limitation is enforced in respect of fencing for the prevention of soil erosion. </para>

                <para class="block">The need to increase supplies of both softwoods and hardwoods in Australia is very urgent. In to-day's Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> there is a two-column article on the production of timber in South Australia, and it is published at an opportune time. In that State it is proposed to produce from 60,000,000 to 75,000,000 super, feet of timber within three years, and 150,000,000 super, feet within nine years. This may seem a large quantity, but less than¼ per cent, of the total area of South Australia is under forest. Even in Western Australia, where there are large forest areas, only one acre out ofevery 187 carries forest of a suitable kind. When we compare Australia's timber resources with those of such countries as Norway and Sweden, and the countries in the neighbourhood of the Carpathian mountains, we realize how much better off. those countries are than is Australia. I believe that the Commenwealth Government should do more to assist afforestation projects by private enterprise. Private land-owners should be encouraged to plant trees on country in suitable rainfall areas which is not particularly suitable for grazing, hut which is suitable for the production of timber, and special taxation concessions should be granted to them provided the trees planted are of a suitable type approved by State forestry authorities. In the Kuitpo area of South Australia, near Adelaide, where the rainfall is satisfactory, the forestry department, about 25 years ago, tried broadcasting the seeds of forest trees. Nine different kinds of  eucalypts and . piries, were left to grow under natural- conditions,, and it was found that certain varieties of pine and the spotted gums showed -the -most prolific growth.  Out  afforestation enterprises' are . pf "two" kinds, 'one  for  the production of softwood,, and the other for the production of hardwoods-.

                    <para>.- I support: very warmly the- amendment, moved by the. honorable member for Barker (Mir. Archie Cameron.), and I hope that it- will; receive' the serious-consideration- of the Government. We started off with, a country bearing valuable forests, but during the last hundred years" we have been despoiling' these forests- at a terrific rate, and not replanting them. Forests have three main functions. The&gt; first is closely connected with the' subject which we have* just been discussing3 - erosion. The' Treasurer (Mr: Chifley)- must realize the enormous amount of erosion which has1 taken. place' in various' parts of eastern1 Australia), including Gippsland',' wherer- forests have- been', destroyed. Once the 'trees are removed s the- rain, washes' the soil off the hillsides: and down, into the rivers; thus causing; damage not! only: in the - immediate area'j buti also in-, other places'; remote- from the.: highlands- thenr-r selvesa Eorests- have'  ant  effect* on. the water- supply,;, and in Australia we: are naturallyshort ofiwater. In forest. areas, the:. water; which falls^as rain' is absorbed by the accumulated humus- on. the. forest, floor, and: only gradually seeps into; the waterways.. When the: forests', are destroyed;, the:, water; flows rapidly down thehi'llsi'des;- and makes its' way. along-the rivers to' the sea, doing very little good i to'- the1 land" owned by pastoralrats, or. agriculturists: The- third function' of forests, is to provide- timber. We are; dependent for- hardwood on. our own fbrests, while for softwoods we' are dependent on imports from other countries. We- know to - our' cost the price which- we have' te pay for imported softwoods for. the.' construction of houses and for- hundreds'- of other purposes. There have been increases' in- the past1 in a num*ber of softwood forests planted; but these increases have not represented anything like whatv isi required. If we are to continue' the heavy use of timber' we shall have to fall back- on our own resources, and we will be able to do- that only bycarrying' out an- intensive- system o." afforestation. Flew governments- - certainly not' the. Commonwealth- Govern ment - have encouraged the conservation and" restoration of our forests, the planting of new forests or of new woods. It is- mainly the responsibility of ' the State governments to look after these matters, and' at last they are beginning to- realize the necessity for afforestation work. In Victoria, recently, an organization known as 'the "Save the forests" organization was formed with a membership spread over tine whole of the State. Amongst other things the organization issues - propaganda designed to teach the- people of Victoria the value of- their forest's in the three senses' I have described! It also sends out to; its members young trees and plants and endeavours to- keep- the forests growing and replenished with young: seedlings: The- Commonwealth Government lias not' done anything in this direction. In proposing this amendment the honorable member foi" Barker- has rendered the country a good service, and F. trust he has" planted', in the mind of the Government a thought which- one daywill bear good- fruit. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>As" the' honorable member for' Barker has said, consideration, must be1- given' to the long' and short- range aspects* of our forests policy. The long-range aspect includes the replenishing of our forests, particularly our hardwood forests which nave been seriously depleted and which in many cases cannot be restored to their former plenitude of wood for many years. The conservation and restoration of our forests should receive every encouragement from the Government. The restoration of our hardwood forests is a problem which concerns, not only the State governments, but also private individuals. "Within a short distance of my home, there are a number of plantations which have been developed during the last 30 or 40 years by private persons. These are mostly planted in <inline font-style="italic">Pinus</inline><inline font-style="italic">radiata</inline> and have done exceedingly well. Such plantations are of tremendous importance to Australia. Although there are large ureas of land not suitable for other than the growing of trees, little, or no encouragement is given to the people to develop them and grow timber  to  supply, our future needs. The suggestion of the honorable member for Barker that money expended on the extension of our forests should be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes is very sound because such expenditure will not be reproductive for many years. Planting trees is not' an inexpensive process. First, the land must be cleared, then the holes dug, then the trees bought and planted, and after all that has been done the trees must be looked after. When the timber is finally cut and marketed only then do the owners of these forests receive a' dividend on their investment of time and money. One man who in the last few years. cut a very large area of <inline font-style="italic">Finns radiata</inline> was taxed by the , income tax authorities on the whole amount received for the timber, notwithstanding that it represented the accumulated value of trees planted over 35 years ago. The taxation authorities took the greater part of the revenue derived by this man from that source. That is grossly unfair. A reasonable and realistic attitude should be adopted in connexion with this matter. The proceeds of sales of timber from privately owned forests should be spread over a number of years for income tax purposes. I support the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Barker and trust that the Government will give it serious consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - I strongly support the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron).</inline> A great deal of the field has already been covered by the two previous speakers, but there is one matter to which I should like to refer, namely, the position of Australia in relation .to timber for case-making. The fruit industry particularly is dependent to a large extent upon imported timbers for the casing, of fruit for export. At present our hardwoods are . suitable for the making of dump and picking cases. We have used hardwood cases for exports in the past, but they have been found not entirely suitable for that purpose. At present we are dependent largely on Canada for the supply of pine woods for the making of fruit cases for the export crop. The amendment seeks to encourage the production of our own pine timbers and, at the same time, to reduce the cost of export cases by producing the suitable timber in Australia. Canadian pine timbers sell at high prices, and many fruit exporters, not being able to afford Canadian pine for their cases, exported their fruit in hardwood cases to the detriment of good advertising for the Australian fruit-growing industry. In order to conserve our markets abroad our export fruit should arrive at its destination in good condition and be  marketed in the most attractive condition possible, but that is not always possible where hardwood cases are used. The amendment has a most desirable objective and accordingly I strongly support it. </para>

                    <para>. - I, too, support the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> and I associate the Australian Country party wholeheartedly with it.  Any one with a knowledge of Australian .timbers, particularly of the softwoods of northern Queensland, must realize that this amendment is not only timely but also desirable as a means of stepping up reafforestation and giving encouragement to the harvesting of the stands of timbers that are available. As the result of the war, the softwoods of northern Queensland, were rapidly cut down, to meet defence requirements, thus rendering future supplies doubtful During the war our forests were rapidly denuded but, because of the shortage of man-power, it was impossible to carry out reafforestation schemes. Any one with even a meagre knowledge of. the timber industry knows that the heavy demands of the war detrimentally affected the future timber resources of this country. The forests of northern Queenslurid produce some of the most beautiful and useful softwoods in the world. A sympathetic implementation of the principle of the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Barker will provide a desirable fillip to the production of Australian timbers. I and members of my party tender our thanks to the honorable member for his far-sightedness in bringing forward his amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> and in doing so I" should like to raise one or two matters. We are all agreed that Australia is desperately short of suitable timbers.Not only have we to replace timber wantonly wasted in the past, but we must also increase the forest areas because timber is used for so many purposes. Australian supplies are now very low and accordingly we must utilize every possible means for increasing them, not only through State instrumentalities but also  by encouraging private persons to plant forests. In the big timber-producing countries of the world, Sweden, Canada and the United States of Amenca, for every tree cut down two trees are planted in its place. The governments of those countries are fully alive to the importance of replacing their stands of timber. In Canada that policy has paid handsome dividends.In looking through an American magazine the other day 1- saw an advertisement inserted by a firm of tree surgeons, indicating how important trees are regarded in that country. These tree surgeons operate, on trees and advise growers as to the best methods of treatment and cultivation. </para>

                    CORSER (Wide Bay) |' 4.3  7].  - I support the amendment. A shortage of timber in Australia is inevit able and accordingly every assistance should be given to people to plant private forests, engage in the production of commercial woods, and to foster their timber resources, even though they obtain no return from their investment for many years. The amendment proposes to grant to such people some measure of assistance by relieving 'them of some liability for income tax in respect of the proceeds of the sale of their timber. All aspects of the timber industry, and of the tax levied on the sale of timber, should be thoroughly reviewed. The Treasurer will remember that some time ago I brought before him the case of a man who sold over 30,000 super feet of timber which had been growing on his property for thirty years. This man was compelled to pay income tax on the whole of the proceeds of the sale, yet had he sold the timber as it stood in his paddock he would not have been taxed on the proceeds. Surely that is an anomaly which should be rectified. The Treasurer will surely agree that in such circumstances no tax should have been levied. If the person concerned had held his timber until it matured and disposed of it as a job lot in his paddock he would have escaped a heavy load of tax. Timber growers should be relieved of income tax on this form of production. All Australian governments are concerned about Australia's timber resources. The Commonwealth Government has expended more than any other government on reafforestation and on forestry research and the instruction of scientists and forestry officers. The assistance advocated in the proposal of the honorable member for Barker would be a small addition to what the Commonwealth Government has already done in the national interest, to ensure the conservation of timber. I hope the Treasurer will accept the amendment in order that there may be an added inducement

A person might grow trees almost to maturity and then lose them in a. forest fire. The Commonwealth Government is aware of that risk because only a few years ago a fire swept through and destroyed thousands  df  pines it had planted above the Cotter clam in the Australian Capital Territory. It is unreasonable to expect private people to engage in this form of production on any scale without reasonable . assistance, because it is not only expensive but also risky. I am sure thatowing to  : our  desperate need for timber anything that the Government does in the way advocated by the honorable member for Barker will give a returnto the nation. </para>

                        <para>- I am not taking advantage of the Minister, or twisting his statement. He was guilty of most dishonest advocacy in this House last night. He asked the people to believe that the basis of his comparison was a true one, and he invited me to accept a challenge on a basis which he knew was absolutely wrong and impossible, having regard to the way in which he presented it.  His  offer was like that of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Lauder who agreed to pay £1,000 to the widow of the Unknown Soldier. The Minister asked me to accept the challenge on his figures that the system of rebate - £150 - which prevails to-day is comparable with his, deduction basis of £50. He presented a table, calculating a deduction prior to the introduction of uniform income taxation on the basis of £50 for a dependent wife, and he made an unfair and dishonest comparison with the proposed rebate system of £150 for a wife. However, I shall use his own figures, and make comparisons which should be true and acceptable to a reasonable man. I apply the rebate of £150 and the deduction of £150 to the' figures which he presented. "What do I find ? Under the rebate system, a man in receipt of £250 a year would pay £3 7s. in tax, and under the deduction system he would not pay any tax. Therefore, there is an advantage of £3 7s. in that instance. A man in receipt of £300 a year would pay under the rebate system £11 2s. and under the deduction system £5, so that the advantage in favour of the deduction system is £6 2s. A man in receipt of £350 would pay £21 under the rebate system, and £10 16s. under the deduction ' system - an advantage in favour of the deduction system of £10 4s. A man receiving £400 per annum would pay under the rebate system a levy of £30 6s. and under the deduction system £18 14s., the difference in favour of the deduction system being £11 12s. On an income of £500,. the tax under the rebate system would be £50 6s. and under the deduction system £38, so that the advantage in favour of the deduction system would be £12 6s., </para>

                <para>The Minister, in asking me to accept a basis of comparison of only £50' under the deduction system, and £150 under the rebate system, was most unfair. However, I shall use some of his own ammunition, and regard the deduction as £100 as against a rebate of £150. What do I find? On an income of £250, under the rebate system, a taxpayer with a dependent wife would, pay £3 14s. and under the deduction system £5, which is a variation against the deduction system of £l6s. </para>

                        <para>- As no other honorable member has risen in his place, I shall take my second period now. The Minister used only a part of the law. He used the law as it is applicable to the allowances for a wife and child. Under the deduction system, before the introduction of the uniform income tax, there was a special deduction that the Minister or his advisers, either inadvertently or wilfully, overlooked. I refer to section 81 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which provided what it described as an "allowable deduction" to any person, other than a company, of £200, less £1 for every £1 by which the income exceeded £200. This section was' repealed when the uniform income tax was introduced. However, that is a deduction under the law as it applied before the introduction of uniform income taxation. It was a deduction that, the Minister, if he had been an honest advocate, would have included in his calculations. Therefore, on the basis of that consideration and the facts it behoves the Minister to pay £100 to a charitable institution, and I shall nominate it. </para>

                </quote><para class="block">Under the law! I remind the Minister and his advisers that the Commonwealth income tax law was not the only law that operated up to 1941-42. He has used only a part of the Commonwealth law. He neglected the State income tax laws that allowed deductions and statutory exemptions. If 1. wanted to take that point, I could do so, and where would he be? He spectacularly and blatantly threw out his chest and issued a challenge to me. It behoves him now to pay £100 to  a  charitable institution. I emphasize that the Minister stated that the levy was computed in accordance with the law as to deductions as they operated before 1943. when the uniform income tax took effect.I shall give him the advantage of applying only the provisions of the Commonwealth income tax law to the deduction system. The Commonwealth law provided a deduction of £50 for a dependent wife, £50 for the first child, and a special deduction to any person other than a company, the sum of £200, less £1 for every £1 by which the income exceeded £200. The honorable gentleman must not take half the argument. He cannot say - "I. shall take a. deduction of £50 and apply it", particularly as he applied £150 to support his own case, and allowed me only £50. He cannot ignore the statutory allowances, namely, the deduction of £200 on a reducing scale. Let us apply the provisions of the Commonwealth income tax law to the exact terms of the challenge, and I shall show where he has failed. He declared that in respect of all incomes up to £500 per annum, a taxpayer is much better off under the rebate system than under the deduction system. If I prove that in one case the. deduction law was more beneficial, the Minister must lose his challenge according to the terms in which he issued it. Now, a taxpayer in receipt of £350 a year, with a dependent wife, would pay under the rebate system, according to the table which the Minister incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard/,</inline> an amount of £21. He then  applied , his . own version of the law . relating to deductions prior -to the:introduction of uniform . income . taxation. In fact, he took only part -of the Commonwealth income tax law, providing 'for a deduction of £50 in respect of the wife. He subtracted ; '£50 from the income of ; £350, leaving ; £300, looked at'.therates.-proposed for 1947-48 for . an . income -.of £300 per annum,and discovered that the . tax would be £28. Therefore, : he gave as his view that under the rebate system, a. jtax of £21 is better than -the deduction 'system, involving, a tax of . £28 on a comparable income of -£350. Unfortunately for the Minister,she overlooked some allowable deductions which operated before the introduction of the uniform income tax. </para><para>Under section 81 of the-Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment Act, . which was the law - and -the Minister referred ito tie law - thesum -of -£100, which was the allowable 'deduction, must also be taken into account. That 'leaves an -amount . of £200. Applying the Minister's own formula,I find that the proposed levy on the1947-48 rateswould be£10 l7s. under the . deduction system, -or -£10 3s. 'less than he would have . to pay 'under . the present rebate system. on a comparable income of £350.Ido not consider that there is any necessity for me -to . cite further instances. The Minister either wilfully misled 'this committee, ashe ; accused . the honorable member . for Reid(Mr. Lang) last night of having done, or'ignor antly stated 'What he believed to . be the facts.

                <para>The Leader of the .

Bu.t what matters to the taxpayer is not whether . 'one system or the 'other is 'applied., but whether- the amount of tax he pays will be reduced or not. I regard the -statement of the . Leader &gt;of -the Australian Country party this afternoon as in the nature -of another' manipulation -of' fig.ures. I' believe that, he  will  agree with me -tin ait at the . beginning of the speech of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction '('Mr. DedmanD on ithis subject yesterday- that honorable gentleman pointed out that when the change was made from dedw&gt; tions to rebates the amount was increased from £5.0 to £100, in order to . counteract any former benefit of &gt;the deductions system. That is ajl I desire to, say on the subject. </para>

I said last night, when.1 dealt with this subject, that it was not possible to give satisfactory comparable, figures for Canada, such, as had been asked for by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> because the. taxation system of Canada, like that of the United States of America, was not properly comparable with" the Australian system. In both America and Canada the State and provincial governments levy taxes which they collect altogether apart from the collections made by the Federal Government and there is no satisfactory way of obtaining full information in respect of the total of 'both the State and provincial and federal taxes. In response to requests"! gave to honorable members comparable figures in relation to the United Kingdom. New Zealand, and Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No; but allowance was made for the national insurance contribution in the United Kingdom, and for the contributory social service tax of New Zealand. The systems of taxation in the three countries are properly comparable. I assume that the figures cited by the honorable member for Richmond referred only to the federal tax imposed by the Canadian' Government. In regard to local government taxes, I gave figures last night which I believe were clear, although they were not given in the form of a schedule. I said that, in Australia, indirect taxes, including local government taxes, amounted to approximately £23 <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> and that, the comparable impost in New Zealand was £27 10s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> and in .the United Kingdom £42 <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> including borough taxes. 1 did not give the committee the figures with any intention to deceive anybody. I -did not. give the Canadian or American figures because the systems there are different, in that, as I have said, both the federal, provincial and State governments levy taxes. The comparisons that I made related to three countries in which the whole of the taxes were' levied by the central governments and could not be  disputed. </para>

                    <para>.- I had another matter to raise on this clause, but deferred dealing with it until honorable members hod dealt with other matters which preceded it. I shall comment first on what the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has just told the committee about the comparative rates of income tax in this and certain other countries in respect of which he has supplied figures. My comments will be brief, because I believe that most honorable members are familiar with the arguments that have been advanced. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>My first comment is that the Treasurer has supplied details in respect of three countries which have Labour-Socialist governments. It is natural to expect that a very considerable proportion of the expenditure in those countries will be governmental expenditure. ' I believe that the people of Australia will be interested to learn what the proportion would be likely to be in countries in which private enterprise is the system favoured by the Government; for example, in the United States of America, in Canada - to which reference has -just been made - in South Africa, and in many other countries. I understand that even in France the rates are very much lower than they are in Australia. If we are to have a balanced picture of what is a reasonable quantum of tax for a government to take from the national income in order to provide those essential services to which so much reference has. been made - protection by way of security, the provision of social services and of essential utilities, and matters of that kind - we must look to what is happening in other countries which we believe possess a comparable degree of civilization and a standard of living which, broadly speaking, is similar to ours. We shall not obtain such a picture from a study of the figures in relation to three Labour-Socialist governments. The United States of America consistently pursued, right up to the war years, the policy of comparatively low taxation, yet it has been able to give to its people the highest standard- of living, generally speaking, that is known to the world. If the Treasurer wants to convince the people that, having regard to the responsibilities of government to-day, our taxes are no greater than they should be, he should place before them a balanced picture which would show what is occurring in those other countries to which I have referred. </para>
                <para>My second comment is that, even if we' narrow our examination to the figures which the Treasurer has presented to us, his argument cannot be sustained; because, in order to make his case he has had to include social services contributions in Great Britain and New Zealand. Of course, the figures in relation to those services in Australia also have been included. But the right honorable gentleman has ignored the fundamental point that if a man with a substantial income in the United Kingdom or New Zealand contributes to the scheme of social services .in either of those countries, he becomes entitled by reason of 'those Contributions to the benefits which the scheme provides. But that is not the position in .Australia, where the so-called .social services contribution is, in point of fact, a direct tax, from which no benefits can be obtained unless a means test can be satisfied. Only a small proportion of the people of Australia. - I believe that I saw it estimated some time ago at about one-third of the population - would ever become entitled to the benefits for which contributions are made at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- The social services contributions in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, countries which the Treasurer has used to bolster up his case, can rightly be claimed to be social services contributions, because they confer  benfits  as a right. In Australia, on the contrary, the social services contribution is a tax, from which some may not benefit in the future. The Treasurer has said by way of interjection that 60 per cent, of the people who make this contribution will be entitled to the benefits of the scheme. </para>

                <para>Flie other matter which arises on this clause relates to rebates for medical and similar expenditure. I understand that some liberalization of the present conditions is proposed'. But I again raise with the committee the removal' of the limit of the amount which may bc claimed by way of rebate where such expenditures have been properly incurred for medical, dental and similar services. We have pointed out in the past that those persons who- have the most serious illnesses, and consequently the heaviest expenditure, receive proportionately the lightest relief. If1 the expenditure of one' year amountsto £50} the taxpayer receives a rebate on the total sum. But if' one lias undergone one or more major operations, involving a long period of. hospital treatment, at a cost of £100- or more, one can obtain, a rebate in respect jc-f only £50'of that amount. With income tax at the existing high rates, the serious- illness of any member of a family, particularly one in the middle ranges of income, can be a disaster to the whole family. If- proper medical treatment has to be given after operations have been performed, the charge for hospital care is high. Many persons in the middle ranges of income, from £500 to £1,000 a year and even higher, have experienced the unhappy fate that one or more of the. members, of their families has had a serious- illness in the' one year and they have been; unable to meet the expenses incurred.. ISTo. one would seriously suggest that any person incurs- heavy medical expenses- voluntarily; that, because' a rebate is given, a. person would prolong, an. illness or undergo- a major operation involving heavy expenditure.. Hardship exists^, and it will- continue to exist as. long, as the- present provision ret mains, unaltered. If. the Gcovernment were returning to om citizens in the middle ranges of income a higher proportion, of their total' incomes, instead of taking- from them; as- much, as it does by way of- income tax, it. would not be necessary to press this point.; but the- legislation; having become not merely- ar taxing instrument but also a social' document; with all sorts of provisions to- meet the anomalies that arise, pressure- of the point is necessaa-y. I know of no* object bion. in principle to the proposal' that I have' made. The cost to; the revenue would be very small, and advantages would accrue to. those persons who. have nob merely- to' undergo the pain and misfortune of a serious illness or operation; but also- to shoulder the very heavy- expenses that are associated' with- it. </para>

                    <para>.- I have considered for a long time that the politics of this country in respect of income tax have become badly out of proportion. Elections may well be fought on principles of taxation or the expenditure of tax proceeds, but a bald statement in regard to a reduction of rates is a fatal ground on which to stage an electoral battle. From time to time, the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt.)</inline> has compared the tax laws of Australia with those of other countries, and has sought to show that Australia is the most heavily taxed country in the world. As he has been challenged and defeated in those fields, he has regularly shifted his ground", until to-day he has resorted to. a comparison of countries that are not comparable. Having been shown, on perfectly legitimate grounds, that, the tax systems of the principal British countries which axe somewhat alike in character reflect in favour of this., country,, he has. sought to compare Australia, with the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">United States of America and the Dominion of. Canada, in which the conditions are such as to allow of no comparison. In the United States of America, there is a direct income tax which, is fairly new in character. It was not possible of implementation until the American Constitution had been amended. There are other taxes, such as the federal income tax, the State taxes and tha city tax, which are sodiverse in character that they cannot be compared with income tax in Australia. They have all the ordinary taxes as we know them, and, in addition, other complicated and onerous: taxes, such as the general property tax, which are unknown in this country.' The honorable member introduced this discussion to save face, but it has- not strengthened his. argument, and certainly he has not proved that people in Australia are more heavily taxed than people elsewhere. As a matter of. fact, taxation systems in the United States of America are very much more complicated: than ours. In the House of Representatives, in the United States of America, a motion was tabled recently de- manding the introduction of a more simple system of taxation, just as the honorable member suggested here, but it was. done with more reason in the United States of America. We come back, therefore, to the question whether the Government is taking from the community more in taxes than is necessary. In order to decide this point, we. should examine, not the total national income, nor even. the quantum - to use the word which he loves so much - of revenue collected by the Government, but the incidence of taxation on each individual, having regard to his family responsibilities. We should then examine how revenue is expended. I believe that if. this is done, every honorable member will, be forced. to agree that present government expenditure is. fully justified. No one will suggest that existing social services are undesirable or unnecessary. In fact, they make possible a greater revenue return, because they represent latent purchasing power in the hands of the community. So far. as taxation is concerned, Australia cannot be compared in all particulars with any other country, but conditions here probably resemble more closely those in the. United Kingdom and in New Zealand. The position in. South Africa is different, because there the. economy of the country is dependent so largely upon mining,. and. much of the national revenue is derived from that source. Anexamination of the figures shows that in Australia taxpayers, in the lower and middle income ranges pay less per head to-day than they did. before the war in both Commonwealth and State taxes. This is true, despite the fact that very heavy expenditure was incurred for war purposes, and that social service benefits have been increased. </para>

                        <para>- No, that, is something completely different.I refer to income tax as- such. If the honorable member wishes to include indirect taxation we might. have a profitable discussion on that; also.. The honorable member forFawkner,, when a. Minister, introduced some valuable social services, and that is to his credit, but. they were financed by a. pay-roll tax, something, which is completely, bad in principle because among other faults it. penalizes the good employer of labour. The employer who pays the minimum, wage to his employeesis required to pay less- tax- than the employer who treats1 his workers well. During the life of. the lastParliament the honorable member, I believe, suggested that the pay-roll tax should be- increased in order to endow the first child under the child endowment scheme- As I'have said, those in, the lower and middle income groups pay less income tax now than they did before the war. If we accept, the challenge of honorable members opposite, and separate social service contributions from income tax proper, the position in. regard to income tax, so far as the bulk of the population is concerned, is found to be. still more favorable. Honorable members opposite have repeatedly stated that any social services system should be contributory. We can fairly claim that this Government has granted greater exemptions than has any previous government. </para>

                        <para>- That; does not enterinto the matter. There are more people:  in employment to-day so that, although most of them individually are paying less than they used to, the total revenue is greater. There is nothing extraordinary in that. Before the war, 500,000' men and women were out of work. Had they all been in employment, the total revenue collected would have been much greater. The real question is, how much tax does each citizen have to pay, and how does it affect his domestic budget? I maintain that, haying regard to its heavy commitments, and the expanded social services, this Government has done a remarkable job in reducing taxes by as much as has been done. </para>

                <para>We frankly admit that, on the higher incomes, taxation is greater than ever before. If those in receipt of high incomes were not taxed- so heavily, they would make a greater demand on the limited quantity of commodities at present available. They would, of course, also stimulate the demand for luxury goods, something which should be encouraged only when the supply- of basic goods is assured. By improving social services, we fulfil a social need, and by increasing the general purchasing power of the community we also stimulate business. Every person whose pension has been increased from 21s. to £2 a week is able to buy more basic goods than he could before. This must necessarily stimulate industry, and this, in turn, will increase the national revenue. </para>
                <para>At the present time, when government expenditure is high, we believe that taxes should be imposed first on those who suffer least by it, and social services should be provided for those who need them most, and who, by spending the money in their possession, will most benefit the community. I maintain that the Government's approach to this matter has been eminently sensible and practical. The whole problem must be examined carefully in order to discover by how much taxation can properly be reduced. To talk about the national income, and the total volume of taxation returns, without considering the ordinary financial requirements of the Government, and the nation's commitments in the way of social services, is to show a lack of appreciation of the fundamental issues involved. </para>

                <para class="block">As I intimated last night, women are limited, at least in the field of industry, to the earning of only a fixed proportion of the male rate of pay. Of course, the reason for this provision lies in the assumption that the male is the breadwinner for the family, and that on him devolves the responsibility for their sustenance. , Unhappily, it is true that in many instances the mother of a family, through widowhood or because of desertion, becomes the sole support of her children. I wish to point out how great are her difficulties in those circumstances, and under the further economic difficulty which she has to face under our present system. All my life I have wondered why the Holy Scriptures paid such attention to the widows of the community; but -having myself become a widow, I realize, as perhaps many others cannot who have not passed through that experience, the great difficulties encountered by any woman who has to make provision, either through the acceptance of a widow's pension, or by her own efforts, for the material welfare of her children ; who must give them the guidance which she would normally be required to give as a mother, and in addition that guidance which the father would normally .give ; and who must give them that physical care necessary for their full development. Last night I cited the case of a Penvale school teacher, who is paid kiss than a male teacher similarly classified in the department, who pointed out that if the male officer were married and had two dependants' he would bc in a position similar to her own in that she is a widow supporting two children. A man with two dependants normally would support a wife and one child and would, therefore, get a greater tax concession than the woman supporting two children. Yet, under our law, she is not permitted to receive the same remuneration as the man.. Not only has the married male teacher, or a person similarly circumstanced in another occupation, an- advantage hy way of income tax concession, he also enjoys the further advantage that one of his two dependants' provides certain services in his home for which the woman either must .pay some one else or must herself exert a tremendous effort in addition to keeping on the work she has to do. That, of course, presents a great difficulty to her. I suggest that it is well within the capability of the Treasurer to meet this situation, partly, at any rate, through the income tax legislation. I know perfectly well all the demands that are made upon- the right honorable gentleman to meet this, that, o:- the other situation; but, as was pointed out 'by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> in connexion with concessions relating to medical expenses, the sum total of a concession such as this' should not be very great. To each individual concerned, however, it would represent quite a considerable amount. After all, if this woman were to relinquish her employment and accept instead the widow's pension, as would be her normal right, the charge upon the Treasury would be very much greater than the granting of such a concession as I have suggested. I commend the case to the Treasurer, and hope that he will give it his earnest attention. I believe it will' at least have his sympathetic consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- The clause with which the committee is now dealing is designed to effect certain amendments of the rebate system, particularly as applied under section 160 of the principal act. In general, I agree with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)-</inline> that the clause effects some desirable improvements; but there is one further amendment which also has relation to section 160 of the act which the Government might well have considered. I refer to rebates on gifts made for the relief of our kinsmen in Great Britain. To-day the people of Great Britain are in distress and a number of public institutions' and organizations in this country are doing their best to obtain funds to relieve that distress. One of these institutions, the Australian Bed Cross Society, is placed at an advantage by comparison with others in that gifts made to the society are subject to rebate of tax under section 160. Donations made to the fund conducted by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne and to other funds established for similar purpose are not subject to rebates. Some time ago, I raised in the Parliament the question of admitting such gifts to the income tax concessions group, and on the 30th April last the Treasurer sent me a letter which reads, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline></para>

The desirability . of strict adherence to this principle is evidenced, firstly, by thef act that the principle has . been observed by successive -governments in .

                <para>What taxation principle is involved'?

                    <para>.- This clause amends section 160aa of the principal, act. which provides for the allowance of a rebate in respect of calls paid on shares in a mining company or syndicate carrying on mining operations in Australia for gold, silver, base metals, rare minerals or oil, or in any company carrying on afforestation in Australia asits principal business. The amendment extends the concession to shareholders in prospecting companies. I should like toknow whether it is possible to extend it to shareholders in companies engaged in. prospecting for water. </para>

                        <para>- That does not matter. It can be brought to the surface. Water is a natural resource that is probably much more valuable to Australia if used in the proper places, than all the base metal that may be discovered. It would be a simple matter to insert a provision covering calls on shares held in such companies. I think the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> need have no fear that that concession would get out of hand or be the subject of claims by people not, entitled to it. No one would incur the risk of losing capital merely to bore holes all over the country in places where there is no likelihood of striking water merely to . obtain a rebate of tax. The only claims that would be lodged would be legitimate. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do not think that the country's finances would be jeopardized by that concession. I should like to know whether I need to move an amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Australians, generally, know that very ' large tracts of country in central Australia are barren wastes because of the lack of water. The Government freely offers tax concessions to those who prospect for gold, silver, base metals, rare minerals or oil. In certain parts of Australia, water would be much more valuable than any one or all of those minerals and oil. I have not submitted this amendment facetiously, although certain honorable members appear to think that I was trying to be humorous in doing so. I know of a company of engineers interested in prospecting for water in Central Australia. They claim that they have already established that Cooper's Creek and other streams, which ran freely 50 or 100 years ago and which are now silted up as the result of wind erosion, are still running underneath the surface of the earth. If they could be tapped by artesian boring and the water raised to the surface in those barren areas where no human being can now subsist, Australia could support a larger population, which would be distributed throughout the length and breadth of the country. Under existing conditions, the people are confined to the coastal fringe. I submit this amendment in the sure knowledge that it will not, make any demands on the Treasury. People who are altruistic enough to expend their money in the search for water will not waste it on boring holes in the hope that they will receive a tax concession. The money will be expended for the purpose of finding water, and only when boring operations are unsuccessful will the company possibly ask for this concession. I am being frank with the Treasurer when I say that I have been requested to submit this proposal to him, because certain people are interested in the matter. The request is simple. Prospecting for oil is no different from prospecting for water, unless we believe that oil is much more valuable than water. I submit that it is not. In these circumstances, water would be more valuable than all the minerals which I mentioned and oil. I hope that the Treasurer will accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - As I  promised, I have examined this matter, but I am not, able to accept the amendment. I have not been able to discover any instances of companies which are engaged in prospecting for water other than those which hire on their plant for sinking wells or constructing dams, and some large manufacturing organizations which make provision for their own supplies of water on their own properties. Primary producers who expend money on providing water are adequately covered, first, by the depreciation provisions' of the taxation law and, secondly, by the amendments contained in this bill. I mentioned this afternoon that money which a primary producer expends on unsuccessful bores is an allow - able deduction. In this instance, primary producers in the position which the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> described, are adequately covered. I am not able to visualize an ' organization prospecting for water for purely altruistic reasons. As I study this proposal, oil and water will not mix. The honorable member has selected a bad combination. However, that is not the reason why I am unable to accept the amendment. Perhaps there are some aspects which I have not had an opportunity to examine. I congratulate the honorable member on having made a completely original proposal, but the most I can say now is that I shall ascertain whether there is any justification for giving to the proposal favorable consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment. I appreciate the assurance which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has given, that if any new factors can be adduced in favour of the amendment, he will re-examine the proposal. However, the attitude which he has adopted is rather narrow. On the eastern coast of Australia, there are extensive water-bearing areas in the sand beds. A good deal of discussion has taken place recently in the Newcastle and lower New England area regarding the use of the water in the Tomago sand beds. The word " Tomago " is becoming well known throughout Australia as the result of the fight to secure for Samuel Courtauld and Company (Australia) Proprietary Limited the right to use water from the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Tomago, sands, which are under the. jurisdiction of the Hunter District Water Board. However, the Tomago sand's are not rare. Similar; sandbeds exist over much of. the- eastern coast; of Australia. Artesian water engineers state that two-fifths of: the total rain that falls on these sandbeds is trapped by the impervious clays beneath the sandbeds, is held there, and forms a reservoir.. There is a. tremendous scope for the development of. these areas.. Yesterday, I read the latest- issue of: <inline font-style="italic">SouthWest Pacific. It</inline> contains- some glorious photographs' of. the extensive underground lakes which exist; beneath, the limestone of the Great Australian. Desert, particularly the Eucla artesian basin adjacent to the Great Australian. Bight. There; there is tremendous- scope, for. the development of. water both for irrigation, and for general purposes. </para>
                <para>There are two theories: in: geology about artesian: waters in. Australia. The: theory advanced by the late Erofessor Baldwin-Spencer is based: on. the plu tonic origin of water. According to this view, the waiter is driven up, apparently through; tha pressure of the rocks; no one: quite understands how that occurs. The. second theory is- that advanced by the late Professor <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edgeworth</inline> David with regard to- the- intake of the waterbeds' on the western slopes of the Dividing' Range. In addition to- that is the intake of water into places like the limestone formations in the Great Australian Desert. Just as engineers- have shown that two-fifths of the rain which, is- precipitated on. the sandbed areas is trapped, so a tremendous quantity of. the rain which falls on these limestone areas throughout Australia, admittedly- at infrequent periods, but floods do occur there, is trapped and retained. in enormous underground lakes. No other country has so much underground wateras Australia- probably has-. No company has approached me to support the. amendment, submitted by the; honorable mem: bar for Gippsland, and I am not associated with any organization, interested in artesian boring. However; I have' some knowledge- of the methods which the company that: the honorable member for Gippsland mentioned, proposes:' to use. </para>
                <para>  Thisorganization operates- the Raineysys- tem of boring in. Australia for the Rainey Corporation of the United States of America. The method is to- sink a shaft, and then put out radial horizontal drills in a star- shape to trap the wholeof the waters in the beds' in the area, and raise a much larger quantity of water than can be obtained by putting down a vertical shaft. Therefore; I suggest to the Treasurer that, whilst' oil and water-will not mix; an excellent case has been adduced for reexamining the amendment. Any company which proposes to prospect for water in the barren areas of central Australia deserves every possible encouragement. </para>

                    <para>. - Proposed new. section 160k relates- to the ascertainment' of Australian tax: on dividends-.. This: provision enables- honorable members to emphasize the necessity for, a. simplification of income tax assessment's. This; proposed new -section contains no fewer than 27 provisions which set out: the- method to be applied for1 the ascertainment; of Australian tax on dividends". The widespread demand for. a further simplification of assessments may well be understood, when we consider the complexity of this- proposed new section. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> would grasp the opportunity to simplify assessments if he considered that the general community would obtain some relief from it. The task is one of considerable magnitude. By addressing questions to the Treasurer; we have ascertained' that assessments: for business', and even private individuals; have been delayed for. two or three years. A few days ago, the Treasurer told me that the reason for the delay was the shortage- of staff" -in the Taxation Department. I am rather interested in that, because I' have been informed: that- &amp;: departmental' committee was' appointed recently to. investigate 'the advisability iof  reducing -the number ofreturns submitted to the department, with particular reference to . the elimination, if possible; of returns -Jrcm persons in the lower income . groups. As 'the result . of those investigations, a recommendation was made to "the effect '.that no -returns should be required from, first, . married persons 'with incomes less -than£ 300 a year, -and secondly, . single persons receiving less than £150 a year. If something of the land could be . adopted, I am sure that . it . would have beneficial . results, f understand that the officers who made the investigation considered that if their proposals were adopted a saving of at least 1:5 per cent, could be made in staff forthwith, and that, -when the system was in full operation, the saving would be as much . as -25 per -cent. The recommendation was -not approved for the Teason, I am . inf ormed, that it would mean a substantial -.retrenchment of . staff in the Taxation ^Department, . which the 'Government would not contemplate. That appears 'to : me to be quite contrary to the opinion expressed in a 'reply given -to me by the Treasurer recently to the effect that there was not 'Sufficient staff available in the Taxation Department to do all the work required. </para>

Department, because it -would appear that some of the officers -do not clearly understand the provisions of the -act. 'Very many taxpayers withhold from lodging complaints in respect of their assessments because they find it so difficult to understand the details of the matters involved. This is not surprising . seeing that some of the taxation officers, themselves are also in doubt as to the real import of the law. If people who . consider that they have been over-assessed do not apply for refunds they can be sure -that -no '.refunds will be made in their cases, because errors in the department . are not likely to be discovered unless, by some means, the particular . assessments come to the notice of high-rrankiiig officials. I consider it necessary to direct attention to the '.need to simplify the returns. If a recommendation -such as that ito 'which I referred earlier has {been made, I -should like to know . why it -was mo.t adopted, particularly as ft jam unformed that Ithe result would -be an : immediate saving -of 15 iper cent, . and : an ultimate . savingof -25 ?per  cent, in staff. The fact that such a recommendation could be made seems to indicate that the department is overstaffed and not understaffed. At any rate, it is quite obvious that if the taxation forms w ere simplified the staff could 'be reduced. </para>

It is highly desirable that everything possible should be done to encourage first-class musicians and artists to visit Australia so that our people may obtain some entertainment apart from films, which, at times, can be very boring. Information of the kind T am seeking would be invaluable in helping artists to make up their mind whether it would be worth while to visit Australia or not. </para>

The amendments, proposed in the clause are intended to bring our taxing legislation into conformity, in certain respects, with the terms of that agreement.

I do not pretend that either Government considers the agreement' to be perfect, for the subject is extremely complex ; but an understanding has been reached and, so far as is necessary, the terms of the agreement are being incorporated in our Income Tax Assessment Act by means of the provisions contained in this clause. . The agreement' must be described as a compromise, but 1 have reason to believe that it is regarded as affording relief to financiers in the United Kingdom who propose to invest in industries in this country. </para>

A tentative approach was made through the .legation on behalf of certain American business interests. It may be that, later on, the subject will be taken up on a governmental basis. A somewhat similar agreement may possibly then be made with, the United States. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Nash, Finance Minister of the Government of New Zealand, was in Australia, not long ago, he discussed with me the possibility of making an agreement on the subject with the Government of New Zealand.

There would be much simpler issues in an arrangement between New Zealand and ourselves, but I believe that there would be great difficulties in many respects in an agreement with the United States of America. As Australia is a young nation, and it is considered that many American industries will be establishing subsidiaries here, we shall certainly give favorable consideration to  the  making of an agreement with the United States of America. The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> knows from  experience that the matter of double taxation has proved very difficult. I am not attempting to blame anybody for not having reached an agreement upon it, because of the great difficulty of making one even when taxation in other countries was not so heavy as it is now. I rose merely to make it clear that the clause has no relation to some of the other matters that have been raised, but is designed entirely' to enable the agreement to operate in relation to the principal act. </para>

                    <para>.- I seek a little further clarification of the fla use. It is headed "Relief from double taxation ", and contains many proposed new sections. According to my reading, it will ultimately, if not immediately oh the passage of the bill, relieve companies, if not, individuals, of double tax. Insofar as it, does that, there is wisdom in 'the proposal. Encouragement will be . given to British industries to commence operations in Australia, because they will not be taxed in two places. I should like to be clear in that regard, as well as in regard to the effect on the individual, because there is a good deal of point in the matter that has been raised by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull),</inline> who has asked for an explanation of the position of artists. We know that to-day Australia does not get its fair quota: of artists and members of the legitimate stage. Australians find that if they. wish to follow a stage career they have to go -abroad, and it is quite unfair that they should be required to pay income tax in two countries. This anomalous position has arisen because that is the case. A Hollywood film star receives a colossal income. </para>

I believe that Sinatra has an income greater than that of the  President  of the United States of America, and so have Laurel and Hardy, the reason being that, the making of films is concentrated in a few centres, and they are circulated throughout the world, paying no more than a nominal rate of duty when they enter a country. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause deals with the salary or wages paid in respect of any piece-work performed by an employee, or any services rendered under a contract which is wholly or substantially for the labour of the employee. It is rather tricky from the point of view of the employer. This is another excellent illustration of the desire of the Government that every- taxpayer snail become' a&gt; tax collector for the Commonwealth Treasury. It is- not the. function of any man: who.  lets  a contract! for. a. lump-- sum, to police, payment of faxes* that' are. due to the. Government: Furthermore, the statement that it-  is  " substantially for the labour of the employee " automatically admits- that?, a certain* amount may not be for wages but maybe, in respect' of materials supplied. It would not be for the employee in that case to. say whether the man concerned was even making fair wages. When, a man undertakes to do certain work on contract,, he runs risks,  r  have had1 some experience in that respect. The employer,, or the man who arranges for" the contract price, should not be obliged t'o make tax deductions and supply wage stamps in connexion with piece-work, and especially contracts. That is asking too much. Tlie compilation of tax sheets, and' the rendering of them at the; end' of each year; require the use of a' rather' complicated piece of clerical machinery. Many persons find that? they have- much clerical work to- do apart from their normal' f arming and Business operations. We' are reaching- the stage- at which some check ought" to&lt; be placed on the extent- to- which private persons should' be asked to do this sort of work, without payment, for the- Commonwealth Treasury. The- filling in of forms' of various sorts- is becoming almost a1 disease in Australia-. During the war; the people were prepared: to put up' with that- sort of thing, and- to accept itf as* a- burden' that was inseparable from the prosecution' of the war: With the cessation- of fighting' more' than two years behind us, many persons consider that quite a few of the restrictions. should be lifted, and that the placing, of responsibility for this sort, of thing on the average' taxpayer should cease. I know that it is useless to* ask the Treasurer to ag&lt;ree to an amendment, Because' his Bills, although' they do not- become law until they pass, the- Parliament  and  receive the royal assent, are; like- the' laws* of the Medes- and Persians; not to be called' in question iki any shape- or form-.. I should like the' right honorable gentleman to- explain why it is necessary; under,- present conditions;. tO' make- every employer, or every, person who lets a- contract  practi- cally  a. policing authority for the Commonwealth.

Australian Country party <inline font-style="italic">Q/Lr.</inline> Fadden),, or while he was a Minister ; because,, as tax rates crept" up, particularly in relation to individual's, it .was considered' that many persons would experience considerable difficulty in meeting their income tax assessments if they were presented at the end of the year.,, and' that it was far more satisfactory to wage and' salary earners to have, deductions- made from their incomes, periodically. The deductions, may not be the precise amount for which they are liable - they may be more or less - but ali least the taxpayers  are  relieved of the difficulty of discharging a big liability at' the end' of the-, year. I may say  in  passings tha* some employers, have spoken- to me about the- need, for.' greater accuracy in the calculation of the deductions that should be made., Some employees find: at the. end of the year that, for various reasons;, the deductions have not been sufficient, to meet the amount' of the assessment,, whilst in other instances the  total  deductions exceed' the assessment and refunds have to be made.-. The: United Kingdom has adopted a- system under  which  the employer becomes the: assessor from month) to month.  That  places* a tremendous amount of- work  upon  him. In conversation with the representatives! of one&gt; employer/ not! long; ago,- 1! pointed- out, that some.' of the difficulty might be: overcome  if  ai measure- could be introduced providing, that- the employer should' be the  assesson,  something  along the lines of  the- , system, in- the  United  Kingdom-. One of the reasons; for, our not having attempted: to- adopt such a proposal was that in, war-time much man-power would' have? .been, needed, and- an unjust  burden  would have.' been, placed om the employer: The  provision  in  the billwas made . necessary by the; fact thalv under1 the instalment', plan, we have called' npoir farmers- and' othersi engaging labour' to- make . tax- deductions from&gt; the pajyanents'tbey have made, particularly, in connexion with piece-work.. I understand that, the matter- waa brought: to a head because, . an-, employee of a. gentleman named Broome bad' been engaged, in. the picking--of onions a&gt;t piece-woiib xates. A dispute' arose,, because . it was claimedt that in the circumstances the 'employer, should liothave'toKJoll'ect the tax- instalments. The case went to the High- 'Count of Australia. I believe that it is- known, as- <inline font-style="italic">JUroome</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">QfocriQiweth,</inline> Ghenoweth. being the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, in- "Victoria. The court ruled that the employee received a salary or wage because he was employed  at  piece-work rates, but that his employment did' not have any relation to a period of time. I believe that all' honorable members agreed that tax deductions should be made from . wages or salaries wherever that was possible. That general principle having been agreed to, there cannot very  well  be an avoidance of its a pplication to cases such as this. </para>

                        <para>- The clause- definitely mentions the word " contract ".. It. is well! that we should stack to the language of the bill; because it is on that, language- . that, any poor devil who goes' before . the; -court will be condemned,. not on what we- think it ought to be:. The . clause reads; "in respect of any services rendered under a-, -contract which is- wholly  or  -substantially for the labour- of the employee ". A man may take a -contract for, fencing, or clearing land, or: sinking, wells, or making dams. Whale doing- 'Mie work he- may be separated by a. great: 'distance from his. employer, who&gt; will, not know hy just how many weeks, he should divide- the contract price in&gt; order- te arrive at : » figure from which to make weekly tax deductions. The Treasurer- said that; in some instances, it might turn out that too much would be deducted. That is one of the  GOmiplaintB-  1 have against the income tax administration. Many people have complained to me that they are unable to get . squared up in regard1 to their annual assessments! It may be that at the end of the year, they have a credit with the department, but they are unable to get, the money refunded. If a man owes something to the Taxation Department, and does- not pay on the due date, he is Sable tar certain penalties. In the same way, if the- department owes a taxpayer money, and refuses to refund the amount within 30 days, it should be subject to the same penalties. There appears to-be one law for the. poor devil who pays the tax, and another for the Taxation. Department,, from the decisions- of which there is no appeal. It often happens that the taxpayer,, to whom the department owes money, is -working on an overdraft on which he must pay interest from day to d:ay; but no amount of writing or interviewing oan get from the department the money it owes- him. A man might as well go to Moscow and try to get an audience with; " Joe " Stalin, as to get an interview with any of the chief officials of the Taxation  Department,,  unless he is:  a  member, of Parliament, and. even then he will, have to spend five minutes explaining who he is. </para>

                <para>Some time ago,. I asked a question on notice in- an endeavour to. find out. in how many instances money was&gt; held by the </para>
                <para>Treasury on behalf of taxpayers, but the Lord only knows when I shall get a reply. When I spoke last year about the delay in issuing assessments, I was told by the Treasurer to supply a list of those who had not received an assessment for three years. I am not going to do it, because t hat is a matter for the taxation authorities. However, I know of cases in which no assessment was issued for two years, and then it was eventually found that <inline font-style="italic">£100 had to</inline> be knocked off the assessment. I know wage-earners who have not had a settlement with the department for two years, although they have written asking for a refund of the money due to them. Of course, the department handles over £100,000,000 a year, and -officials may believe that it is a small matter that a " fiver " or a " tenner " should be owing to this taxpayer or that. Those are small amounts in the total -accounts of the department, but to the poor fellows to whom the money is owed they may mean a good deal. Therefore, it is high time the department was forced to make prompt settlement in cases where it owes money to taxpayers. It cannot claim ignorance of the fact that the "money is owing because it sends out notices to taxpayers stating the position. The taxpayer is just as much entitled to the money due to him at the end of 30 days as the department is entitled to the money clue to it, but in this instance what is sauce for the goose does not appear to be sauce for the gander. </para>

It seems to be the desire of some to blackguard these officials.

They know that these officials are honest, and are doing a difficult job in a very capable way. It must be remembered that the number of taxpayers has increased very greatly. The honorable member for Barker seems to think that taxation officials take a fiendish delight in obstructing and frustrating people, and withholding money to which they are entitled. He said that if the taxpayer did not pay up by a certain date he was subject to a penalty. 1 should like him to cite one instance in which a man who had a reasonable case for an extension of time has. been refused time to pay. </para>

                        <para>- It is that point which requires clarification. At the present time, a great amount of tax is uncollected. In the main, it is due from business people and property owners whose properties normally produce revenue. However, because' of bad seasons, the owners were not able to meet their taxation commitments in a particular year. The general run of taxpayers who earn wages or salary are not in that position, because the tax is deducted periodically from their earnings. Even though there may be good reason . why the taxpayer cannot meet his commitment on the due date, the Taxation Commissioner may demand the payment of an additional  6  per cent, on the outstanding amount. As the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> pointed out, the department does not pay interest on the money which it holds on behalf of a taxpayer. When a taxpayer is required to pay interest on money due to the department, it represents a heavy burden if he is working on an overdraft. I remember bringing to the notice of the Treasurer, two or three years ago, the case of a proprietary company, of which the principal had an income of about  £15,000  from the company. </para>

His  income was drawn from his interest in the business, but for the year under discussion the tax, plus the penalties, amounted to more than the business earned. That, admittedly, is an extreme case, but it shows what can happen. I hope that the Treasurer will view sympathetically the plight of those who, year in and year out, provide revenue for the Government, but who, in a lean year, arc unable to meet their commitments. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that the purpose of this amending clause is to close a gap which was revealed by a' judgment of the High Court in December of last year. In the case in question an employer was paying a man a certain price per bag to pick onions.- Under the act, the employer could not be compelled to deduct tax nl the source, because the contract did not mention any time, but merely, the rate to be paid per bag. That gap has now been closed by this amending clause, and the deductions must now be made whether the employee be engaged under contract or the piece-work system. As persons of this class will essentially be casual workers the rate of deduction, if they are working for, say, a fortnight, will be their rate of earning throughout the whole year. Consequently, their deductions are disproportionately heavy. They may not earn anything like the casual rate . throughout the whole year. People engaged in casual employment need their money very badly. If the casual work is very remunerative they find themselves subjected to heavy deductions, much of which will be handed back at the end of the year. I ask the Treasurer to issue an administrative order stating that where it is clear that a man is engaged on casual work the rate of deduction may be adjusted to meet his expected annual income. </para>

What will be the position, say, of drovers who sign contracts to drive stock from one place to another and who, in turn, employ one, two, or more men to assist them ? In such cases, is the owner of stock or the contractor regarded as the employer of the casual men and who would be responsible for making deductions from their wages? The same position applies generally to contract shearers. Is the owner of the sheep responsible for the deductions to be made from the wages of all the men engaged by the' contract shearer? Another type of contract over which difficulty may arise is that in which the owner of a threshing plant contracts to thresh the crops of farmers, going from one place to another as the work cuts out. Such a contractor may employ casual labour to assist him in his work. Who is responsible for the deductions, the farmer or the owner of the threshing plant who engages such casual labour? </para>

                    <para>.- Perhaps, of all people my constituents are most concerned in this matter. The dried fruits industry established at Mildura, Redcliffs, Merbein, Nyah and Woorinen employs large number of seasonal workers who come from Melbourne, and other parts of the country by special train or by any other means of transport at their disposal. Last season there was great misunderstanding in the industry becausegrowers did not know whether or not they  had to make tax deductions from the wages of these workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> R. Messenger representing the growers . went to Melbourne and secured from the Commissioner of Taxation a temporary ruling on the point. That it was verytemporary is apparent by the clause in this bill on which I am speaking, for under this amending provision fruit-growers and others employing seasonal workers in large or small numbers will be compelled to collect the whole of the appropriate deductions from their employees,notwithstanding the length of engagement, or conditions of employment. The men resent the deductions being made in many instances, for as many depend on the harvest time for their chief income, their total yearly income may not be subject to tax. I protest strongly against the dried fruits-grower being called upon to act astax collector when his full time is required in the management of his block, and when his management is a vital necessity to thereapingof the full fruits of his year's labour. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like some information relative to the tax imposed -on living allowances paid to ex-servicemen undergoing training courses under the post-war reconstruction training scheme. As honorable members are aware, a singletraineereceives £3 5s. a week, . and there are various additional payments for married men and those withdependants. Payments of living allowances by the department are at presentsubject to deductions for income tax,notwithstandinga ruling given.some time ago by theCommissioner of Taxation that such allowances constituted neither wage nor salary and because of that there was no power to tax them. InWestern Australia I saw an instruction passed through the department to the effect that deductions in respect of these allowances, which were neither salary nor wages, were to be exacted until such time as the ex-service- men complained, whereupon the deductions were to cease immediately pending an alteration of the law to give to the department power under the Income Tax Assessment Act to levy : such deductions. When I questioned the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> on this point the right honorable gentleman indicated that the Income Tax Assessment Act already gave the department power to do so. For the benefit of all ex-servicemen undergoing training Ishould like the right honorable gentleman to indicate whether there is power in the act enabling the department to make these deductions. </para>

                <para>Mr.CHIFLEY (Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.10]. Honorable members have raised a number of questions relating to the collection of income tax from salaries andwages. The main principle is that the employer of the labour shall be responsible -for the collection of the tax. The honorable member for Fremantle (Mr.Beazley) instanced the case of men employed on seasonal labour at high rates of remuneration for short periods and who at the end of the year may receive a total income below the taxable amount. I do not know that there are very manypeople so circumstanced. However, the Commissioner of Taxation -and the  Deputy  Commissioners havepowertomake adjustments to meet cases of that kind. </para>
                <para>The points raised by other honorable members are covered by "the main principle' that the employer of the labour is responsiblefor the collection of the tax. Since 1942, employers of labour with but few exceptions have, continued to make the deductions from the salaries and wages of their employees. It was only because some dispute arose, that a ruling was given by the High Court which rendered necessary the insertion in the bill of this amending clause. I am aware that the collection of the tax imposes additional strain on the employers, but the continuance of that practice is necessary for the working of the pay-as-you-earn system. I am surprised to learn that in some areas employers have refused to collect the tax from casual workers. In ray own electorate farmers employing casual labour have been making these deductions ever since the . -system was instituted. If em-ployers decline to make these deductions that system would quickly break down. I shall askthe Commissioner of Taxation to prepare a statement covering 'the points raised by honorable members during thedebate on this 'clause. </para>

                    <para>.- Ever since the. experts succeeded in making income lax assessment a science, the general public has found thai it has been blinded by science, and the more amendments that have been made the more scientific it heroines and the more frustrated and helpliw. become the members of the general community. Consequently, in their frustration they lurried to experts for help. Sonic of the bright and more enterprising officials in the Taxation Department found that whereas they were en ruing hundreds of pounds a year in the department .  they could earn thousands outside by going to the help of taxpayers. They formed a new profession. They became what are called "tax agents ". The tax agents are. now seen in their proper perspective. The department introduced registration of tax agents. Thetax agent was supposed to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer. That was his duty and what he was paid for. When the tax agent became registered there entered into the matter a now factor, beca use the tax agent: found that he had conflicting interests.  His  job was not only to serve his clients - that was what, he was paid for and what he was supposed to do - but also satisfy the Taxation Department. If he fought too hard for his client, the taxpayer, he necessarily came into conflict with the department. Fortunately, most agents regarded it as their duty to attend to the interests of their clients, the taxpayers. As the result some of them had their registration wiped out by the Tax Agents' Board. It may be said that they were properly deregistered. I should expect that answer to be given in the ordinary course of debate. But the tax agents who were deregistered appealed to the court, and they appealed successfully. That was the position until this further advance in the science of taxation assessment was produced. It now seems that the board proposes to meet the position in another way. Competent agents apply to the board for registration. They are registered. They fight for their clients. They come into conflict with the Taxation Department, and they are deregistered. Against, that injustice they appeal and the court upholds their appeal. Is the proposed amendment of the principal act. in clause 32 intended to defeat the court's decision? Is it designed, as other parts of the bill are designed, to get. around the decision of the court and frustrate the court? If so. the committee should be very chary about overruling the rights of the individual by making tax agents register every year. We do not do that to doctors, architects, dentists or any other professional men. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish the honorable member would follow what I say. Time does not permit me and it is too tiresome to go into every detail. I said that the Taxation Department was losing some of its ablest and enterprising officials, including its legal men, because they find the remuneration outside is better than in the department. Those officers are trained and skilled. They have been approved by the board. It had registered them. They are qualified and their qualifications are attested. They have higher qualifications than some of their juniors, who now have their jobs. Yet they are disqualified. To defeat the court so that it shall never again be able to do terrible things to the department it says, " We will just refuse to register them". When it does that it does a grave injustice. This is a bad thing. It takes away the rights of individuals. By making tax agents register every year the board will have them constantly under its power. Why, the autocratic British Medical Association cannot deregister its members unless they are guilty of infamous conduct! If doctors, lawyers, dentists, optometrists and other professional men had to come up every year for re-registration what tremendous power would be given to the little coteries in control for the time being. That is a power that I submit we would never grant to an autocracy. Why should we allow it to be in the hands of the Tax Agents' Board ? </para>

                        <para>- This amendment does Luke away the appeal, because the board will not re-register some of them. If a man isregistered as a tax agent and the registration is taken away.from him, he has the right of appeal to the court; but, with annual registration, the right of appeal is taken away.It is a roundabout way of destroying the jurisdiction of the court. It is wrong if men of the highest repute, who become tax agents, and put up a fight for the people who engage them, can be crucified by the board for having done what: they consider to be their duty. If an agent has to work under the everpresent fear that he will not bo re- registered, the profession may as well be abandoned, because he will not even be able to pretend to be the agent of- his client. </para>

                        <para>- Not, in the respect that I refer to - annual renewal of registration. The agent will bc no longer his client's agent, but the agent of the Taxation Department. The Taxation Department will be his master, and will always have the powerto refuse him registration. What I have said should be sufficient to convince the committee; but, finally,I submit that if a tax agent gets at crosspurposes with the board, or the Taxation Department, if he fights too strenuously and conscientiously for his client, who is the taxpayer, he will lose his livelihood, and that is the worst, threat one can hold over the head of any person. </para>

                    <para>.- The story told by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> would conveythe impression that; the Tax Agents' Boards consisted of officers of the Taxation Department. That is entirely incorrect. He implied that if a tax agent offended the department, the. agent, would not be reregistered. I can best answer that statement by citing the names of the members of the Tax Agents Board in New South Wales. The  chairman  is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams.</inline> M.L.A., a member of the State Parliament, and a public accountant, whilst the other two members are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> H. Swift, the State Auditor-General, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weir,</inline> theUnder-secretary to the State Treasury. None of these gentlemen is associated with the Taxation Department. The Tax Agents' Boards in other States are substantially similar.It is apparent, therefore, that the Taxation Department has notmuch to do with determining whether tax agents should be registered or deregistered. The fact is that for a long lime it has been recognized that throughout Australia many people, by posing as tax experts, have been really deceiving the taxpayers. It is time that persons who claim to be taxation experts should be obliged to prove their qualifications. The provision with respect to annual review of registration is made in order that the boards may exercise a more effective control over tax agents. That provision is a protection to the taxpayers, as is also the creation of the boards. That is why similar boards had been in operation in some States for some time, prior to uniform income tax. </para>

Persons are not allowed to run a motor car unless they renew registration annually. In fact, one cannot own a dog without renewing the registration annually.I simply rose to indicate that the Tax Agents' Board in New South Wales, in which State the electorate of the honorable member for Reid is situated, does not include any officer of the Taxation Department. I regard it as a reasonable and impartial body. </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst on the surface the explanation given by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> might appear to be satisfactory, he left ouite a number of matters unexplained. The legislative provision by the Commonwealth for the registration of tax agents was introduced inJuly.  1943.  That is three years ago. It was then provided that registration should continue indefinitely until such time as the tax agent was found guilty of misconduct, or so-nic of l.it-r -offence,, or was disqualified  ihi  the ground of bankruptcy or on other specified grounds. T.'sually, the, registration of an agent continues indefinitely. The Treasurer has slated that the object of annual re-registration is to enable, a check to bo made on agents: and he intimated that . an agent might be refused renewal of registration because of unsatisfactory conduct. That is the only reason that has been given for the annual renewal of registration of agents. fn view of the fact that the Treasurer has slated that the Tux Agents' Board is completely independent of the. Taxation Department, it would be interesting to know who is to make the objection to the renewal of an agent's registration. Doe&gt; the Taxation Department submit the objection, or do clients of a particular agent submit iff 1 rather think that a. client's remedy is to refuse to do any more business with a particular agent., just as a client withdraws his business from an unsatisfactory solicitor. Therefore, it would appear that the only objection which can be submitted to the board against re-registration of a tax agent must come from the department itself. Quite a number of applications for registration from persons in my 'electorate, who prepared income tax returns prior to the operation of this provision, were refused because the department did not consider that the applicants possessed the necessary experience and qualifications. Therefore, the most opportune time for the department to exercise its judgment, as to the qualifications of an applicant is when the original application for registration is submitted. I shall require more than the Treasurer's statement to convince me thai; once registration is granted it is really necessary to oblige the ageni to apply for renewal of registration annually, because the only authority in a position to object to re-registration is the Commissioner of Taxation. The Commissioner is in much the same position in relation to the board as the police authorities stand in relation to the Licensing Court. When an hotel-keeper applies for a renewal of a licence from time to time, usually objection against the application does not come from a member of the public as a rule, but from the Police Department. I agree with the honorable member for Keid <inline font-weight="bold">(.Mr. Lang)</inline> I hat one can apply the same reasoning to the registration of solicitors, doctors, ilcii tints or other professional men. A tax agent is not compelled to pass an examination, but must, satisfy the Taxation Department of his fitness to prepare, taxation returns. Having satisfied the taxation authority with respect, to those requirement", 1 submit that, except wheir an agent is guilty of some offence which ill-serves disqualification, his registration should continue without further challenge. This is a further imposition by luireaciacy upon the community. Tax agents will be compelled to submit themselves to officialdom year after year in erder to be accorded what should belong lo them us a matter of right. </para>

                    <para>. -  This proposal may contain a good deal of merit, but T fail to understand why chartered accountants, most of whom submit' returns for taxpayers because they have the necessary knowledge to compile the required information, should be required to apply annually for registration. The compilation of tax returns is often the principal part of their business, yet under this bill, every year, they must join, the form-filling class. Does the Government propose to require lawyers, due-tors and dentists to re-register every year? Certainly not! Surely one registration should suffice. No honorable member desires to see bogus tax agents establish themselves, or people who defraud the Taxation Department, but riirely the Government should dismiss from its mind the idea that it must conr stantly legislate for a nation of " crooks '.'. Chartered accountants arc doing this work. The average sitizen . is not able to fill in his income tax return. How many honorable members fill in their own. tax forms? </para>

When Australia required a total war effort, all the activities of the people had to be related to those of the government, and . yet some ridiculous forms which existed during the war, still endure. If a person, required a tyre for his motor vehicle, he is obliged to fill in a form declaring that in effect his neighbour does not possess a horse and jinker that he can use, state who is his doctor and give similar irrelevant information.. The Government should not attempt to restrict the activities of tax agents in this way. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not agree with, the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> to any substantial degree on. this matter, because I am mindfulof the fact that people in many callings such as an auctioneer, butcher, wheat-grower and dairy-farmer, are obliged to register every year. A person must take out a licence for his dog or bull. My list of licences is piling up. I have not any particular objection to this provision which requires that tax agents shall register annually. For various reasons, these agents shall be subjected to some surveillance. A few years ago, I had a disagreement with the Taxation Department regarding several people in. different parts of Australia.  In  one instance, I discovered that a well-known firm of tax agents had been compiling returns for one of my constituents for a number of years. The agents had accepted payment, from him for their services; but, without informing him of what they were doing, they attached a certificate to his returns stating that they did not, guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in them. If a lawyer acted in a similar manner towards one of his clients, he would quickly be summoned before the law society. That firm of tax agents was selling its client and his interests behind his back. Tax agents should have a certain code of morality. If an agent is to be licensed and permitted to charge a fee for making out a return for a client, his services should be at the disposal of the man who employs him. </para>

                        <para>- A. copy of the certificate was not, attached to the copy of the return. If honorable members like to take up the case of the tax agents. T do not mind, but I know where I stand in this matter. The first person that the agent, should tell that he is dissatisfied with a return is the taxpayer who employs him. If he fails to do that, he should be " rail-roaded " out of his job. Therefore, when the Treasurer insists that tax agents shall register annually, I contend that, on a  few  matters which have come to my personal knowledge, some of. the agents should not be re-registered, but de-registered. </para>

                    <para>.- I find it difficult to understand why some honorable members opposite object to this proposal. The sole purpose is to require a tax agent to inform the board in writing every year that he desires to continue as an agent. The board will obtain from him all particulars regarding himself and any other information that it requires. A tax agent holds an important position in the community. He has a <inline font-style="italic">quasi-professional</inline> position - a confidential position - and he is entrusted with all the business secrets of his clients. Consequently, tax agents must be reputable persons whom the public can trust. As the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> stated, this provision is designed for the protection of taxpayers. Therefore, I am astonished that honorable members opposite should quarrel among themselves about this matter, and object to a sensible proposal. The Board that has been referred to by the Treasurer has no connexion whatever with the Taxation Department. It is an independent board of reputable people who have control over tax agents. The Government is to be commended for introducing this simple amendment providing for an up-to-date register of these individuals who are in a position to collect substantial fees from clients for the handling of their confidential business. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot see any great abjection to a register of tax agents. Everybody knows that the Government will squeeze out of the community the last oz. of tax. If taxagents have escaped this imposition in the past they have been lucky. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> cited quite a number of occupations in. which people have to register from year to year. Even the simple dairyman who carries on an industry of the greatest value to this country is called on to register each year, although I could never quite understand the necessity for this. Once a property has been examined, there should be no need to make it a yearly event; but year after year officials inspect dairy farms to see that dairies are far enough away from milking sheds and so on. That costs a lot, of money. I cannot, see anything wrong in insisting upon a register of tax agents. Even auctioneers have to register every year. This provision may do something towards keeping the occupation as clean as possible, and I am quite sure that the Australian Country party is not opposing it for that, reason. The honorable member for Barkerhas claimed that in some cases tax agents have been dishonest in forwarding returns which they have not verified on behalf of their clients. I. point out, however, that on taxation return forms is a question asking whether the agent certifies as to the correctness of the figures that have been entered on the form. The tax agent replies in the negative, stating that the figures have been supplied to him by his client. I have no doubt that that was done in the case to which the honorable member for Barker referred. The client himself would have received a. copy of the return sent in by the agent. If he did not insist upon that, he must be a curious type of taxpayer. I cannot sec anything discreditable to the tax agent in regard to that matter, because the form prescribes that he must make that declaration and that the taxpayer himself must be satisfied with the information that he signs. </para>

                        <para>-I do not speak in terms asstrung as that.I have sometimes been in the same position as the honorable member but I have not said so. What I have, to say now on the matter is not uttered in any party spirit, but in the interests of truth. Surely no agent, whether he be an accountant or a tax agent, or anybody else, can be expected to give an undertaking with respect to thu information that a client submits to him. How can an agent undertake to say that the details of his client's business arc correct? How can an agent verify the facts that are submitted to him ? He can only do that, to the degree permitted by the documents, vouchers, receipts, &amp;c, submitted to him by his client. He could not go beyond that. He is only an agent, and. the taxation return itself contains a specific clause which makes that very clear. The honorable member for Barker suggested that an agent should implicate himself by guaranteeing the information submitted to him by his client. </para>

Obviously, no man who prepares a return on behalf of a taxpayer can guarantee the correctness of the information that his client supplies. A solicitor, tax agent, or any other of the one hundred and one kinds of agents with which we are all familiar in the business world today, may prepare a return and put it before his client. The client has to satisfy himself that the return is correct, and has to sign it. It docs not go beyond that, and. while I am a. member of this chamber I shall not be a party to any attack, direct or indirect, on. any person who acts as an agent for someone else, by suggesting that in preparing a document he necessarily makes himself responsible tor the truth of its contents. </para>

                        <para>- The divergence of opinion amongst members of the Opposition on this clause is very interesting. The Opposition takes great exception to the proposal that agents shall be required to register each year. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> and the honorable member for Parramatta and. some of his colleagues claim that professional men, such as doctors, dentists, chemists and architects, do not have to do likewise. However, such men. have to carry out long years of study at universities in order to qualify for their degrees, whereas tax agents can obtain registration without undergoing training of a similar character. Many tax agents have left employment in the Taxation Department, and taxation agencies in order to engage in that profession. I agree with the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> that some of them did so for the sole reason that, al though they had reached high positions iu the department, they were not earning nearly as much in salaries as they now earn as tax agents. Anyman who has served in the Taxation Department can resign and set himself up as a tax agent, whatever his qualifications may he. I object to the fact that such men do not have to pass examinations in order to start in business. I. sincerely hope that, in the near future, any person who desires to become registered as a tax agent will be required to pass an examination set bv the Public Service Board. Any person who wishes to practise as a tax agent should be qualified to do so, and there is no reason why heshould not be required to register each year, as certain other professional men are required to do. . </para>

                    <para>. -Usually.I am  able to make myself understood in this committee, but apparentlyI have not been able to do so to-n ight. The case, which I stated simply, is this : If a man acting as a tax agent accepts a taxpayer's money for preparing tax ret urn, and if he. has any misgivings regarding that return, his duty is to inform the taxpayer of the fact first, not, to submit the return to the Taxation De par tment together with private information which he has not, given to his client. None of my colleagues in Opposition can justify a registered tax agent conveying to. the department information about a taxpayer's affairs, together with his opinions about them, which he has not conveyed to the taxpayer. Such an agentis recreant to thu trust reposed in him by' his client. He is not paid by the Taxation. Department. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> was most eloquent ' in his ability to misunderstand me. If he, as a barrister, went to a party opposing one of his clients and said, " Look, J. will give you some information, about my bloke that you can use, but I will not let him know that I have done so ", I have a strong suspicion that any law society, with the possible exception of the one in Sydney, would kick him out.I have had experience of dealings, with legal men in Sydney, What I have said would hold good,. 1 believe, in any law society outside of that city. If a barrister or solicitor undertakes a case, he does not convey to his client's opponent information that he has not given to his client. In fact, he is not supposed to convey anything to the opposing party. He supplies his services for a fee to the man whose case he undertakes to fight. A tax agent is in much the same position as a. solicitor or barrister. He does certain work for a "taxpayer and accepts a fee for doing so. The taxpayer places confidence in him. and, in my opinion, the agent should not convey any information to the Taxation Department which he has not conveyed first to his client. Ifhe does so, he is recreant to the trust reposed in him and should not be allowed to continue to act as a tax agent. </para>

                    <para>.Much of this discussion has nothing to do with the case. Under the existing law, any tax agent's licence can be cancelled. The proposal in the clause now before the committee merely provides that: agents shall register every year. The point at issue is whether this clause should be agreed to or not. I remind the honorable member. for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> that a bad agent can be deregistered under the provisions of the existing law. I consider that the army of accountants, lawyers, and others who act as tax agents, should not be required to join the already overburdened ranks of government form-fillers. This clause should be considered in conjunction with the succeeding clause. If honorable members read both of them, they will realize that nobody may render a tax return for a fee unless he is a registered tax agent. Therefore, probably every legal firm in Australia will be required to register as a tax agent. </para>

                    regret that so much debate has occurred over such a simple matter. The present law provides that the registration of an agent shall continue indefinitely until cancelled by a board for one of a number of specified reasons, such as death, bankruptcy, and misconduct. Therefore, the board now has the power .to control all registered agents. If there be any misconduct on the part of an agent, his registration can be cancelled. If an injustice should be done, the deregistered agent may apply to a court and have justice done and may have his registrant ti on restored. That has been done. A registration has been cancelled, there has been a successful appeal to the court, and
                </para>
                <para>I  ho registration has been restored. The hoard now seeks to circumvent the court, by doing away with the right of appeal and compelling agents to register annually. </para>

                        <para>- An honorable member has said that tax agents have the right of appeal. According to my reading, they have not. The right of appeal lies to the County Court, the Supreme Court, or whatever may be the name of the court in any State, upon cancellation of registration. The board will be able to circumvent that, by refusing reregistration. The act does not state how the board is appointed. Those who compose it may be most reputable men. I want to know what is the justification for this amendment of the law. The explanatory note states that at present the board has certain powers, and goes on to say that it has been found in practice that the board should be given greater control. Why should it. be given greater control? It lias been decided that tax agents shall be made to register annually. With one registration, the office file is complete; but with an annual registration there will have to be a staff of officers, which will have tQ be paid - by whom? Later, there will be a demand that tax agents shall be made to pay for their annual registration, on the ground that it is only just and proper that they should pay for the upkeep of the board's staff. This is not imaginary; it has happened at other times in similar circumstances. Points will be raised, like that mentioned by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron).</inline> In the ranks of lawyers, and among all classes of agents and auctioneers, it has .happened that a miserable type of person has acted dishonestly. Should that occur, there will be a demand for the protection of the person who has been robbed or otherwise despoiled. That will lead to the establishment of a fund similar to the existing funds to cover defalcations by an auctioneer, agent or lawyer. The staff will grow, and we shall ,have a complete bureaucracy. The committee should view the matter reasonably. Is this the first step towards the establishment of :.. staff to deal with annual registrations? Will it do a very wrong thing, by circumventing the law of the land ? Will a bureaucracy be established which will Lave an appetite for power, and grow on that on which it feeds? I contend that this is the first step in that process, and that, this is the proper time to mention it. I shall not stand idly by when I see the first step being taken, without stating my views, because I will not have it said later that in. the year in which this provision was .inserted in the act I had remained silent. I enter my protest now, because 1 see that what appears to be quite an innocuous clause is a move towards the establishment of a bureaucracy, and the doing of acts of injustice. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> has been misleading the committee. He would have us believe that the right; of appeal which tax agents now 'have is being taken from them. It is not. Under the position as it. stands, the tax agent is registered. Ordinarily, he would register once, and his registration would carry  on from year to year. This amendment of the act will make it obligatory that he shall notify the board every year that he desires to continue to be registered. There is no injustice in that. A solicitor has to register every year, pay fees, and make provisionfor carrying on his practice. As I have pointed out, tax agents act in a quasi-professional capacity. They have the confidence of taxpayers, and their clients deserve protection. That is the object of this proposal. The board is entitled to have up-to-date particulars in respect of every tax agent. </para>

All that the proposed new section provides is that, in each year, the tax agent shall notify the board, in a form approved by the board, that he desires to continue to be registered, and that he shall furnish the board with the particulars that are specified in the form. The right of appeal which has existed is not to be affected. Even though a tax agent may be disqualified for the reasons set out in section 251k, he will still have the right of appeal. It is idle to argue that any injustice is being done. All that is proposed is that the board shall be placed in a position to obtain full particulars concerning any person who is carrying on the business or profession of a tax agent. To argue that the right of appeal will be affected, or that an injustice will be done, is to mislead the committee. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is not. A taxation agent has to register, and the purpose of that registration is to ensure that he is competent to practise. This provision will result in the establishment of a pretty little staff and there will probably be a fee charged for reregistration of an agent. I cannot see any reason why the agent should have to be reregistered. Then there is the case mentioned by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> in which a taxation agent was apparently sending secret information , to the department that certain taxation returns' were not true. I am not altogether satisfied with the composition of the board. There are two government officer's, one from the Sub-Treasury and the other a nominee of the chief audit officer of the State concerned. The third member is appointed by the Governor-General. If a question of assessment arises they might tend to encourage taxation agents to furnish secret information to the department, because those agents have to serve their masters. If any member of the board knew what was happening in the case mentioned by the honorable member for Barker he flagrantly violated his duty in that he did not ensure that the tax agent was deregistered. The only purpose I can see for requiring tax agents to reregister every year is to create an embyro department and to extract an annual fee from them. </para>

                <para class="block">Clause 38 sets out the assessments to which the several amendments to be made by the bill shall apply. The amendment proposed to be made by paragraph p of clause 24 is complementary to that proposed by clause 17. It was accordingly intended that both of these amendments should apply to assessments based ou income derived during the year ending the 30th June, 1947, and subsequent years. With respect to clause 17, this intention will be given effect by sub-clause 7 of clause 38. Through inadvertence, however, the complementary amendment made by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">p</inline> of clause 24 was expressed to apply to the same assessments as the other amendments included in clause 24. Thus the amendment to be made by clause 24 (p) has been incorrectly expressed to apply to assessments based on income derived during the year ending the 30th June, 1948, and subsequent years. The proposed amendments to clause 38 will ensure that the amendmentsmade by clause 17 and paragraph <inline font-style="italic">p</inline> of clause 24 shall apply to the same assessments, namely, to assessments based on income derived during the year ending the 30th June, 1947, and all subsequent years. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. I draw attention to the fact that sub-clause 5 of this clause provides that amendments effected by section 24 of the act shall apply to all assessments for the financial year beginning on the 1st July and all subsequent years. Therefore, I suggest that the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) is quite in order in offering reasons why those amendments should not apply to those assessments, and to do so by showing that the amendments made by section 24 are inappropriate. </para>

                        <para>. - A great number of the amendments ' written into the Income Tax Assessment Act are, as we have observed during the discussion on this and other bills of the kind, designed to get rid of the operation of certain decisions of the courts - to render them no longer applicable to a similar set of circumstances. [ take this opportunity to point out that this practice has done more than anything else to clutter up the income tax laws by converting them from a statement of general principle into a wilderness of single instances. In order to deal with one particular case a particular formula must be worked out. My experience, and that of most other persons who have had to consider these provisions in detail, is that every time we amend the legislation we add to the difficulties of construing the act, and of reconciling one provision with another. I do not say that by way of criticism of taxation officers. My experience of them has been very happy. I think they are a very able lot of men, and in my own State, where I have my own modest transactions with them, the  Deputy  Commissioner is, I think, an uncommonly wise man. The only complaint I have against taxation officials is one which I could perhaps make against most of us in this House - they have an easy disposition to believe in their own omniscience. "When they find that the High Court has knocked out their interpretation of a section, their immediate reaction is to amend the act, because their view of the matter must be made right, whatever the lawyers have to say about it. The result is that a long list of amendments comes along to meet that particular case. </para>

                            <para>- In some instances, yes ; but as to others I have grave doubts. The result of applying this policy so resolutely is that a complicated set of rules has been built up, and the job of interpreting the act is very difficult. In 1934-35 a royal commission was established to examine income tax law, with the result that we made a fresh departure with what is now the principal act. Since then, however, the same policy has been continued. I beg the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to lay a restraining hand on the powers that be in the Taxation Department so as to get them to consider that occasionally the taxpayer may be right, in addition to being told by the High Court that he is right; and to consider, also, that these attempts to alter the law to meet the one particular case may create confusion in twenty other cases. </para>
