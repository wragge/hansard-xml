                            - Has the Minister for Information seen a statement in the press to-day in which
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline>
                            Fell, president of the Employers
              Federation, called upon the employers to fight the Banking Bill by every means in
              their power ? Has the honorable gentleman also seen a statement in the press
              purporting to have been made by the Leader of the Liberal party in Victoria,<inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollway,</inline>that the main issue in the Victorian
              general elections will be the Banking Bill?<inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                Hollway</inline>further states that if the non-Labour parties are returned to
              office they will be " pledged with the Liberal Governments of South Australia and
              Western Australia to stand in the path of the Australian Government which threatens to
              destroy the fundamentals of our liberty ". Does the Minister know that such
              statements are likely to create disaffection among His Majesty's subjects and
              probably lead to violence in this country? Is it an attempt to resurrect the New Guard
              or the Australia First Movement? Will the Minister confer with the Minister acting for
              the Attorney-General with a view to invoking the Crimes Act against these people in
               order to maintain peace, order.and good government in this country?

                        <para>- I will do as the' honorable member suggests and consult the Minister acting
              for the Attorney-General, to see whether certain threats made by some people opposing
              the nationalization of banking plan should be investigated. The right honorable member
              for Cowper and some other honorable members like the honorable member for Moreton, who
              supports him but has not yet expressed himself in that way publicly, have talked very
              violently on this bill, but the democratic way of life will be preserved, and this
                Government can be depended upon to see that it is.</para>

              honorable gentleman as a responsible Minister - that the Minister acting for the
              Attorney General will be asked to instruct the Commonwealth Investigation Service to
              investigate opposition to the Government's banking nationalization legislation, I
              ask the Prime Minister whether this means that the Minister proposes to offer threats
              of intimidation to the free expression of public opinion against such legislation by
              the use of members of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. If so, how would such
              action differ from the use of the Gestapo and OGPU by governments of totalitarian
              countries?</para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may .rest easy in his bed at night. I have previously said
              in this House 'that no matter what party a citizen may be a member of he is
              entitled to express his opinions within the limits allowed by the law. A Labour
              Government will never withdraw that right from any person in this country, whether he
              be a member of the " Blue Guard ", or whatever it has been called, the Liberal
              party, the Australian Country party or the Communist party. Certain utterances are
              subversive, and could be dangerous to the peace, order and good government of the
              country. I have made it perfectly clear to the honorable member and to others that
              anybody who cares to express opposition to the Government's banking legislation is
              quite entitled to do so. That will enable the public to see clearly who are the
              opponents of that legislation. Some of those who have joined up with the honorable
              member's party have been recognized for decades in this country as being of the
              deepest dyed conservative type. I am glad when they come out into the open and show
              who are opposing the interests of the people.</para></talk.start>

                            - No, in the House. The Prime Minister, when moving the second reading of the
              Banking Bill, referred to two methods of dealing with the private banks, and I
              interposed that both amounted to confiscation. You,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,
                warned</inline>
                            me that if I interjected again you would name me, and I would be
              suspended for one month. Standing Order 59 provides that if any member be suspended,
              his suspension on the first occasion shall be for the remainder of that day's
              sitting; on the second occasion for one week; and on the third or any subsequent
              occasion for one month. You were in error,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                Speaker,</inline>
                            because I have not been suspended during this session. In my
              eighteen years service in the Parliament I was suspended only on the 12th September,
              1945 - in connexion with a subject I cannot now discuss, namely, food for Britain -
              and on the 12th July, 1946. At no time prior or subsequent to those dates was I
              suspended. Your threat to suspend me for a month was broadcast and was published in
              the press. As it was made on wrong premises I know I have only to point that out to
              you and you will make the

              ignored the Port Committee's instruction to continue work, and held an illegal

              I have is that on the whole the aircraft run pretty close to time and have a very high
              average of time keeping. I am not aware of details of any of the instances referred to
              by the honorable member. I agree that it should be possible to have minor repairs
              effected without having to send long distances for qualified mechanics to make the
              repairs. If the honorable gentleman will be good enough to supply instances, I will
              undertake to have them inquired into with a view to avoiding unnecessary delays.</para>

                                <para>- I am aware that in 1939 and preceding years a greater quantity of freight was
                carried by Guinea Airways and other operators of airlines in the goldfields area of
                New Guinea than by other companies. A very heavy tonnage was carried, because air
                transport was the only way in which freight could be conveyed to the goldfields, and
                Guinea Airways did an excellent joh. As to whether its contract will be cancelled,
                the Australian National Airlines Act states that where an adequate service is
                provided by the commission other airlines shall not operate in territorial areas.
                That provision will be given effect, and will come into operation on the 2nd
                November next.</para>

                    <para>- I direct the attention of the Prime Minister or the Minister for Repatriation,
            whoever it may concern, to the case of an ex-serviceman who lost a leg on naval duty. He
            applied for his war gratuity to be paid to him in cash. The act provides that the
            gratuity may be paid in cash to persons who are totally or permanently incapacitated. In
            this matter the War Gratuity Board has exercised its discretionary power under section 6
            of the act to direct that the wording of section 21e shall be regarded as being "
            totally and permanently incapacitated ", whereas the word used in the act is "
            or ". This man is permanently incapacitated, having lost a leg. Before the war he
            was a farm hand, but the loss of a leg compelled him to seek a vocation that would not
            be so severe on an artificial limb. He has taken up house-painting and requires a
            utility truck in which to transport his equipment. He needs the cash to buy the truck. I
            should like the appropriate Minister to ensure that payment of war gratuity shall be
            made in cash to help permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen,</para>

            that is made by the Repatriation Department in respect of tools of trade or professional
            equipment is inadequate for the purchase of these necessary instruments. The war
            gratuity of some of these men who had long service in the forces amounts to as much as
            £130, and if it were paid to thom they would be able to set themselves up in life.

              become surplus for any particular reason, to make them available first to State
              Governments for the purpose of assisting them to overcome their housing problems. If
              some buildings become surplus as the result of legislation which may be passed by this

                        <para>- The subject has been considered on a number of occasions, and, as the honorable
              member for Brisbane is aware, certain relaxations of the test were made some time ago.
              The Australian Labour party's desire has always been to devise some plan that
              would result in the abolition of the means test, but a very large sum of money is
              involved. I have not seen the latest estimates of the cost of abolishing the means
              test but it has been estimated that an amount of £38,000,000 or £40,000,000
              per annum would be involved. For that reason, and because of the impact that such
              action would have on the finances of the country, nothing further has been done to
              relax the test. The honorable gentleman may inform his constituents, however, that the
              subject is receiving constant attention from the government.</para>

                    <para>- Since the honorable member asked her question, I have discussed the
            matter on two or three occasions with the Minister for Health and Minister for Social
            Services. Some time ago, consideration was given to the suggestions of the honorable
            member. The Minister has decided, and the Government has agreed, that there shall not be
            an amendment of the act at the present time. The Minister has had' discussions with
            State Ministers, with a view to bringing under the provisions of the hospital benefits
            scheme those whom the honorable member claims should have further assistance. Evidence
            in regard to cost has been collected, and the investigation has been almost completed.
            That should remove most of the honorable member's anxiety. The position as it stands
            is better than some people imagine it to be. When a person is admitted to a mental
            asylum, his or her pension is stopped if he or she remains in the asylum for four or
            more weeks, but is restored immediately upon release, with the addition of four
            retrospective weekly payments. If a male breadwinner is sent into hospital, the wife is
            immediately regarded as a widow under the Widows' Pensions Act and is entitled to a
            widow's pension. If there are any children the mother of whom 'becomes an
            inmate, the person who has the care and custody of them collects the payment on behalf
            of each child. In addition, there is a provision which gives to the Director of Social
            Services power to deal with special cases, such as those which the honorable member has
            in mind. If the act does not make specific provision for the granting of relief, the
            Director of Social Services is empowered to Use his own judgment and grant relief. I
            believe that those not now provided for by the act will be covered when they come under
            the provisions of the hospital benefits scheme.</para>

                            . - Only one hourhas been allotted for the discussion of these territories for
              which enormous amounts of money are to be voted. It is a disgraceful thing that
              honorable members are not allowed to discuss such matters at length. I do not object
              to the amounts which it is proposed to vote, but the committee has a right to know how
              the money is to be expended. I draw particular attention to the administration of the
              Northern Territory. As honorable members know, there is in the Northern Territory an
              administrator, and now it is proposed that a legislative council shall be elected to
              assist him. As a matter of fact, the elections for this council are to be held in the
              first week in December. No one man, however capable, should be called upon to
              undertake the job of administering the Northern Territory. I say that with all respect
              to the present administrator. He is a young man, and eventually he will become one of
              the best administrators we have everhad, but he should not be asked to carry the
              burden alone. I remind honorable members that the Minister for Lands in Western
              Australia declared only recently, as reported in the
                            <inline font-style="italic">West
                Australian</inline>
                            of the 30th September last, that the task of administering the
              land settlement scheme for ex-servicemen was too big for any one man to handle, and
              that a committee was to be appointed to assist him. Honorable members will appreciate
              what I say, therefore, when I point out that the task of administering the Northern
              Territory is too heavy for any one man. We should be kinder to him, and give him the
              assistance of a committee of at least three persons, the administrator to be chairman.
              The setup would be somewhat like that which existed in 1925-26, when we had in the
              Northern Territory a North Australia Commission to assist the administrator. If such a
              committee were appointed, the administrator would not be called upon to deal with
              every petty problem. He could delegate some of his authority to members of the
              committee, while he concentrated on matters of general policy. That would be only fair
              to the administrator, to the residents of the Northern Territory, and to the taxpayers
              generally. As I have pointed out, the proposed votes are for very large sums, and a
              further large appropriation is to be made for additions, new works, buildings,
              &amp;c., including £400,000 which has been allocated for lands acquisition in
              Darwin. The Northern Territory suffers greatly by reason of the fact that it is
              virtually under the control of two Ministers, the Minister for the Interior
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson),</inline>
                            and the Minister for Works and Housing
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon),</inline>
                            the latter being responsible for
              all works and buildings. The Administrator may issue a requisition for certain works
              which he regards as of extreme urgency, but nothing is done until the Department of
              Works and Housing has endorsed it and allocated men to the work. That is totally
              wrong. The administration of the Northern Territory should be left in the hands of one
              Minister. I go further and say that as the Minister for the Interior is already
              overburdened with work, a new portfolio of Minister for the Northern Territory should
              be created, or at least responsibility for the administration of the Territory should
              be placed in the hands of an assistant Minister. Like Topsy, the Northern Territory
              has now "growed up". A good deal of the money which is voted for the Northern
              Territory year after year is merely poured down the sink. There was a time when I
              complained bitterly about the unwillingness of the governments of the day to provide
              adequately for the Northern Territory. Now money is being provided but I find myself
              having to protest against the methods adopted in its expenditure. Both the Minister
              for the Interior and the Minister for Works and Housing are well aware of what I mean.
              Too much of the time of the Minister for the Interior is taken up on matters
              concerning the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, and on electoral
              matters, both of which responsibilities occupy the full time of the Minister. I
              strongly urge that a new portfolio of Minister for the Northern Territory be created.

                        The ex-servicemen's organization is one of the few bodies in New Guinea with the
            necessary status to present a case. There is no electoral body in New Guinea to which a
            case could be presented, this Government in its unwisdom having abolished the
            Legislative Council there. It seems strangely inconsistent that it should do so and
            should subsequently establish a Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, which
            already has a representative in this Parliament. There is a good deal of merit in the
            suggestion of the honorable member for Richmond

            Allen has rendered valuable service to the nation and is respected and admired by the

            development scheme which the British Government is carrying out there. To-day, New

            have some real knowledge by virtue of my training. The Land Board, which was abolished
            as a result of a recommendation in the Fletcher - Payne Report, should be resuscitated.
            That report was a factual and very valuable document, but unfortunately, as the result
            of pressure from vested interests, including Vesteys and Lord Luke, a recommendation was
            made that the board should be abolished.

            disappointed to think that the honorable gentleman's leg could be pulled so easily.
            Probably it was because of his inexperience. He thought he was doing the right thing,
            regarding
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Payne,</inline>
                        a man of very high status in
            Queensland, as an authority on the matter. Following the abolition of the Land Board,Mr.
            Payne recommended that the Land Court of Queensland be asked at intervals to sit in the
            Northern Territory to advise and adjudicate on the allocation of land3. That
            recommendation, however, was never adopted. The regulation abolishing the Land Board was
            tabled in the Senate because the Government of the day knew full well that I, as the
            watchdog of the Northern Territory, would have bitterly opposed it. As a matter of fact
            I wrote the seppeches for two Labour men to deliver in the Senate opposing the proposal,
            one of them
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gordon</inline>
                        Brown, who is now
            President of the Senate. He did a mighty good job on my advice in trying to stop the
            abolition of the board, but the Minister had his way, and it was abolished. It is high
            time it was resuscitated and given the status of the Land Board in Queensland. I say
            that because the people in the Northern Territory are suspicious of the methods of
            allocation adopted on the last occasion after applications closed in June. They suspect
            favoritism. It is a truism that it is not what is that makes people suspicious, but what
            they believe is. If the Minister takes my advice, allocations of land will be made by
            the same procedure as has been adopted in Queensland since 1924, when the Queensland act
            was redrawn, by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Payne,</inline>
                        by the way. Before 1924,
            every clerk, typist, or any one else, in the Lands Office in Queensland, without
            experience of how land should be worked, put in applications for land. The applications
            would go to a town like Longreach. There were 1,200 applications for one block at 3d. an
            acre a year rent. The local land agent made a grand harvest at the fee of one guinea a
            head. The ballot for the block was like the Golden Casket lottery drawing. So
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Payne</inline>
                        was given the job of rewriting the act to ensure
            that unsuitable applicants without experience or sufficient money should be eliminated
            from ballots. The first requirement is experience, and the second money with which to
            develop a block of land. An applicant for land has to prove that he has both before
            being allowed to take part in the ballot. The applications are culled mercilessly. Those
            left go to the Land Board in front of the commissioner and the marbles are drawn. That
            is when the applicants fake pot luck. A similar method would solve the problem in the
            next allocation of land in the Northern Territory. Some choice land has been opened up
            in the Northern Territory, including the Barkly Tablelands. In no other way will the
            people of the territory be satisfied. A land board must be set up and the method I have
            indicated used in public by a Land Commissioner, for the allocation of land. I have been
            through the mill in Queensland and know what I am talking about. On one occasion, after
            applicants had been .culled, there were only two marbles from which one had to be drawn.
            I was the unlucky one and drew the black marble. One criticism that I make of the
            Minister for the Interior is (hat in every State there is a scheme for the allocation of
            land to ex-servicemen, but none in the Northern Territory. Who were those people that
            were allocated land recently? They were friends of mine and I have no objection to their
            having been allocated land, but the allocation should have been made by ballot and not
            at a secret conclave by a .few officials in Darwin. The territory has grown up. The
            people know what is done elsewhere. They want the same procedure adopted in the
            territory as has operated in Queensland since 1924 and, presumably, in the other States.
            I congratulate the Minister for having recently appointed as Director of Lands one of my
            own profession, a licensed surveyor, who has vast experience of the cattle and sheep
            country of Western Australia. He is capable of examining the land in the remote and vast
            area of the Northern Territory. I also congratulate the Minister for having appointed
            field officers. We call them crown lands rangers in Queensland, but that term is not
            sufficiently dignified. "Field Officer" is a better title. Lam glad the Minister
            has seen fit to appoint those field officers to classify the lands thoroughly, but I
            complain about the delay in the examination of the country. The Administrator told me
            that he intended to have an aerial survey made before allocating any more land. I am in
            favour of that and have been advocating it for many years, but I submit that much of the
            land in the Northern Territory is already well classified. Many areas of 400 square
            miles do not need any further classification before people get on with the job of
            opening them up. I suggest that the Minister confer with the Administrator on that
            point. The valleys of the northern rivers, and areas such as Katherine, can readily be
            opened up. There should be strip flying for a detailed survey certainly, but the other
            work can be done by other means. I understand that an aeroplane has been engaged for
            survey work on pastoral areas farther back, but there is no justification for a detailed
            survey. The Director of Lands with a team of packhorses or a 30-cwt. truck could get
            more real and exact information of those areas than could be got by strip flying,
            although I am pleased that modern methods of photography are being used to classify the
            lands generally. It is an art in itself to prepare the mosaics that can be seen at the
            Department of the Interior. I do not wish to be unduly critical of the
            Administrator's action in having a plane equipped to do strip flying, but it is a
            matter of urgency to have the land allocated. I wonder if the Minister is able to tell
            us just how much of the land in the Northern Territory is waiting for allocation and how
            much of it is already being used by pastoralists free of charge 'pending
            classification. It is all very well to say they will not do this or that when resumption
            notices go out to pastoralists, but I have had vast experience of surveying land
            resumptions in north-western Queensland. My experience shows that from the time [
            received instructions to survey an area, the area has been "flogged". At
            Da,1gonally, in 1925-26, the land was stripped as bare by sheep as it would have been by
            a caterpillar plague. The outgoing tenants did not graze the sheep, but shepherded
            16,000 sheep, and, when the unfortunate new selector came to take up 30,000 or 40,000
            acres, he found nothing but bare country. My brother and I took up 40,000 acres at
            Boulia. When we arrived it had been stripped of grass. We had about £600 to pay for
            two bores. The year 1925 was dry and 1926 began the real drought, 1927 was a
            "schmozzler" and 1928 and 1929 were dry. In 1930 we were practically forced off
            the holding for lack of funds. The field officers have a mighty job to do in the
            Northern Territory. When resumptions are about to be made they should be sent out to
            prevent the outgoing lesseepastoralists from overstocking the holdings. The country is
            worthy of better treatment, and I do not believe that the great pastoralists of the
            Northern Territory are any different from those of Queensland. If they have the
            opportunity they will take every blade of grass off the properties. Therefore, some
            restriction should be placed upon them. It is useless for field officers to sit in
            Darwin, Alice Springs and other centres. As their name implies, they must be out in the
            field. That is their place. We do not want so much administration in the Northern
            Territory, hut we do require the practical men to be in the field. It is a fight, as it
            were, between the administration, and the practical or scientific man in the field. I do
            not wish to minimize the need for administration, but it should be secondary to the
            field work. The man in the field, the expert, should take first place. It is useless for
            any one to attempt to administer something if he does not know what he has to
            administer. For instance, if a carpenter does not know his tools, he cannot use them to
            advantage. It is the same in any other sphere. A man must have had enough training in
            matters scientific to know when a thing is proved, and what he is administering. Because
            lands will be allocated in the near future, strict supervision must be kept on the
            outgoing lessees before the resumptions are due.

                        Very little of the money which was allocated for the development of mining in the
            Northern Territory last year was expended, and I hope that this year the expenditure
            will be substantially increased. I realize that it is difficult for the Minister to
            examine every application for assistance for mining operations. He must always be
            careful that he is not having a joke put over him by someone without capital, who
            desires to use government funds for floating on the stock exchange companies bogus or
            otherwise. However, there are some small companies in the Northern Territory which
            deserve assistance. One of them which is " above board " is engaged in
            tin-mining at Maranboy and I ask the Minister to give to its needs sympathetic
            consideration. One of the requirements is the development of the water supply from
            Beswick Creek, so that the battery may .be started up at Maranboy. At Fountain Head, a
            private operator
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Potter</inline>
                        has had to do the
            crushing because the battery there is out of commission. This work is really a
            government job.

                        An amount of £400,000 has been allocated for " Works Services ". There
            must be an interesting story behind that, and I cannot be too critical of the Department
            of Works and Housing which controls the erection of houses in the Northern Territory.
            The set-up is peculiar. The architects, I believe, may be quite competent to design
            buildings for, say, the Commonwealth Bank. They may be able to give an excellent lecture
            on the history of architecture, beginning from the Norman period and proceeding to the
            early English and decorated period of 1265, the perpendicular period of the 14th
            century, and the Gothic period up to the Renaissance. However, what we require is
            domestic architecture, suited to the climate of the Northern Territory. We need an
            expert on domestic architecture, but such an officer does not appear to be employed by
            the Department of Works and Housing. What happened in 1926 when a former member for
            Gippsland,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paterson,</inline>
                        was Minister for the
            Interior? When I criticized the type of houses in Darwin as being totally unsuitable for
            the tropics, he was good enough to send to the town an architect,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haslam,</inline>
                        and, in addition, provided money for him to
            proceed to Singapore. When the architect returned, I conferred with him, and he designed
            a type of house suitable for the climate of Darwin. I do not know whether he is still
            employed by the department. I intend to ring up the department to-day to ascertain his
            whereabouts, if possible, because he did a remarkable job. The designs which he made
            provided for the walls to be louvred to enable the circulation of air through the
            houses. He went so far as to experiment, not with the straight louvre, but with a curved
            louvre, so that a slight ten-mile an hour breeze would pass through the house at 25
            miles an hour. In addition, the curved louvre could be opened at will. Before the advent
            of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haslam,</inline>
                        the type of house in Darwin had four
            rooms in a block and they were surrounded by a verandah. It was the hottest type of
            house ever designed, and was built in the days of the first administrator in 1911.
            People lived, not in the house but on the verandah. Indeed, it was impossible for any
            one to live in those four box rooms at the centre of the structure. If
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haslam</inline>
                        is still alive I hope that we shall be able
            once more to obtain his valuable services, because at present the department is making a
            mess of house construction in Darwin.

                irrigation within their vicinity. An important subject which I discussed on one
                occasion with the honorable member for the Northern Territory (
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blain)</inline>
                                was the prospects of cotton and tobacco
                growing in that area.

                            <para>- For once, the honorable member for the Northern Territory and I are in
                agreement. I must note the date and the time. The cotton position is a difficult one
                for us in these days of reconstruction, and if it were possible adequately to
                produce cotton and tobacco in Australia, those two big industries would greatly help
                our development. I have read the reports published by the Council for Scientific and
                Industrial Research. They appeared to be factual documents, and contained a note of
                romance regarding what could be done with the Northern Territory. For the first
                time, I found a scientific approach. We were not told that every part of the
                Northern Territory would blosson like the rose. The report, while recognizing that
                grazing and cattle raising must be the major projects, devoted considerable
                attention to water conservation and irrigation, and the possibility of keeping stock
                fat until they went to Wyndham for slaughtering and shipment overseas. It also began
                to make out a case in regard to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco. I make these
                references only in passing. I am an admirer of the potentialities of the north. I
                have visited the area on four or five occasions, and whenever I go there, I am
                amazed that we, who live in the south, should know so little about the Northern
                Territory and its potentialities. During World War II., large numbers of Australian
                servicemen were stationed in the Northern Territory, and many of them would like to
                return and settle there. The honorable member for the Northern Territory has
                referred to pastoral leases and the difficulties which exist in that connexion. If
                we are to settle ex-servicemen or immi-.grants in the north, we must have planned
                irrigation projects. I ask the Minister to make available to us the latest
                information about the cotton and tobacco potentialities of the north.</para>

                            .- J refer to the proposed- grant to the provisional administration of Papua and
              New Guinea, towards expenses, of £2,350,000. That huge sum will have to be paid
              by the taxpayers of Australia, a,nd we are entitled to a statement of how it will he
              spent. I can find no details in any document made available to us covering this item.
              Whenever an honorable member on .this side of the chamber introduces a discussion
              about the administration of our external territories he is met with abuse from the
              Minister for External Territories
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline>
                            who
              alleges that we are the friends of sweaters, and the like. Some time ago I moved a
              motion on private members' day which was intended to be helpful, and in which 1
              proposed that a committee of members of all parties should visit Papua and New Guinea
              to investigate conditions on the spot. Such committees are often appointed by the
              British Parliament. But what can one expect from the present Minister for External
              Territories, who, on one occasion, said, in regard to these territories - and I quote
              the following passage from

              people I would say that if it should become necessary to defend our mandated territory
              they should defend it themselves. As '-far as I am concerned, all I can judge
              about the necessity for retaining New Guinea is that a handful of exploiters have got
              hold of the -country, some interested in aerial transport, some in gold mining, and
              some in the search for oil. These people want to retain New Guinea in order to
              preserve their own commercial interests.</para>

                                - Some years ago, before the honorable gentleman assumed ministerial office.
                Papua and New Guinea are rich in natural resources, vegetable' fats, which the
                world so greatly needs, and other commodities. During the administration of the
                pre-war non-Labour government there was a measure of local government in Papua, but
                nowadays that has been abandoned, and an attempt is being made to administer Papua
                and New Guinea from Canberra. However well-intentioned the officers charged with this
                administration may be such an administration must be detrimental to the territories.
                While discussing another item in the Estimates, I referred to the administration of
                the Minister for External Territories in relation to Papua and New Guinea and was
                told that there was no objection to his policy. It has also been said that we are on
                the side of the exploiters, or words to that effect. In this connexion I direct
                attention to the following extract from the newspaper

              abundantly so - is that the Ward Administration is not only hindering the
              rehabilitation of New Guinea hut threatens to stifle private enterprise altogether.
              "New Guinea" for -the " native " has become a party catch cry; a catch
              cry for which the Australian taxpayer will eventually have to pay something 'like
              £1,500,000 a year; this for a Territory of abundant wealth in gold and copra
              which before this war was self-supporting and could again bc so but for the Government

                        Before the wai-, during the regime of the Lyons, Menzies and Fadden
            Governments, some Commonwealth funds were provided to assist in the development of New
            Guinea. While I was Minister for Trade and Customs a bounty was provided for von years,
            to assist white men to give employment to the native peoples under good conditions.

            there is no objection to his administration, I direct attention to the following

                        It is astonishing that, although there is no authority for a
            stabilization scheme for copra in these territories, the Government is retaining a part
            of the proceeds of the sale of copra and placing it to the credit of government funds.
            Neither the copra producers nor the gold-mining companies are allowed to retain the
            proper proceeds from their activities. There can be no justification for the actions of
            the Government in this regard. Copra producers should he paid the full proceeds that
            their product brings on the worlds markets. The Minister for External Territories has
            denied that anomolies exist in his administration. Why, then, was not the honorable
            gentleman willing to agree to my request that an all party parliamentary committee
            should visit Papua and New Guinea during the winter recess for the purpose of reporting
            on affairs there? Such, a report would be valuable in very many ways. The honorable
            gentleman, however, took advantage of the standing order which limited the time of the
            debate on that occasion and prevented other honorable gentlemen from speaking to my
            motion. Since then he has visited Geneva and no doubt with much arrogance submitted 95
            amendments during: certain discussions on native affairs. I have no doubt that the
            honorable gentleman, notwithstanding his immature experience in the administration of
            native affairs, employed typical rabblerousingstatements such as he uses in public
            meetings in East Sydney in telling the conference which he was addressing of his own
            magnificent administration. I do not criticize the officials of the Papua New Guinea
            administration, many of whom made the supreme sacrifice during the war. Some hundreds of

              more helpful in respect of the natives. I point out that the administration formerly

              in that regard. Of what use is it to pay natives in bank-notes to meet claims for war
              damage, for these simple-minded people do not understand the value of money? It would
              be far better for the Government to restock villages with pigs and poultry, and to
              provide seed for the replanting of gardens. The variations which the Minister for
              External Affairs has made in the indenture system have also been unsatisfactory. The
              new conditions are too restrictive and the period of employment, which is now one
              year, is too short to give satisfactory results. We have the extraordinary situation
              of one Minister of this Government making provision for former Polish soldiers to come
              to this country conditionally upon their agreeing to remain in their employment for
              two years, while another Minister, who is in charge of our external territories,
              provides a system of employment which requires natives to remain in their employment
              for only one year. It is alleged that the previous indentures enforced slave
              conditions upon the natives, whereas in fact, they could more properly be compared
              with the indentures signed by apprentices, seamen and the like. The Minister for
              External Affairs has adopted a very high-handed attitude. We can only hope that during
              his travels he has acquired more wisdom. Under existing conditions, there is every
              justification for our asking that an inquiry be made into the administration of Papua
              and New Guinea, so that the good reputation of Australia in regard to native
              administration may be preserved. He should invite members of all parties in the Senate
              and the House of Representatives to accompany him to the territories, so that they
              could gain a better idea of what is being done there. While the honorable gentleman
              was overseas, the Minister for the Army
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Chambers)</inline>
                            administered his department. I submitted in writing to that
              Minister a proposal in regard to a parliamentary visit, but he replied that the duties
              of his own department were too heavy to permit of his making a visit. Other members of
              the Opposition were also prepared to go. The Minister has said that shortly he will
              again visit the territory. He made a very brief visit some years ago. On the next
              occasion, he should not confine his attentions to the Port Moresby district, in which,
              we know, a lavish native village is being built at an expenditure of about
              £100,000, while the natives of theRabaul region, whose villages were bombed,
              whose numbers were substantially reduced, and who need medical attention, are being
              neglected. The honorable gentleman should travel widely in the territory, and remain
              there for a considerable time. When he returned from his last visit, he read a tribute
              from some native about "what a fine fellow number one Government was ". Other
              natives, though, held different opinions. I have on the notice paper a motion, the
              debate on which could have been concluded long ago, had the Minister so desired. It
              proposes -

                        The honorable member for the Northern Territory, in his opening remarks,
            congratulated the Government on its selection of an administrator. I appreciate his
            congratulations, and am confident that the gentleman appointed will prove to be one of
            the best administrators ever to have held that responsible office. In the brief period
            during which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Driver</inline>
                        has had charge of the
            Northern Territory, he has won the confidence of the people by his outstanding ability
            and untiring energy in formulating a programme for the development of an area which has
            received very scant consideration from all previous governments. I realize that the
            development of the Northern Territory is not an easy task. I have no fantastic ideas.
            But I have said in this Parliament, as well as in other places, that the Northern
            Territory will have a very great future if it is properly treated. Up to date, it has
            not had just consideration from either lessees or any other section. About two years
            ago, I made an extensive tour of the territory, and was amazed at the lack of
            development and facilities. I found that big companies such as Vesteys, Bovril
            Australian Estates Limited, and others had depended wholly on 'the natural resources
            of the country. Cattle were travelling 12 miles backward and forward to a waterhole.
            That meant that they spent the whole of their time walking out to feed and back to
            water. How could stock be expected to keep in condition in such wretched circumstances?
            My investigations convinced me that an administrative change was necessary. As the
            honorable member for the Northern Territory, myself and others who have had the
            opportunity of coming into contact with the new Administrator know, the Government has
            done a very good job in that connexion. . We all are determined to benefit by past
            mistakes.
                    </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for the Northern Territory referred to the availability of land
            in the territory. Not a lot of land is available at the present time. That which is
            available will be thoroughly surveyed by the Director of Lands. I shall not take any
            risks in connexion with its allocation until I have examined his report. The time has
            arrived when full consideration must be given to the future welfare of the lands of the
            Northern Territory, and I intend, even at the cost of delay, to ensure that a proper
            survey of them shall be made by thoroughly competent men before coming to any decisions.</para>
                    <para>I have decided to make provision for a land court by an amendment of the existing
            legislation. I assure the honorable member for the Northern Territory that the draft of
            the amendment is in the Attorney-General's Department, and will be sent to the newly
            elected Legislative Council next January. Those people who consider that they have not
            had a just and fair deal will then be able to approach a court of appeal.</para>
                    <para>The honorable member for the Northern Territory also referred to mining development.
            The -Government has given attention to the position at Tennant Creek. The Administrator,
            who is a water conservation engineer, selected a site, and a successful bore was sunk.
            The matter of reticulation is now being handled by the Department of Works and Housing.
            I hope that, in the very near future, the water will he laid on to Tennant Creek. The
            other proposal is more difficult, because of the meagre population at Maranboy, but we
            realize that there are possibilities of developing the tin-field there. The possibility
            of obtaining water from Beswick Creek is being examined by the Administrator.</para>
                    <para>The honorable member also criticized the design of houses being erected in Darwin. I
            know that he realizes the difficulties associated with putting the new plan into effect,
            but sometimes I am at a loss to understand his attitude. I am sure that he realizes that
            the Government is determined that, notwithstanding all obstacles, Darwin will be built
            in such a fashion that it will be, not only an important asset, but also an
            advertisement to Australia. The administration has been most careful in choosing
            suitable designs for houses in the Northern Territory. It even sent an expert to Brazil
            to get whatever information was obtainable from that country about buildings for hot
            climates. The honorable member commended the work of a certain officer of the
            department, and then went on to say that he did not know now whether the man was dead or
            alive. As a matter of fact, the officer referred to is still in the employ of the
            Department of Works and Housing, and his principle work is to watch carefully building
            development in the Northern Territory. Because of its strategic value, the Northern
            Territory is regarded by the Government as of great importance to Australia. The more it
            is developed, the better it will be for Australia as a whole.</para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Parkes asked for information about the reports of the
            Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the work of the Northern Development
            Committee. That committee was created in accordance with an agreement between the
            Governments of Western Australia, Queensland and the Commonwealth to direct the work of
            qualified men planning the development of northern Australia. It is obvious that any
            important developmental work in Queensland on the one side, or Western Australia on the
            other, would have its effect upon settlement in the Northern Territory. For instance,
            developmental work by the Government of Western Australia in connexion with the Ord
            River scheme would also affect the territory over the border. I am sure that the two
            State governments mentioned working in conjunction with this Government, will be able to
            bring much valuable land into pro- duction. Those persons who criticize proposals for
            the development of land in the Territory have usually either not seen it at all, or
            merely flown over it in an aeroplane. I believe that there is great room for development
            in the Ord River district, especially in the production of tobacco and cotton, just as
            there is in the Katherine area. In its efforts to develop the Northern Territory, the
            Government is hampered by the conservative legislation and administrative acts of
            previous governments, and in particular, by the unjustifiably long leases which were
            granted. These leases cannot be terminated except by paying unduly high compensation.
            Until the land, which' is the subject of the leases, is available for re-allocation,
            the Government's scheme for development will be held up.</para>
                    <para>The honorable member for the Northern Territory also complained because there was no
            scheme in operation in the territory for the settlement of ex-servicemen, and he drew an
            unfavorable comparison between what was happening in the territory and in Western
            Australia. In reply to him, I point out that very little of the land in the Northern
            Territory is suitable for closer settlement. It is the wish of the Government to protect
            ex-servicemen from exploitation, and to prevent them from acting as dummies for big
            financial interests. Therefore, the Government will not define its policy in regard to
            land settlement in the Territory until it has received the report of the Lands Director,
            who is making a complete survey of suitable areas.</para>

                            . - I support the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline>
                            about the administration of the territories
              of Papua and New Guinea. I do not wish to enter into a violent controversy with the
              Minister for External Territories
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline>
                            on
              this subject, because I know that he is inclined to regard criticism of his department
              as a personal attack on himself. I have before me the
                            <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Book</inline>
                            for 1939, showing the expenditure on the
              territories of Papua and New Guinea at that time when Australian colonization of those
              areas was in a reasonably nourishing condition. In 1939, the expenditure on Papua and
              New Guinea was about £1,000,000, about £500,000 being expended on each. In
              the Estimates before us the total appropriation for the territories of Papua and New
              Guinea is £2,779,000. Thus, compared with the normal provision in pre-war years,
              an additional amount of approximately £1,750,000 is to he provided. I &lt;lo not
              doubt that certain circumstances may exist to-day that call for increased expenditure
              ; but in view of the enormous amount of money to be provided, we are entitled to some
              information as to the items on which it is to be expended. The manner in which these
              Estimates have been presented to the committee demonstrates how the Government is
              attempting to smother up its proposed1 expenditure in these territories. The first
              item under Division No. 255 reads: " Grant to Provisional Administration towards
              expenses, including native welfare, war damage and reconstruction, £2,350,000
              ". A lump sum is provided for those services. Under item 10, restoration of lands
              and roads, an additional amount of £40,000 has been provided and an additional
              amount of £100,000 has also been provided for reopened plantations - clearing
              secondary growth. The committee and the taxpayers generally are entitled to have a
              detailed statement showing how all this money is to be expended so that they may know
              whether extravagances in the administration of the territory are contemplated. In
              almost every instance in government accounting, a dissection of large amounts is given
              so that honorable members are able to see at a glance what is proposed. Only those who
              have something to hide cloak their accounts in obscurity in this way. I stress the
              enormous expenditure proposed to be incurred by the Department of External Territories
              by comparison with the vote for the Australian Capital Territory. For the whole of the
              Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, an amount of £740,500 is to
              be provided, or only approximately one-quarter of the vote for Papua and New Guinea.
              In the estimates of expenditure for the Australian Capital Territory, a complete
              breakdown is given showing by what departments and on what services the money is to be
              expended. The honorable member for Balaclava
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                White)</inline>
                            has suggested, and I, too, advocated some time ago the appointment
              of an all-party committee with facilities to visit New Guinea to ascertain what is
              happening there. I would be prepared to pay my own expenses to travel to the territory
              if reasonable facilities were provided to enable me to move about the country when I
              got there. The Government, however, has placed all kinds of obstructions in the way of
              people who desire to visit the territory. New Guinea has an important bearing on the
              defence and security of Australia, and although it is desirable that we should do what
              we can to build up a healthy native population it is also vitally necessary that we
              should retain a contented white population there. White people will remain in New
              Guinea only if opportunities for the advancement of their material well-being are
              provided. I have received letters from the New Guinea Citizens Association complaining
              that when a ship arrives at Lae no nets are available for the safe handling of its
              cargo. Consignees receive their invoices, but all too frequently find that their goods
              are lying on the bottom of the harbour because of the poor shipping facilities
              provided. Having paid customs duty on the goods on the basis of the invoice, they have
              the greatest difficulty in securing a refund when the goods are lost in that way. The
              residents of New Guinea are maintaining one of the most important outposts of this
              country, but so bad have their conditions become, that the New Guinea Citizens
              Association proposes to appeal to the Mandates Commission of the United Nations for
              justice. It is extraordinary that Australian citizens should have to contemplate
              taking such a step against their own Government for the protection of their rights.
              Such an extraordinary state of affairs could develop only under the administration of
              a government of the character and calibre of the present Government. If New Guinea is
              to be of value to Australia, the white people who take their wives and children there
              must he treated more sympathetically than they have been in the past. I find it
              difficult to choose a word adequately to describe the kind of treatment extended to
              the widows and dependents of civilians who gave their lives in the defence of New
              Guinea. I am familiar with the treatment meted out to the widow of the brother of the
              right honorable member for Cowper
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle
                Page).</inline>
                            That is only one of many similar cases which have been brought to my
              notice. The right honorable gentleman's brother was killed by the Japanese, after
              his wife returned to Australia. Until the fate of her husband had been established,
              the Government made her
                            <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline>
                            payments, but
              in common with other widows similarly circumstanced, it deducted from the
              superannuation and other accrued payments due to the dependents of these officers, the
              amount of sustenance paid to them during the war. Contrast that treatment of the
              dependants of those who gave their lives in order to provide us with a brief period in
              which to build up our defences, with the proposal now before us.

                            .- When the Estimates were under consideration I found it impossible to discuss
              the matter of Land Sales Control and the royal commission thereon because the Prime
              Minister acts in a dual capacity. As Treasurer, he is in charge of the Land Sales
              Control, and, as Prime Minister, he is in charge of royal commissions, but I could not
              combine the two. So I take this opportunity of saying what I had hoped to say before.
              When a government appoints a royal commission, it frames its own terms of reference
              and chooses its own judge. That is why I have always opposed the appointment of royal
              commissions. The land sales inquiry was a travesty from start to finish. Extraordinary
              steps were taken by the Government to restrict its ambit. All requests for a full and
              complete inquiry were rejected. The actual conduct of the inquiry was even more
              extraordinary. The commissioner skilfully adhered to the letter of his restricted
              terms of reference. Land Sales Control comes directly under the control of the
              Treasurer.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lush</inline>
                            was the Treasurer's
              personal delegate. He graduated from the Treasurer's office at Canberra. No phase
              of governmental activity was closer to the Prime Minister's personal
              administration. He has kept his finger on the pulse of Land Sales Control throughout.
              It was his pet creation. Like Caesar's wife, it was supposed to be incorruptible.
              A Prime Minister, jealous of the reputation of his administration, would have insisted
              on throwing the doors wide open. He would have insisted on a complete, unrestricted
              parliamentary inquiry. He would have appeared himself before the inquiry. Then, if
              misconduct or wrongdoing was proven against any of his officers, he would have taken
              prompt and decisive action against the wrong-doers. If it was the system that was at
              fault, then he would have altered the system. But what do we find? First, inordinate
              delay while the terms of reference were found. That could be only for the purpose of
              protecting the Government. Then, when adverse findings were recorded, no action was
              taken. Despite all the precautions, misconduct was clearly established. But the
              Government has taken no action against the culprits. Why? Is it afraid that the whole
              story may come to light ? The whitewash brush left too many dirty stains as it was for
              the Government's peace of mind. The inquiry proved that the Treasurer's
              administration of his own department has been a failure. Sydney was the largest
              office. On the Government's own admission it has failed twice - before Lush and
              after Lush. The trouble with
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lush</inline>
                            started in
              1945. But nothing happened until May, 1947. Was not the Treasurer aware of what was
              happening in his own department? Months prior to the public exposure in May last, the
              dogs were barking that all was not well in Sydney Land Sales Control. Is it a fact
              that the Treasurer summoned
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lush</inline>
                            to Canberra
              at one stage? Were certain rumours discussed at that interview? If he knew, why did he
              not act promptly? Why did he wait until after the scandals were disclosed in the
              press, and the matter had been raised, not once, but on several occasions in this
              Parliament? Only a very stubborn administrator would have refused to admit that the
              control of land sales is bad, not only in principle, but also in its administration.
              No human being can be expected to give honest and correct decisions on the thousands
              of applications which are handled by the office. Only a stubborn administrator would
              have failed to take the only possible action, namely, to abolish the control of land
              sales immediately. The evidence showed that the

            Control officials were inundated with thousands of applications, all of which required
            individual decisions, and the officials were not even experienced in the rudiments of
            real estate. They had had no legal experience. Thus the jeweller's travelling
            salesman had absolute power to determine the value of an estate. The recommendations of
            the advisory committee \vere ignored. By a stroke of the pen, a poorly paid public
            servant can add thousands of pounds to an approved valuation. That, in itself, is
            vicious. Those responsible for such a system are accessories before thu fact in any act
            of corruption.</para>
                    <para>
                        The conduct of the inquiry was even more disturbing than what it revealed about some
            of the principals. As soon as it seemed that there was a danger that the inquiry might
            get beyond the Lush affair, all concerned took extraordinary steps to bottle it up
            again. There was the incident of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lush's</inline>
                        famous list. He was accused of having given preferential treatment, and personal
            attention to Parry, Burke and Alexander. In reply, Lush said that he was ready to submit
            a li3t of the names of 30 other persons to whom he had given similar treatment.
            Immediately, there was a panic. . He said that his list included the names of some
            members of this Parliament. It was even suggested that it included the names of two
            Ministers, as well as those of certain other prominent political figures. So the
            commissioner ruled that there was nothing wrong in giving preferential treatment to such
            people. No matter how he tried, Lush's counsel was unable to get that list before
            the commissioner.

                        The royal commissioner so ruled. Yet,, at the end of the inquiry, the

            not the list be produced, even at thislate stage? If any member, including a Cabinet

                        Then there was the Alderman affair.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman</inline>
                        is an Adelaide lawyer who specializes in political lobbying. He has proved himself a
            very slick operator. Since the present Government came into power, he appears to have
            devoted very little of his time to his legal practice in Adelaide. During 1942 and 1943,
            he attached himself to the then Minister for the Army. He put in a lot of time around
            Darwin. As a result, he put in a bill of costs to the Government, amounting to
            £6,460 15s. He charged for 93 days in " operational and bombed areas ", at
            twenty guineas a day. Also, for 259 days which he spent in Sydney and Melbourne, he
            charged at the rate of fifteen guineas a day. In addition, he charged, for 352 days,
            travelling expenses at £1 10s. a day. Eventually, he agreed to settle his claim for
            £6,000, after the bill had been queried. Had
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Alderman</inline>
                        been serving in the Army as an enlisted man, he would not, of
            course, have collected an extra five guineas a day for danger money while at Darwin, or
            his travelling allowance either.

                        who bobbed up
            trafficking in the broadcasting licences of Jehovah Witnesses. Once again, he proved
            himself a slick operator. On behalf of Jehovah Witnesses, he traded its Adelaide
            broadcasting station to the Methodist Church and the South Australian branch of the
            Australian Labour party. Then, he turned his attention to Newcastle, in New South Wales.
            He persuaded the Australian Labour party to " part up " £4 a share for 2HD,
            then a defunct station, or £16,000 in all. That indicates just how expert
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman</inline>

                    <para>
                        It is not surprising, therefore, to find Alderman interesting himself in Land Sales
            Control. He bobbed up in Canberra on behalf of the Western Assurance Company. According
            to the very busy
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balmford,</inline>

                        applied the pressure to
            increase the price of a property in Pitt-street, Sydney, mind you, not Adelaide.
            Eventually,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balmford</inline>
                        agreed to an increase of
            £4,000 on the previously approved price. So,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Alderman</inline>
                        got results for his client at the rate of £1,000 an hour. But
            that £4,000 was not the fruits of his legal training. It was earned by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman,</inline>
                        not the lawyer but the political lobbyist.
            That is another reason why the present system is wrong. How many people can afford, or
            would desire, to employ a political lobbyist to put their case before Land Sales
            Control?

                    <para>
                        Then there was the Parry affair. Parry, also, was a man who specialized in political
            contacts. He was another parasite on the people who control the Government's
            political machine. He is a man who thrived on political favours. He knew his way around,
            especially through the back door. But the inquiry did not start at the beginning of the
            Parry affair. It carefully avoided the stench of the Victory Garden which became a golf
            course. Parry had immediate access not only to Lush, but also to Canberra." Parry
            purchased the Fenwick estate, comprising 86 acres, in December, 1943, for the sum of
            £10,000. At that time, Lush was not in charge of the Sydney office. The
            commissioner reported that the file relating to the Treasurer's consent could not be
            found, so was not available to the inquiry. Parry, in acquiring the estate, had only one
            object in mind, and that was to subdivide it and make a huge profit. The Victory Garden
            enabled him to obtain government assistance in preparing his estate for subdivision.
            When
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parry</inline>
                        decided to collect his profits, he
            came to Canberra and saw the Treasurer personally. He wanted to purchase two extra
            blocks. The Treasurer informed him that he would grant his request provided that the
            estate was not to be subdivided at a profit. In July, 1945, Parry transferred ll acres
            of land in a property called the Golf Links estate to a family company and proceeded
            with his plan to subdivide it. The valuation placed upon that land and an adjoining
                        <inline font-style="italic">li</inline>
                        acres was only £2,900. Parry .wanted to
            sell it for £9,000. He knew that at the time the Housing Commission of New South
            Wales intended to resume the land in furtherance of a government housing scheme. Lush
            wrote to the Canberra Land Sales Control office on the 22nd October. 1945, in the
            following terms : -

            commission. Counsel instructed by the Crown knew that he was about to leave the country,
            but took uo steps to prevent his departure. One cannot help but ask : Did counsel for
            the Crown receive any instructions? If they did, from whom did they obtain them? Parry
            obtained a passport and a taxation clearance, and I have no doubt that he also obtained
            dollars. Why? The Government had a clear responsibility to ensure that Parry remained in
            this country. How did its members know that criminal proceedings would not have to be
            taken as the result of the commissioner's report? The fact is that Parry was an
            embarrassment to many people while he remained here, 'because he knew too much. He
            had subdivided the land and had done so at a profit; something which was contrary to the
            terms of his explicit agreement with the Treasurer. If
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Dovey,</inline>
                        senior counsel for the Crown, was correct in the submissions which he
            made to the royal commission, there was a clear intention to defraud the Housing
            Commission of New South Wales, and Parry's departure is paralleled only by the
            disappearance of a key witness during the inquiry into the notorious land scandals
            earlier in this century. Governments have been wrecked by irregularities of much lesser
            seriousness.

                        The final chapter in the story of this inquiry is the astounding promotion of the
            royal commissioner. He was appointed to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and
            Arbitration while still considering his report. It was wrong for the Government to make
            such an offer to him, and it was wrong for the judge to accept it. The Government's
            administration was clearly on trial. An' adverse finding on its administration would
            have damaged it immeasurably. We have wit- nessed the spectacle frequently of
            governments taking refuge from hostileinquiries by pleading that matters the subject of
            inquiries are
                        <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline>
                        Here,, the Government
            itself was
                        <inline font-style="italic">sub judice;</inline>
                        yet it had the audacity,
            while the royal commissioner was still considering his report,, to offer him a promotion
            !. That should be sufficient to shock any one who desiresto see the integrity of our
            judicial system maintained. Such a thing should never have happened, and it has tainted
            the entire proceedings and the commissioner's report. There was a time when members
            of the judiciary of this country had a really high conception of their obligation to
            hold themselves aloof from controversy. The late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Justice</inline>
                        Piddington resigned an appointment to the High Court rather than
            permit .that court to become the subject of controversy. But here we have the spectacle
            of a judge accepting a promotion from a governmentwhose administration is on trial, and
            doing so while that trial is still proceeding. That is something which is not only
            unjudicial but is also unprecedented. It destroyed the whole value of the
            commissioner's report, and it provides the worst possible indictment of the
            Government which made the appointment and of the judge who accepted it. British justice
            is founded on the impartiality of the judiciary, and this was emphasized in the judgment
            delivered in the famous
                        <inline font-style="italic">New Statesman</inline>
                        case, tried
            before the English courts. This conception is expressed in the following words which are
            perhaps the most beautiful I have ever read : -

                            . - I know that the honorable member for Reid
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Lang)</inline>
                            is a life member of the society for the cultivation of the dirty
              tongue, but I feel that I must reply to some of his observations. One of them is his
              absolutely slanderous statement about a judge of the Supreme Court of Now South Wales.
              No member of the Government had any idea that Judge Sugerman proposed to resign from
              the Arbitration Court Bench. I did not know of- it, and the Attorney-General
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline>
                            did not know of it, until the week-end
              before Judge Sugerman tendered his resignation. At . the time when Judge Kirby was
              conducting the inquiry, while he was preparing his report, and afterwards, there was
              no indication that Judge Sugerman would resign. Had the position on the Stevedoring
              Commission been acceptable to another judge, Judge Kirby would not have been chairman
              of that commission. Judge Kirby's name stands in the highest public repute in his
              association with the New South Wales bar. I am sure that no one had any contact with
              him except the Attorney-General's Department, which approached the Government of
              New South Wales for the services of a judge, as we have approached other governments
              in connexion with inquiries of this kind. The inquiry to which the honorable member
              for Reid referred lasted for a great many weeks, and I think it has been agreed by the
              parties concerned that the judge who conducted it did so in a most fair and judicious
              manner.

            was requested to do so by a member of this Parliament, as I have been asked to see other
            persons by other members of the Parliament. In this respect, I have always ' tried
            to oblige honorable members, whether of the Opposition or of the Labour party, if they
            honestly desired me to see some one whom they brought along to introduce to me. It is
            clear that one ought to be much more careful, but I always thought, as one occupying a
            ministerial position, that it was my duty to see as many people as possible who believe
            that they have a case to present. Above all, I have tried to oblige private members when
            they ask me to see some one, and that applies to members of all parties. I do not
            discriminate. Indeed, I have been more considerate to members of the Opposition,
            perhaps, than to members of my own party, and I have even been accused of leaning over
            backwards in my efforts to be just. There is not a scintilla of truth in the suggestion
            of the honorable member for Reid about the judges of the Supreme Court of New South

                                - I do not suggest that. I wish to refute at once the suggestion that the offer
                of a judgeship was made to Judge Kirby while he was conducting the inquiry, or while
                he was preparing his report. Nothing of the kind occurred. Judge Kirby has conducted
                a number of inquiries. He was detailed for this inquiry by the Chief Justice of New
                South Wales,
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline>
                                Jordan, with the
                consent of the Government of New South Wales, in the same way as other judges have
                been detailed from time to time for similar work. That is how he came to conduct
                this particular inquiry. The honorable member for Reid spoke of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parry.</inline>
                                I do not know
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parry,</inline>
                                but, as I have said, on. one occasion I did see him in
                Canberra. He was a member of the Legislative Council in New South "Wales, and I
                was asked to see him. In reply to the interjection of the honorable member for
                Wentworth
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline>
                                I now say that I do
                not know who was the member of Parliament who asked me to see
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parry.</inline>
                                I saw
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Parry</inline>
                                for about ten minutes, and I then referred him to the Commonwealth
                Actuary, who deals with Land Sales Control. After that, I had nothing more to do
                with
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parry</inline>
                                or his subdivisions. They were
                dealt with on a purely administrative basis. It is only fair to say here that the
                judge who conducted the inquiry believed that
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Lush,</inline>
                                although a sinner, was 'probably more sinned against than
                sinning. There are in Sydney a number of slick gentlemen - and the honorable member
                for Reid knows some of their pretty well, because he has had fairly close personal
                association with some of those of the type to which, apparently, Parry belongs. It
                would appear that
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lush,</inline>
                                more sinned against
                than sinning, was induced by professions of friendship and by entertainment to
                depart from the procedure laid down for Land Sales Control. When that became known
                to me he was immediately removed from, the job. Apart from
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parry,</inline>
                                various other gentlemen were associated
                with the entertainment of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lush.</inline>
                                The
                honorable member for Reid referred to the fact that
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Parry</inline>
                                had left Australia. He may rest assured that the Government did not
                fear
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parry</inline>
                                being put in the witness box. The
                judge made it perfectly clear in his finding that the Canberra office which deals
                with the control nf land sales was above suspicion. I sholl say something more to
                the honorable, member; I do not believe that any honorable member in this House ever
                doubted the complete honesty of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balmford.</inline>
                                Most honorable members have had some dealings with him in one way or another. He is
                conscientious and honest, as well as able. He has done his best in what is
                admittedly a most difficult job - and I know of the difficulties associated with it.
                As to the famous Victory Garden, of which the honorable member for Reid speaks, the
                only association 1 had with that transaction - and my letter makes that perfectly
                clear - was that I intimated to him, after the matter had been investigated by the
                Commonwealth Actuary, the conditions under which the place could be sold. The
                honorable member for Reid says that there was some departure from that, decision. I
                assure him that there was no departure from it as the result" of any action by
                me. Much as the honorable member may like to defame me, or the Government, I do not
                think that he will be prepared to doubt my word when I give it to him.

                    <para>
                        I now turn to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman.</inline>
                        He is a professional
            man whom I have met on several occasions in Canberra, but I think that I have had only
            one conversation with him that related to anything associated with business. He came to
            Canberra to represent a certain airline company in which some members of th»
            Opposition have been greatly interested. The company was not Trans- Australia Airlines.
            I understand that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman</inline>
                        is the personal
            representative of that company. It is true that he represented the Government in certain
            cases; I think that he was assisting counsel to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Justice</inline>
                        Lowe in an inquiry into certain aspects of the bombing of Darwin. T
            believe that another king's counsel also appeared in that case. I have to confess
            that wherever a. king's counsel or lawyer is engaged by the Government I am not too
            happy about the account that will he rendered by him. I know that there is a certain
            procedure followed by the legal profession and that the prothonotary who fixes costs
            appears to be disposed to fix high fees for king's counsel, their juniors, and
            solicitors. At least, their accounts always seem large to me, and on many occasions I
            have queried the charges. That appears to be so, even when the Government is not
            involved, because I have some knowledge of high fees charged in libel cases - cases
            which did not concern me personally. The same tendency was shown even before the
            increased cost of living which occurred many years ago. And so, when the honorable
            member for Reid says that some lawyers' fees are high, I agree that he was correct;
            but that was about the only correct thing that he said. I know nothing of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman's</inline>
                        personal activities, but I understand
            that he is a lawyer or barrister of bigh standing in Adelaide, the city of churches. It
            is true that he has acted for the Government, and has been paid certain set fees for
            doing the work entrusted to him. I also understand that he ha3 been paid the customary
            fees for men of his professional standing doing certain classes of work, such as that of
            assisting
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                        Lowe and dealing with
            compensation cases. When I hear the honorable member for Reid talk about twenty guineas
            a day, I must confess that the charge seems modest. I think that there must be something
            wrong, and that the honorable member for Reid has given the wrong figures, because
            usually a king's counsel will not act for a mere twenty guineas a day. I do not
            think that the honorable member for Warringah
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Spender)</inline>
                        would demean himself by appearing in court for twenty guineas a day,
            and I am sure that my colleague the Attorney-General
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr.
              Evatt)</inline>
                        when he was in practice would not appear in court for that fee. It is
            true that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman</inline>
                        acted in connexion with a
            wide range of compensation cases. It is also true, as I have said, that some of the fees
            charged bv king's counsel in the land sales inquiry appeared to me to be high, but I
            believe -that they were the customary fees for king's counsel in such cases. I have
            been told by people of all classes that compensation cases in the Northern Territory and
            in other places such as New Guinea were handled by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Alderman</inline>
                        in a capable manner, and that he did a splendid job. I know that he
            did a thorough job, and that he performed a great amount of work in difficult
            circumstances. In the performance of that work he had necessarily to neglect, to some
            degree, his own practice. I have not heard any charge against
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman</inline>
                        as being a " crook " lawyer, and I am sure if that
            charge had been made against him the Law Institute in Adelaide would have dealt with it.

                    <para>
                        I deeply regret that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lush</inline>
                        was diverted from
            the path of rectitude. At the same time, I know that this is not a world in which every
            one is perfect. Even the disciples of Christ had their defects. I shall not be one to
            punish too severely a man who was induced by sharp business men to fall by the wayside.-
            I shall not lend myself to that sort of thing,, especially as the judge stated in his
            report that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lush</inline>
                        had already suffered, severely
            for his actions. Although hewill not fill the same job again, or a similar job, I am not
            prepared to throw him out in the street. He has been more sinned against than sinning,
            because he was influenced by " slick " business men. One would have assumed that
            a man who was a member of the Sydney City Council for ten or eleven years; chairman of
            the County Council, he having been elected to that position and not appointed to it by
            any government ; a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales,, elected
            largely by the votes of the conservative section of the community, because he is not a
            Labour man-

                                from leaving Australia. So far as I know,
                there isnothing to prevent any citizen from going to the Taxation Branch and.
                provided the police do not object, obtaining a taxation clearance to leave
                Australia. That matter is dealt with not on a ministerial level, but by the
                Commissioner of Taxation. Every honorable member whois not entirely ignorant of
                government administration is aware of that. As to theissue of the passport, I do not
                think anybody has protested more vociferously about passports than have
                honorable members opposite.

                                - I know of no legal reason why the honorable member for Reid should not be
                issued with a passport to leave Australia, though there may be some moral reasons
                for refusing it because of the irresponsible charges he makes against certain
                people. I know of no legal power vested in Judge Kirby which would have enabled him
                to prevent Parry from leaving Australia. If Judge Kirby wanted Parry to give further
                evidence he could have taken the necessary steps to secure it; apparently he had
                already satisfied himself as to the type of man Parry was and the business methods
                which he had adopted. I would not have taken any notice of the general charges made
                by the honorable member for Reid except that I wanted an opportunity to clear up
                this point. The honorable member has been pressing them for a long time and they
                have not benefited him very much. I do not like a judge, whom I do not know
                personally, but who enjoys the highest reputation in his profession and in the
                community, to be subjected to unfair criticism. I do not know what government
                appointed Judge Kirby to the Bench, nor am I interested to know. All I am concerned
                about is that the learned judge is held in high repute.

                                is, I understand, a reputable citizen of Adelaide who
                apparently represents certain big capitalist companies and comes here - like other
                lobbyists who mostly sit behind the Opposition parties - to press the claims of his
                principals. I do not object to his doing so. If these people believe that they are
                entitled to see their parliamentary representatives they have every right to do so.
                That was common practice long before I came into the Parliament.

                    <para>.- I am glad that the forms of the House give honorable members an opportunity to
            raise matters that they believe to be of great public importance. On another occasion I
            endeavoured to say something in regard to the subject I am now about to discuss, but was
            prevented from doing so. What happened, subsequently, is now history, and I propose to
            say no more about it. There comes a time, however, when, notwithstanding the use of the
            forms of the House to prevent an honorable member from expressing his views, an
            opportunity to do so presents itself. I avail myself of that opportunity now. 1
            understand that the public departments are to have made available to them sums of money
            to defray the cost of Australian representation overseas greatly in excess of those
            provided during the last financial year. The .information I have shows that the amounts
            proposed to be provided for this purpose are as follows: - International Labour
            Conferences, representation, £38,000; World Trade and Employment Conference,
            representation, £4'0,000; United' Nations Pood and Agriculture
            Organization, contribution and representation, £47,000; United Nations
            Organization, representation, £95,000; United Nations Educational, Scientific and
            Cultural Organization, contribution and representation, £61,000; South Pacific
            Commission, contribution and representation, £30,000. The items covering
            representation alone total £173,000, and those covering representation and
            contributions total £138,000. Representation at the International Labour Conference
            is estimated to cost £38,000, an amount almost equal to the cost of Australia's
            contribution, namely, £36,000. One may reasonably assume that the same ratio will
            obtain in regard to all items in which representation and contribution are lumped
            together. We might, therefore, add to the known estimated cost of representation
            one-half of the £138,000 representing both representation and contribution, which
            will give us a grand total of £252,000, which this Government proposes to expend
            during this financial year on overseas representation. It is interesting to ascertain
            what the Government expended last year, a year of extraordinary government jaunting, on
            this account. The information I have shows that the cost of our representation at the
            International Labour Conference was £31,338; at minor conferences, £9,879;
            Conference on International Trade and Employment, £49,922; United Nations Food and
            Agriculture Organization, £45,495; United Nations Educational, Scientific and
            Cultural Organization, £33,551; International Institute of Agriculture, Rome,
            £8,351; and South Seas Commission, £3,716. On a proportionate basis, we arrive
            at an amount of £31,000 in respect of those headings, making a total cost of
            representation for this financial year of £161,000. Thus, the Government proposes
            to make available approximately an additional £100,000 of the taxpayers' money
            to meet the cost for the current financial year of representation overseas on these
            conferences. I do not say that the Government should not be adequately represented
            overseas. Indeed, in the international sphere the Government should pull its weight and
            ensure that expression shall be given to Australia's point of view in the councils
            of the world; but when we find this extravagance at a time when the Australian people
            are bearing so heavy a burden of taxation to send Government supporters on joy-rides it
            is high-time that it was exposed. The public should be informed that the Government
            intends to expend £100,000 more this financial year on jaunts of this kind than was
            expended last year.</para>

                            - I do not know what the Government proposes to do, but it has reached the apex of
              financial foolishness in its expenditure on these jaunts. I have in my hand a letter
              written by the Prime Minister
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline>
                            to the
              honorable member for Franklin
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkinder)</inline>
                            setting out details of Government representation at various conferences last year. I
              shall take only one example, namely, the International Labour Organization conference.
              When the Opposition parties were inoffice, the International Labour Organization
              called for representation of Australia at least once a year and we complied with that
              request, sending delegates to represent the Government, employers and employees.
              However, we found that on other occasions Australia could be quite adequately
              represented at International. Labour Organization conferences by one of our high
              commissioners. But what do we find to-day? During the last fourteen months this
              Government has sent no fewer than nine ministerial supporters as delegates
              toInternational Labour Organization conferences. Can any one seriously say that such
              representation is justified, or that the Government is not using the International
              Labour Organization purely as- an excuse to give joy rides to its supporters in this
              Parliament? Here are the particulars:
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Finlay</inline>
                            and the honorable member for Darling
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Clark)</inline>
                            attended the International Labour Organization conference at
              Cleveland, United States of America, the former from the 12th April, 1946, to the 11th
              June, 1946, and the latter from the 11th April, 1946, to the 29th June, 1946. Before
              those gentlemen had returned,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline>
                            was
              despatched to the conference held at Seattle from the 14th May, 1946, to the 17th
              July, 1946. He had not returned when
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline>
                            was on his way to attend the conference held at Montreal from the 18th July, 1946, to
              the 28th December, 1946; and he had not returned before
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline>
                            was on a jaunt to the conference held at Montreal from
              the 24th August, 1946, to the 26th February, 1947. Following the usual practice, he
              had not returned when the honorable member for Griffith
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan)</inline>
                            was on his way to the conference held at Brussels from the
              9th November, 1946, to the 24th March, 1947. He, of course, could not make that trip
              alone.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large</inline>
                            accompanied him and attended
              that conference from the 12th November, 1946, to 10th February, 1947. Then, the
              honorable member for Martin
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline>
                            of "
              dilly-dally " fame, went overseas, and was absent for five months. Then the
              Minister for Transport
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline>
                            after the
              lesser fry had had their jaunts, found it necessary to attend the International Labour
              Organization conference held at Geneva. He left these shores on the 3rd June, 1947,
              and has just returned. He was accompanied by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Amour,</inline>
                            who attended the conference at Geneva from the 3rd June, 1947 to the
              21st August, 1947. Those nine ministerial supporters were sent on these jaunts at the
              taxpayers' expense. Such extravagance was not even approached by preceding
              governments. Yet, we are now told that this Government intends to increase its
              expenditure on representation of this kind by £100,000. The taxpayers would not
              be so concerned about that expenditure if they were assured that the nation was
              reaping fair value for it; but when we find that public money is being expended by
              this Government to send overseas men who bring Australia into disrepute, it is time
              that the Government had another look at the matter and that the taxpayers had
              something to say on the subject. I shall refer to the visit of the Minister for
              Transport to the International Labour Organization conference at Geneva. We already
              know something about
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour's</inline>
                            doings
              overseas. They have been exposed in this House, and
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Amour</inline>
                            has challenged the honorable members concerned to repeat their
              statements outside. I give this information
                            <inline font-style="italic">gratis</inline>
                            to the honorable senator:
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                Frank</inline>
                            Browne has published outside the statement to which the honorable
              senator has taken exception. The honorable senator has not been game enough to take
              action against
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Browne.</inline>
                            The editor of the
                            <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline>
                            in a footnote to a
              report published in this morning's edition of that newspaper, made certain
              comments about the explanation which
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline>
                            made in the Senate last night. But the honorable senator has not yet taken action
              against the editor of the newspaper. Therefore, until he takes appropriate action
              outside to clear his name, we must assume that the charges made against him are
              correct.

                        . - I direct the attention of the Minister of the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline>
                        to a certain matter that concerns women who remain in the
            women's services. It concerns their pay. About three months ago there was a general
            rise of Army pay, but, although these women were, I presume, to obtain the same rise,
            they have not received it, although repeated representations have been made through
            their officers for it. The last rise they received was in 1942, when they received an
            extra 4d. a day. In June last year, they had their taxation remission taken from them.
            They now have to pay income tax where formerly they had not to do so. That means that
            they are losing money. A warrant officer until June last was paid at the rate of 8s. 8d.
            a day, plus 2s. a day deferred pay. She now draws that amount, that is 10s. 8d. a day,
            and she has to pay ls. a day tax, which means that she is ls. a day worse off than
            formerly, instead of better off, as she is presumed to be by the public since Army rates
            of pay have been increased. The comment made to me was that any person who had been in
            the employ of the same employer for six years would consider herself unfairly treated if
            at the end of that period she was worse off than before. Another point is that this
            warrant officer receives less than the lowest paid stenographer in the Repatriation
            Department. She assures me that it is a matter of considerable heartburning that members
            of the public are inclined to believe that girls in the services are employed
            unnecessarily, when, as a matter of fact, their very presence is saving money in the
            matter of pay. So I ask the Minister for the Army to look into this matter immediately
            and ensure that the increased rate is speedily applied to the
                        <inline font-style="italic">women's services.</inline>

                    Recently, I asked the Minister for Works and Housing
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
            Lemmon)</inline>
                    whether it was not a fact that a war widow, unless she had some income
          over and above her widows' pension, was unable to obtain a war service home. The war
          widow who wrote to me assured me that in addition to her pension she had the £50
          required as a deposit, and that she earned something additional from time to time, but was
          not in regular employment. She has one child. Because she was not able to state the exact
          amount that she earned in addition to her pension, she was not eligible for one of the war
          widows' homes. The reply of the Minister for Works and Housing was that the question
          did not entirely correctly state the case, and that those homes were allotted only to war
          widows who were considered to be good risks. The department apparently did not consider as
          a good risk a widow with a child to support if she had only her pension, I should like to
          know on what basis the department determines whether a woman is a good risk. If it is done
          in the ordinary governmental way by reference to a set of regulations, grave hardship must
          be imposed.^ Any business person assesses a good risk more on the character of *he person
          concerned than on any tangible asset she may have. The matter of war widows has been
          discussed considerably in recent weeks and their pensions have been reviewed. I ask that
          this matter be reviewed quickly. This woman is only typical of many others. She gave up a
          dearly loved home in order that her husband might serve in the forces. He died. So she
          lost her home and her husband. Now she is not able to obtain a war service home. So I urge
          upon the Government the necessity for a review of this matter, not only in the manner the
          Minister for Works and Housing suggested, that is by providing homes of a cheaper type to
          meet the needs of people like this woman, but also by re-examining the basis upon which
          the department assesses a war widow as a risk in the advance of money for a home.

                    <para>. - I am pleased that the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Snipping
            is present, because I desire to bring to the notice of the Government the shipping
            position as it affects Western Australia. For some weeks, there has been a disagreement
            between the Fremantle Tally Clerks Union and the Federated Clerks Union of Australia.
            The Federated Clerks Union, which is led by a gentleman named Hughes, who, I understand,
            is on the central executive of the Communist party of New South Wales, has determined
            that the Fremantle Tally Clerks Union shall join the Federated Clerks Union. The result
            is a hold-up throughout Australian ports. Tally clerks will not handle cargoes to or
            from Western Australia. At the moment a conciliation commissioner is in Perth. I
            understand he has informed the men that he will not hear their case until they resume
            work. On top of that, we are faced with the position of the foremen stevedores
            threatening to go on strike if they do not have certain conditions granted to them. I
            understand that a conference is taking place in Sydney this afternoon on that matter and
            that there is every possibility that it will be satisfactorily settled over the
            week-end. In the hope that it will be, I am informed that the Australian Shipping Board
            will berth a vessel on Monday morning as a test case. As regards cargoes for Western
            Australia, there are at Sydney 14,000 tons, at Newcastle 7,000 tons and at Port Kembla
            2,200 tons. The cargo at Newcastle and Port Kembla consists mainly of steel and steel
            pipes urgently required in areas in Western Australia that experienced drought this
            year. The cargoes also include home-building materials urgently needed in Western
            Australia. It is no use making ships available to load at Sydney, Newcastle and Port
            Kembla unless they can take on cargoes for</para>

                    Western Australia only and proceed direct to Fremantle. The Minister for
          the Interior
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson),</inline>
                    who is at the table will
          understand the position perfectly, being a Western Australian. A considerable proportion
          of the 14,000 tons of cargo lying at Sydney is deck cargo, and has been on the wharfs for
          the past six months. It is mainly m road-making machinery and, owing to the delay in
          providing shipping to carry it, local governing authorities in Western Australia, who are
          the purchasers, will be penalized by having to pay the increased price approved by the
          Prices Commissioner in the meantime. I was speaking, a few moments ago, by telephone, to
          our liaison officer in Sydney, and he pointed out that, as soon as shipping is resumed,
          the first essential is to get vessels to load at Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla with
          cargoes for direct transmission to Fremantle.
                </para>
                <para>The position in Melbourne is a little worse than at New South Wales ports, because the
          accumulated cargo amounts to 25,000 tons. If it is transported by rail the manufacturers
          concerned have been authorized to charge the increased freight, as compared with sea
          freight, co the purchasers. That may be normal business practice, but it is hard on the
          people of Western Australia, who are being penalized because of action of a
          Communist-inspired union in New South Wales. The 25,000 tons of cargo at Melbourne
          includes 250 tons of spare parts for harvesting machinery. These are urgently required in
          Western Australia. As the Minister for the Interior is aware, harvesting is starting in
          that State now, and will he in full swing in two weeks. The cargo also includes 22
          headers, balers, hay presses and other machinery required at harvest time. I mention these
          commodities because every one appreciates the urgent need for them. It appears that a
          settlement of the dispute may be reached during the coming week-end, and I urge the
          Government to instruct the Department of Supply and Shipping to do everything possible to
          make vessels available at the various ports to load these cargoes' immediately for
          Western Australia. One " River " class steamer alone could shift the cargoes from
          Newcastle and Port Kembla, totalling 9,000 tons.</para>
                <para class="block">Two ships could clean up theback-lag in Sydney, and another two and a
          half or three ships at most could remove all available cargoes from Melbourne and
          Adelaide. Again I urgently request the Government to give serious consideration to this
          matter.</para>

                        .- I wish to speak for a few minutes about the serious plight of wheat-farmers in
            New South Wales in particular, and throughout Australia generally, who are facing to-day
            a grave shortage of cornsacks. Already protest meetings are being held. In my
            electorate, such meetings have been held at Forbes, Peak Hill and other wheat-growing
            centres. For the first time for many years, Australia is to have a " bumper "
            wheat crop ; yet the Government has allocated only one bag per bushel where there is a
            silo, and four bags per bushel where there is not a silo. The present wheat crop will
            break all records. An initial survey indicates that it will be between 110,000,000 and
            130,000,000 bushels, which is far in excess of anything harvested previously. Providence
            has been bountiful, but we cannot expect Providence to harvest and transport the crop,
            nor can we get away from the fact that under Commonwealth law, the Australian "Wheat
            Board has a complete monopoly of cornsacks. Theboard is the only authority that can
            import the sacks. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline>
                        directs the operations of the board, and therefore he has
            failed, and his Government has failed to make proper provision for this crop. The crop
            has not appeared suddenly overnight.We have known for many months that the harvest would
            be a record. The tragedy is that little can be done now. Bulk storage facilities are
            totally inadequate. The permanent silo accommodation is limited, and there is
            insufficient labour or materials to provide emergency silos which in normal timescould
            be constructed to take the overflow. Wheat farmers are too busy to do the job for which
            the Government is responsible. There has been a suggestion that baled hay storage
            accommodation could be used for wheat, but there is a lack of proper waterproofing to
            cover the baled hay. In addition, this type of storage accommodation cannot be proofed
            against mice, and finally, there is no flooring. Possibly, with extra trucks, the
            railways could carry an additional 6,000,000 or 8,000,000 bushels provided the wheat
            could be unloaded directly into the ships; but what assurance have we thatthose engaged
            in loading the ships will not be on strike? It would be quite useless for the railways
            to carry wheat to the ports unless there was some assurance that there would be no
            shipping strikes or hold-ups, and that the grain could be loaded directs into the ships.
            What is the Government doing about it? To clear up the uncertainty that exists
            throughout the country amongst wheat-growers, the Government must say definitely what
            quantity of bags is in store; what further allocations are to be made, and how soon :
            what shipments may be expected and will these arrive in time for the harvest; and
            whether it is prepared to send someone to India in an endeavour to obtain the maximum
            number of bags required to meet this emergency? Partial loss of the crop would be the
            greatest tragedy that Australia has faced in food production, particularly in view of
            the fact that northern hemisphere crops are far below last season's yield. A hungry
            world wants all that we can produce. If the Government cannot provide increased storage
            or more cornsacks, will it compensate the wheat-growers for the loss of their crop,
            grown, I remind honorable members opposite, under licence ?
