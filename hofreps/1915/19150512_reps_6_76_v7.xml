                <para class="block">A few words of mine will serve to commend the motion to honorable members. When our Expeditionary Force was  brought into existence, high hopes were entertained of the soldierly qualities of the men. It was thought that they would prove themselves as capable as any soldiers in any part of the world in the performance of whatever work might be allotted to them in the defence of their country. That they have acquitted themselves even better than the most optimistic among us anticipated is now common knowledge. With the special merits of their behaviour under fire I shall leave others to deal who are better qualified to express opinions on the subject. </para>
                <para>My particular desire at this moment is to convey to those who have been bereaved of brave relatives and friends, who have- died in the performance of that first of all the duties of citizenship, " the defence of the country to which they belong," the sympathy of this House, and of the Parliament. Such a widow or such a mother, in grieving her loss, will nourish a proud sorrow, solaced with the happiness of knowing that her beloved one gave his life to fulfil the duty that lay nearest to him. </para>
                <para>May I add the hope that every citizen who can engage in the great work of subduing the enemy, and winning an honorable peace, may feel it to be his bounden duty to give his services to his country without delay, so that the conclusion of the war may be brought about as speedily as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - I join cordially with my right honorable friend in seconding his motion of congratulation to our troops on the brave deeds which they have accomplished at the Dardanelles. There is not a healthy-minded Australian who does not walk with a more erect and happier step since the news of their deeds came to hand. That news made our pulses thrill. It verified our belief that our brave boys were worthy to stand alongside the seasoned troops of the Motherland. They have proved their prowess on a very hard-fought field. They have demonstrated - once more that they are boys of the bull-dog breed, and we are all proud of the race from which they have sprung, for there is no indication of decadence in the transplanted breed here in these Southern lands. We are gloriously glad that they have had this opportunity of proving to the Motherland what we owe to her, and of the opportunity given us to repay our obligations. This feeling, however, is mingled with one of sorrow for the relatives of those who have fallen, and yet - </para>

It is with that view that the Government, after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition in this matter, resolved to submit this motion. </para>
                <para>Speaking for myself, I would say that if warfare is to be carried on in the way it is being conducted at present by our enemies, civilization will have to organize and establish a court which will bring to justice those responsible for this violation of the rules of civilized warfare.

                <para>I hope that the House will carry this motion without qualification, and without hesitation, as a declaration that we strongly condemn the destruction of unarmed ships in this manner. The language is strong. "Wanton murder" is undoubtedly strong, but it is the term used by a jury of a judicial character which inquired into the deaths of some of those innocent passengers of the <inline font-style="italic">Lusitania</inline> whose bodies were recovered from the sea. The motion places on record the views of this House concerning that crime, and if any action is to follow, it behoves those who represent us to take such steps as may be necessary to bring to account those who have been responsible for such a crime against civilization. </para>

                        <para>- The enemy lays claim to culture, but surely it is a strange inversion of the generally accepted views of culture that such a crime should have been possible in this twentieth century. Rather than think of this as culture, I would call it a cancerous growth in our civilization, which must be cut out at all hazards if our civilization is to live. It is on a par with what the enemy have been doing recently in many other ways. All these outrages against the common instincts of humanity, even if it be war time, make us set our teeth harder and become more determined that this kind of warfare shall cease, and thai a standard of decent warfare shall be maintained. We are going to see this war through. All these violations of the laws of civilized warfare are so many demonstrations of the enemy's weakness; they prove most surely that we are fighting an outlaw, who subscribes to no standards but those of brute force. It is becoming apparent by this time to most of us that Germany has already lost in this war. But whatever may be the outcome, Germany has lost the respect of the civilized world, and she seems also to have lost her own honour and self-respect, otherwise she would not have resorted to this display of pure savagery. There can be no quarter for a nation like this until she has been beaten and humiliated to her knees, as she deserves to be, for the crimes she has committed against humanity. Germany is fighting not only the British nation and her Allies, but she is fighting humanity as a whole, and I am convinced humanity will win out in the end. </para>

The following works, which are wholly outside the city area, will be sufficient to keep the present men employed to the end of 1915 : - Completion of Cotter dam, channel, suction main', pump-house, £40,000; first section, of main sewer, £70,000; completion of Stromlo and Red Hill reservoirs, £20,000; completion of first kiln and commencement of second kiln, with plant, machinery, and brick works, £15,000; completion of electric power mains, £10,000; road maintenance, afforestation, fencing, rabbit destruction, &amp;c, £20,000. Total, £175,000. This is the work that is now being carried on. Probably more men will be employed there on works independent of those now proposed. </para>

                        <para>- We have arranged that the postage charge for newspapers is to be the same as that on newspapers sent from Australia to Great Britain. I do not know of any more complete system for the delivery of letters than that which has been carried out, but I am not surprised that some soldiers do not receive their letters, because there is now at Broadmeadows an immense number of letters lying unclaimed, for the reason that they have not been correctly addressed. The arrangements for forwarding newspapers and letters are very complete. They are sent to the particular section or unit at the front, where their delivery is in the hands of experienced postal officials, who, having joined the Expeditionary Forces, have been selected by the Defence Department for that work. If letters are properly addressed to the particular section, I cannot conceive how they can fail to be delivered. We can do nothing more at this end than has already been done, but I can, if necessary, make inquiries through the Defence Department to see what is being done at the other e.nd. Sending a letter addressed to a soldier: "Expeditionary Forces, Egypt," is of no use. It will not reach its destination. Full instructions have been issued notifying that the address must give details as to the soldier's unit, and so forth. </para>

The letters are sorted in Australia, and those addressed to each unit are put in separate bags, in order to insure their safe and quick despatch at the other end. </para>

                                <para>- Nothing better can be done at this end. The Minister of Defence is not responsible for what takes, place at the other end. I would point out that the location of our soldiers during the last eight or ten weeks has created difficulty, because many of our troops have been on transports, and have not had a chance to receive letters. If honorable members will have a little patience, no doubt everything will be right in the end. I can assure them that everything possible that can be done at this end is being done. </para>

In reply to that question. I may state that the Postmaster-General's officers advise that the officer in charge of the Port Adelaide  Radiotelegraphic  Station is Francis James Burgoyne. From particulars furnished to the Engineer of Radiotelegraphs on the 7th May, 1914, it appears that Burgoyne was born in Monmouthshire, England, on the 21st March, 1876. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burgoyne</inline> joined the Postmaster-General's Department in 1889, and has, therefore, had twenty-six years' service in the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware that inconvenience is being caused, as suggested by the honorable member. I was nearly put out of a tram in Sydney myself on that account. When the coin I had was sent to tire officer responsible for giving instructions, he did not take the same view as that taken by his subordinate. I agree with the suggestion conveyed in the honorable member's question; but the British Government have entered into an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government to withdraw only a certain amount of silver coinage each year. If there are more coins unduly worn than will make up the amount to be withdrawn, I do not think undue pressure should be applied at the present time. </para>

Action in this direction is, however, being hampered by the refusal of a number to accept transfers involving removal from Sydney, thirty-five having recently intimated their unwillingness to accept transfer under such conditions, preferring to wait the occurrence of vacancies in Sydney. It is not intended, in the meantime, to make any allowance in addition to their prescribed salary as telephonists, as there is no justification for paying them at a higher rate than other officers engaged on the same work. </para>

                        <para>- Some days ago, in speaking in this chamber, the Prime Minister used certain words of regret - perhaps of mild  reproach  - concerning my attitude towards him on a certain day, on the outbreak of the war. Amongst other things, he said that he had secret information from the Motherland which he could have communicated to me had he been asked to do so. I should like the right honorable gentleman to say whether he had information from the Imperial Government concerning matters relating to the outbreak of the war other than that which was communicated to His Majesty's responsible Government of the Commonwealth for the time being? </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable gentleman's statement of the facts is not accurate. I used no such words as those which he has attributed to me, but I did make a statement to the effect that I believed I could have assisted him in the way suggested. I waited purposely in Melbourne from Saturday night until 4 o'clock on Monday. I had no direct communication, and I was not entitled to have any, from the Imperial Government. But I was in possession of information which was known only to one other gentleman in Australia, and which we both thought might have been of some service to the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member's mind runs towards ladies. I am dealing with a question of much greater moment. I made no complaint at the time. I was putting in only a rejoinder to something said by the right honorable member for Parramatta. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, as he was quite entitled to do, met me when I arrived at Colac, and gave me certain information. He saw the Leader of the Government later. He motored down from Ballarat, and picked me up at Bacchus Marsh, and we came to town together. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the Minister representing the Minister of Defence can say how it is that no one can get information from the Defence Department? Months ago I wrote from Perth, and, I think, also telegraphed, to the Department in regard to the death of a son of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Crossley,</inline> asking at the same time for a reply to my communication. I received no reply. I wrote again a private letter to the Secretary, but I could get nothing out of the Department. The question I asked was what were the rules which had been agreed upon with respect to the relatives of soldiers who die before going to the front. This was the case of a man who died at Broadmeadows. Perhaps the Assistant Minister of Defence will undertake to facilitate a reply to my question? </para>

There was a lower tender, namely. that of the Automatic Bakeries Ltd.. at 13s. "3d. per 100 lbs. The tender of W.

                    <para>.- The right honorable gentleman has, I think, overlooked the fact that he got the permission of the House to go into Committee of Supply to consider the Estimates, Division No. 34. He is asking honorable members to deal with a new Bill, to which, of course, I take no exception; but I think that he had better be sure of his ground. We got the permission of the House for a particular purpose, but it is being used for another purpose. That is a very unusual course. </para>

                        <para>- I should think that the Minister of External Affairs would not be well after what he has been doing lately. He has certainly not been well mentally or politically; but I am sorry to hear that physically he is unwell. I considered - pending his arrival in the Chamber - that the old trouble, which arose before the departure of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to San Francisco, should have been ventilated in the House. It was only out of consideration for the feelings of the ex-Prime Minister that a number of honorable members on this side did not proceed to lay bare the secret history of that struggle. We were all hopeful that as the Cabinet had turned down the Minister of External Affairs, and had seen things with a larger gaze, we would not have had any attempt at vindictive treatment by the Minister of External Affairs of the late honorable member for Ballarat, once the leader of a Government in this country. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that the correspondence was made a public document, because it portrays the Minister of External Affairs in the worst possible attitude before the public of Australia. It shows him to be a small, bitter, narrow, prejudiced, revengeful man, against a big, broad man, whose shoe latchets he is not worthy to unloose. I hope that the honorable member will not mind me making these gentle remarks across the table. Some of us did not suspect that he would be guilty of this conduct. We thought that he would prove worthy of his position, having leaped twice into the shoes of a dead man. But, instead of that, as soon as he gained power he took a hold of this fallen giant, this stricken man, who for the third of a century had served this country, and whose name is honoured throughout its length and breadth, and endeavoured to humiliate him in a way quite unparalleled, thank God! in the history of Australia. I did not intend to refer to that matter, because I was hopeful that the Government would have been sufficiently ashamed of their conduct after the disgraceful episode to which I refer, and that it would not be repeated. They showed their worth at that particular time by turning the Minister of External Affairs down in the Cabinet. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard of a number of resignations, but if I was treated as the Minister of External Affairs was treated by his colleagues, whether the Caucus was behind me or not, I would say at once to my colleagues, " Gentlemen, as my recommendations have not been accepted, you must accept my resignation." If Ministers do not accept and act upon that view, we cannot have responsible government, or a proper respect for Cabinet solidarity. The Minister of External Affairs, apparently smarting under the lash of his colleagues' action, takes the first opportunity of getting level with the man he had already abused so much. That is really the position as it appears to us, and as " the man in the street" is viewing it. I wondered at the ex-Prime Minister going to the Panama </para>

                <para class="block">Exposition, even after the more generous conduct of the Cabinet. It occurred to me that his proper attitude would have been to say to the Government, " Gentlemen, I am extremely obliged to you for your vote of confidence, and your second invitation, but, after the treatment I have been subjected to by a Minister, I cannot think of representing Australia at the Exposition." However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> evidently had made up his mind that, being larger than the Minister of External Affairs, he could put his feelings in his pocket, and forget the cruel and slanderous attack of the honorable member; he was willing to give one more service to Australia, and away he went. I have read many newspapers published in the western States of America since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> arrived in California, and beyond the occasional misspelling of his name it is obvious that he has been received with respect and treated generously by the people there, and has done even better in his public utterances than in his present state of health we thought it likely that he would do. What is going to be the effect upon the people of America of the cavalier treatment which has led to the instantaneous resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin?</inline> When the Minister was asked to-day in charitable mood by one of his former colleagues to lake the House into his confidence in regard to this matter, he replied, "The time is not ripe." </para>

                        <para>- The Minister cannot claim originality for that, nor for any other phrase. The language used in his correspondence with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was borrowed from Billingsgate. The time for the making of an explanation is the present, when all the circumstances are fresh in our minds, not when everything is closed and forgotten. Surely, if the Minister has a good case, he will lay the papers on the table and say, " These are the reasons that impelled us to act as we did towards the delegation, and these are the feelings that we have in regard to the members of the delegation." In the first encounter of these unequally-matched adversaries, the Minister and the Prime Minister relied largely in their replies to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> on the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen;</inline> but to-day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> are together. Both consider their- honour and self-respect jeopardized by the action of the Minister, and have incontinently resigned their commissions in consequence of the affront to which they have been subjected. .Surely they have taken a right attitude. I knew something concerning the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> to the secretaryship of the Commission, and the beginnings of his work. I saw how successful he was at the start. He could be spared at that time from his duties in connexion with the Department of External Affairs because he was a junior. </para>

                        <para>- When first employed, he was getting a shade over £200 a year. Judging by the work that he did for the Commission in its early stages, he was wisely selected. There was a lot of difficult work to be done at first, and it was due largely to his delicate handling that conflicting State interests were reconciled. He was the only man who could be sent to San Francisco, and the only man of three who have gone abroad, and whose services are supposed to be indispensable to the Department, to be recalled. Permanent heads are notoriously unconcerned with political and diplomatic matters. When they said " We want this man back; will you recall him?" the Minister was only too glad to do it. He should have said, " At worst, this officer will be needed for only another six or eight weeks, when the return of the majority of the Commissioners will free him." The Minister should have paused, out of a sense of decency towards the men composing the Commission. The representatives of the States are mostly Ministers or ex-Ministers; and of all the men who played a prominent part in the early days of the Union, the representative of the Commonwealth took pride of place, and was pre-eminent in the public mind of the country. A feeling of decency - or, at least, of delicacy - should have caused the Minister to say, " I will not inflict cruelty on Alfred Deakin, a man who has retired from political life with honour, and who is performing gratuitously public service for the Commonwealth." From some of the correspondence emanating from Billingsgate some months ago, it might have been thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> is being paid heavily for his services. To my personal knowledge, he made great personal sacrifices in going to America, and receives nothing for his services beyond bare travelling and living expenses while away. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that he would not. He has probably undertaken more missions for the Commonwealth and the State of Victoria than any other public man who ever lived in Australia, and no man has performed his work more economically or has been more scrupulously exact in accounting for public money expended. The service that he is now performing is honorary, and he was called to it apparently in accordance with the unanimous desire of all parties of the people. If we may believe the provincial press of Victoria, which contains fuller particulars than the metropolitan journals, the Commission was not consulted about the recall of its secretary. A cable was not sent, asking " Can you spare <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward?"</inline> Had such a message been sent, the reply might have come that he would be free within a month or six weeks, and then any decent Minister would have said, " Suggest that he return then." Why was not such a message sent? Judging by the earlier correspondence, it was because the Minister takes the view that the Commission is a departmental body which must do his bidding. An office boy must not be more subservient to the views of the political head of the Department. That is an entirely wrong conception of the position of the Commissioners, and no other man in this House would take such a view. The Commissioners should be treated as a body of extra departmental men who are performing honorary services for the Commonwealth and the States, and therefore must be dealt with courteously, if not as equals. I do not suppose that the Minister can imagine any other man to be his equal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> however, is one who has borne all the political  honours that the people of Australia could confer upon one of their countrymen, and has declined titular honours times out of number, when they would have been thrust on him by universities and by sovereigns. Though some of us may differ from him in politics,  Ave  know that he is a man against whom no sneer or suggestion of dishonour will ever be made by contemporaries or historians. This bitter Minister must have a much lower estimate of him than we have; otherwise his treatment would not have been so cruel. T speak strongly, because for twenty years I have been in close personal contact in private and public life with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and looking at the matter calmly and dispassionately, I feel that the Minister of  External Affairs stands in a pitiful light over the business. I hope, however, that even now he will recognise his error, if it is not too late to retrieve the position, and that he will say to the Commissioners who have resigned, " "We made a blunder. Stay there - continue this Exposition work through to the end." </para>

                        <para>- The action in connexion with the secretary was an incident which any man who has had experience in departmental or political affairs would feel to be an affront. In all these Commissions, Royal or otherwise, a wise Government acts in conjunction with the  chairman.  If an officer has to be appointed, the  chairman  has as much to do with it as the Minister. When an officer was appointed to take up the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> no other man was sent, but a man on the other side of the Pacific was selected to carry on the work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was probably apprised  of the man who was selected, and advised fl'it he would take up the secretarial duties. If we may judge by the reports, it was at that particular time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> joined in agreement upon the matter and resigned. There is something to me very significant in the resignation of these two Commissioners when the new officer was suggested. Why was this? Did they deem him unfit because of his qualifications or antecedents to conduct the work of the Commission? These are the things upon which we are in the dark at present, and upon which we are entitled to some explanation, and in this quiet way I am inviting the Minister to give this Committee the information. I hope that in all I have said I have exercised due restraint, but I would like a chance to deal with a man like the Minister of External Affairs in regard to this matter. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of External Affairs is uneasy, and he feels the harpoon of criticism when it is under his skin. He is exhibiting evidence of the shattered remains of a guilty conscience though I do not suppose that his conscience is equal to the full discharge of its official work, or he would long ago have registered his penitence in this House. I hope he will give us a full explanation. I shall have something further to say anon, lt seems to me that the Minister must be judged only by what is published, and viewing the matter in that light he stands in a most inglorious position. </para>

                    <para>. - I think I shall be best consulting the wishes of this Chamber by avoiding the shocking example of vituperation to which we have just been treated. I have nothing to say derogatory to the  Chairman  of th"i Panama Exposition, who occupied  a seat in this House for so many  years  and with whom I was as much assorted as the eulogist who ran away from his former constituents to get- a safe seat in this House. If there was any doubt as to the wisdom of the course I have adopted, it has been removed by the speech of the honorable member. </para>

It must have been clear to the House that it was not the benefit of the Public Service or the welfare of Australia that concerned him.

I admit that the correspondence with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was of a lively character, but I claim, also, that it was called for. Now. here are the facts: Immediately after taking office I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> for a statement of the position. I had a perfectly open mind regarding the Panama Exposition, and did not care whether he went on or not. I simply asked for a statement of the position of affairs, and I received a document eloquently detailing all the advantages of proceeding. But the important fact that a member of the Commission then in San Francisco had strongly advised Australia to pull out, because the Exposition was merely " an American show," was concealed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> gave that advice in several successive cablegrams, and also in a lengthy letter. </para>

For, of course, had we known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Niel</inline> sen's view, we should not have gone on. He was the one man in a position to judge. Yet we have not heard one word from the last  speaker  on this vital point. He gave the House a bitter, black-blooded, partisan speech reeking with the "blatherskite" so often heard at Essendon </para>

You have just ruled, sir, that you could not accept my motion that the words be taken down, because debate had intervened before I submitted it. I wish to point out that I rose as soon as the opportunity was afforded me. I was not seen by the  Chairman,  however, and several points of order were taken. Do you rule that the taking of those points of order constituted a debate that intervened between the using of the words of which I complained - and of which I asked that official notice should be taken - and the submission of my motion? </para>

                        <para>- The issues involved in this matter are very simple. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> for a statement of the case, to assist the Government in determining whether we should proceed with the proposed representation of Australia at the Exposition, in view of the outbreak of the war, and of the fact that three of the contributing States had retired from, the project. I naturally expected tha.t this statement, which was a very full one, would contain all material facts bearing on the matter. The honorable member for Balaclava has by interjection suggested that the departmental file was open to me. As the Committee is aware, however, it was only a few hours after I took over the administration of the Department that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> statement was submitted to me. Files in reference to extra-departmental Commissions do not usually come before the Minister. I believe that my honorable friend, the honorable member for Angas, who held office as Minister of External Affairs, has seen very few of them. </para>

                        <para>- The permanent head of the Department would not read the correspondence on these matters. A secretary had been appointed, and the whole matter apparently had been turned, over to the Commissioners. I think the Prime Minister will bear me out that it was after considering the document submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and upon my solicitation, the Cabinet eventually and unwillingly agreed to be represented at the Exposition. Matters went on, and some months afterwards I saw a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen,</inline> who was associate Commissioner with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> at San Francisco, to the Prime Minister, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> corrected a statement which the Prime Minister had made, and which had appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> This letter was the first clue I had to the concealment of the advice which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> had given, and thereupon I wrote a letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> asking for an explanation as to why this fact had not been included in the document submitted to me in September. </para>

                        <para>- Although I had reason to complain of want of candour on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> I felt that, as there had been an implied obligation on our part, and which was created by the previous Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> should represent us. Hence it was on my proposition that the Cabinet decided to renew the invitation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to go to San Francisco. Honorable members can see for themselves what ground there is for the passionate invective of the honorable member for Balaclava to-day. However, I pass it by, in order to say a few words in regard to the tabling and printing of the papers. The papers had to be laid on the table in connexion with the correspondence of another Commission, and were part of that matter. As they were of public interest, I thought it right that they should be laid on the table and printed for circulation among official documents. I have nothing further to say except that, in the exercise of my right, this being merely a departmental Commission, and in the interests of economy and the public welfare, I decided to recall <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> from San Francisco and appoint some one else to carry on the work. </para>

                    <para>.- I did not know this matter was coming on to-day, but it is only right that I should say something about the Panama Exhibition, as I happened to be the Minister concerned when the proposal was taken up. A few weeks after I took office - in 1913 - I read through a large file dealing with this Exhibition, in which I found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harcourt</inline> or the authorities at </para>

                <para class="block">Homo had requested that we should decide this matter quickly. I do not know whether my predecessor in office read through that large file or not, but I saw no evidence that there had been any haste on the part of those who preceded me in deciding this question. I went carefully through the file, made a digest of material parts of it for my own information, and came to the conclusion that if we could get a better estimate than either of the two estimates supplied to my predecessor, a matter of such international importance should be decided at once. I made a recommendation to Cabinet accordingly. The original estimate, if I remember correctly - the honorable member will be able to correct me by looking at the file - was about £150,000, but there was a lower one, amounting to about £100,000. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that the Minister has not seen the main files dealing with this matter. I have read them all up to the time I left office. There was one file, examination of which might occupy half a day - the original file - in which the last Government, and the Government before the last, were asked to come to a decision. As the matter had been in abeyance for eight or ten months - I think there was a request about July, 1912, for a decision on the part of the Commonwealth Government on this matter - I went into the subject at once, and came to the conclusion, if the lowest estimate of £100,000 could be reduced, that perhaps the proposal was one in which we ought to join, even though the Imperial Government did throw it up. Following this came the suggestion that the States might join, and that a joint responsibility to the extent of about £80,000 should be undertaken. The Cook Government accepted this proposal,  and  decided to contribute £20,000 towards the total expenditure. During this time I was directly conversant with the file, and with" what was going on. I saw some of the State Ministers myself, and I took the chair on behalf of the Commonwealth at any meeting held for the purpose of drawing up some definite plan of operation. </para>

                        <para>- The officers of the Department will tell you it is so. If he looks, the Minister will find some of the minutes actually drafted in my own hand writing - if he can read it; I find some difficulty myself. May I give him one instance? I remember that, in February, 1913, there was a meeting in my office at the Department of External Affairs one Saturday afternoon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> was there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hagelthorn</inline> was there, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was also there. I drew up about ten propositions, which were grouped together, as the basis of the arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. I had typed a copy of that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> lent every assistance in his power then. We determined upon taking part in the Exhibition, and 1 think it was in September that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> at our request, accepted the position of  President  of the Commission. There was no appointment of a Royal Commission. There was simply a meeting of the representatives of the States for the purpose of arranging preliminaries, and an intimation, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> of the appointments that were made as State and Commonwealth representatives. That was in the September before we left office. </para>

                        <para>- August or September; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was told as early as March that the Cabinet desired him to accept the office. He took it; but I told him, as he probably would not leave until the following January, that there was no necessity to give him anything like <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> official appointment. Everything at that, time was to be informal. Matters went on from week to week and month to month. Meetings were held in Melbourne, and I was always present until I thought the time had come for making business arrangements - for collecting the exhibits, and making arrangements about sending them away; for communicating with the authorities at Panama itself, so that everything might be done on business lines as between those who were to represent us as an Australian body, while they were here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen,</inline> who, with others, was representing us at San Francisco. I can assure the Minister that right through all this time, either by personal attendance at the meetings or by report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> who was an officer at the Department of External Affairs, after each meeting, I was perfectly cognisant of what was being done. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry the Minister has allowed appearances to raise a suspicion in his mind. I do not for one moment say that the Minister should have known all the facts contained in the files in his office, but I do say that, rightly or wrongly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> might have assumed that he knew more of the facts than he did, as he was aware that I had investigated the matter closely, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> had been in communication with the Department as well as with the Commission. He might have thought that every matter that came before the Commission had also come before the Department, and that the departmental officers might have kept him in touch with everything that was being done. I am not deciding the matter as between the Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I am not going to decide that point, but I wish the Committee to be fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin. Mr. Deakin</inline> somewhat reluctantly went. The Prime Minister asked him to accept the position, and he asked me to give him time to consider. There were considerations against his acceptance, and he told me that if he did accept it would be desirable that he should come back after three or four months, and that he did not want to put the Commonwealth to the expanse of his continuous residence; that as soon as he found matters could go along without his personal supervision, it might be necessary and desirable for him to come back. The Minister will find that this is the fact. I am sure that he will accept my <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in the matter, when I state that the suspicion that has been raised by the correspondence is not justified, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has no personal motive in concealing anything. I put that to the Minister as a fair interpretation of the facts. We pressed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> into the position. We pressed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to take the position, and it was with some reluctance that he accepted it. As to the expenses of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> I may say that he is a good officer, who has been our representative at Home, and also the representative of the States at the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908, so it will be seen that he has very large experience of how to conduct such undertakings. He was our chief advertising officer, and, in order to save expense, I got him to arrange all the advertising material at his disposal for use in America. As the Minister probably knows, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> prepared a rather elaborate pamphlet for circulation abroad. There were a good many applications for the position of advertising agent, but I refused to make any appointment, seeing that it would run into a great deal of money. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> amongst the officers of the Department, was the most qualified man to send away; and I may say that, he was paid only his salary and expenses. As to the expenses, the only standard we had was that afforded by the payments made by the States to their, officers in San Francisco. The New South Wales Trade Commissioner had, I think, a fixed salary and £2 a day expenses. </para>

In the case of Victoria, the salary paid was £400, and travelling expenses at 25s. a day, and the advice I got was that 25s. a day was, on the whole, reasonable, in view of the cost of residence in San Francisco during the period of the Exposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> was paid no allowance for the time occupied in travelling from Australia to America. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to refer to the case of Jeremiah Melbourne, a member of the Second Australian Light Horse. While this man was at Broadmeadows Camp, his mother every week received an allowance out of his pay; and when he left for Egypt he made an order that this payment was to be continued. However, information regarding this man ceased, and the mother, becoming somewhat alarmed, made inquiries at the Department. It is nearly three months since the Department was first approached, and it then transpired that this man had apparently been lost sight of. My reason for bringing the case up now is that the following letter was received only to-day from the Department : - </para>

                <para class="block">That is all the information that has been obtained up to the present time, beyond an admission, at an earlier stage, from the Department that, in the case of a number of men who left for Egypt on, I believe, the 22nd December, no list bad been kept, and that the Department waa awaiting a proper roll from Egypt before anything could be done. There appears to be room here for a very vigorous protest. It seems singular, from a military point of view, that a number of men could be sent from Australia with no proper detailed list of their <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline> I do not know what to do in order to expedite matters. The Assistant Minister of Defence has suggested that I should place a question on the notice-paper for to-morrow; but the only result of that would be, in a month's time, a reply in almost identical terms with that of to-day, and I am not disposed to do anything of the kind. </para>

In quite a number of instances the Department has had to be stirred up to enable the relatives of soldiers who have gone to the front to receive the wages which have been allocated to them. Unfortunately the Minister representing the Assistant Minister of Defence is not in the chamber at the present moment. But the Minister of Trade and Customs ought to Be able to assure us that he will immediately have the case of this man inquired into, with a view to a proper statement being made to his relatives. </para>

                    <para>.- I would not have spoken but for the attitude of the Minister of Trade and Customs towards the honorable member for Echuca. When he made his half-satirical reply to the honorable member, did he realize that there is an aged woman, with one foot in the grave, who is anxiously waiting to hear what has become of her son? Does he recognise what her feelings must <inline font-style="italic">he,</inline> seeing that she can obtain no information from the Department? Certainly they are not a cause for merriment, or for the sneers of some honorable members opposite. I do hope that the Minister will see that the honest thing is done by this woman, who has brought a man and a soldier into the world. </para>

                        <para>- I think that in a matter so simple I could have stated that the right thing would be done. There is no difficulty in the way. But do not let us make sport of the feelings of an old woman who is anxiously awaiting tidings of her lost son. I come now to another matter. To-day the Minister of External Affairs undertook to give certain information in regard to murders in Papua. I want that information to set out the callings of the men who have been murdered by natives. Within the last month or two prospectors in Papua have suffered to an unprecedented extent at the hands of murderous natives. In my humble judgment, this is entirely due to the extraordinarily protracted delays which have occurred in bringing to trial natives accused of capital offences. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that in quite a number of cases recruits for our Expeditionary Forces, after having been passed as fit for service by the medical practitioner in the particular town from which they hail, have, upon re-examination in the city, been rejected as unfit. In some instances these men have sacrificed their employment on the strength of their having successfully passed an examination by the local doctor. Any recruit who had successfully emerged from such an ordeal would be justified in concluding that he would be accepted for service when he presented himself at the barracks for enrolment. But quite a number of these recruits have suffered a bitter, and sometimes a cruel, disappointment when, on subsequent examination in the city at the hands of a medical officer, they have been rejected. I hope that this matter will be brought under the notice of the Minister of Defence, and that means will be devised to prevent a repetition of the disappointment which has been experienced by numerous young men from the country. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member has touched upon a question which I had intended to bring before this Chamber at the earliest opportunity. To me it seems an infamy that men who are burning with the desire to serve their country on the battlefields of Europe, after having been passed as fit for service by a qualified medical officer appointed by the Defence Department, and after having been quartered at the Broadmeadows Camp for some weeks, should be rejected on the ground that their teeth are not in order. </para>

                        <para>- In many instances these men have sacrificed their employment to come to the city for the purpose of undergoing military training. In such circumstances, I am of opinion that the Department should defray the expenses which they have incurred. I have in my mind the case of one man who broke up his home in Melbourne, and was in camp at Broadmeadows for eight weeks before he was finally rejected as unfit for service.  His  wife sold the pony and trap with which he had been accustomed to earn his livelihood. This woman has five children by her second marriage, in addition to one son, who is already serving at the front. I say that the rejection of her husband, after he had broken up his home, so that his wife might reside with her own people during his absence, is an infamy. To-day the whole family are in want. When such cases can occur it is unmistakable evidence of a lack of efficiency somewhere. I am sorry that the honorable member for Grampians is not present, because I am sure that he would indorse my remarks. To the honour of the dentists of this city, they have offered to form a dental corps at the front for the purpose of attending to the teeth of the members of our Expeditionary Forces, and I am assured that medical jealousy alone is responsible for the non-acceptance of that offer. If there were dentists out at the camp, they would be in a position to save the teeth of many of the men. Their offer should have been accepted, and no feeling of jealousy on the part of any person should have been allowed to prevent its acceptance. </para>

                        <para>- I think that they might, very well have been sent there. There is another matter of importance which I wish to bring under the notice of the Committee. I am sorry to say that, by insisting upon the observance of an old rule established in Victoria, the Education Department of the State is compelling the resignation of every lady teacher who honours a soldier going to the front by becoming his wife. Such a rule might very well bo suspended at a time like the present, especially in such a case as the one to which I refer, where the children attending the school at Toolangi, near Healesville, are deprived of the opportunity of being taught by the enforced resignation of the teacher. I should be glad if honorable members would assist me to bring under the notice of the Government the injustice of the course which is being followed. </para>

                    <para>. - I suppose it will be generally contended that it is, to a certain extent, a waste of time to attempt to ventilate particular cases in connexion with the work of the Defence Department in this chamber. But, until the Department establishes some tribunal before which these cases may be brought, honorable members will have to continue to waste time in this way. I have a case to bring under notice to-day, because there is no other way in which I can have it ventilated. The first duty of a soldier is, of course, obedience, and the punishments inflicted for offences in the Army and Navy may appear to be severe to a civilian. It will, however, be granted that the Army and Navy authorities are not justified in inflicting a punishment which will make a man for the rest of his life a burden on society. A soldier has written to me from Osborne House making certain complaints. I am aware that he has been guilty to a degree, but the condition of health in which he is left as the result of the punishment inflicted upon him does not reflect any credit on our civilization, and certainly not upon the common sense of the men who had charge of him.

                    <para>I have been returned to Australia suffering from valvular disease of the heart, which, I consider, was brought about by ill-treatment received aboard H.M.A. Troop-ship <inline font-style="italic">Orvieto.</inline> On 14th November, 1914, I was brought before Colonel Wanliss, 5th Battalion Infantry, charged with my first offence, the first being leaving parade without permission, and the second being refusing an order of a corporal. In the second charge my defence was that the corporal was ill-using my greatcoat, to which I objected, and refused to allow him to have it, as I was responsible for it. </para>

                    <para>On both charges I was found guilty, and sentenced to eighteen days' detention - nine days for each charge, and these my first offences. I was taken before Captain Lind, Medical Officer, 5th Battalion, who sounded my heart and other organs, and was then taken to the stokehole, where I worked six hours per day during my detention, right through the tropics. Having finished work, I was conducted to the cells, and slept on iron laths, with no mattress, and only two blankets. In another cell constructed for one, two men were confined, one sleeping on the concrete deck, with no mattress. During my time of detention, I was never taken above decks for exercise or fresh air, but was taken between decks to the stokehole, and brought up the same way. I had never done any such strenuous work before. My time expired the day previous to arrival in Egypt, 4th December, and on the morning of 6th December I was sent to Mena Hospital, where Captain Todd found I was suffering from  encarditis  I was detained in the hospital the whole time we were in Egypt, and on being examined by the Medical Board I was told I was suffering from valvular disease of the heart, and had been recommended for discharge as permanently unfit. Previous to enlisting, I was examined by two doctors, and also hold a medical certificate from a doctor in England dated February, 1914, stating that my organs were all sound. Captain Lind is also prepared to state that I was quite sound before working in the stokehole. I must also state that, before leaving Egypt, I examined my pay-book, and found that £ 5 8s. had been deducted for the time I was compelled to work in the stokehole. </para>

Seeing that so many cases of this character have been reported, some body or board, removed from the peculiar feeling which surrounds military and naval men, ought to be appointed to investigate them. It is not too much to ask that such an investigation should take place. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the honorable member will admit that a statement of that sort, going forth in a democratic community, will give rise to a feeling of horror in the minds of many persons. If the charges brought against the authorities are correct, we ought to devise some means of preventing the infliction of punishment which will make a man a physical wreck. The man whose case I am ventilating is at Osborne House, Geelong, and, according to his statement, he is likely to be in hospital there for some time. Honorable members on this side have presented cases to the House. It seems a waste of time that we should have to ventilate such matters here, when there is a great amount of other work waiting to be done. But we have no other means at our disposal. It is impossible to get wrongs rectified by the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, as he has not told me. But I know that in the Department a man is required to send a communication through his superior officer. During my time in the House I have known fifty cases where a communication has been kept back, and the information has not reached the Minister. I have proved that to two Ministers of Defence, but nothing has been done in the matter. For instance, a man in the Naval Department wished to ventilate a grievance because he had been unjustly punished. He endeavoured to reach the Minister, but he was unable to succeed. I have tried to get the wrong redressed, but so far nothing has been done. Fancy a case like the one mentioned by the honorable member for Echuca being brought up here! Yet there are numerous cases of men who have left good positions and have been passed by the local doctor, but who have been told by the Department that they were not wanted. I know four men who were accepted under conditions which were right at the time. They had to make an arrangement to leave their work; they had to give their employer a chance, but by the time they were ready to go, new regulations had been brought in, and the men found that they were not wanted then. In regard to the question of teeth, at one time the Department would accept a man if he had a full upper set of artificial teeth; but after a certain time the Department revoked the regulation, and dozens of men who in the transitory stage had left their places of employment, were rejected. I cannot go into the question of teeth. There are medical men who ought to know" what is desirable in that regard, and cases ought to be dealt with on their merits. It is not possible to get wrongs redressed by military officers, and therefore we have to bring these matters up here whether we like it or not. I ask Ministers to see if they cannot establish some board or court where men who have been dismissed from the Defence Department can get their grievances considered, otherwise we shall have to continually waste the time of the House in ventilating them. </para>

                        <para>- Not to fill the vacancies which have occurred recently, but ordinary vacancies. I believe that there is in existence a regulation which precludes any officer under the age of twenty-three years from going to the front. I know of one case - probably there are others - where an officer had made every preparation to leave, but, owing to the regulation, his services could not be accepted. I believe that we should have the best men we can possibly get to act as officers. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to that point. I do not agree with the contention that a man under that age is not capable as an officer. If a board can examine the privates, it can also examine the officers who are willing to go, and who are under twenty-three. If the board find men suitable, there is no reason why they should not be permitted to go as officers. The system has only been in operation a short time, and most of the young officers have grown up with it, and although they have not yet reached the age of twenty-three years, it will be found that very many of them are more capable of acting as officers than are others who are thirty or forty years of age. The sending of inexperienced men is quite another question; but. if young men can prove that they possess the necessary judgment, and have had sufficient experience to fit them for the position of officer, why should they not be allowed to go, seeing that they have passed the examination and hold a commission ? I ask the Minister to give this matter his serious consideration. I believe that, in very many cases, it will be found that some of the best officers we have have not yet reached the age of twenty-three years. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to reflect- to a matter I raised in a question some time ago, and that was about accepting as recruits " those who otherwise would have been sent to prison. I noticed that in a case where two young fellows were about to be sentenced to imprisonment for housebreaking, the Judge said that if the Defence Department would accept them as recruits, he would not pass sentence on them. I do not desire to be hard on those who have been in prison ; there are some in gaol who ought not to be there, and some out of gaol who ought to be there. And when an offender has served his term of imprisonment, he ought not to be ruthlessly pursued. But it is a serious thing for Judges to allow criminals to go scot free on condition of volunteering for the front. Of course I do not refer to cases like that of the young fellow who opened a letter in the Wyong post-office. I am quite with Justice Backhouse in his remarks on that case. The cases that I have in mind are those like that of two young men who were convicted for housebreaking, and a more recent case to which I drew attention. On Saturday last, when I was saying good-bye to some men and officers who were leaving for the front, one of the officers said to me, " As I am in the King's uniform, I must not talk politics; but I wish to tell you that we read the question that you asked in Parliament about permitting criminals to volunteer, and wo are glad that you asked it. We trust that you will follow the matter up, because it is a reflection on decent fellows that criminals should be allowed to join the ranks." I know that in one tent at Broadmeadows a man borrowed the private overcoat of a fellow soldier, promising to return it shortly, but, instead of doing so, he went into town, stayed there for a couple of days, and came back without it. Then he tried to borrow the overcoat of another of his comrades, and as this one objected, took it without permission, and left it in town. . Finally, he deserted. Quite a number of men have deserted just prior to the time fixed for their departure. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. If criminals are told that they may escape imprisonment by volunteering, they may join for two or three months, robbing their comrades, as in the case I have mentioned, and then desert. The Assistant Minister told me that it was for the Minister to decide whether men who would otherwise be punished by the Courts should be allowed to enlist. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that, and I wish to know what he intends to do to prevent it. Will he state publicly that these men shall not be permitted to join the Force? When a man offers to join, he is asked whether he has been convicted or not; but the men to whom I refer could, I suppose, declare that they had not been" convicted, because they had not been sentenced. The overwhelming majority of those who have volunteered are the pick of our young manhood, and are going to the front actuated by the highest and best motives, but there are some who have volunteered merely for their own ends, and desert a few days before the time for leaving, comes. I should like to know what is being done in cases of desertion. I know that of ten men in one tent, two did not embark when the unit to which they belonged was sent away. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. They draw pay for two or three months. I spent a night at Broadmeadows, and next morning was present when two or three men were brought before the Lieut.  -Colonel. One  of these was charged with breaking a regulation. He had written to the Lieut. -  Colonel saying  frankly that he had no idea that he would be sent away so soon. Apparently he had broken the regulation to get himself dismissed. The Lieut.  -Colonel, however,  treated the matter very wisely. He gave the young fellow a lecture, telling him that the regulations must be obeyed, and saying that he trusted that he would not again disobey them. </para>

                    <para>.- The complaints about the non-delivery of letters addressed to the troops in Egypt are general. I am constantly receiving letters from constituents who have sons at the front, complaining that their letters are not delivered. The Postmaster-Gene-  ral to-day stated that he thought that letters were not delivered because they were insufficiently addressed; but I write to some of the men at the front, including a brother, and my letters have been addressed in accordance with the departmental regulations. Only yesterday I had a letter saying that they had had no word for several weeks, and then all the letters came in a bunch. These are specific instances in which the regulations concerning the addressing of the letters had been observed in fullest detail. The regimental numbers had been given, the troop, squadron, the regiment, Expeditionary Force, first or second, as the case might be, and the word "Egypt." They were fully addressed, as stipulated by the Defence Department, and yet those letters did not reach the men for several weeks. In some cases, as far as I know, they have not been received yet. The letter I received was dated 4th April, and stated that no letters had been received for several weeks. I know that letters were written regularly, because I have written to privates in the ranks myself, and I feel, therefore, that there must be a great deal of substance in the complaints which have been voiced in the press. I hope that the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Defence will try to get at the root of the trouble. If, as the Minister representing the Minister of Defence stated, the letters are sorted according to their regiments and division, and so on, in Australia, the presumption is that the trouble is at the other end. </para>

                        <para>- One was in the Light Horse. So far as we know, those men had not moved from Egypt. At all events, that is the presumption, because there has been no casualties among them : and if they had not been moved from Egypt, there was all the more reason why they should have received the letters. There is one other matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs. I refer to the position with regard to the export of butter from New South Wales to the other States. </para>

                        <para>-  And I know that it is being done particularly in regard to butter. My constituency happens to be right on the border of New South Wales and Queensland, and, owing to the action of the New South Wales Government, my constituents find themselves unable to export butter to Queensland, where the price is 192s., as against 124s. in Syd- . ney. At all events, that was the price at the time I refer to. We are only 100 miles from Brisbane, and 400 miles from Sydney, and yet we are unable to take advantage of the Brisbane market. My constituents, in common with all the different parts of Australia, have suffered by this restrictive legislation of the New South Wales Parliament. They are also suffering from the prevailing drought, and their returns have been cut down to less than half what they were formerly. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that my district has not suffered quite so badly as others, but I want to point out that the scarcity of butter has not been brought about by the war. It is due entirely to drought conditions, and it seems to me that it is the duty of the Minister of Trade and Customs to ascertain what is being done by New South Wales. I conceive that the Minister in his official! capacity is the guardian of the rights of all the citizens of Australia. I do not see why the State of New South Wales  should be allowed to adopt a dog-in-the manger policy by refusing to allow an increase in price in that State, and prohibit exportation. In many instances my constituents are working fifteen or sixteen hours a day, and yet they are barely earning enough to make a living. In some cases they are unable to pay their rent, and a great many cannot keep their cows alive owing to the high price of fodder. It is costing the farmers in some instances 2s. and 3s. a pound to produce butter, and yet they are unable to take advantage of the Australian market owing to the attitude of the New South Wales Government. Surely, it is the duty of the Minister of Trade and Customs to inquire into this matter. </para>

                        <para>- They do. The honorable member will find that fair and reasonable wages are paid in my district. Unfortunately, at the present time scores of the farmers are carrying on at a loss, and in cases where they are losing their cattle it is utterly impossible to replace them. Once they lose their cattle they lose their livelihood for many years to come. In these circumstances, they should be entitled to get for their product what is the fair market price in Australia. The scarcity of butter has not been caused by the war. On several occasions the price of butter has reached very nearly its present level; but never before in my time in Australia has a drought been so widespread throughout the dairying districts as is that of to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but I am dealing more particularly with the dairying districts. Some of the dairying districts of New South Wales were in good heart during the whole of the great drought of 1902. The principal dairying districts did not do quite as well as they have done during certain other periods, but they certainly did not have a bad time. This year, however, the position is different. With the exception of one very small part of the State, the drought has been severely felt in the dairying districts. </para>

It is true, as the honorable member for Gwydir has suggested, that an excellent season was experienced from August to December, but from January until last week practically no rain fell. That period covers the flush of the year, when a great number of cows come into milk, and the farmers rely on that particular part of the season for returns to nay their rent, and to enable them to keep their head? above water. </para>

                        <para>- No; very few had enough money when they started to enable them to employ any one. I shall not argue this phase of the question with the honorable member at the present moment; other opportunities will offer for its discussion. I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to inquire from those who, to a very large extent, control the butter industry of the State, if the position is not as I have stated. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to submit to the Assistant Minister of Defence a proposal which, I am sure, having regard to his own ample proportions, will receive his unqualified sympathy. We have in this community many men who are described as " bantams," and who are anxious to go to the front, but who, because their height is below a certain standard, are denied the right to do so. In respect of the Lancashires, and something like twenty other British regiments, the standard has been reduced so as to allow men to go to the front who are less than 5 ft. 4 in. in height. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. About 70,000 of those who volunteered in Great Britain to go to the front shortly after the war broke out were denied the right to do so because, although they were physically fit, they were below the standard height. We have big, stout hearts beating in the breasts  of  many men  of  small stature. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. At a time like this, when there is a call from all parts of the Empire, I think it is unfair that the' smaller men of the community should be denied the right to assist in fighting the Empire's battles. Some  of  our most brilliant generals - some of those who have conducted the biggest of our campaigns- have been very small men.  I would ask the Minister whether there is not some way of getting over this difficulty. Seeing that in the case of certain British regiments the standard height has been reduced to 5 ft. 1 ir.,, can we not do the same here? </para>

                        <para>- Very useful indeed. I read, recently, a statement to the effect that the Minister of Defence had suggested that the smaller men could not keep step with the bigger men, and that the trenches in many cases would be too deep for them. I do not think such an argument will bear a moment's investigation. I hope that our " bantams " will have an opportunity to show their mettle. I am confident that if the opportunity offers they will acquit themselves quite as well as, and possibly do better than, some who, by reason of their greater height and breadth, present a substantial target to the enemy. I am sure that the Minister, having regard to his own ample proportions, will have sympathy with my proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - Though it is not my intention to attack the Minister of External Affairs over the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> resignation, because I think the blame should go further back, I do not, of course, exculpate him from blame. I think that he should share it in connexion with the Cabinet, of which he is a member; and, as I said this afternoon, I cannot help thinking that if ever a man has been treated scurvily by a Government, that man is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin. But we must go further back than this incident. It will be recollected that, during the term of the last Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was appointed to another Commission, along with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> and the terms of the Commission were made specially wide, in order to permit it to be practically the eyes and ears of the Government, to be a sort of outlook for the Government in connexion with all matters  coming to the surface during the war, and so that the Government could give the Commissioners any special duties which might crop up, or call on them to undertake any special investigations which we might wish them to make in connexion with the war. What happened? First of all, the Commissioners inquired into this and that commodity, and made recommendations concerning it, and then all at once their services were not required. It appears that " there was nothing for them to do." The present Government, with the tremendous business knowledge that every one knows it possesses, with its wonderful and varied assortment of ability, deemed itself capable of running the world, let alone Australia, and so it completely ignored and set aside the Commission, took no notice whatever of its recommendations, issued proclamations without reference to it, and finally squeezed the Commissioners out of the positions which they had filled with so much distinction and ability in the stress of war and the multitude of other engrossments now forgotten. Papers which lie on the table bear witness to the excellent work they did and the amount of consummate ability they pressed into it. I venture to say that no one in the House who knows <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson will deny that, for an all-round business man, it is doubtful whether he can be excelled in Australia. I have never met a man with a more varied knowledge and a greater, broader, and saner outlook upon life and business matters generally. Yet this man who, without fee or reward was' prepared to give his services to the country in its time of stress and strain, has been set aside, and another gentleman, about whose qualifications I have not a word to say in derogation, has been appointed, at  a  big salary, to do the same work.

                        <para>- My friend, unfortunately, does not know the facts, whereas I do know them. My colleagues in the last Government, who are in the chamber, know what we appointed that Commission to do. They know the terms under which it was appointed, and I say that we did not appoint it merely to inquire into exports and imports. We appointed it to do anything that the Government saw fit to give it to do in connexion with the war. That was the beginning of all this trouble. Now we have the second dose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> is getting at the hands of the present Government. He got the dirty kick-out the first time, and they have made it impossible for him to continue in his office on the second occasion. If ever a man has been treated scurvily by a Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin has been  at  the hands of this Government. And for what? If there is an unselfish man in Australia it is the same Alfred Deakin; notoriously throughout his life not a self-seeker, desiring only to 'serve his country ; certainly doing nothing which would make his country one whit poorer or worse monetarily for his services;  all  his life particular upon these" points of honour and emoluments. Why, then, is this man turned away in this unseemly manner; an old public servant, who has served his country well, given up his own interests to do so; who is practically a poor man to-day; who has sacrificed his health - I think it is not too much to say so - finely-drawn and finely-balanced as he is. Every one knows the mental strain which his public life has always involved ? And here is his reward for it all. To be humiliated and degraded by this Government. It is time some one spoke out about this kind of treatment. </para>

Just this, and only this : that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> gave him a memorandum showing the present position of affairs connected with Panama, and omitted this one particular, which the Minister says is an important particular. I wonder what is so important about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neilsen</inline> was one of the members of the Commission assisting in this matter, and yet, somehow, an expression of opinion on the part of this one member of the Commission is regarded by my honorable friend as the most important of them all. </para>

That is the very first thing that any reasonably-minded Minister should have done - to have asked the  Chairman  of this Commis-sion to talk matters over in his office. Instead of doing that, the Minister got hold-  of this memorandum. So far as we know, no conference took place, but there at once began an epistolary correspondence of  a  very violent character by my honorable friend, who wanted to know this, and that, as if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> were a dog, and had done some underhand dirty work. The Minister ought to&gt; know in his sober judgment that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> is the very last man to try and deliberately deceive a Minister in such  a  way as has been suggested. Either the Minister could have talked the matter over with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> or he could have looked up the file, which would have given? him all the information which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had; but I have yet to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was under any obligation to include all the details of correspondence in this memorandum.

                        <para>- What obligation was there upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to quote an opinion and place it in a memorandum which purported to set forth the then position of affairs? It seems to me that the Minister not only attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in that correspondence, 'but also attacked every member of the Commission for having dared to turn <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen's</inline> opinion down. The Minister says here that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen's</inline> opinion is the one thing that ought to have determined, the matter. In my opinion the Commission comprised men infinitely wiser than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen,</inline> abler than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen,</inline> and who are infinitely more concerned with the real welfare and interests of Australia than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen,</inline> and that 'is without saying any-  thing derogatory to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen.</inline> I do not wish to say one word against what he has done, but now, strange to say, in this last episode of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> joins hands with M.r. Deakin against this Ministry. What have you done to drive <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> out too ? Who else are you going to drive out? As far as we can get the facts, and we have only the scantiest particulars to go upon, the Minister has recalled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> and appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oughton</inline> in his place. Strangely enough, the Minister lets the cat out of the bag in making his explanation. He says that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> helped to formulate the memorandum with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> at this end of the world. I wonder if that has anything to do with his recall. </para>

I understand that the Government are proposing to wind up this Exposition business - that they are not going to continue our connexion with it  for an indefinite time. Could not they have let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> stay two or three months longer to finish up the whole thing? Have things become so urgent in the Department of External Affairs, and has this man become so absolutely indispensable, that he cannot be allowed to stay there for three months longer? Does anybody believe trumpery excuses of this kind? In my opinion there is something at the back of it all still that we do not know of. I do not blame the Minister any more than I blame the Government. The Government were responsible for the appointment of this Commission, and I never heard such trivial reasons given for the humiliation of a great public servant as those which have been placed before the Committee. I invite the Minister, for the sake of his reputation as an administrator and an able man, to give us all the facts, and to place on the table all the correspondence in order that we may see whether there is anything more behind. If this is not done, I am afraid the honorable gentleman must be judged very severely, and that the Government must share his responsibility for having treated men in high positions with such scant courtesy. </para>

                    <para>. - I must enter my protest against the remarks of the honorable member for Gwydir, who is probably disappointed by the result of the appointment of the Postal Commission, inasmuch as, in connexion therewith, he did not score as he thought he ought to have scored. It seems to me that, after the lapse of years it is a cowardly thing to make such an attack in this House on an absent man. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the word in deference to your ruling, and ask whether it will be in order to say that such an utterance as that of the honorable member shows a great lack of courage, if it does not show vindictiveness. I happened to be a colleague of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> at that time when, I think, he did well under all the circumstances. It was a difficult and stormy time, and party lines were not drawn so clearly as they are drawn now. The honorable member for Gwydir is usually a generous opponent ; and it seems to me most strange that he should make what I cannot but regard as a dastardly attack on an absent man. I am rather surprised that the Prime Minister, who is a lover of fair-play, did not rise in defence. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to criticise the Minister of External Affairs, because it seems to me that we ought to wait until we have the facts before us. It is the duty of the Minister, I think, to lay all the papers on the table. I, personally, was of the opinion that we were only wasting money over the Panama Exhibition; and, even after we had entered upon the undertaking, £ raised the question whether it was wise to go on. It seems to me, however, that something has happened behind Parliament - something that we ought to know. We ought to know, for instance, why the Minister, when he took action some time ago, had, so far as it appeared to the general public, his judgment over-ridden by his colleagues. </para>

                    <para>. - There is just one item in those Estimates which strikes me as being very significant and eloquent of many things. It is an item of  £70,000,  which represents the expenditure involved in the internment of Germans in Australia. The spending of so large a sum of money seems to indicate that we are engaged, in none of the diabolical things of which we read, and that We are trying to treat them as belligerents should be treated. </para>
