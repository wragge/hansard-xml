                        <para>- Some days ago, the honorable member for Bourke, speaking in this chamber, made a very serious attack on  Colonel Lee,  the Commandant of the State of Queensland, and it is my duty to place the House in possession of the facts of the case. The honorable member charged  Colonel Lee  with having embezzled £700. This is an extract from a speech which he made on Thursday last- </para>

                <para>When the Board dealt with Sergeant Anderson, it said, "Tour receipts are bogus, we  shall not receive them;" but Colonel Fry's receipts were accepted as genuine, and he was allowed to escape. Following the Board of Inquiry came the court martial. When I read the list of officers constituting the court martial, my mind went back a few years in the history of this country, and I wondered what justice could be expected from a body so constituted. </para>

                    <para>Its  president  was an officer who some years ago was called upon by the New South Wales Government to account for £700 that had been advanced to him. At the time he was a major.  His  reply was that the advance had been £300 in hard cash, not £700, and that he had receipts from his predecessor for the balance of £400. Ho could not account for a penny of the £300, however, and it was discovered afterwards that he had received the great bulk of the £400 for which he said he had obtained receipts from his predecessor. Out of £700 he stuck to £611. A Board of Inquiry was. appointed to investigate the case, its members being  Colonel Waddell  and <inline font-weight="bold">Major T.</inline> F. Knox, one of whom boasted that he was manager of the Colonial Bank, and the other that he was managing director of Dalgety and Company. </para>

That statement was admittedly made out from memory some eight months subsequent to the period of the initiatory and main transaction concerned, and the court is of opinion that there is no evidence to support Winch's alleged statement that he handed the sum of £345 to Lieut.-Colonel Lee. </para><list type="decimal-dotted">

In this connexion, however, cognisance should be taken of the special demands made by the Government upon this officer's time and attention at this particular period in respect to the training and despatch of further contingents for service in the war. It is likewise clear that Lieutenant-Colonel Lee was further impeded in the task of adjusting his accounts with the Government of New South Wales by the necessity of fulfilling similar obligations towards the Imperial pay authorities at the same time. </para><para>The court, therefore, is of opinion that no charge of substantive neglect in the direction indicated can be established. </para><list type="decimal-dotted">

                </list><para>The court, having in view the gravity of the offence set forth in this charge, cannot but express its very deep regret that it was ever so preferred. No doubt, if Lieutenant-Colonel Lee had been a business man, and seized with the official routine connected with Departments, he would have handed over this money at once; but, in view of the unsettled condition of his accounts, he, it seems, considered it would be sufficient to hand this comparatively small sum in on the final adjustment. When called upon, he at once handed it over from a place of safe-keeping in his regimental office, showing he had derived no personal benefit from the retention of this money; and it should be borne in mind that at this time the Government was in his debt for war gratuities to the extent of £125 to £150. </para><para>The statements in evidence, supported by a sworn affidavit of Lieutenant-Colonel Lee attached to this report, go to show that the unadjusted balance of the Imperial pay, £5,364, and the New South Wales advance of £700, in all £6,064, which moneys had been mixed and handled together, represent disbursements for which vouchers have been lost or not taken, advances and pay to the troops unrecovered, or for which no vouchers were held, and general leakages inseparable from such a campaign. Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, in his affidavit above referred to, has also sworn that upwards of £200 of his own salary went in helping to provide necessaries for the troops, of which he has no hope of recovery. </para><para>While, under ordinary circumstances, it would be the plain duty of an officer intrusted with public moneys to properly and fully vouch for their disbursement, and the failure to do so would be a most reprehensible dereliction of: duty, the court, after very careful and exhaustive consideration of the evidence, has come to the conclusion that, under the very exceptional circumstances surrounding the whole matter, the inability of Lieutenant-Colonel Lee to produce vouchers for the disbursement of that portion of the said advance of £700 which came to his hand, as well as that portion previously disbursed and unvouched by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, might be allowed, and that Lieutenant-Colonel Lee should not be held culpable or personally liable for them. </para><para>The court is of opinion that such money as has not been vouched for has been expended wholly and solely for the legitimate requirements of the detachment, on account of advances of pay, which the inability to keep proper accounts, and changes and constant movements of the men, had rendered impossible of collection; also the adjustment of Imperial pay accounts. Further, the court desires to emphasize its conviction that Lieutenant-Colonel Lee has not personally benefited by any of the money's, but has shown a willingness and desire to render every assistance to the Government of New South Wales in endeavouring to arrive at an adjustment. </para><para>In view of all the circumstances, the court recommends that the adjustment of the advance of £700 be made by dispensing with the production of vouchers for those portions of the advances unvouched for, and that the amount of the war gratuity due and payable to Lieutenant-Colonel Lee be no longer withheld from that officer. </para><para>In conclusion, the court desires to give expression to its regret that Lieutenant-Colonel Leo has been arraigned upon such slender and generally unsatisfactory evidence as that upon which the serious charges appear to have been based; and, furthermore, the court would take occasion to mark its disapproval of the highly impolitic, and, in some instances, intemperate phraseology in which the various indictments have been embodied. It is obvious that hasty and ill-advised conclusions have been arrived at without due consideration of facts and figures bearing upon the case. </para><para>It is likewise considered a matter for regret that more trouble had not been taken at the outset to sift the evidence submitted to the Audit Department by the witness Winch, inasmuch as it is clearly manifest that the authorities were entirely misled by the unreliable information furnished by him to the Chief Inspector of Public Accounts. </para><para>The court in its deliberations has not been unmindful of the fact that Lieutenant-Colonel Lee fought gallantly and well in the defence of the Empire in South Africa; also that ho rendered signal and valuable service to his country, and upheld the honour of New South Wales by the able and efficient manner in which he exercised his command over the detachment of Lancers despatched by that State for service against the Boers. It has been made manifest to the court that, whilst serving in General French's column, the troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Lee's command were kept continuously on the move, averaging, as one witness attested, up to seventeen hours daily in the saddle - fighting and marching - for periods extending for three weeks at a time on occasions. This being the case, and having constantly and steadily in view the all- absorbing main issues of the campaign, viz., the discomfiture of the enemy and the safety and well-being of his men, it is quite intelligible to the court that Lieutenant-Colonel Lee might have been forced to neglect minor questions of accounts through lack of time and opportunity - such questions being, after all, only of small significance in relation to the paramount interest at stake. </para><para>Notwithstanding that the court has manifested its entire disagreement with the conclusions arrived at by the Chief Inspector of Public Accounts in respect to the matters at issue, and, furthermore, has taken very marked exception to the phraseology in which the various charges preferred against Lieutenant-Colonel Lee have been embodied, it is still specially desirous of placing on record an expression of its opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brodie</inline> has been actuated throughout the entire proceedings solely by a pure sense of duty towards the Government. </para><para>Dated at Sydney, New South Wales, this 28th day of January, 1904. </para><para>Geo.

                            <para>- In the first place, the Minister informed Parliament, the press, and the country that a court martial dealt with the case of  Colonel Lee.  There is not a word of truth in that statement. That is my first answer to the honorable gentleman. The report which the Assistant Minister of Defence has just -read to the House makes no reference to a court martial. The whole trouble in regard to  Colonel Lee  arose out of the refusal of Major-General Hutton to send him to a court martial. That is clear and distinct. All that the Assistant Minister of Defence has done has been to read the findings of a Board. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question regarding the tenders called for the supply of motor cycles to the Postal Department - a matter which I brought under his notice a few days ago. It appears that there have been no specifications, and that a local firm of motor cycle manufacturers put in a tender for double cylinder machines, whereas it has come to their knowledge that the Department will be satisfied with single cylinder machines, so that they have not tendered on a fair basis with those who have offered to supply imported motor cycles of a cheaper grade. I therefore ask the Postmaster-General whether he will allow the tenders to be reopened, and specify whether single or double cylinder machines are required, so that all may tender on an equal footing 1 </para>

We have not sent supplies to post-offices, because it has not been thought necessary to do so. It has been made widely known that the clerks of petty sessions who are registrars of pensions have been supplied, and it is believed that no claimant will have any difficulty in the matter. </para>

                            <para>- An objection to the proposed bantam battalion has been that the trenches are too deep to allow of small men shooting out of them. Has the Assistant Minister of Defence seen an illustration in the latest <inline font-style="italic">Graphic</inline> to hand, in which that disability has been overcome in the way I suggested by making steps in the trenches? In view of this fact, will the Government reconsider their refusal to recruit a bantam battalion from Australia? I should also like to ask the Minister whether he is aware that the "War Office has authorized the formation of a bantam battalion at Glasgow, the minimum height being 5 feet? </para>

                        <para>- Many complaints have been received from Port Darwin, and I am afraid that, no matter what we do, complaints will continue to come. I believe that there is a scarcity of accommodation, and it is understood that requests have been made to the Administrator for assistance, but I have not previously heard that the residents were willing to erect houses for themselves if they were given a small advance by the Government. I have every sympathy with the desire of the men for proper housing accommodation, but the position is that there has been a large and rapid accession of working population there. As the honorable member will realize, it is difficult to provide for the increased demand, having regard to the fact that no previous arrangement had been made in anticipation of such accession. </para>

                            <para>- No, but we have taken steps so that we can take over the licences at any time. On the 25th March the licences came up for renewal, and had to be renewed, if at all, for twelve months under the former Ordinance. That Ordinance was repealed. A new one has been substituted which enables the Government to extend the licences from month to month, so that when we are ready to take the hotels over there will be nothing in the ordinance to prevent us. </para>

One honorable member asks a question, and the whole House will apparently endeavour to assist the Minister to answer it. I appeal to honorable members, when a question is asked, to remain silent until it has been answered. If then they desire to put an additional question, that may, in certain circumstances, be done. </para>

                <para>I desire to direct the attention of the House very briefly to the facts of the case, from which it will be seen that I never at any time admitted the charge. It will be within the recollection of honorable members that the honorable member for Barrier had a motion on the business-paper for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the question whether the third reading of the Loan Bill had been carried. I had prepared an explanation and refutation of all the charges which had been made, but the honorable member for Barrier, for reasons, I suppose, of a very sound character, saw fit to remove his notice of motion from the notice-paper; and consequently I had no opportunity to deal with the matter. However, the honorable member for Ballarat, during the course of his speech in that city, said - </para>

                <para>From that statement, which already appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and which I made from my place in the chair, it will be seen that I emphatically repudiated the charge, and also that I disproved it from the records of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> from the uncorrected proof which I had in my hand. Therefore, I take it that the honorable member's memory has played him a trick in this matter, because I do not think he would intentionally have stated that I admitted the truth of the charges when, as a matter of fact, I had denied them in the most positive manner, and had also furnished proof to the House that they were absolutely without foundation. In regard to the incident, I would like to take this opportunity of reading two memoranda, one from the  Clerk  of the House, and one from the reporter who took the notes at the time. I asked the  Clerk  to prepare a memorandum for the information of the House, and he presented me with the following: - 7th May, 1914. </para>
                <para>Memorandum for the  Hon.  the  Speaker. </para>
                <para>In compliance with your direction, I beg to state my recollection of the proceedings on 30th October last in connexion with the third reading of the Loan Bill. The Bill was read a second time, and passed through Committee after about sixteen divisions had been taken. The report was adopted on division after the closure had been applied. It was then between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning. The House had by that time become very excited. Many members were standing up calling out loudly, and paying very little attention to what was being done. The motion for the third reading was put. The  Speaker  declared the question passed. I was standing at the table looking towards the  Speaker.  As soon as the  Speaker  intimated that the Bill had been read a third time, the Prime Minister jumped to his feet and moved the adjournment of the House, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> moved the closure. I pointed out to the  Speaker  that, though the third reading of the Bill had passed, the formal reading of the Bill by the  Clerk  - in compliance with the order of the House - had yet to be done. By <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> direction, I then formally read the title of the Bill, and the last stage of the Bill was completed. </para>
                <para class="block">That memorandum was signed by Air. C. Gavan Duffy, Clerk of the House of Representatives. Then I called upon <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Principal Parliamentary Reporter, and asked to be furnished with a memorandum from the reporter who took the notes, because I felt that the honour of the  Speaker  could not be assailed without also the honour of the principal officers of the House being concerned. What was alleged could not have taken place except by the most trusted and responsible officers of the House entering into a conspiracy with the  Speaker.  The Principal Parliamentary Reporter  thereupon issued the following minute to the reporter who was reporting the proceedings at the time - </para>

                <para class="block">In reply to that minute the reporter replied as follows - </para>

                <para>I have no desire to take up the time of the House further, but I think it is only due to me that I should make this explanation, because the debate in connexion with the removal from the records of the suspension of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> from the House is apt to convey a false impression to the public mind, and it would be made to appear that I had done something culpable and dishonorable during my term in the Chair as  Speaker.  Therefore, I feel that it is due, not only to myself, but also to the House, that I should make the" facts clear. At the same time, may I also remind the House that I had no hand whatever in the suspension of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> at that time? As a matter of fact, while I regarded the incident as a grave one, I recognised that the honorable member was new to the House, and unfamiliar with its procedure. Party feeling was running high at the time, and, therefore, I felt that there were extenuating circumstances in the case, so I asked the House to allow the matter to pass. The Prime Minister, however, took a graver view of the situation, and proceeded to put into operation the rules of the House, resulting in the expulsion of the honorable member for Ballarat at the time. I felt very sorry. I would rather have seen the incident dropped. During last election false statements were circulated in my electorate that the honorable member for Ballarat was suspended od my casting vote as  Speaker,  and, therefore, some odium was cast upon me. As a matter of fact, the decision of the House was carried without the necessity for the Speaker's casting vote having arisen. Had that casting vote been necessary I should have exercised it, as I would have felt bound to do, in the direction indicated by my previously expressed wish that the incident should be allowed to drop. I am pleased to know that the House has taken action to expunge from the records the suspension of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath,</inline> and had I been present at the time, I should, after his expression of regret for what he had said, have most heartily supported the proposal. </para>

                    <para>There is a great disparity between the pay of privates in the British and Australian Forces. Most of the reservists left their families in Australia, and the Government decided to pay the difference between the respective rates of pay in order to enable the families to live during the husband's absence. There is not the same disparity in the rates of officers of the Imperial and the Australian Forces, and the amounts paid to the Imperial officers are considered to be quite sufficient to enable them to maintain their wives and families in Australia. There is not, therefore, the same reason for similar treatment to be afforded Imperial officers, and the Government do not propose to take any action in that direction. </para>

I was asked whether I had any concrete proposals to bring forward. I have such proposals to submit, and the only opportunity one has under existing conditions is to submit them to the House. I say that, because at our own party meetings business is so congested that it is be coming more difficult to have a particular matter considered at such meetings than it is to have it dealt with in this House. </para>

I have had other urgent business connected with my electorate before the party for the last seven or eight weeks, and it has also been impossible to reach that. I should prefer, in dealing with matters of this kind, to submit what proposals I have to make to the members of my own party before bringing them forward in the House ; but in this case it has not been practicable to do that, and undue delay in dealing with a matter of such vital importance to the people would be inexcusable. </para>

I offer the friendly suggestions contained in my proposal which will enable the corporate ability of the Cabinet to frame a policy and create machinery. If required, I can fill in details. The fixing of prices and regulating of supplies has long been an ideal of our party, and I cannot admit that our leaders have no practical scheme for giving effect to it. </para>
                    <para>I have no desire to reiterate the statements which I made in this chamber yesterday. I then showed that we had actually sent shipments of butter overseas, and had been obliged to bring them back again - a ridiculous position for this Commonwealth to occupy; that we had exported £100,000 worth of wheat to a neighbouring Dominion, notwithstanding that a flour famine in Sydney is notified in the public press; and that, in regard to the meat supply, we have been laboriously endeavouring with insufficient machinery arrangements to ascertain what is the real position in Australia. Only to-day the Minister of Trade and Customs has assured us that this information will be supplied as soon as returns are available. I may mention in passing that these inquiries have been in progress for some time. I do not blame the Minister personally for failure to use the machinery at his disposal to the fullest possible extent to supply the public with the desired information. But I would point out that there does reside in the Government the necessary power to create much more effective machinery than exists at the present moment. </para>
                    <para>I urge, by way of friendly complaint, that the Government might have exhibited more public-spirited aggressive- ness, more energy, more originality, and more ingenuity in attempting to devise extraordinary means to meet this extraordinary and vital situation. </para>
                    <para>I would also remind the House that we have no method of ascertaining the position in regard to sugar stocks in Australia to-day. We are in the humiliating position that we must wait until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, condescends to inform us that if certain things are not done, and if certain arrangements are not made by his own company within a specified time, there will be a sugar famine in this country. </para>
                    <para>Whilst <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have no desire to traverse the ground which I covered yesterday, I do wish to call attention to the fact that there is at present a conflict of purpose as well as of action amongst the State authorities. We know that one State has prohibited the export of wheat to another State, and that there has been a veiled threat that a particular State will prohibit the export of sugar to other States. </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; but surely it was never contemplated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> should leave the control of his great Department, go away, and give his time exclusively to the work which would arise from a proper carrying out of the instruction I have read? The demand would be too comprehensive. I understand that even before the appointment of the Commission arrangements were made by the previous Government that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was to be a representative of Australia at the Panama Exposition, showing conclusively and positively that it was not intended that the Foodstuffs Commission should adequately cope with the present situation, because it would be impossible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to act on both Commissions. </para>

                        <para class="block">August last, and the last of the reports, I find, is dated the 31st October, so that the inquiries extended over two months. I will not refer to the reports In detail, but just mention the subject-matter of them. </para>
                        <para>The first report is dated the 7th September, and deals with the question of wheat and flour for the United Kingdom, British Colonies, and the Allies. </para>
                        <para>The second report, dated the 7th September, deals with meat for the Allies. </para>
                        <para>The third report, on the 8th September, deals with the carriage of foodstuffs to oversea Dominions and the Allies. </para>
                        <para>The fourth report, dated 9th September, deals with meat-canning orders from the British Government, and advises that an effort should be made to obtain such orders, and that, in the absence of them, the Government should go ahead and encourage the manufacture of tinned meats. </para>
                        <para>On the 11th September, there are reports -bearing on the prolongation of the war, and recommending that efforts should be made to induce the planting of crops ; a report in regard to cargo in foreign bottoms being held up; a recommendation for an international clearing-house, and a report dealing with seized enemy ships. </para>
                        <para>On the 16th September, there is a report dealing with enemy patents, and a report recommending cables to be sent in regard to prize courts. </para>
                        <para>On the 30th September, there is a report in regard to enemy trading, and a report in regard to enemy vessels sheltering in neutral ports, and about to leave such ports. </para>
                        <para>On the 1st October, there is a further recommendation as to communication with State Governments on the sowing of crops, and a further report on the question of increasing the output of locally manufactured goods as against goods previously coming from enemy countries. </para>
                        <para>On the 8th October, there is a report in regard to the prohibition of the export of oats from New Zealand to Australia. </para>
                        <para>On the 13th October there is a report dealing with brands on goods to signify country of origin. </para>
                        <para>On the 22nd October, there is a report suggesting that the export of wheat and flour should be prohibited, and a recommendation that tonnage should be secured for the export of Australian meat. </para>
                        <para>On the 30th October, there are further recommendations with regard to the proposal for an international clearing-house, the search of enemy vessels for guns in neutral ports, and action on the lines of the British Board of Trade; a report dealing with the treatment of mineral ores and wool, and a report dealing further with the question of the planting of crops and communications with the States. </para>
                        <para>And, lastly, there is a report in the shape of an appendix dealing with the probability of the local production of goods hitherto imported from Germany and Austria-Hungary. </para>
                        <para>These appear to -me to be in their way valuable reports; they seem to be necessary. But there is no information as to existing or probable food supplies, except a reiteration of facts previously published by State statisticians. </para>

                                <para>- With millions of men taken out of the avenues of production and sent to the war, and therefore becoming consumers, it was quite evident hat it was a matter of necessity and urgency that a special eye should be kept on the necessaries of life to see that no shortage occurred, especially when we were exporting goods of this kind oversea. </para>

                        <para>So much by -way of reference to the Royal Commission. I am very sorry that it was put out of action until something better was created in its place. There could have been something better created, in my opinion, but such as it was the Commission was doing some good, and nothing has been put in its place. </para>
                        <para>The Minister admits now quite candidly that he has not the machinery at his disposal to do any better than he is doing. </para>
                        <para>I come now to the question of what power we have to do better. I believe that we have ample power. I hold that all the powers we have, or think we have, should be exercised to their utmost in the effort to deal with the present extraordinary situation. As I point out in the motion, we have our power in regard to statistics. That is a constitutional power, under which we are entitled to pass legislation empowering our Statistician to make inquiries, and prepare statistics on any matter arising in Australia. For instance, on a question of population, or goods, or anything else, we can instruct that officer to make inquiries, and report to us. Under that power we have authority to give directions that everybody in Australia shall present reports at such periods as we lay down for the information of the House and the Government. "We could issue a proclamation compelling every producer, manufacturer, and holder of stocks to register output and holdings weekly in the same way as we compel electors to register their changes of address. If there is any difficulty in getting the information with the machinery at present at our disposal - and it is admitted there is - the Government ought to take immediate action to augment the machinery, and correct its defects, and to see that the information is perfectly reliable and adequately supplied. </para>
                        <para>Then we have the export power. The power to prohibit exports is almost unlimited in its scope. It has already been exercised, I am glad to say, in regard to wheat, flour, and sugar, and the export of meat, except for the Imperial Government, is also prohibited. The Imperial Government, however, has asked only for meat from the surplus stock of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubtedly. The power to prohibit exports, as well as the power to obtain statistics, authorizes the setting in motion of the necessary machinery. </para>

                        <para>The British Government has not asked that we shall export meat required for local consumption; it asks only that wo shall send our surplus meat. The public of Australia should not be allowed to go short of meat when the supply of that commodity to the Imperial authorities is not a matter of urgency. If meat or other foodstuffs were urgently needed by our soldiers in the trenches, we should be bound to sacrifice ourselves to the uttermost to meet their requirements, but so far as one can gather from the press reports - and no other information has been given to us - there is in the communications which have been received from the Imperial authorities no hint of urgency in this matter. </para>
                        <para>In addition to the powers that I have named, it must be remembered that the country is now in the throes of war, and that extraordinary powers have therefore been conferred upon the Government by the War Precautions Act. That Act gives Ministers almost unlimited power. In my opinion, it gives the powers which cannot be given by this Parliament in times of peace. War having broken out, the unexpressed power residing in the National Parliament has enabled us to pass that drastic measure known as the War Precautions Act, under which, it appears to me, the Government is authorized to act in any such manner as may be necessary to prevent the public interest from being jeopardized by causes arising out of the war. </para>
                        <para>Ministers acting under the War Precautions Act have commandeered tha output of the woollen factories, laid down specifications as to the quality of the material that must be manufactured, and? dictated prices. If Ministers can do that, it is certain in the public interest  they  can act in regard to the supply of foodstuffs. </para>
                        <para>Beyond and above all the powers that I have mentioned are the powers given by what is known as th» law of eminent domain, the right which national necessity gives to every Government over and above the powers expressed in a written constitution to do what is necessary to conserve the public  interest. Should it become necessary, the Government could order every individual citizen to do its bidding in regard to his goods, chattels, and all other possessions. To use an extreme illustration, the Government could strip us of our clothing to supply the troops, if the necessity were sufficiently urgent. There is hardly anything that one can conceive of that could not be done under this right to take whatever action may be necessary to preserve the existence of the nation; there is no limit to this national power. It is an unrestricted area of limitless jurisdiction. </para>
                        <para>Putting together all the powers that I have named - the power to demand information for statistical purposes, the power to prohibit the export of goods from Australia, the powers set forth in the War Precautions Act, and the extraordinary powers - unquestioned in a time of war - going beyond the expressed words, of the Constitution which are inherent in this and every national Government under the law of eminent domain - it must be obvious that Ministers have a source of power from which to draw, which they have yet scarcely touched, much less exhausted. </para>
                        <para>I wish to repeat in this connexion a statement that I made last night. It is not sufficient that the Government or individual Ministers should obtain occasional information when spurred to do so. We have received from the Minister of Trade and Customs detached pieces of information which are totally unrelated and without co-ordination. They have to be sought for in piles of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in which they must be picked out from a mass of other matter. This information has been given spasmodically, without aim or directness, and without any concern for related action. The chaos that is thus created should be reduced to order, and there should be organized aggressive and public-spirited action taken. At a time like this it is not only the duty of individual members to make suggestions to Ministers, and to urge on them the need for action; it is also the duty of Ministers to apply their inventive faculties and ingenuity to search out, suggest, and try out methods for relieving the public necessities. Disjointed information' of an insufficient character has been given" to members from time to time. Undoubtedly it has been given with expedition. But no concrete, energetic scheme for the protection of the public interest has been put forward. </para>
                        <para>The duty devolves upon this Parliament of formulating a policy, and of creating machinery to give effect to it, and the first step is to invite Ministers in a friendly way to give the House a definite lead. Ministers should confer together, and, in their conferences, they should be actuated by the desire to do something, not by the desire to prevent things from being done or to put stumbling-blocks in the way of action, or to apply destructive criticism to every suggestion. They should confer, not in the spirit of conservatism, but with the desire to act, with the desire to create and construct machinery for the carrying out of well-considered policy for the safeguarding of the public interest under wise and energetic administration. </para>
                        <para>I ask that the views that I put forward yesterday may be considered in connexion with my statements to-day, because I do not wish to go over again the ground that I then covered. </para>
                        <para>I have made these statements in the friendliest way, with the desire of offering a constructive suggestion for meeting the difficulties with which we are faced, and which, if not promptly tackled and dealt with, will increase in intensity, and in their destructive influences. </para>
                        <para>I do not expect the Minister of Trade and Customs, who leads the House, to be in a position to say off-hand that such-and-such a detailed scheme shall be adopted, but I hope that my remarks may be considered by the Government as prompted by a friendly spirit, and by the desire to have something done to help the people in their present difficult situation. </para>
                        <para>The motion which I have moved gives opportunity for the submission of a scheme for this object. This means of ventilating suggestions and proposals has been taken by me on previous occasions, and I submit my amendment for the favorable consideration of honorable members. </para>
                        <para>My proposal ought not to be discussed in any party spirit, or regarded as primarily intended to be used in formulating a complaint against one side or the other. The best intelligence of honorable members on both sides should be brought into  active play, and there should be sympathetic co-operation to obtain a remedy for our present difficulties. </para>
                        <para>I should have been pleased if, at the commencement, it had been determined to make this a non-party session. There are matters as to which there will be a difference of opinion regarding their party or non-party character. </para>

Such matters will probably continue so insistent that Parliament will find itself unable to deal with matters of a strictly party character. I ask honorable members on both sides to approach the consideration of my amendment with the desire, not to tear it to pieces, leaving nothing in its place, but to bring forward constructive ideas which will help the people out of difficulties which are, apparently, becoming more and more serious. The first portion of my motion asks that machinery should be created for the purpose of supplying the House with accurate, reliable, and immediate information, and that the Government should supply that information to the House; the second portion asks the Government to seriously consider the difficulties of the people in this matter and formulate some definite policy, and, as soon as any other matter of urgency is disposed of, permitting this question to be considered in all its aspects, to indicate what their larger policy is, so that we may know that we have the machinery and a definite plan upon which to operate. It is because I believe the Government capable of determining a course of action to prevent the exploitation of the people, that, instead of submitting a more detailed scheme, I desire the Government to lead the House and the country. </para>

I have no objection to the motion, but at the same time if we are to wait until we get the statistics for which it asks in the ordinary way, we must wait a long time. I quite agree with the honorable member as to the importance of knowing what we are dealing with before taking any action, but the difficulty is the delay in securing from the States the statistics they collect. The matter of the collection of statistics is in their hands, and though time after time the Commonwealth Statistician has urged upon them the necessity for expedition, the production statistics for 1914 will not be available in Australia for another six months. </para>

                                <para>- I have pointed out to State Ministers the need for hurrying the collection of their figures. It should be a much easier matter to collect information in regard to factories than to collect statistics in regard to stocks as required by the honorable member; but as that information is not available until ten or eleven months after the period covered by it has been completed, what opportunity have we to  secure  that information which the honorable member desires? What the honorable member is aiming at I have been aiming at ever since I have been in this Parliament. I have been trying to get information which will enable honorable members to better perform the duties put before them. The honorable member for Cook says that we need more machinery. If we had waited to get from the various States information that 1 have been able to place before honorable members in connexion with stocks of meat, &amp;c, from time to time, we would have had to wait for months later than when we were able to get the figures through our own  office  If the honorable member's, motion is carried it will not put us one step further forward. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman has never heard me put forward that claim. On the other hand, the honorable gentleman made that claim for that great Commission he appointed - the Deakin-Thomson-Knibbs Commission - which was going to do something great. I shall read what they did do. These gentlemen were appointed a Royal Commission at the latter end of August, and the States, at the Conference with the Cook Government, agreed that they would supply certain information, but all that these gentlemen did up to the 31st October was to ascertain how much wheat was available in five out of the six States. There is no figure in the whole of the papers of that Commission except that relating to the wheat available in Australia after the crop harvested nine or ten months before, and it took them two months to ascertain it. Beyond that they did nothing. </para>

It was really to safeguard the interests of the people that we prohibited the export of sugar, and to the credit of the Prime Minister, be it said, the matter was first brought forward by him. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member had been in his place yesterday when a question was put to me by the honorable member for Darling Downs as to the export of 3,000 tons of refined sugar, he would know "that we allowed that quantity of raw sugar to be imported on the understanding that, after it had been refined here, it could be re-exported. Our object was to secure trie work of refining it for men in the local refineries. I think that the action taken by the Government in that case was a proper one. If we had not taken it, this sugar would have been refined outside, and Australian workers would have been deprived of the employment thus secured by them. Coming to the general question of the price of foodstuffs, I would say that if we can do all that the honorable member for Cook urges that we should do, then there is absolutely no need to ask the people of Australia to give the Commonwealth Parliament increased powers. In my opinion, however, under the Constitution as it stands, we cannot do all that the honorable member says we can. </para>

In order to be able to answer a question put the other day regarding butter stocks, we had to cause inquiries to be made at various butter manufactories, and the  same course would have to be taken with regard to every other commodity.

                                <para>- I disagree with the honorable member. Let me assure him, however, that the Government are fully alive to the importance of these matters. I ask him to withdraw his amendment on the understanding that I shall submit it to the Cabinet, and that we shall do our very best to safeguard the interests of the community. As I said yesterday, in reply to the honorable member for Bendigo, I think it unreasonable that people who have obtained meat for about 2d. per lb., and have placed it in cool chambers, should now be selling it at about 8d. per lb., taking advantage of the necessities of the people. </para>

                                <para>- Something has been done ; but it is not always advisable to state exactly what is being done. If you throw all your cards on the table, then your opponent knows exactly how to play his hand. I do not know what has been the effect in other States where large stocks of frozen meat are held; but the result of our action has been fairly marked in this State. I hope that the people will see that it is put beyond the power of certain exploiters to take advantage of the necessities of the people. It should not be possible for 'these men to do in Australia what is being done by the Meat Ring in America, by freezing produce while supplies are plentiful and bringing it out and selling it at exceedingly high prices in times of scarcity, thus trading upon the necessities of the people. </para>

                            <para>.- I think that the honorable .member for Cook did well to introduce to the House this matter of the high cost of living, but, while I listened carefully to him, I did not hear him suggest any remedy for the evil with which we are faced. The cost of living has considerably increased since the outbreak of the war. I have gone very carefully into the matter and have obtained information, from what I regard as a most reliable source, showing that the cost of living to-day is £20 per month, as compared with £15 a month six months ago. That represents an increase of 33 J per cent., or 6s. 8d. in the £1. The purchasing price of a sovereign to-day, as compared with six months ago, is about 13s. 4d. My sympathies go out to the struggling heads of families who have to meet this state of affairs, but sympathy without action is of no avail. I contend that it is within the power of the Government to take action. The Labour party for some considerable time have made political capital out of this question of high living. They have dangled it before the people as a means of getting into Parliament, but have taken no action to deal with the question. Prices have gone on increasing from day to day, and the struggling masses have been left by them to meet the situation. </para>

If we do not intend to deal with the matter effectively and immediately, then we are not doing our duty as the custodians of the rights of the people. We should act at once. If we had in office a good strong Government, it would act immediately, and would be prepared to take the responsibility. It is rather strange that, after all we have heard from the Labour party throughout Australia regarding the high cost of living, it should be a representative of a State which has been governed by a Labour Government for the last four years who has come forward with this proposition. It is rather significant that this wail with regard to the high cost of living comes from New South Wales, which has been under a </para>

The Labour Government of New South Wales, 1 suppose, will have to make the butter manufacturers " find the butter." </para>

The averages for the States were as follow: - Western Australia, 1,140; New South Wales, 1,049; South Australia, 1,022; Tasmania, 1,000; Victoria, 951 ; and Queensland, 904. Honorable members will see that the figure for Queensland is only 904 as against 1,140 in Western Australia, and 1.049 in New South Wales, in both of which States Labour Governments are in office. Those figures are contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline><inline font-style="italic">Labour Bulletin No. 8,</inline> and they prove that the claim that Labour Governments have reduced the cost of living is misleading, and absolutely fooling the people. Nothing has been done to grapple with these questions, except to condemn in the strongest possible terms certain combines, imaginary or real. I notice that the Attorney-General, when speaking the other day, as representative of the  Trollymen's  Union, at the Labour Conference in Adelaide, said that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was not the worst combine in Australia. It is a combine, however, that the honorable gentleman knows something about, and yet he has not attempted to do anything to check what he says are its ravages. </para>

                                <para>- I am about to connect my remarks with the amendment. My desire is to point out that the Minister'salleged saving on that bread contract was an eye-opener for any one who had an eye to business, for if the Government could save 2d. per loaf on one contract, what is to prevent them extending the principle so that the whole of the people may be supplied with cheaper bread ? </para>

                                <para>- The Minister made that statement, but I showed that he was making a loss of 2d. per loaf. In regard to sugar, I propose to show there has been no inflation of wholesale prices by the refiners during the last nine or ten months. Any shortage or inflation that has been experienced is a result of manipulation by dealers, the petty men in the trade ; but I shall endeavour to prove that there is no shortage at the present time, and absolutely no inflation of prices. The wholesale price of sugar in Melbourne and Sydney to-day is lower than it has been at any time during the last five years. </para>

                                <para>- That statement only supports me in saying that it is not the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, or the refiners, who have caused any inflation in prices, but that the middlemen in Melbourne have held their stocks, and tried to create a scare by making it appear that there was a shortage of supplies. I shall quote to the House the wholesale prices of sugar in Melbourne during the last six years. Melbourne prices are about 7s. 6d. per ton in excess of Sydney prices, and are subject to a trade discount of 5 per cent. On the 13th May, 1909, the wholesale price of sugar was £21 7s. 6d. per ton; on the 1st October, 1910, £22 2s. 6d.; on the 1st September, 1911, £23 12s. 6d. ; on the 5th October, 1912, £22 12s. 6d. ; on the 25th July, 1913, £22 2s. 6d. ; and on the 6th July, 1914, £21 2s. 6d. War broke out in Europe in August of last year, and the price "I have given for that month has ruled, except in Queensland, ever since. </para>

We will, therefore, hold at the disposal of each customer a quantity of sugar equal to what was delivered at the corresponding period of last year, and it will be essential that orders sent to us shall be confined strictly within those limits. The prices for all our goods will be as per our price-list on dates of delivery - as usual. </para>

                                <para>- I am showing that a lot of the outcry about the monopoly which has victimized the people is only so much dust-throwing. The monopolists are nearer at hand. Let us endeavour to get at the truth as to who is responsible for the increase in the cost of commodities. The Queensland Prices Board fixed the wholesale price of sugar at £23, which was the amount which Victorian buyers were asked to pay, and, at the same time, it fixed the retail price at 2s. 9d. per one dozen pounds, at which figure the consumers in Queensland have been obtaining their' sugar, whilst those in Victoria have been paying 3s., and have been able to get only very limited supplies. I am in a position to state that the Government can arrange for the public to be supplied with sugar at 3d. per pound to the extent of the whole of the Australian crop, and having regard to the prices of other commodities at this period I do not think that charge can be regarded as excessive. Indeed, it is as much as from 50 to 100 per cent, lower than the prices charged in other parts of the world. </para>

                                <para>- I say that sugar is cheaper to the consumer in Australia than it is in New Zealand, because I have information from the Dominion that the retail price there is 3d. and 3£d. per pound. I do not think that the Australian people will object to paying 3d. per pound for sugar during this war crisis. -If that price could be fixed for about ten months of the year, special arrangements could be made, either by rebate of duty or by some other means to be decided upon by the Government, to bridge over the balance of the year. The Government seem to be taking a rather long time to consider what action shall be taken, but my own opinion is that the duty should not be interfered with. I know that the sugar growers are prepared to come to a reasonable understanding to let the people have the whole of the Australian sugar crop at the price I have mentioned. Of course it is of no use to criticise the Government unless one is prepared to suggest a remedy, and I hope that one of the results of this discussion will be that the collective wisdom of the House will evolve a remedy. Under the Federal Constitution the Government have power to do almost anything which the people require to be done. With the Constitution as it stands, we can meet almost any emergency, and I am not one to advocate handing enormous powers over to the Central Government. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member will pay attention, he will find that there is a way out of the difficulty. Section 51 provides that Parliament shall have power to make laws with respect to  . . . " matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to the State by whose Parliament the matter is referred or which afterwards adopts the law." The Government should, therefore, immediately suggest to the State Governments - five of whom are Labour Governments - their comrades in arms in the great battle against the foe within the gates - to call their Parliaments together, and concede to the Federal Government full power to deal with the question of food supply. In that way the whole matter would be settled in a week or two, and this Parliament would have power delegated to it by at least five States to make laws to govern the cost of living. I put that suggestion, with all earnestness and sincerity, before the Government and the mover of the motion as a way out of the difficulty.

If the Labour Government of New South Wales has failed to do anything, let this Parliament appeal to the New South Wales Parliament to give us the necessary power. I am sure that if such a policy were adopted, Australia would respond in such a way as would give this Parliament full power to pass laws dealing with the necessary commodities of life. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is referring to the referenda, which! it will take many months to get through. I have an impression that the Minister of Trade and Customs made an interjection that some action he took in ascertaining the quantities of meat available had caused a reduction in the price. If I were in any business I should always make it my special concern to know exactly what stocks were in Australia and the rest of the world. A business man gets his pickings through knowing where the shortages and surpluses are. I do not give any one very great credit for happening to know what stocks there are. It is rubbish to say that the first thing we have to do is to discover the existing stocks in Australia. We know every time we put our hands in our pockets that stocks are short and prices too high. In the face of this we do not want to start an inquiry all over Australia to find out where stocks are. It has struck me as a peculiarity about the Labour party that they are always trying to find out something about somebody else's business instead of building up a business of their own. The Minister of Trade and Customs said he reduced the price of meat. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know whether I mistook the Minister for somebody else. I know my wife thought that the price of meat had been reduced owing to the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and went out to buy it. She was told in the shop, "No, the selling price has not been reduced. It is only the buying price that has been reduced." It is the selling price that affects the housewives of Australia. I urge the Minister to get a move on, and reduce the selling price of meat. If he does this he will have earned the undying gratitude of thousands of people who are struggling to-day to make ends meet in these trying times. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Cook has moved a motion, of- which the second part declares that it is the duty of the Government to formulate and execute means for guaranteeing to the people of Australia the necessities of life at reasonable rates. That is the essence of the motion, and I agree with it. I agree with the proposition that from the day the war broke out the National Government had power to do practically anything if thought necessary. It had all the powers it could possibly possess through the taking of any number of referenda. I put that proposition months ago, and still strongly adhere to it. It is indorsed to-day by men of all classes, and especially by men of standing in the legal world. The Attorney-General, in his discussion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell</inline> the other day, said the Defence powers were the most drastic in the Constitution. That is exactly what I said on the floor of this chamber a few weeks ago. The Attorney-General said he would be a bold man who would dare to put any limits on the powers of the National Government at the present time. If that is so, in what sort of position do we stand ? We have refused to do anything to exercise our powers. We have power to maintain a well-nurtured Army and Navy. We have ample and unlimited power to protect the civil population against the rapacity of individuals. If, without trial by Judge or jury, we can intern private individuals at Langwarriu  because we think their presence in the community is not beneficial, so under the same sinister power we can imprison any person who we think has done something inimical to the interests of the country. If ever there was a question of paramount interest to the Defence Department it is that of the supply of fodder. We had unlimited power to import from the Pacific coast, India, or the Argentine all the fodder we required for Defence purposes. Instead of doing this, which would have relieved the local market and kept fodder at a reasonable rate, we entered into competition in the local market with every private buyer. We sent up the price of fodder and enabled the fodder ring to increase their profits; we put an embargo on every man who owned a horse and dray and made him pay enormously more than he ought to have paid. The same necessity for cheaper fodder is indicated by the allowance that has been promised to the mail contractors. It was the undoubted duty of the Government to import fodder from the outbreak of the war, and what is true of fodder for cattle is equally true of food for human beings. The Indian Government took charge of the wheat crop, fixed the price, transported the surplus to Great Britain, and the difference between the price realized there and the price paid to the growers of India went into the revenue of the Indian Government to help meet the expenses of the war. What they did we also could have done. The price of meat has risen; the price of wheat has risen. Even the price of firewood has risen, and the price of tea has gone up, although there is no drought in China. Yet the Government, who have absolute power over exports and imports, have not taken a single step to insure the supply of cheap foodstuffs to the people. We propose to put the referenda to the people. After we carry them, what will we do ? We shall do no more than we are doing to-day. </para>

                                <para>- I am here to uphold the principles of the Labour, movement, and not to support any particular Government which does not uphold those principles. Honorable members talk about the referenda and of nationalizing monopolies, and yet they will not take a single step when they have unlimited power. Even with our present powers in the matter of insurance and banking, no step has been taken; and the chances are that, when it is proposed to move, it will be found that there is no necessity, every State having taken action. A Government, which is here to uphold the national existence can see men going to the war, and their wives and children practically starving owing to the enormously high prices of food, and all they can do is to turn round and say that they have no power to prevent it. That is absolute bosh, because they have the most extensive power possessed by a Government in any country. "Under the Constitution, the Government have domestic powers sufficient to enable them to protect the common people from the ravages of enemies without and within. The facts are plain and palpable to every man ; and the Government and this Labour party could do what is necessary if they dared *o take the chances. If the honorable member for Cook is prepared to persist with his motion, I shall support it. </para>

                            <para>. - It is exceedingly refreshing to hear the remarks of the honorable member for Bourke. In Queensland a Liberal Government has been subject to similar criticism; and, according to the Leader of the Opposition in that State, that Government was put out of office for failing to take action in regard to trusts, and also for not doing something to reduce the high cost of living. The honorable member for Cook is quite right in pressing for the fullest information, so that we may know whether or not the Customs Department can show that any trusts or combinations are "cornering" the food of the community. We have been told by the Attorney-General, through the press, that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is such an organization, though it is said not to be the worst of the kind . If that be so, it is the duty of the Minister of Trade and Customs to make investigations. If it is known by the Attorney-General that trusts and combines are operating injuriously, the names ought to be communicated to the House. Can the Minister of Trade and Customs give us the names of any trusts or combines that are carrying on operations detrimental to consumers? If the Government are not in a position to afford such information, they ought to remain silent, and not make allegations outside. Such allegations as I refer to have been made by the Attorney-General ; and I hope that, at a later stage, we may have some information from the Minister of Trade and Customs. I ask the honorable gentleman again whether there is in his Department any information regarding the alleged trusts and combines referred to by the Attorney-General ? </para>

                                <para>- I am asking for the names of trusts that are said to be operating injuriously in Australia at the present moment. Specific inquiries were made regarding an alleged Beef Trust, and none was found to exist; and there is information to that effect in the Department of Trade and Customs. It is strange to hear Labour members raising these questions as to cost of living against a Labour Government. In Queensland the Liberal Government was said to be responsible; and I think I hear the honorable member for Ballarat say "So they were." If we take the figures for 1914, which are the latest available in the Library, we find that the purchasing power in the various capital cities is represented by the following: - Sydney, 24s. Id.; Melbourne, 22s. Id.; Adelaide, 22s. 10d.; Perth, 22s. 10d.; Hobart, 21s. 10d.; and Brisbane, 19s. lid - an average of 22s. lOd. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> in giving some later figures, adds a comment to the effect that it will be observed that "Western Australia is the most expensive and Queensland the cheapest State. This shows at once that all those allegations about the high price of food in Queensland were merely made for political purposes. In New South Wales, where there has been a Labour Government for years, we find practically the highest rate, namely, 24s. Id. in Sydney, as against 19s. lid. in Brisbane. What are the remedies that are to be applied? What has the Labour Government of New South Wales done to reduce the cost of living? When it is sought to make political capital out of our present circumstances, it is only reasonable to ask the Government, as the honorable member for Cook has done, to frame some policy. Members of this House and Labour senators went to Queensland during the elections, and strongly denounced the late Government for doing nothing to reduce the cost of living; and it is only fair that a Labour member should now challenge the Commonwealth Executive to come down with a distinct policy. </para>

                                <para>- It is only right that, the Government should be asked to show how they are going to reduce the cost of living. Complaints are made in Queensland and other States as to the high price of butter; but I can say that, in my own constituency, in many instances, the cost of production has been higher than the price realized in the market. While the price was 2s. per lb., farmers in many districts found that the cost of production was something like 2s. 6d., or, at any rate, considerably in excess of the return. Throughout the drought these men on the land found their stock dying, their capital diminishing, and their overdrafts rising; and yet the people in the cities were urging, as a magnificent remedy, the reduction of the price of butter to possibly ls. 3d. per lb. And similar circumstances have prevailed in other directions. In New South Wales, with the wheat grab at 5s. a bushel, the return received by the farmer was, in many instances, less than the cost of ploughing and planting. Of course.- there were cases in which the farmer got higher rates; and I am only urging that such problems as these have to be faced squarely and fairly. All that the farmer gets as wages is produced out of the land. He has no Wages Board or standard wage for times of depression, but he must stand the brunt of bad seasons and all other untoward conditions. Yet, although a drought was over the land, the only remedy suggested was a cutting down of prices below cost. If that is the remedy proposed by the Government, it is based on injustice and iniquity, and will bring its own retribution. No remedy will be satisfactory that does not do justice all round. If we are going to regulate prices we must remember what the farmer has to bear during bad seasons. He must buy agricultural implements and other goods manufactured in the cities under Wages Board conditions ; and during the drought the rates of wages in the cities were kept at the highest. Thus the brunt of the drought, with its consequent loss and suffering, is borne by the primary producers. There is no suggestion that at such a time a Board should reduce the cost of the articles he requires - no suggestion that boots, timber, or his necessary labour should be made cheaper. It is extraordinary that during a drought there is never any idea of reducing wages in the cities, but always the suggestion that the prices of the products of the primary producers shall be lowered. Such an idea is grossly unjust and unfair, and productive of the greatest hardship in the country districts. In all these matters the sense of justice ought to be the basis of our legislation, but I find that honorable members opposite, in their attitude towards this matter, deal only with the products of primary industries. Butter may be quoted as an illustration. That is one subject upon, which a good deal has been said. To arrive at the true position we ought to ascertain the facts.

                        <para class="block">In Queensland it is shown that the men enjoy just about the highest effective wages, and applying that test to butter as an illustration, we find that the only* burden the people in the big centres of Queensland are called upon to bear in consequence of the drought is the extra price for butter, which, at the most, amounts to a couple of shillings per week. There has been no reduction in a standard wage at all. </para>

That is the whole burden that these people have had placed upon them. </para>

" But the honorable member is drawing me away from the point by his incursion into party politics. Whenever there is national distress, honorable members opposite talk about the cost of the necessities of life, but as a matter of fact they deal with only three or four things which, as I have shown, are the primary products. They do not talk about reducing the price of the products of the factories in the cities at all. But I am not saying that they should. I am only asking for a fair and square deal all round. If regulation is good for one thing it is good for another. It is not right to talk only of regulating the price of products produced by only one class in the community. </para>

                                <para>- If there is a trust or combine injuriously affecting the price of agricultural implements, or if there is any trust or combine likewise affecting the production of boots, clothing, foodstuffs, or anything else, such trust or combine ought to be subject to the strongest condemnation. I have always taken that attitude. But honorable members opposite appear to think that trusts and combines are concerned only with the primary products. They talk only of three or four things, such as meat, butter, food, milk, and cheese, when any reference is made to regulating prices of products, and under these circumstances, if any attempt is made at regulation, it will break down hopelessly. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> was quite right the other day when he said that there were certain economic values which could not be interfered with. If, for instance, the Labour party in Queensland attempted to pass an Act dealing with the price of butter, and to declare that it should not exceed ls. 6d. under existing conditions, many farmers would be unable to carry on. He would have to close down altogether. If, as the Minister states, there are worse combinations than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, he would be quite right in exposing them, and in bringing public opinion to bear upon them. But they have not even adopted the Canadian system of giving publicity to the operations of combines. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> name is given. This is not fair dealing, and I again ask the Minister in charge of the House to inform us what are these trusts and combines which are said to be worse than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and which are exploiting the Australian public. </para>

                                <para>- In one part of his statement the Attorney-General stated that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company deliberately exported 3,000 tons of Fiji sugar lying in bond in Australia on 26th April, si* days before they approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> to draw his attention to the probable shortage. From that statement, made by the Attorney-General, the public were given to understand that the company were concealing the facts from the Government, but it is rather interesting to learn from the Minister of Trade and Customs what really was the position. Yesterday he told us he did not know whether any evidence had been given before the Commission. The Minister yesterday did not know whether any of his officers had given evidence, but now he admits that the company did export the sugar after having applied to the Federal Government, of which the Attorney-General is a member. They obtained permission to bring this Fiji sugar into Australia in order that it could be refined here, with the express object of giving employment to Australian workmen. If the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had been as unscrupulous and regardless of Australian interests as the 'Attorney-General would have us believe, they could have sent that sugar straight away from Fiji, and Australia would have been the loser by the transaction. It was a wise arrangement to provide employment for Australian workmen, but the Attorney-General and his colleagues should not now seek to hold this company up to ridicule and contempt in the eyes of the Australian public for that very reason. That one little incident gives a fair idea of the value of the whole of the report. I hope, therefore, that the Government will allow us to see the evidence upon which the statement was based, so that we can read it ourselves, and know exactly what was the information upon which the Attorney-General acted. In conclusion, I wish to say that I think the Minister of Trade and Customs treated very unjustly the members of the Food Supply Commission, which was constituted by the previous Government to make certain inquiries regarding the position in Australia. They were eminently qualified for that task. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson is a man than whom no one stands higher in the estimation, of the whole commercial community of Australia for integrity, ability, and sincerity, as well as for capacity for sound judgment and wise discretion. Those honorable members who served in this Parliament with him know that a fairer-minded man never entered the halls of this Parliament. He was one of the Commissioners. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin, who is so well and favorably known to us all personally, was another, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> a conscientious public officer, was the third man. Immediately they were appointed they entered whole-heartedly upon their duties, and spent night and day doing their best in the interests of the people of Australia. It is all very well for honorable members of the Government who came in some weeks afterwards, and when things were running more smoothly, to suggest that the appointment was unnecessary. We have to remember what was the position of Australia when war broke out, and what chaos existed in the commercial world. These three gentlemen had to survey the whole of the commercial conditions as they were affected by the rupture brought about by the war. They did their duty well, and the report which was presented to us conveyed no idea of the amount of work which they were called upon to do. Instead of treating them cavalierly, as the Minister did, it would have been better if the honorable gentleman had taken a more patriotic view of the whole position. As one who was closely associated with the members of the Commission in the beginning of their work, I am sorry that they were not allowed to continue, because they could have done a great deal of very useful work for Australia. If their powers were not sufficiently wide, the Government could have done as we did in connexion with the Beef Trust Commission, and passed an Act of Parliament giving them authority to call for the production of books, papers, documents, and everything else necessary for the prosecution of their investigation. </para>

                            <para>. - I had the pleasure of listening to the opening remarks of the honorable member for Darling Downs, and I was reminded by them of an early dictionary definition of a crayfish. It stated that it was a red fish that walked backwards. It was stated later that that definition of a crayfish was wrong in only three particulars, seeing that it was not a fish, it was not red, and it did not walk backwards. It was not my intention to speak on the motion had not the honorable member for Darling Downs, in making a comparison of the cost of living in Queensland with the cost in other States, quoted misleading figures. The honorable gentleman quoted the figures for March, and, though they may have  been  correct at the time, they have been altered by later figures. </para>

The figures are given for five towns in each State, and with respect to the capital cities, I find that in Sydney the increase was 8 per cent. ; in Melbourne, 16 per cent.; in Adelaide, 14 per cent. ; in Perth, 11 per cent. ; in Hobart, 14 per cent. ; and in Brisbane,. 21 per cent. Unfortunately for the honorable member for Toowoomba, the centre of his own district has the record increase for Australia. </para>

                                <para>- It is not because of the drought. The increase in Brisbane was 21 per cent.; in  Toowoomba, 27 per cent.; in Rockhampton, 13 per cent. ; in Charters Towers and in Warwick, 21 per cent. ; and there is only one other city or town in Australia that comes nearer to the figure for Toowoomba than 23 per cent., and that is Mount Gambier, in South Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Sydney is represented by the figure 1,098, Brisbane by the figure 1,129, and Toowoomba by the figure 1,159. That shows the comparative cost of living, and yet the honorable member for Darling Downs has been trying to show that in this matter Queensland is better off than are the other States. I am willing to confess that I am not greatly concerned as to whether Queensland is worse or better off than the other States in the matter of the cost of living. I try to look at the question from an Australian point of view, and whether there is a slight decrease in one State and an increase in another, the fact is incontrovertible that all over Australia to-day the cost of living is very high. Our attention should be directed not so much to pointing out who is to blame, or to charging certain political parties with the blame, but to finding out the causes of the increase, and to seeking for a remedy. During the last Queensland elections I accused the Liberal party there of being responsible for the high cost of living in that State. </para>

                                <para>- It was admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> in a policy speech, and by every one who was aware of the facts, that, although Queensland does not grow enough wheat for her own consumption, she exported no less than 100,000 bushels of wheat. We had also the fact, admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> that £8,000 could have been made by his own firm by speculating in wheat ; yet in his policy speech he said that there had been no speculation in wheat. The honorable member for Darling Downs wishes to know the causes of the increase iu the cost of living, and I say that it is due, in a large measure, to speculators cornering wheat and holding it for high prices. They " bear " the market at one time, and "bull" it at another, and simply gamble the whole time with the food of the people from the clay the seed is sown until the wheat is ready to be sent to the mill. For the seven months ending January of this year Queensland exported 600,000 lbs. of butter more than she exported during the similar period of the preceding year. Queensland was not short of butter. She had more to spare than she had in the previous year. What caused the high price of butter in Melbourne and in Brisbane? Victoria was short of butter, and Melbourne speculators bought heavily in Queensland. They filled the cold stores to overflowing. They did with it exactly what was done with the wheat supply. They doled it out only in small quantities, with the result that people in Victoria anxious to obtain butter could not get it. The speculators held it back in Brisbane. They sent down small shipments as it suited them to do so. Upon one shipment of butter alone from Queensland to Victoria, no less than £9,000 profit was made by the speculators. I said during the Queensland election, and I repeat now, that these men were doing what the laws of the country permitted them to do. As speculators, it was their business to hold back supplies, and, when it suited them, to unload in sufficient quantities to keep up the price. The people of Melbourne and of Brisbane had to pay high prices, not because there was a shortage, but because the gamblers in butter operated in Brisbane, and held back supplies from Victoria; and, as a consequence, both States had to pay high prices. The same thing might be said with regard to sugar, wheat, and other commodities. What I object to is that the laws of the country should allow any one to hold up, gamble, and speculate with the food of the people. The honorable members for Cook and Bourke claimed that the Federal Government had at the present time the power to stop that kind of thing. </para>

                                <para>- The Government would have to come to this Parliament to reduce duties, and perhaps in a week or two we shall have an opportunity to deal with. that aspect of the question. In the meantime, unless th© State Governments take action in this matter, the Federal Government is absolutely powerless. All that we are asking for by the proposed referenda is that the Federal Government should have the same power to deal with these matters as that possessed by the State Governments. We have had an illustration of what one State can do. The Government of New South Wales exerted their sovereign powers, and commandeered the supply of wheat. The High Court held that they were justified. I think that every honorable member will admit, although, perhaps, reluctantly in some cases, that the New South Wales Government took the proper action so far as their people particularly were concerned. They may have been selfish, and may have laid themselves open to the charge of disloyalty to the rest of Australia; but they acted in the interests of the people of New South Wales. Before the elections in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> stated that next year there will inevitably be a heavy shortage of sugar, and he was prepared to commandeer the whole of the sugar crop in Queensland, and let the other States look after themselves. This was suggested in retaliation for what the New South Wales Government had done in commandeering the wheat supply of that State. I say that the New South Wales Government could have done no better under the existing circumstances; but I say, also, that the Federal Government should have the power to do for Australia what the New South Wales Government did for New South Wales. </para>

                                <para>- Unfortunately for the honorable member, his statement will not bear the test of investigation, because exactly the same difficulty is experienced in Free Trade countries, and in countries where the protective incidence of the Tariff is not so high as it is here. In the Motherland to-day the prices prevailing are as high, if not higher, than the prices prevailing here. The increase in prices there may be due to the war, but it is not due to the war in Australia. It may be due, to some extent, to the drought, but it is chiefly due to the operations of speculators. Here is an illustration of how the thing works: There are eighteen men in Sydney who practically control the business of New South Wales and Queensland. Their names are- - </para>

                                <para>- I will accept responsibility for them. I am* not going to shelter myself behind anybody. There is the secret of the high cost of living. In Australia there is a combination of commercial men, just as there axe similar combinations in the country where the trusts are most powerful - I refer to America. These men absolutely determine, nob only where men shall live, what they shall wear, and what they shall eat, but the prices which they shall pay for commodities. </para>

                                <para>- I accept responsibility for the statements which I have read. The fact remains that to-day the retailers of this country who sell commodities to the people do not control the prices of those commodities. They practically have no voice in the prices which they charge. Their profits are cut down to a minimum ; and they are so entirely in the hands of trusts and combines that they are compelled to buy in a certain direction, at a certain rate, and also to sell to the public at a certain rate. I will give an illustration. There is a firm of merchants in Brisbane which placed an order with the Melbourne agents for the Canadian Fish Packing Company for a certain brand of tinned fish. That order was accepted. But a few days later the firm received a letter from these agents - the letter is now in the hands of the Attorney-General - intimating that owing to the pressure of the Brisbane Merchants Association they were unable to accept the order, and advising the firm in question to make its purchase through that Association. In other words, this firm could not-get its goods other than at a price stipulated by a third party. </para>

                                <para>- No. The honorable member knows that there is in this country - just as there is in America and Europe - the system of interlocking directorates. That is to say, the men who form the directorate of one company are also the directors of other companies. The arrangement is a very clever business one. Legally these men are perfectly justified in their action. But the people who say that they own this country, and who should have the right to control their food supplies and methods of living, are absolutely helpless in the hands of these commercial magnates. We have established Wages Boards, and we have been told that the high cost of living is due to the high rates of wages which obtain. My experience is that the high cost of living is responsible for the repeated demands for increased wages. Only a few weeks ago I saw in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> the report of an address by a gentleman who I am assured is a well-know supporter of honorable members opposite. He had* just returned from a two years' visit to England, and he spoke before a meeting of the Victorian Hardware Association. He told that meeting that much had been said about the strikes which occurred in the Old Country, that he had been there, and that, so far from criticising the men because of their action, they were absolutely justified in going upon strike. He pointed out that since the outbreak of the war the cost of goods had increased so much that what a sovereign would purchase previously - he spoke in February of the present year - then required an expenditure of 24s. He told his hearers that this was not due to the goods being scarce, but merely to the fact that people were holding them to reap an extra profit. Honorable members know that in Australia, immediately war was declared, the prices of goods held in stock were increased - even the prices of drugs - to an enormous extent. The war was made a convenient excuse to put up prices. The cost of goods that were nob affected in the least degree by the war was. immediately raised. Yet honorable members opposite complain that the working man is getting unreasonable and is demanding outrageous wages. The surprise to me is that he- is so modest. So far from the cost of living being due to the higher rate of wages being paid, </para>

                        </continue><para class="block">I say that the cost of living compels wage-earners to demand higher rates of wages. It is no use burking the fact that the margin between the ordinary worker's wages to-day and the cost of living has disappeared. This is not a laughing matter. It is a serious one, and is particularly serious seeing that unemployment is so prevalent. If a man's employment fails him for two or three weeks, he is now right down on his beam ends. I invite honorable members opposite to address themselves not so much to the question of who is to blame for the increased cost of living, so far as political parties are concerned, as to what are the institutions in the community which control the food of the people and make them pay unreasonable prices for it. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- Not only in Australia, but in every country in the world, the people are faced with the perplexing problem of how to make it easier for the masses to live, how to so accommodate wages to food and the necessaries of life that conditions will be more advantageous to the workers. Some time ago, I came across a very interesting table of computation in this direction. I have not it with me, but I remember the facts perfectly well. It set out that in the case of the lower-paid men of the community - that is, men who are receiving up to £80 a year - the necessaries of life cost 95 per cent, of their wages, leaving them only 5 per cent, with which to purchase the comforts and conveniences of life, to defray the cost of extra education, and to cover contributions to friendly societies,. &amp;c. </para>

                                <para>- Let me finish my statement. As wages go up the proportion for necessaries decreases, and the proportion for comforts and extras increases, until the man who is getting the higher wage can live more cheaply, and has more money left, proportionately, for recreation, improvement, education, and other things than the man at the bottom. That is the wrong way about. We contend that the man on the low-wage scale should have as fair a margin as the man on the high-wage scale. The Leader of the Opposition has reminded me that the cost of living has gone up 12s. as against an increase of 4s. for wages. </para>

                                <para>- In the Old Country, it has gone up at the rate of 25 per cent. The trouble is that the increased cost of living, as I have been trying to argue, is not confined to this country. It is not confined to Labour Governments or to Liberal Governments; it has a worldwide aspect. </para>

If I could believe with the honorable members for Cook and Bourke that the Federal Government have the power to do the things they ask, I would be with them in denouncing the Government. But I believe that the Government are hobbled and unable to do what is asked by those honorable members. When the time does come to submit once more to the people a request for additional powers to this Parliament, I think that we will receive a better answer than we got the last time. </para>

                            <para>. -This afternoon we listened to two speeches from members sitting behind the Government that were somewhat remarkable, because both were strongly condemnatory of the inaction of Ministers in regard to the important matters covered by the amendment. The speech of the honorable member for Bourke was avowedly hostile.  His  expressions were those to which we were accustomed when the members of the Labour party were in opposition to a Liberal Government, and asked day after day, " What is the Government doing to reduce the cost of living?" They declared that the Government should do something to relieve the situation. The honorable member for Bourke is the only member of the party whose attitude is unchanged. He has told the House that the Government have the power to improve things if they choose to exert it. The honorable member for Cook travelled on the same line, and, although his hostility to the Government was not so pronounced, he clearly evidenced his discontent because an Administration of which so much had been expected had done so little. The speech of the honorable member for Brisbane, another Labour supporter, was intended to back up the Government. He had no fault to find with Ministers, who, in his judgment, are fulfilling all their obligations, but in reality nothing could be more scathing and condemnatory of the Government than was his speech. He has been able to go through all the capital cities of Australia, and name every individual there who is exploiting the workers by increasing the cost of living. He not only names individuals, but gives the institutions which they are said to control. He tells us that he himself is responsible for the statement he made. Having this important information, being able to put his finger upon those who are injuring the people of the Commonwealth, he has been false to his duty to his constituents, and to the country at large, in not impressing the facts of the situation on the members of the Government. The Labour party was thought to be solid, but evidently there are serious breaches in its ranks. The honorable member for Bourke was certainly not firing blank cartridge ; there was an explosive force in his remarks, which created a great deal of anger among the Government supporters. </para>

                                <para>- I am endeavouring to do so, and am trying to show that the object of the amendment is to incite the Government to give relief to the workers by doing something to reduce the cost of living. I suggest that the Government should try to restore confidence among the employers, so that, instead of capital being sent out of the country, it will be used to stimulate production as much as possible. Excluding altogether the effects of the drought, I say that our agricultural production is being seriously decreased because of the abnormal conditions created by Government measures, and the sooner we get back to normal conditions under which confidence will reign the sooner will supplies be increased and prices diminished. The promotion of new industries has been suggested as a means for decreasing the cost of living. The establishment of new industries would, no doubt, have that effect. Every true citizen wishes to see our industries multiplied so that employment may be available to as many as possible, but men will not put their capital into labour-employing industries so long as legislation tends to prevent them from getting a fair return for their money. Those who have money usually have it because they are men of common sense. Such men engage in business enterprises for the sake of profit, and if you make it almost impossible for them to obtain a profit on their operations you create conditions inevitably leading to an increase in the cost of living. According to the Government Statistician - I take my information from page 259 of the last Labour bulletin issued - wages have increased each year from 1901 to 1914. </para>

                                <para>- I am not prepared to give credit to the Tariff for everything, though I am certain that every increase in protective duties means a corresponding increase, in the cost of' living, and therefore to that extent the Tariff is responsible. The contention of honorable members opposite appears to be that the more money the working man passes through his hands the better off he is. But it is obvious that if wages are increased all along the line the cost of the commodities produced must be advanced. Take, for example, the production of wheat. The ploughman has to be paid more; the man who sows the ground has to be paid more; the man who reaps the crop has to be paid more ; the man working on the threshing machine has to be paid more ; the man who carts the wheat to the railway station has to be paid more; every man in the flour mill has to be paid more ; and every man in the bakehouse has to be paid more. The inevitable consequence of all these increases is that the cost of the commodity to the consumer must be advanced.. If we could raise the wages in one particular branch only, leaving the wages in all other lines unaltered, the individuals concerned in that particular line would benefit materially; but, inasmuch a3 everybody in every line has to get an advance, wages are increased from start to finish, and consequently the cost of living increases. That is my answer to the question put by the honorable member for Indi. </para>

                                <para>- " There are none so blind as those who will not see." I have sought to show the Government that the policy of creating artificial conditions is unsound, and that the contention that the more men receive in the shape of wages the better off they are is a fallacy, which has been demonstrated by the figures of the Federal Statistician. I now appeal to the Government, in the words of the honorable member for Bourke, " to do something." When honorable members opposite were on this side of the House they were ever urging that something should be done. They have now been in office for over ten months, and they have not brought in a single measure or performed a single action that has brought about any improvement in the conditions of the workers. All that they have done has been to create a still greater degree of dissatisfaction in the minds of the workers, which is one of the very things that are making for the undoing of our Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>.- In referring to the agricultural industry, in his endeavour to show that the higher wages paid to the men employed on harvestors, those doing the  stooking,  and those carting the grain, tended to increase the cost of living, the honorable member for Echuca forgot one very important factor, namely, that the ever-increasing efficiency of machinery is continually tending to decrease the cost of production. To-day, although wages in the agricultural industry have had a badly-needed increase, it is cheaper to harvest a field of 100 acres than it was twenty years ago, machinery, to a great extent, having superseded the necessity for employing labour. The same argument applies to nearly every industry. Many people believe that the increase in the price of boots is due to the increased wages paid to the employees in the boot factories ; but the Federal Statistician has shown conclusively that, whereas four years ago the workers received £28 out of every £100 worth of boots produced, to-day he is not getting quite £28 out of every £100 worth produced, notwithstanding he has received an increase in wages. The reason is to be found in the fact that every month, or every week, newer and more effective machinery is being introduced into this industry, tending to make labour still more effective and productive. As long as this condition of affairs continues, there must be a spirit of discontent among our working classes. I trust that they will never be satisfied to put up with small wages while they see other people becoming wealthier by their efforts. </para>

The Minister of Trade and Customs has reminded me that the manufacturers in the boot industry do not buy this machinery; they pay a royalty on it. </para>

                                <para>- First, it is the argument of high wages; then it is the cost of machinery; then it is the royalty; and, lastly, it is the rent. Honorable members ascribe the increased cost of produce to anything but the true cause, which is, that a few people of great wealth are manipulating the articles that have been created by the many. That is why we have, on this side of the chamber, a spirit of discontent. We realize that all is not being done that ought to be done. </para>

I wish to reply to some of the statements that were made by honorable members on this side of the House when the honorable member for Bourke uttered his protest against what he termed the inactivity of the present occupants of the Ministerial bench. I hope that I am a faithful member of the Labour party, and loyal to its principles, but I have yet to learn that, because I sit on a bench behind the Government, I am to remain for ever silent though I think the movement of the party is not going fast enough. And I am told by some honorable members that the place of the honorable member for Bourke is on the other side of the chamber. </para>

I believe, with the honorable member for Bourke, that we do possess these powers, and I am fortified in that belief by the opinions expressed by some of our constitutional 'authorities. Let us see what our present Attorney-General has said. There is one quotation which I cannot use, but which, if I could use it, would strongly fortify the position taken up by the honorable member for Bourke. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell,</inline> 3LC, in questioning the validity of the Enemy Contracts Annulment Bill, said that he believed that it was unconstitutional, and the Attorney-General next day, in criticising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell's</inline> statement, said - </para>

It is imperative, therefore, that we should take every precaution to safeguard the community against a shortage of sugar. The Government have exercised their power to take such steps as are necessary to insure the availability of an adequate supply. </para>

                        <para class="block">I argue from this that it cannot be denied that the Government have power to buy sugar to supply the requirements of our troops at Broadmeadows; that no one can doubt that the Government have power to buy sugar to supply the requirements of men employed by us in building the transcontinental railway, of the men making boots for our troops at Broadmeadows, of the men and women making clothing for the men at Broadmeadows, or the requirements of those engaged in making ammunition for our soldiers. Wo one will question our power to buy fodder and to sell it to those engaged in the manufacture of these several commodities. We can do this because the Empire is at war, and it is necessary that our troops should be maintained. I believe - and I wish I could induce the Ministry to see eye to eye with me - that just as it is essential for the Government to provide sugar or wheat for the men engaged in making war materiel, so it is equally essential to buy sugar and other requirements for the men who are ploughing our fields and growing the wheat to be turned into flour for the use of the men who are fighting our battles. It requires no stretch of imagination to believe that the Commonwealth Government has the necessary power to enter into commerce to-day in  respect of practically every line that is required for our people. When a few oi us hold that opinion, and hold it very strongly, I am surprised that we should be denounced by any member of the Labour party for giving expression to it in Parliament. Surely the provision of cheap food for the people is, next to that of the war, the most important question that we have to discuss to-day. The families of our soldiers at Broadmeadows and at the Dardanelles are receiving an allowance that is not very large, and day by day that allowance is being depleted by the operations of certain people here. But we are making practically no attempt to deal with these people. I am glad that the honorable member for Cook has submitted this amendment, since it has opened up this discussion. </para>

I am not prepared to remain silent when I think that things are not being done which ought to be done by the Government, and when I believe they have the necessary power to attend to them. I would sooner hand in my resignation, walk out of the Labour party, and be finished with it than remain silent in such circumstances. I do not think it is the desire of the majority of honorable members on this side of the House that I should be stifled. The honorable member for Hunter and one or two more may think that I should be; but the majority of our party are Democrats, and believe that an honorable member is merely exercising an undoubted right in voicing his opinions in this House. These are the opinions I hold, and I hope that as the outcome of this discussion the Government will immediately take action. It would be idle to adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Moreton that the State Governments should be asked to agree to an alteration of the Constitution. </para>

                                <para>- If one State remained outside the compact, the trusts and monopolies operating in Australia would have their registered offices in that State, Since there are five State Labour Governments in Australia, some may ask why this suggestion should not be adopted. I hold that it is not practicable. What is more, I believe that such an appeal is unnecessary, since we already have the requisite power. We have power to do anything we deem desirable. We have shown that we possess it by commandeering woollen goods in the various stores, and no one has dared to object to that action on the part of the Government. Having the power, the Government should exercise it. I would go even further, and say that, even if we had not the constitutional power, we should nevertheless take this action. </para>

                                <para>- I believe that it ought to be done, and that the people ought to be protected. The question with which we are faced is a serious one. If we could foresee the end of the war - if we knew that it was going to end a week or two hence - the question would not be so serious as it is; it must be most serious while the war lasts, and I hope that the Government will do something. It has been argued that we, who speak in this way, want to confiscate the earnings of the farmer. We desire nothing of the sort. I do not want to take from any man anything that he has justly earned or created. At the same time, I do not think that one section of the community, because of the war, should benefit at the expense of every other section. There are a number of people in this country who claim to be patriots. In the last three months of 1913 England exported 1,000,000 lbs. of tea, whereas in the last three months of 1914 she exported to Holland alone 16,000,000 lbs. of tea. This was done because an extra 3d. per lb. could be procured, and the tea went through Holland to Germany. What did these men care about supplying the enemy with food or stimulants? The figures in regard to the export of cocoa from England to Holland are very much the same. German doctors have said that tea and cocoa are the best stimulants their soldiers could have, and Germany went to merchants in Great Britain to secure these stimulants. There are many people who talk patriotism, but do not practise it to any extent. They are making an immense profit out of the war. In this country alone there are a few who will be millionaires after the war, but while it lasts there will be a good deal of suffering among the wives and children of the men who have gone to the front. Holding these views, I support the amendment, because, while I think it is inadequate, I hope that the Government will do something stronger in the near future. </para>

                            <para>.- I can well understand that the honorable member for Cook, the honorable member for Ballarat, and several other members of the Labour party should desire the Government to give effect to their policy. It is only natural that they should; but I find it difficult to understand why they have not learned by now that certain gentlemen occupying high positions in their party would regard the action which these honorable members are urging upon them as the very last that should be taken. </para>

                        <para class="block">Labour party, know perfectly well, in the first place, that if they attempted to carry out that policy it would fail; and, secondly, that they would thus be deprived of a political cry which has carried them to victory over and over again in Australia. That is their position in a nut-shell. They have sufficient acumen to know that their boasted policy of regulating prices, once it was applied in a general way, would break down, and that by its failure they would be robbed of a political cry which has done so much for them. Let us consider for a moment what has been the result of the one or two attempts that have been made to regulate certain prices in Australia. A little while ago they regulated the price of sugar, and did so, no doubt, with the very best of intentions. </para>

                                <para>- They may have done so; but I am not selecting any particular Government for criticism. I am referring to this matter only by way of illustration, because the regulation of prices is part of the acknowledged policy of the Labour party. They would regulate prices, not only in time of war, when there might be special reasons for attempting to do something of the sort, but in times of peace. I am taking this one attempt to regulate the price of sugar in order to show that the policy, not only does, but must, inevitably break down in the long run, and that arbitrary interference with the general course of trade, in almost every instance, ultimately results in higher prices than would have had to be paid. In New South Wales the price of sugar was fixed at £21, and in Victoria at £21 2s. 6d., whilst in Queensland the price was allowed to go to £23. I think that this was most injudicious, and, that if the circumstances had been fairly considered, it would not have been done. A reference to the statistics will show that the average price of sugar in Australia, over a number of years, was considerably more than the price fixed by the Commodities Boards. This action, as the honorable member for Moreton has pointed out, was of no benefit to the consumer. </para>

                                <para>- I wish to deal with one particular phase of the question. The fixing of prices did not affect the consumer. The grocers in New South Wales continued' to sell their sugar at the same price as they had been charging for a number of years. The price of sugar had risen and fallen from time to time, but the grocers had simply resolved to sell the sugar for 3d. per lb. across the counter, and to abide by the rise and fall of the market. At the time at which the price of sugar was fixed the ruling price was £21 per ton  all  over Australia. The grocers were selling the sugar at 3d. per lb., and when the wholesale price was raised in Queensland to £23 per ton, the grocers in that State, and also in Victoria, still continued to sell at 3d., and the only people who got any advantage from the fixing of prices in New South Wales and Victoria were the middlemen. But that is not the serious part of the position. It was well known to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company some considerable time ago that there must be a big shortage in the sugar crop. </para>

                                <para>- The company were certain of that prospective shortage in March, at any rate. In all probability they had a suspicion of such a state of things a little earlier, and I venture to say that if the company had been free agents in February last, they would have immediately secured such supplies of sugar as they thought the circumstances would warrant, and that sugar could have been bought then, and landed in Australia right through this period of scarcity, which we are about to pass through, at -£23 per ton. Moreover, it would have been landed in Australia at that price. We know that to-day it is impossible for the company to land and hold sugar in bond in Australia at under £25 per ton, and the consequence will be that immediately our supplies are exhausted, they will be obliged to immediately raise the price of sugar, even if the duty is taken off, to £25 per ton, and the consumers ;all over Australia will have to pay more  for  their supplies. The Commodities Boards cannot in fairness and justice reduce the price after that date. We know that in all probability our Australian crop will be exhausted by the end of March, and goodness knows what we will have to pay for sugar after that date if the war is not at an end. The position in regard to sugar is just one  instance  of the absolute harm that has attended the attempt to fix prices. But that is not the end of the evil, because in regard to the far greater proportion of the sugar supplies, if the price had gone up to £23 per ton, as would have been only reasonable at the time, the growers of all but the small proportion produced in New South Wales, would have received out of every £1 increase 18s. and the company 2s. The Minister of Trade and Customs must know that my statement as to where the increased price goes is absolutely true. The agreement under which the company buys sugar at the mills is that of every £1 increase above £19, 18s. goes to the producers of the raw sugar - who, in most instances, are the growers themselves, because they are interested in the cooperative mills - and the company gets only 2s. </para>

They would not, of course, get the benefit of the rise in regard to raw sugar which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had purchased and held at that time; that is to say,, the producers would not have got the benefit of any rise in regard to sugar actually held by the company at the time, but those producers who had not sold their raw sugar would have derived the benefit. </para>

                                <para>- They would not have held it all. However, that does not affect the argument I am endeavouring to put before the House, namely, that whenever the Government attempt to arbitrarily interfere with the general operations of trade, the result, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, will be the hitting of the man whom the Government action was intended to help. Let me now deal with the butter supplies, about which there has been a good deal of argument in this House during the last few weeks. I heard one honorable member say that there are vast stocks of butter which the producers have hidden away, and will not put on the market. I only wish that the Government would straight away appoint a man to go through every cool chamber in every butter factory and store throughout the Commonwealth ; if . that were done - it would be found that there is not a single box of butter stored away anywhere. </para>

                                <para>- I have not been on the south coast, but that country is responsible for a comparatively small proportion of the butter production of New South Wales. Nobody should know better than the honorable member that nine-tenths of the milk produced in his district is sent either to the factories or "direct to Sydney to supply the wants of the metropolis. Yet the honorable member would tell the House that, because there was a good season in the district he represents, there must necessarily be an ample supply of butter in Sydney. One of my complaints against honorable members opposite is that, being cognisant of these facts, they still endeavour to bolster up a case which they know to be absolutely rotten. The honorable member for Illawarra must know that the milk produced in his district is not being converted into butter; yet, if I were not conversant with the facts, the honorable member would endeavour to upset my argument by his interjection. </para>

                                <para>- It does apply to the area that is supplying the greater portion of the milk. Practically as far south as Nowra, which country, with the exception of the Bega district, comprises the whole extent of the dairying country along the south coast, nearly every drop of milk produced is sent to Sydney. Honorable members opposite believe that prices should be regulated. The Commodities Board fixed the price of butter in New South Wales, and what has been the net result? </para>

                                <para>- I know it is cheaper ; but let us endeavour to look a little further than our own noses, and bring our considerations down to the bedrock of common sense. The average farmer is not a born fool; he has just as much brains and intelligence as has any one of us. I do not suppose that he is actuated by any peculiar motives of philanthropy or any altruistic notions about working himself to death for the benefit of others. After all, the dairy farmers in New South Wales are endeavouring to make a living, and they look at the present situation from the same stand-point as most people, do - as to how they are likely to most benefit their own pockets. Until recently there had been in the district I represent no rain from the beginning of the year, and the paddocks, instead of being well stocked with grass, were, to a large extent, bare, because shortly after the rain fell the cold weather set in, and the grass did not grow. I have never seen the cattle on the Richmond River looking so miserable. Many of those in milk are in wretched condition, and cows about to calve are in very poor condition, too. Nothing knocks dairy stock about so much as milking them in winter, and the farmer puts this pro position before himself : " Is it going to pay me to knock my stock about by milking them through this hard winter, to receive, at the most, ls. Id. per lb. for my butter, and to run the risk of losing some of my cattle; or will it not be more profitable to dry off as many cows as possible, and give them a spell?" </para>

                                <para>- It is a simple proposition. If the price went up to 2s. a lb., the farmer would say to himself, " Well, I have an additional inducement to buy better feed, and endeavour to keep a few more cows in milk during the winter, so that in spring, instead of keeping the cows dry, and having to wait three or four months for a return, I shall immediately benefit from the spring weather." </para>

                                <para>-I say that they may at the present time. Cannot the honorable member see that if an inducement is held out now to farmers to keep their cows in milk during the winter, they will, when the spring comes with the warm weather, have two or three times as many cows in milk as they probably would otherwise have at the end of the winter, under existing circumstances, in New South Wales, and that' the immediate result will be to increase supplies and bring the price down ? Cannot the honorable member see that the policy which he is advocating means that hundreds, if not thousands, oil milking cows will be dried off to save their lives at the present time, and that, instead of the price falling to a normal level, as it ought about the end of August, it will not fall until probably October or November ? </para>

                                <para>- I am talking, not of milk, but of butter. Had I with me some statistics which are in my room in Parliament House, 1 could show honorable members what has been the growth of the co-operative movement in the butter industry on the northern rivers of New South Wales. From a return of £10,000 in the first year of the movement, the figure has risen to £2,000,000" last year; and practically every lb. of butter is marketed through co-operative channels. The men who established these factories, and, by their' own initiative and enterprise, built up this great industry, have by further co-operative efforts practically eliminated the speculator and the middlemen from Sussex-street, in Sydney. This is a magnificent triumph for organization and co-operation. Honorable members opposite ought to cease talking about the regulation of prices and the institution of Socialism - to cease talking about the capitalist, and raving against the capitalistic system - and bend the whole of the energies which they undoubtedly possess to inducing the trades unions of the country, instead of spending half-a-million a year in paying organizers to keep the whole community in strife, to devote themselves to the establishment of the co-operative system from one end of Australia to the other. By this means infinitely more would be done towards the solution pf the problem of the ever-increasing cost of living than all the Parliaments in the wide world could accomplish. </para>

                                <para>- Then I say that the honorable member is probably the worst result that co-operation has ever brought into this world. So far as the regulation of prices is concerned, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the man is hit whom we are trying to help. If we are to do anything in the way of really reducing the cost of living, the great secret, in my opinion, is in the application of the principles of co-operation. What the dairymen of the northern rivers of New South Wales, and also the dairymen of Victoria, have accomplished, I believe could be accomplished in regard to a great many other commodities; and I suggest that  honorable  members opposite should give more study to this question than they have yet done. Another suggestion made is that we should endeavour by a careful analysis of the position to ascertain, well ahead of the actual event, the probable shortage in commodities, and in that way make the Government acquainted with the position, so that they might, by the importation, secure in advance sufficient to carry  us  over a shortage. It always seems to me, however, when we come to examine these nostrums, or suggestions, or whatever you like to call them, that, in the light of practical experience, they nearly all break down. The honorable member for Cook has said that if we had only seen sufficiently far ahead we could have imported all the fodder we required to carry us over a very difficult period. </para>

                                <para>- Apart altogether from the question of where we were to get it from, does the true position not immediately present itself? Let us suppose that the forthcoming shortage had been discovered as early as the end of last November, when we probably could have arrived at an approximation of the shortage of fodder in Australia. Let us suppose, further, that the Government, with all the machinery at their disposal, had decided to send cable messages for fodder from the Argentine, California, and elsewhere in order to prevent prices rising. Let us still further suppose that the Government had carried out this plan, and that the ships were all on the water and timed to arrive in the first and second week in January and after. Now, if abundant rain had occurred in the first week in January, what would have been the result ? </para>

                                <para>- I say that a very great deal would not have been required. Further, by the time we had purchased oversea, and brought the fodder here, we should have found that, under the circumstances, whatever we sold would be at a loss, and probably a balance would <inline font-style="italic">\&gt;e</inline> left unsold. After all is said and done, we are the creatures of  circumstances.  If we had the prescience of the Almighty we might be able to so regulate the affairs of the nation that, in regard to many commodities, we would be able to steer clear of difficulties; but I venture to say that when we come to examine the plans proposed, we must admit that they are almost bound to fail. I now only desire to say that, in my opinion, in a time of war, any one who is guilty of cornering any commodity that the public need is guilty of one of the most heinous crimes that man can commit, against his fellow-man. So far as I am concerned, I should like to see the utmost rigour of the penal laws applied to such persons; and I am prepared to give the Government every possible power that they could exercise at a time like this to prevent the cornering of any commodity necessary to the public well-being. Honorable members opposite are right when they say that the Government have the power to-day to do anything they like to any man who corners any commodity whatsoever.  </para>

                            <para>. - I commend the honorable member for Richmond for the very eloquent testimony he has given to the virtues of one phase of Socialism in our community - co-operation. I remember that, when it fell to my lot to be an organizer among the dairymen of the State of Victoria, one of the frequent assertions made to me by some of the old Tories associated with the industry was that co-operation is a phase of Socialism; but my reply was, "What odds if it is, so long as it will benefit the dairymen of the State?" Co-operation is one of the finest phases of Socialism, and is a magnificent testimony to what can be done by united effort. </para>

                                <para>- We over here, being a co-operative party, are prepared to accept assistance from the other side. The peroration of the honorable member for Richmond was really fine, and I absolutely agree with everything he said in it; but I am afraid that the bulk of the arguments he has adduced to-night in respect to governmental interference with some of the trade and commercial transactions of the community, were altogether lacking in logic. I suppose honorable members on both sides agree that it is fair and proper, as we find society to-day, to endeavour, as far as possible, to fix the wages to be paid to our workmen. </para>

                        <para>Where would we be as a community - where would we be in the world to-day - had it not been for the intervention of the British Government in the early stages of this war? There would have been absolute and utter collapse, financially and commercially. But the magnificent way in which the British Government handled things in a very delicate and critical situation, was the means of preserving the financial equilibrium, not only of the Empire, but of the whole world. Had it not been for the Government of Great Britain standing behind the great financial and commercial concerns of the Old Land, trade would have been brought to a standstill, and the Empire would have crumbled without the Germans firing a single shot. They stood behind the banks, the fiduciary institutions, the insurance companies, and behind all trading concerns, practically guaranteeing everything. That is what Government intervention meant in Great Britain at the outbreak of the war. I say now, we want more of that kind of Government protection in normal times. I do not desire to detain the House long, but I want to quote a statement made in an article written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meredith</inline> Atkinson, in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times,</inline> and published on 9th May. </para>

                            <para> The individualism of normal commerce suffered a temporary collapse in face of the crushing crisis. All the nerve and resources of the country were braced to meet the shock, and it was seen to be sound economics and good military policy for the State to assume control, for the time being, and insist upon the welfare of the whole community. Not less important, perhaps, is the fact that for the first time the complexity of the world's economic machinery has been uncovered, so that the man in the street has learnt a great deal about its workings. Let us hope that its lessons will not be lost upon him, but that the study of economics will be seen at last to be essential to the public welfare. </para>

Anticipating a serious dislocation of the sugar trade owing to the war, the Government at once appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the facts, and endowed it with full power to act. The Commission, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Primrose, acted with promptitude and efficiency. It checked the speculation for a large rise in the price of sugar; it "cornered" the whole available supply, and it sold to the refiners at a fixed price, with a proviso that they in turn should sell to the retailers at moderate prices, definitely determined. The result was that there has been no shortage in sugar supplies, and only a comparatively small increase in its price. " The idea of a Government fixing prices! </para>

                            <para>In the first place, Germany and Austria, on which this country has been dependent for about two-thirds of all the sugar consumed, became suddenly closed as sources of supply, as well for immediate as for future delivery. Secondly, the complete dislocation of the financial market, and more especially of the remittance market, threatened to paralyze dealings with other countries from which supplies might be bought. Thus there was imminent danger of a positive famine in sugar, once existing stocks had become exhausted, and the certainty that for some considerable period the price of sugar would rise to an almost prohibitive figure. </para>

                            <para>In these circumstances,  His  Majesty's Government decided to take upon itself the task of insuring an adequate supply, and of arranging for its distribution on terms that would be no more onerous to the. public than the actual conditions made inevitable. The first _ steps taken put an immediate end to speculation in sugar, and to the rise in the price. The leading refiners were approached, and an arrangement was made that the whole body of refiners should stand aside from the market for raw sugars, leaving it free for the operations of the Government; that they should look to the Government alone for the supply of raw sugar for their factories; that the sugar should be issued to them at a fixed price; and that they in turn should sell their refined products to dealers also at a fixed price; the difference between the two prices being no more than sufficient to allow them a fair profit on manufacture. </para>
                            <para>The price of raw sugar charged to the refiners Was determined on the basis of protecting the Government from loss on their purchases, according to the best estimate that could be made of the prospects of the sugar market. Allowing for reasonable profit to the refiner, dealer, and retailer respectively, this price permits the sale to the public by retail grocers of sugar at the minimum price of 3|d. per lb. for good granulated, and 4Jd. per lb. for good cubes, with other qualities at proportionate rates. In distributing the sugars, it is the intention of the Commission to make use, as far as possible, of the existing machinery and channels of the trade. </para>

                                <para>- I am giving the honorable member a statement of just what would happen without Government intervention. This article, from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail Year-Booh,</inline> comes from a very independent authority. It is practically a brief account of the work of the Royal Commission presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Primrose, and I want to say that if sugar speculators had their way in Great Britain, probably they would have put the price up to £50 per ton, and the consumer would have had to pay 6d. to 8d. per lb. at least, for sugar. That intervention by the British Government- saved to the masses of the people between £18,000,000 and £20,000,000. That is the kind of intervention which the people ask for and appreciate. I hope that this debate will have the desired result, and that it will prove to be one of the first skirmishes in connexion with the great referenda campaign at which the people will decide by an overwhelming vote to give this National Parliament those powers which are absolutely necessary to protect their interests. </para>

                            <para>.- I should like, at the outset, to say that the statement which the honorable member for Maribyrnong made at the beginning of his speech with regard to my views on wages was totally erroneous. He wilfully, I believe, misinterpreted the interjection I made. I said by way of interjection that while it might be possible to fix nominal wages, we certainly could not fix actual wages. The best proof of that is afforded by the actions of the different Governments of Australia during the last four or five years, during which the desire for the fixation of prices has been more in evidence than it was at any other time. In the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Bulletin,</inline> No. 8, issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> in March, 1915, there is at page 261 a diagram showing the rise and fall of effective wages. Taking New South Wales for the purpose of illustration, I find that in 1906, when the diagram was first published, fixing the standard at 1,000, New South Wales was represented by the figure 950. In 1914 it came down to 910. This is largely owing to the fact that, during the last five years, that State has been under the control of a Socialistic Labour Government, whose desire has been to reduce prices and the cost of living generally to the worker. If we take the case of Victoria, we find that in 1906 that State was represented by the figure 918, a lower figure than that for New South Wales for that year, but in 1914 Victoria went up to 965, under a Liberal Government, or 55 above New South Wales, under a Labour Government. </para>

                                <para>- It is always because of something, but the fact remains that the net result of the efforts of the Labour Government of New South Wales has been to reduce the effective wages of the workers of that State, although their nominal wages have been increased by Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration. It matters very little to me what schemes are proposed if working men secure less effective wages as the result. </para>

                                <para>- The figures I have given represent the average over the whole community in each State, and there is no answer to them. When one quotes the average for the community, it is no answer to that to mention one or two instances which apparently contradict it. Let us consider some Government interference that has taken place recently. Let us examine it as coolly as we can in the heat of what Ill 12116 be called a party squabble. The Government of New South Wales fixed the price of wheat at 4s. 2d. a bushel, and they commandeered the visible supply in the State. The Government of Victoria fixed the price at 4s. 9d. per bushel, but three weeks later they found they had made a mistake, and raised the price to 5s. 6d. When the New South Wales Government commandeered the visible supply within that State, they found that they had not sufficient for the consumption of the community, and it was necessary for them to go abroad for importations of wheat. These importations are now costing them about 7s. lid. per bushel. There is no system of governmental interference that I know of by which we can fix prices for any longer than a day. If a commission is appointed to fix the price of any article of consumption, and they fix it at the rate ruling for a particular day, that fixed price will be effective for that day, but the commission must be prepared, with a change in the market, to fix the price again the next day. They must be always on the spot, and must change the price with every alteration of the market. </para>

                                <para>- Is a ring responsible for the increase in the price of butter from ls. to 2s. per lb. ? Why are eggs 2s. a dozen ? Is it due to the operations of a ring? It rs because the hens are laying, fewer eggs. Some time ago people could not afford to feed fowls, and they decided to eat them. For a time poultry was cheap; but when poultry could be fed, and they were kept to produce eggs, there were fewer of them for sale, with the result that the price went up. That result was not due to the operation of any ring. What led to the increase in the price of wheat? There was no ring controlling that article. It was the drought that' led to the increased price of wheat,, from 3s. 6d. per bushel up to nearly 8s. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is right, to a certain extent, in saying that the price of wheat is fixed -by Mark Lane. The wheat market of the world is controlled by Mark Lane in the sense that operators there know the visible supplies, so far as America is concerned, east of the Rockies, the visible supplies from Russia, from Australia, from the Argentine, and the supplies in the Old Country. They know practically the demand in every country of Europe for wheat, and what its production is. They keep these facts in mind from day to day, and change the price of wheat according to the fluctuation of the visible supply. </para>

                                <para>- That is exactly what I have said. The operators of Mark Lane fix the price in accordance with the fluctuations of the visible supply. Surely we have arrived at a stage of our history when men governing the affairs of the nation should know that prices are regulated by the cost of production. There may be a normal price for certain products as the result of men securing a monopoly. A case of that kind is a proper case for governmental interference. Parliament should legislate to prohibit monopolies. I shall go to the fullest extent with the present Government in maintaining that principle. I take the case of Government interfering to regulate the price of commodities.. I may advert for a moment to sugar. I believe that most of us will agree that those whose business it is to supply sugar to this community, knowing that there is a shortage ahead, would have been prepared to supply the full quantity required by Australia at a cheaper rate than can now be quoted, because the Government of the Commonwealth have advertised to the whole world that we are 20,000 tons short of our actual consumption of sugar. </para>

                                <para>- I prefer to deal with one thing at a time. When the Government of Australia advertised to the world that we were 20,000 tons of sugar short, it is only human nature that people having sugar to sell should say, " Australia must have this sugar," and up goes the price. The men whose business it is to supply the community with sugar would have found out where supplies were to be had ; would have ordered the necessary supplies, and they would be on the water coming to Australia under signed contracts to-day at a much cheaper price than will have to be paid for them now that it has been .advertised broadcast that Australia cannot produce any more sugar until next season, and we shall be compelled to import the quantity required to make up our local consumption. The same thing applies to wheat, and to any other commodity that can be mentioned. If an honorable member has a certain product which I want, and if he is the only man in the town who has it, and I must have it, when I go into his shop he will say, " This chap is fair game for me; up goes the price to him." </para>

If he did not, he would soon have to file his schedule. I believe in the prevention of monopoly not only in war, but in time of peace. Monopoly should be prevented under any circumstances, and any legislation tending to aid the monopolist will always have my hearty opposition. Let me give another illustration from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline> book dealing with the relative cost of living. </para>

One of the theories which it will upset is that as to the cost of living. Upon page 232 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> lays down the relative cost of living in the different States of Australia. Again taking 1,000 as the weighted average of Australia, New South Wales worked out at 1,049- </para>

                                <para>- Yes. I am going to say it again, and to put a different interpretation upon it. South Australia worked out at 3,022, Western Australia at 1,140, Victoria at 951, and Queensland at 904. It will be seen, therefore, that the three States which were above the average at the time these statistics were compiled were those which were, and still are, being administered by Labour Governments, whilst the two States which were below the average were being administered by Liberal Governments. When the Labour party have had a couple more years of office, I confidently expect to see the Queensland average a good deal higher. Now my honorable friends opposite appear to be intelligent men.

                                <para>- I am not alluding to the Moses with whom my honorable friend does business. The Egyptians tried it, as did also the Greeks. It was tried, too, in the Middle Ages, when Parliament, in an effort to encourage the woollen industry, enacted a law declaring that every corpse must be buried in flannel. At that time Parliament thought that it was doing something which would assist the woollen industry; but its action did not have that effect. I say that honorable members upon this side of the Chamber are just as anxious to see the working classes get a square deal, so far as the necessaries of life are concerned, as are my honorable friends opposite. But they have a different method . of going about it. I believe in a man getting as much as he possibly can for his labour. But I am endeavouring to prove that the actions of honorable members opposite are not calculated to achieve the desired result. That conclusion is irresistible, seeing that in New South Wales, where the nominal wages - that is the money wages - have increased, the quantity of goods which can be purchased with that money has declined during the past five or six years. </para>

                                <para>- Fortunately for this world, there is always hope ahead. The honorable member's statement reminds me of a cartoon which recently appeared in a London paper, and which depicted a squad whose members had been taken out to shoot at a target which was distant from them only about 30 yards. None of them could hit it, and after they had all vainly tried, the sergeant said to them, " Your last hope is to fix bayonets and charge." I have endeavoured to enumerate what I regard as the necessaries of life. It is a somewhat difficult task, but, briefly, they may be set down as comprising flour, bread, meat, tea, sugar, milk, butter, jam, salt, mustard, pepper, potatoes, cabbages, parsnips, carrots, turnips, eggs, bacon, fish, and fruit. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member objects to the whisky, I suppose? I had him in mind when I suggested an alternative, namely, "whisky or ginger pop." After all, I would remind him that a man must drink. He cannot live on bread alone. If the articles which I have mentioned constitute the necessaries of life which the proposal of the honorable member for Cook seeks to cover, it aims at setting an absolutely impossible task for the Government, and out of the fulness of my heart I intend to assist them. </para>

                                <para>- It reads like a book. " The earliest convenience of the Government," if they exhaustively carried out the terms of the proposal, if adopted, would be long after the honorable member for Cook and I had passed from this mortal sphere. Take one case alone - the movement of stocks. The honorable member wants reliable and accurate information about the movement of stocks for the supply of the necessaries of life. Is fish a necessary of life? How is it possible to watch the movements of the fish stock? I can imagine the Government setting out to look after the stock of fish. They would have to be in the sea, so that we could eat them fresh. Again, how could the Government get reliable information as to the stock and the movement of eggs? So far as I know, there are three classes of eggs - fresh eggs, preserved eggs, and election eggs. But the honorable member has not asked for a separation of the classes in the collection of the statistics. Honorable members are laughing, but I am serious. I am anxious to know how it would be possible for the Government to get reliable statistics as to the quantity of eggs to be laid to-morrow. While they were taking stock and preparing statistics, the stock would all be eaten, and, therefore, the statistics would be useless by the time they were presented. Then, take milk. How would it be possible for the Government to ascertain how much milk the cows are going to produce next week? If you got warm weather, you would probably get more milk; but if you got cold weather, and a number of : the cows were dead, you would get less milk. </para>

If the weather becomes bitterly cold, more of their heat will be absorbed in protecting their bodies than in the production of milk. If the weather gets warm, the cows will give more milk, and, as a result, we will get more butter, and then, of course, the price of butter will go down. If we get less butter the price will go up. </para>

                                <para>- Absolutely necessarily. When I was a lad at school I remember an illustration being given on the law of gravity. We were told that stones- always tended to fall to the earth. In my innocence, I said to the teacher, " Suppose that they fell on a verandah?" He said, " I did not say that stones always fell to the earth. J. said that they always tended to fall to the earth." You may put an artificial barrier underneath them to support them for the time being, but remove the barrier, and " down she goes," in the words of the honorable member for Darwin. Take tea, which is an essential item of food or drink in Australia. What reliable and accurate information could the Government, or a Commission, get about the quantity of tea to be produced, or the stocks likely to come forward from time to time, unless they took into their own control the purchase of the tea for the community ? Unless they did, they could not get any information. They would have to rely on the traders. All that they could possibly do would be to go to the traders, and say, " What stocks are you importing?" to be told, "Well, we are importing so-and-so." But something might develop next day or next week. The whole business would be stopped, and the information would not be worth a snap of the fingers. </para>

                                <para>- I am afraid that the Government are not swift enough to catch the rabbits. How could they ascertain the stocks of mustard and pepper? They might get some information about pepper and items of that kind from the honorable member for Cook. Passing from food to clothing, suppose that a strike took place, for example, in the hat trade, and the number of hats available for use in the city was diminished, would not the price of hats naturally go up? There would be more persons demanding hats, and less hats to supply the public, and the price would go up no matter what regulation to the contrary was made. It does not matter what Government interference takes place; as long as there are persons prepared to pay the price of an article you cannot stop them from doing so, and the sooner we all realize that we cannot regulate prices definitely, the better it will be for the whole community. Another favorite argument of my honorable friends opposite is the regulation of house rents. They are always anxious: that a Fair Rents Court should be established. What could it do to reduce the rent of an average working-man's cottage if it did not reduce the cost of building it, or in the alternative, if it  did not rob the landlord of a certain amount of his just earnings'? Let me put a case. If an average landlord - I am not one - can build a house for £500 fit for a family to live in, and he receives £25 a year, plus his rates and taxes, he is .getting a fair interest on his money. </para>

                                <para>- I have always had a good opinion of the honorable member for Darwin. Before I .became a member of this House I knew that he was a shrewd, capable business man, and I have always wondered why he bought houses up rights-of-way; but now I know that he gets .better interest out of them. If a man gets 5 per cent, on his money it is a fair average investment, and no Fair Bents Court would be entitled, or, I think, would be likely, to reduce the return to capital below that rate. </para>

                                <para>- Suppose, on the other hand, that there is an increase in the wages of the bricklayers, plasterers, plumbers, and other men whose services are employed in building, and it costs £1,000 to build the same sort of house, the landlord will want 5 per cent, on the extra money invested; in other words, he will want 5 per cent, on £1,000, and that will merely double the rent on the tenant. It does not matter whether you increase his nominal wages or not, that makes an actual reduction in the wages of the man who has to occupy the house. Yet honorable members wonder how the price gets back on to the man who is always working and producing these things. </para>

                                <para>- I will answer the question. Suppose that I build a house today at a cost of £500 on land worth £1 a foot, and that ten years hence the value of that land goes up to £10 a foot. I sell the land, or, if I retain it, I expect interest on it- for what reason ? Because, if I sell it I can invest the money in a bank, and get the return I expected to receive in rent. </para>

                                <para>- I am with the honorable member if he wants to deal with that question on the principle of land values taxation. All my life I have believed in a land tax as a kind of check to that very tiling. Where the community adds a value to the land the unearned increment is, in my judgment, a fair ground for taxation by the community; but where nominal or actual increases take place in the value of land under our present system the landlord has an absolute right to that increase as long as he can get an investment for his money elsewhere, or if .he retains the land at the market value he is entitled to the interest on it. If you apply the principle of taxation of land values it has a tendency to cause more houses to be built, and there is no necessity to confiscate, because the building of the extra houses in itself tends to lower the rents, and as long as you give the extra supply you will get a lower rent. But what is the alternative ? If you do not give the market value of the land to the owner, he ceases to invest his money, and houses get scarcer and rents go up, or two or three families have to live in a house. I have watched this agitation with regard to the reduction of the price of food and the cost of living, and I am just as desirous of 'seeing the idea carried into effect as is any member of the House. In a land like this, flowing with milk and honey, so to speak, I would like to see people doing as well as is possible, getting plenty to eat, to drink, and to clothe themselves with, decent houses to live in, and good conditions to work under. If men are so fortunately placed very little more can be done for them. The evidence of history throughout the ages shows the impossibility of effecting reforms unless they aTe favoured by the natural conditions of the country. </para>

                        <para>When the Federal Labour party was returned to power, the Enoggera military bread contract was being carried out by the Automatic Bakeries Limited, then a non-union firm. Seeing that preference to unionists was the platform on 'which the Labour party was returned to power, the union at once made negotiations with the Minister of Defence, with the object of giving preference to a union-run bakery. </para>
                        <para class="block">The contract previous to this had only been arranged by the association sending to certain master bakers, and asking them for their tenders. As an outcome of the union's negotiations, a tender was called, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shead,</inline> of South Brisbane, who is a master baker, employing union labour, tendered at about1s. below the cost of the Automatic Bakeries. This contract was carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shead</inline> for some three months, and in this instance money was saved by the Department. Through the effluxion of time, the contract expired on 31st January, and on fresh tenders being called, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shead</inline> received the contract. As a result of a union bakery getting the contract, it afforded employment to a large number of workers. At this time the unemployment question was acute in Brisbane. Had the contract been taken from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shead,</inline> the union baker, it would have meant from four to six men being thrown on the labour market. If the Automatic Bakeries had received the tender, there would have been no extra employment as far as bakers were concerned. </para>

                        <para>He said the second contract, beginning on 1st February, was accepted by the Defence Department under certain conditions. Owing to the uncertainty in the, flour market, flour having risen at that time from £9 per ton to £14 per ton, with the prospects of going much higher, he thought it would be impossible for him to tender on a flat basis. He wrote to the Department enclosing a tender on a sliding scale, taking for a basis the then price of flour, namely, £14 per ton, and asking an increase of Is. per 100 lbs. of bread for every advance of £1 per ton in the price of flour. This also acted in the event of flour falling. The Department would receive a benefit of1s. per 100 lbs. of bread for every fall in the price of flour. This the Department agreed to, making the then price of bread 14s. 6d. per 100 lbs. on the basis of flour at £14 per ton. The extra 1s. per 100 lbs. exactly represented the extra cost of flour. No extra profit is made by him, even if flour reached £30 per ton, and he would be none the better off. </para>

I am sure you feel quite certain of the truth of your statements, and so am writing to defend the company. The wages and conditions of work are specified on the tender. Referring to the conditions. I am sending you, under separate cover, a booklet explaining our process, which certainly shows that the conditions are different. Here the trade is elevated almost to a profession, and a man who once works here does not like to have to work again in a hand factory. Our wages are all governed by the Wages Board. We pay higher than the award - the highest in the city. The present contractor employs four other members of his firm under no award. We are an entirely open shop, never asking whether a man is a unionist or not. In fact, many of our mcn (not bakers) are unionists. Over two years ago the Bakers Union refused to allow members to work for us, and the present contractor has been stirring up enmity against us ever since in order to further his trade - using the unions as  catspaws. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> the Attorney-General of New South Wales, visited our factory, and was so pleased with it that he has decided to instal a similar one in Sydney, and he says the conditions are all that can be desired. - Yours faithfully, J.

                        <para>Every man employed by the Automatic Bakeries in their bakehouse since they installed their machinery has either scabbed or is a non-unionist. In fact, I do not know of any baker whom they have employed who has not scabbed. </para>
                        <para>It seems strange that not one unionist has been employed, if they are not opposed to unionism. But, on the other hand, the scum of scabdom has been and is employed by them. Herbert Sheard (director) at a meeting held for the purpose of forming Automatic Bakeries Limited is supposed to have said that, on the installation of their machinery, there would be no more strikes, that union bakers will not be wanted. It looks at least that if it was not said, that it is being carried out at all events. In evidence, before. Price Fixing Board, P. J. Maher said: - "We can produce 50 per cent, more bread in our factory without any more cost." So you can see Enoggera bread" contract to them would not mean the employment of additional labour. Automatic Limited have been always, and- still are, night bakers, but we have a decision on our Industrial Board which will force them to clay work in a few months. (Now that 22nd May happened.) </para>

                            1902. - W. Shead was a member of our union out on strike. He later started in business, gave preference to members of our union, absolutely refused to employ any others; this attitude he has maintained to the present time. 1912. - Employing only unionists, he was one of the few bakers allowed to work, under permit, from the general strike committee. 1914. - He was the only master baker to write to the Bakers Union offering to start day baking (before we issued the ultimatum that we would refuse to work under night baking conditions). Shead again helped us by giving evidence before the Industrial Board in favour of our proposal. And the decision given in our favour was to a great extent due to his evidence. Since securing the Enoggera bread contract, W. Shead has employed four (4) operative bakers in addition to his previous staff. These additional men are constantly employed. He has also employed additional casual labour (jobbers) to the extent of £9 per week; this has been the saving of our unemployed, every one of whom has had a share of the extra work created by this contract. In fact, the securing of the bread contract, besides being a union question, is a bread and butter question.

                <para class="block">I have nothing further to say, except a few words in conclusion. The present Government, being pledged to the principle of preference to unionists, could have done nothing else, if it were to remain true to its professions and promises, but give the contract to this particular firm. The other firm is notoriously a non-union firm. It does not profess to be a union firm, except in the sense that a man who is out of a job is willing to join a union in order to get in the Government employment; and the Automatic Bakeries Limited is willing to claim some kind of unionism in order to get this contract. The difference in price is very little, especially when we remember that the Automatic Bakeries Limited is a combine of nine bakeries, which was deliberately started in order to get control of the baking trade of Brisbane. The present Government is pledged against combines. It is pledged to give the individual a fair go, and to see that the public are well served. This combine set out, not only to squeeze out the other bakeries of Brisbane, but also to establish the price of bread, and practically to rule the whole of the business in that city. They have failed, and I think the Government are to be congratulated upon the fact that they assisted the other bakers to break the strength of the combine. The honorable member for Moreton laid some stress on the point that the combine were supplying the bread at a fixed price. That is one of the strongest arguments that could have been adduced in favour of giving the order to the other firm. The Automatic Bakeries Company were able to supply at a fixed price, although flour was showing a tendency to rise, and has since risen, only because, having control of so much money, and having the business of nine bakeries to supply, they were in a position to lay in stocks of flour. On the other hand, the ordinary baker, having a smaller capital, would not be able to lay in stocks of flour, and was therefore subject to the rise and fall of the market. I think the honorable member, having discovered that his statement regarding Shead and his partners was incorrect, might have the grace and courtesy to withdraw the imputation which he made on the firm. I cannot expect him to withdraw his suggestion that the Government acted unfairly. Had they acted in any other way the attack upon them would have come, not from the Opposition, but from this side of the House. If the present Government were giving orders to firms like the Automatic Bakeries Company, which are not union firms, and which will not employ unionists if they can secure the services of non-union men, then they would have to submit to a good deal of criticism from their own supporters. We and the public generally expect the Government to be true to the principles for which they stand, and which Labour has advocated outside as well as in Parliament. </para>

The honorable gentleman did not give the House, nor has he yet done so, the real facts of the case regarding the price paid, save that he said it was to be 15s. per 100 lbs. to begin with, with a rise of Is. per cwt. in proportion to the rise in the price of flour. The charge that I made was that the Government were then paying 5s. 8d. per cental more for the bread which they procured from a union bakery than the price at which they could have purchased it from other bakeries. </para>

As to the honorable member's suggestion that I should apologize for what I have said regarding this firm, I can assure him that if I ever did any one an injury, and it was within my power to make reparation by apologizing, I should be most happy to do so. No one has less desire than I have to injure any individual. But when one is asked to retract a statement that one has never made, or to retract a statement which one subsequently finds to be incorrect, the least those preferring the request should do is to approach the individual concerned in a respectful and not in a bouncing manner. I was vexed with the honorable member for Brisbane the other day, and vexed to such an extent that perhaps I said something that I ought not to have said when he insisted upon an apology.

                    <para class="block">The letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> was read in the House by the honorable member. If I have done this  firm an  injury and it approaches me in respectful terms I shall be willing to make amends; but until it does, I  am  not going to be bullied into any withdrawal of what I have said. </para>

                            <para>- When the Automatic Bakeries Limited wrote to the honorable member for Maranoa they also wrote to the Minister and others; but they wrote in respectful terms. The writer of this letter from Stephens and Tozer lectures me on the duties of a Liberal member of Parliament. When that firm writes to me in respectful terms, I shall be willing to put the letter on record, and withdraw anything I have said if I find that I have done <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shead</inline> any injury. Until then I shall maintain the position I have taken up. </para>
