                        <para>- Prior to the meeting of the House, after the dinner adjournment last night, I heard from two or three sources the sad news of the death of Major-General Bridges, and, in subsequently referring to the matter in a speech, I was not aware that the news had not been made public. Now that I know that Major-General Bridges&#39; death had not then been publicly announced by the Government, I fear that my remarks may have caused pain by the premature disclosure of the facts. I do not think that that is probable, but as my speech may have had that effect, I apologize to the Minister and to the friends of the deceased officer for my premature mention of the occurrence. </para>

                        <para>- The information obtained on inquiry bears out the statement that the position is as put by the honorable member, particularly in Victoria. I was informed yesterday that the wholesale houses in Melbourne have not 150 bags between them, and that many towns in Victoria have no sugar at all; that grocers are quite unable to supply their customers, and that the wholesale houses are unable to supply the grocers, stocks being wholly in the hands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is not supplying orders as filed. Clearly the powers given to the Parliament by the Constitution are inadequate to enable us to deal with this position. </para>

                        <para>- Owing to shortage of water, the difficulties arising from having to use bad water in the engines during the severe drought, the failure of contractors in Australia to supply locomotives and engine boilers to contract time, and the absolute necessity for overhauling existing locomotives, it has been necessary to temporarily reduce the rate of plate-laying, which has entailed dispensing with the services of about 150 men. The water difficulty has been mitigated by rains within the last few days, and when sufficient locomotive power is available it is proposed to increase the number of men employed. I can assure the honorable member that I shall do my utmost to keep up the number employed, but with severe drought, war, and other circumstances against us, the difficulties have been great. </para>

                        <para>- A number of complaints have reached me of delays in the delivery of cablegrams to the wounded in Egypt, and the time occupied in receiving replies. Can the Assistant Minister of Defence give the House any explanation for those delays, or say whether it is likely there will be an early improvement ? I understand there has been delay not only in official messages, but also in the case of private cablegrams. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to inform the House, in reply to this question, that it is impossible for the Defence Department to keep everything up to date. Every man at the front is fighting for his life. Those who are wounded are placed on board ship as quickly as possible, but it is impossible to get information straight away from the seat of war. Honorable members may picture to themselves what is going on where everybody is fighting for life, and where we are outnumbered to the extent of ten to one. There is no time to attend to little details of this sort. Honorable members must see that the work at the Dardanelles is of such a terrible nature that it is almost impossible to get a cable sent here concerning any one particular soldier. I hope honorable members will not be unreasonable in this matter, notwithstanding that they are in receipt of letters from their constituents regarding sons and husbands at the front. </para>

However, what I want to point out to honorable members is that it is impossible for any person who sends a cable to the front to expect a reply within twenty-four or forty-eight hours, because everything there is so disturbed. </para>

                                <para>-The&#39; representatives of the newspapers are here by the courtesy of the House. I have no control over them so long as they conduct themselves in a proper way. If the press desire to publish any information of what takes place here they have a perfect right to do so, because a few days afterwards the same information would be published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the newspapers could merely copy it if they desired. The present arrangement merely gives the public news at an earlier date; but I have no control over the press whatever. </para>

                                <para>- I have no control over the press at all in this matter. Whatever action the military authorities may take in regard to press censorship is a matter between the military authorities and the press. It has nothing to do with us. All we are responsible for is the official publication, and of that no censorship is allowed either by the military or any other Department, apart from a decision of the House itself. </para>

Supposing he had made a statement inadvertently about a matter that should not then have been made public to any one in this House, he would have been very glad if we had prevented it being published in the evening papers. The same course would be taken with any statement made in this House that was not a fact, and which, if published, might reach the hands of the enemy, and do us harm. </para>

                            <para>- That is the very point to which I propose briefly to address myself. It came to me as a considerable shock to learn from the Prime Minister a few moments ago that the very proper attitude he is taking up as to information that should not be published is in relation only to circulation abroad. Newspaper reports of speeches made in this House apparently are to be censored, but the official records, which are easily obtainable in any part of Australia, are not to be censored, and may be sent oversea. Could we have a greater tangle of nonsense? </para>

By way of illustration, let me point out that we had last night from an honorable member opposite a very valuable contribution to the discussion concerning the Small Arms Factory. This question of munitions has been fully and freely threshed out in England, and threshed out, it is believed, for the benefit of the people as a whole. But here we are not allowed to discuss the question of whether there should be one or two shifts per day at the Small Arms Factory - whether we should work at full or only half our energies because, prithee, it is dangerous that the enemy should know that we are not working two or three shifts at the factory, and still more dangerous that the public should know that we are utilizing only half our energies. </para>

                            <para>- In every country, with, perhaps, the exception of France, it is being publicly urged - without interference from the censor - that every legitimate means should be employed to secure the utilization of their full energies in turning out war supplies. But in this country it is apparently an iniquity - so iniquitous that it should be hushed up - &#39;for an honorable member to suggest that an instrumentality under the Government is not working full time. I would urge upon the Prime Minister that it is ridiculous and absurd to censor the newspaper reports of our proceedings - in other words, to censor publications which Australian people read - and at the same time not to censor <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which is open to any alien, naturalized or unnaturalized, who chooses to buy it. </para>

                            <para>- There are many things I do not like, but I do not object to your trying them. I think even the honorable member will appreciate the fact that it would be very difficult to censor any statement until it had been made, and as this is supposed to be a deliberative assembly it would be utterly impracticable, even for the honorable member, to devise any means of censoring an honorable member. But we have been censored outside. I do not think I have made any statement in this House about the Small Arms Factory, but regard the question of whether or not the Small Arms Factory is putting forth its best energies as a very proper subject for discussion. Every one desires that it shall do so, and if such a matter may be discussed in England, the great munition supplier of Europe, surely in the Commonwealth, where we are turning out only a few thousand rifles-- </para>

We want to know whether we are doing our best. Under the practice to which I am taking exception, Australia is debarred from learning whether we are or are not doing so in this regard. This is not an occasion requiring philippics against some unpatriotic person, but it is an occasion requiring the display of a certain amount of common sense. There is an extraordinary conflict between the two positions which the Prime Minister has taken up. </para>

                        <para>. - I feel that already something has been gained this morning by securing from the Prime Minister, for the first time, a statement to the effect that he will consult with Opposition members regarding this very important question of censorship. I can tell the right honorable gentleman that honorable members have not taken action without having the fullest possible justification for so doing. Criticism which is intended to facilitate the discharge of the obligations arising out of the war is being censored - unwisely and unduly, I think. I hold very Strongly that the action of censoring such criticism tends to inefficiency and not efficiency in the conduct of the war. Our supreme object should be the public interest. What is the public interest? Surely it cannot be injured by a free, full, and frank criticism of the way in which the war is being conducted. Almost every day such criticism takes place in the Old Country. In fact, in a recent speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> invited it. He said - </para>

                        <para>To-day all our efforts and energies are concentrated upon the war, and we are all in absolute agreement that it behoves every man among us, here or elsewhere, by act of service, or, if that is impossible, in such other channels as may be open to him - and of these appropriate parliamentary criticism is not the least important - to subordinate every other interest to the one overmastering purpose. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">What boots parliamentary criticism here if the public may know nothing about it ? Take, for instance, the speech delivered last night by the honorable member for Macquarie. I did not hear the whole of it, but that portion of it which I was privileged to hear seemed to be criticism of a temperate and capable kind directed to a subject with which the honorable member&#39;s very position as representative of the Macquarie electorate makes him fully acquainted. Yet in this morning&#39;s newspapers there is not even a reference to it. Such censorship cannot be in the public interest. If there should happen to be some concern under the control of the Government into which, in the opinion of capable judges outside, there should be an inquiry, and about which there should be free discussion, surely there ought to be no censoring of such a matter as that. The honorable member was referring to the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. My opinion is that this factory is in such a condition that some action of a special kind should be taken in regard to it, because, while munitions are our overmastering requirement at the present time, the gates of that factory are closed every Saturday religiously at noon and not opened till Monday morning. Such a state of affairs is an absolute farce; in fact, it is a tragedy. We may as well give notice to the Germans that we are not fighting at the week-end as to stop work in our preparations for battle. As Lord Kitchener has repeatedly told the workmen in the Old Country, the battle is being fought in our workshops. But, apparently, what Lord Kitchener can tell the workmen in Great Britain we are not permitted to say here. That is our complaint. In Australia we are not permitted to do anything like what people are permitted to do every day of their lives in other countries of the world, and I maintain that it will be wrong to permit such a state of affairs to continue. The Prime Minister has given his assurance that no political considerations enter into the attitude which he and his Ministers assume in regard to censorship. I give him credit for that statement, but may I suggest that this morning for the first time has he taken the only course which can put it to the proof. He will recollect that immediately war broke out Oppositionists were appointed to the control of the censorship in the Old Country in conjunction with Government men. That was the best proof that the Imperial Government could give that no political considerations were to prevail in connexion with the censorship. </para>

                            <para>- I am making no complaint except upon one point, namely, that the Ministry are directing the censorship of criticism, which is intended to be helpful, and which, I believe, is helpful. Before long I shall make the right honorable gentleman aware of the kind of criticism that is being censored - if he is not aware of it already. I maintain that a very serious state of affairs is growing up in connexion with this matter. Apparently. whatever a Minister or an officer may say goes in. I heard an officer saying the other day that we had arranged for about 20,000 more soldiers than we had rifles available. Could a statement like that help our people here or help recruiting ? I had to correct the officer on a public platform, but of course the whole thing was censored. I think the only thing published about the meeting was that a dog was howling while I was speaking. I have not inquired as to whether I am subjected to a rigid censorship by some newspapers that I could name, but the fact remains that oftentimes when I have essayed to give particulars which I have thought would be useful, and facts concerning the present situation, I have found no mention of them in the newspapers. </para>

                            <para>- I get plenty of censuring and censoring. I appreciate the spirit of the Prime Minister to-day, and I tell him that the invitation which he has given to the Opposition will be most cordially accepted, and that we shall do our best to put this matter on a proper basis.  But  at the same time I wish to remind honorable members of the importance of this matter, and to quote one instance which indicates it. I am told that if any news is censored the man concerned may not be told by the newspaper proprietor that his news lias been censored. Is that not an absurd condition of affairs, that a man may not be told that an important deliverance of his own has been censored ? I wonder how far this is to go. If it is to continue, this thing may happen - I do not speak of the present Ministry; I am merely illustrating the principle of the matter ; but there have been incompetent administrators during a period of national crisis, and men have been put out of office for not doing what they should have done, and because their removal has been an overpowering national necessity. If the, censorship is to be the exclusive prerogative of the Minister or an official who may be censurable and incompetent- I do not make any reflection on present Ministers; I do not wish to do so; I have no justification for doing so; I am speaking absolutely impersonally and putting a hypothetical case, and in the history of the British Empire incompetent men have shielded themselves by preventing the publication of anything relating to their administration or incompetency - it comes to this that we may push the point of censorship to the point of injuring instead of helping ourselves in the prosecution of the war. Is criticism which tends to efficiency to be censored ? That is the over-mastering question, and the only consideration. If we are to permit an undisputed censorship by the very people who are affected by that criticism, we are doing a very wrong thing in connexion with the prosecution of the war, and may defeat the very purpose we have in view, namely, the preservation of our efficiency in the conduct of the war in the most vigorous way, and under the most advantageous terms to ourselves.

                            <para>- I should think that that fact has a good deal to do with the matter. But I maintain that criticism of facts that makes for greater efficiency at the Small Arms Factory should not be absolutely shut out as is now done. Here in Australia we are told that we must not say anything about the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, and that, if we do, our remarks shall not appear in public. </para>

                            <para>- I am able to tell the honorable member that a statement, not reflecting on the Minister, but suggesting another course that the Minister should take at the Small Arms Factory, has not been allowed to appear in the public press, That statement had been carefully prepared by the ex-Minister of Defence, but was not allowed to appear in public print. If that act of suppression does not approach suspiciously near the introduction of the political element into the censorship, I should like to know what does. </para>

                            <para>- It did, but the Minister had the last say on the matter, and nothing further has appeared. Enough said ! That sort of censorship should cease, because no one could read the statement by the ex-Minister of Defence on a question with which he was entirely familiar without feeling that it was a criticism that was both, appropriate and deserving of consideration. Let us. see what had happened in England. According to a leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> of 16th March, Lord Kitchener told the Empire - that although the manufacturers of munitions of war have been working at &#34; the highest possible pressure.&#34; the output does not only not equal our necessities, but does not fulfil expectations. </para>

                        <para>Lord Kitchener acknowledged that the majority of our workmen were toiling loyally and well, but he also said bluntly that there were cases where &#34; absence, irregular time-keeping, and slack work &#34; had led to a marked diminution of output. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Lord Kitchener is reported in the same issue as having said - &#34; I can only say that the supply of war material at the present moment, and for the next two or three months is causing me very serious anxiety.&#34; He wished the workmen to realize that it is absolutely essential, not only that the arrears in the deliveries of our munitions should be wiped off, but that the output of every round of ammunition was of the utmost Importance. The new Defence of the Realm Bill, for the mobilization of our industrial resources was, in his opinion, imperatively necessary. </para>

                        <para>We have a very unpalatable message to give to the public in regard to the production of munitions in the north. Only after consultation with responsible persons I decided to write. If there were a prospect of improvement I would not speak, but the strong force of public opinion is needed. It is no exaggeration to say that not merely the successful prosecution of the war, but its whole issue, is jeopardized by the industrial inefficiency in the north. </para>

                    <para class="block">I say nothing as to the justification for that criticism. I am only instancing the fact that the most scarifying criticism in regard to the production of munitions of war in the Old Country is permitted to appear in the public press every day as a matter of course. That Glasgow correspondent continued - </para>

                        <para>The country is living in a fool&#39;s paradise. 1 believe that the Government, too, is a most important cause of the attitude of certain sections of organized labour. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">One could not get a statement of that character published in our Australian newspapers. If any Australian public man were to dare to say that we are living in a fool&#39;s paradise, and that the whole issue is being jeopardized by the actions of the Minister - but perish the thought; no one has ever suggested such a thing, and if any one had suggested it, no newspaper would be permitted to make the statement public. In that fact lies the distinction and the difference between the censorship in England and the censorship here. The <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> criticising another speech by Lord Kitchener, said - </para>

                        <para>He sought the publicity of the House of Lords in order to have a straight talk with the working man on drink, irregular timekeeping, slack work, and trade union restrictions on the one hand, and on wages and war rewards on the other. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">So the criticism goes on. To it must be added the statement by Admiral Jellicoe that his ships were being rendered inefficient by the lack of industrial efficiency in the workshops and arsenals, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> French&#39;s statement that his operations were hampered because he required more men and more ammunition. But here in Australia one must not say a word about our little factory at Lithgow lest it should jeopardize the conduct of the war. Such an attitude is farcical. Regarding the Small Arms Factory, I desire to call the attention of the Ministry to a few facts, mention of which is appropriate just now. I realize that, although I may mention these facts in the House to-day, they will not be permitted to be published in the press to-morrow. First of all, let honorable members get into their minds the fact that the war machine at Lithgow does not work at night, or at week-ends. The enemy is fighting every night and all night - on Sundays and on Saturday afternoons - but those men at Lithgow, who have as much to do with the successful prosecution of the war as have the men at the front, are not permitted - I will put it that way - to work on Saturday afternoons or on Sundays. </para>

One statement is at variance with the other, so far as I understand, and I cannot believe that this factory could not be so managed, as to put all these automatic and high-grade machines to their full use. </para>

I am mentioning facts that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright</inline> himself has stated, and these are all fair subjects for criticism. When such criticism is made, either here or outside, it ought not to be subject to the censorship. Nobody, so far as I know, would think of telling the enemy how many rifles were turned out, or anything of that kind. Of course, such information as that would be censorable; but, surely, criticism directed to making the establishment more efficient, and to the multiplying of the munitions of war, ought to be regarded as legitimate, reasonable, and helpful? </para>

                        <para>.- A most remarkable spectacle is presented to Parliament and the country this morning, though, perhaps, I ought not to say that it is presented to the country, because the chances are that the outside public will know nothing about it. Here we find a party and Government which is supposed to be upholders of public liberty pursuing a policy of suppression so utterly bad, that the very friends of suppression are led to protest against it. We are told this morning by one member of the Government that there is to be publicity, and from another member of the Government that he is quite prepared to see <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> itself censored. If that be so, it is evident that the Government speaks with a divided voice on the situation; and it appears that these two gentlemen are to confer with members of the Opposition as to what ought to be censored. But the honorable member for Parramatta has said that the supreme factor for consideration is the public interest. If what was said by the honorable member for Macquarie last night be true, and if what the honorable member for Parramatta says is true - that the supreme factor is the public interest - we are confronted with a condition of things so absolutely rotten, so corrupt, and so evident of incapacity that the public interest is threatened, and the public safety endangered. </para>

                            <para>- The Assistant Minister had better wait until I have concluded. In the first place, we have been told by one Minister that nothing will be censored except what in his opinion is prejudicial to the public safety. Only a fortnight ago we were told, clearly and distinctly, by the Minister of Defence that he had informed the members of the press that they were not to report a question that had been put in this Chamber by myself. Who is to be the judge of these things? What is to be the criterion ? How can incapacity or improper conduct be brought to light, or how can errors and wrongs be rectified, if not by public criticism ? Parliament is the only channel by which a member has any assurance of having his views placed before the public. Only the other day a man who had served his country for a long time was suddenly called out and dismissed without a moment&#39;s notice or without being told why. He was cast out upon the streets, although he had been in the service for twenty-five years, and had, by arduous effort, rendered valuable assistance to this Democracy. What is the common right of a human being, if not to be faced with his accusers, told what the accusation is, and to be tried ? If such a man is found guilty, then he may be punished either by the Courts, or by being deprived of his employment. But the man to whom I refer was not faced by his accusers, had no accusation made against him, and was not tried by the Courts; he was simply thrown out on the streets by an arbitrary Minister, and his wife and children left destitute. Is this what is called justice and honour in such a party and such a Parliament? We had a statement yesterday by the Minister in another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made various statements, and asked questions of the Minister of Defence, and an investigation is supposed to have taken place in reference to the Red Cross goods alleged to have been sold at Rabaul. The Minister of Defence in the Senate yesterday said the Court of Inquiry had found - </para>

                    <para>That this admission was reduced into writing, in duplicate, and signed by Campbell. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Minister of Defence gives credence to such statements; but let any man look up the record. I say that that record contains evidence of conspiracy to discredit one man because he is in a humble position, and to free social criminals from their responsibilities. This is the case in which the <inline font-style="italic">Sim</inline> newspaper made various statements in regard to these Red Cross goods, alleging that the soldiers had to buy the things that had been presented to them. In this connexion questions were asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> - not by me, the outcast, but by a responsible man who is respected by the Opposition, if not by this side. That honorable senator yesterday asked a question, and got an answer. He was informed by the Minister that there was correspondence regarding the matter, and that inquiry had been held. What happened ? The main allegation was that this man had not only admitted that he had lied - that before  Colonel Watson  and Captain Lane he admitted that he had lied in connexion with these officers, and admitted that the officers were honest men, and that this confession had been reduced to writing in duplicate. In his sworn evidence, however, this man, Campbell, said that he never did make any such confession, but adhered to his original statement. How and by what means can the truthfulness or untruthfulness of either side be proved? By producing the written confession. It is said that one copy of this confession was sent to the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Sim</inline> newspaper, and one given to Colonel Holmes, but no such document can be found in -the records. </para>

                    <para class="block">Campbell went on to say that the profits of the sale of these goods went to the officers, and Captain Goodsell went into Court to contradict this. And how did he do that? He said that Campbell&#39;s statement could not be true, for the simple reason that no profits were made. And how was that? Captain Goodsell said that no profits could be made on the dry canteen because what was for sale was dead stock bought from Burns, Philp, and Company, and that the men would not look at it. This Department - the men who are said to be not corrupt or operating in a manner inimical to the public interest - admits that it bought from Burns, Philp, and Company useless stock that the men would not buy. There were rotten rugs, and tobacco that wa3 stale and  unsmokable;  and these facts are put forward in order to show that Campbell&#39;s statement could not be true. As a matter of fact, this is the strongest condemnation of the Department that there could possibly  be. Captain Watson said that he posted Campbell&#39;s letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> but the editor of that journal denied having received it. Any one who reads these documents through will see in them ample evidence of organized conspiracy by the officers to save themselves. He said, too, that he wrote in duplicate on the subject, one copy being sent to the Administrator. This matter should not be allowed to stand where it does- There is ample evidence that in a country which is not within the war area justice should be administered by tribunals which are not court  martials.  We have had private soldiers judged by their officers and officers judged by each other. Lord Russell of Killowen told Queen Victoria that the members of court  martials  are so steeped in prejudice regarding questions of what they call honour that they are incapable of doing justice. Campbell says that when he made a statement regarding the matters referred to he was called upon at a moment&#39;s notice to pack his kit, and was sent for months patrolling the islands. The officers say that nothing of the kind happened, but that applications from those who were willing to accept extended service were asked for, and that Campbell applied. Campbell says that that is a lie. It can be proved whether it is or is not a lie. Did Campbell volunteer? If so, where is his written application, or the proof that he volunteered by word of mouth. The papers which have been laid before the Senate show on their surface evidence of deliberate conspiracy. They do not contain the documents that are essential to the justification of the position taken up by the military authorities. Until the confession which this private soldier is said to have made has been produced, the Minister, Colonel Holmes, and the whole Administration must stand condemned as mere  concocters  and conspirators against the public interest. I leave the matter there. </para>

                        <para>.- We should have a statement from the Assistant Minister of Defence on this subject. A most serious charge has been made by the honorable member for Bourke. Papers have been laid on the table of the Library which purport to be the full file, but, according to the honorable member, they are not complete. That charge, if incorrect, should be easily answered. The Assistant Minister should have no difficulty about producing Campbell&#39;s letter. I do not think that we should proceed with the consideration of the Estimates until we have had a reply from the Assistant Minister. It is awkward that the Minister of Defence is not a member of this House. </para>

                            <para>- We know that the Assistant Minister, not being in charge of the administration of the Department, is not as well acquainted with all that takes place as is the Minister himself. The latter, of course, has his hands very full at the present time, but if we want our young men to continue to enlist, we must make them confident that they will receive fair play from their officers. The statement of the honorable member for Bourke has been made with a full sense of responsibility, and the knowledge that if it is untrue the honorable member will forfeit the confidence of the House and of his constituents. Campbell, said that his mate had purchased certain clothing which was proved by a card enclosed with it to have been sent by the Red Cross Society for free distribution to the men. He wrote a letter containing that statement to the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun-.</inline> An inquiry was held later, and it was reported that Campbell confessed that he had been telling a lie. The honorable member for Bourke contends that Campbell&#39;s denial of his first statement should be produced. I think that the Committee should insist on its production, and to confine the discussion to that question, and insure a full explanation by the Minister. I move - </para>

                        <para>.- The case that has been brought under notice, though, perhaps, not a very important one in itself, contains elements which strike at the very root of our military administration, and cannot be ignored by the Minister. The House and the country wish to know whether those who enter our Military Forces are to be treated as justly as they would be treated were they in civil occupations. Will they be given the opportunity to make good any charge, on the understanding that they must suffer penalties for any wrongdoing ? If the charge of the honorable member for Bourke is proved, a private has been slandered by his officers. I do not know Campbell, but I understand that he discovered that certain indiscretions, or certain offences, had been committed, and brought the matter before the Department, and made it public. In my judgment, to purloin an article given by a charitable organization, and to sell it to men to whom it had been given, is a worse crime than stealing, involving, as it does, breach of trust, and the taking of money for something which there is no right to sell. The reputation of certain military officers is at stake, as is also that of Private Campbell ; and the obligation rests with the Minister of Defence to bring the facts to light. If Campbell has made a confession denying his original statement, that confession should be produced. If it cannot be produced, the Minister has a hard case to answer. A straw will show how the wind blows, and the allegations of the honorable member for Bourke, if true, indicate that justice has not been done to the men by their officers. In a free country the humblest individual is entitled to justice, and no man should be branded a perjurer  until there is full proof that he has committed perjury. If courts martial are to continue to produce injustice such as has been alleged, no Minister with any self-respect can continue to support their existence. Ministers have great responsibilities cast upon them at the present time, and my sympathy goes out to them; but that sympathy will not be nearly so intense if matters that go before them for adjustment or adjudication are not dealt with in accordance  with the principles of British justice. Unless all doubts regarding the justice of the Department are removed, a blow will be struck at the public confidence in the Administration. The Minister cannot allow the humblest man under his care to be slandered, or maligned, or unjustly dealt with. This case cannot be allowed to rest, until the alleged confession has been produced and its authorship proved. If the confession cannot be produced, the Department will have a difficult case to answer. I hope that in the interests of our military system the Minister will be able to clear up this matter, and that in future honorable members will not have the unpalatable task of bringing similar cases before the House. This is no party matter. The obtaining of justice for the men who are fighting our battles is far before any question of party politics, and is a sacred trust imposed on us. I, therefore, appeal to the Minister to clear up this case, and thus prevent the impression on the public mind that wrong will not be righted as soon as it is exposed, and that justice will not be done even to the humblest man in the ranks. </para>

Speaking as a member of this House anxious only for the reputation of Australian troops and of Australia, my feeling is that this Rabaul business requires further investigation. I deprecate very strongly any references to officers and men as though we had in the army two classes, one in direct antagonism to the other. </para>

                            <para>- .Some honorable members make it appear, perhaps  unintentionally,  that all officers are more of less tainted with a class bias against the private, and that it is impossible for anything like justice to be obtained by a private from a court martial constituted as courts martial are. I feel sure, however, that that is an entirely erroneous view. I am proud to think that there are many officers who are entirely honorable men, and who are prepared to give the humblest individual in the ranks a fair and square deal. I deprecate very strongly the insinuation that there has been a certain amount of class antagonism in this Rabaul trouble; but it appears to me that the only way in which we can reach any definite conclusion will be by the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to investigate the matter right from the beginning. There is no doubt whatever that courts martial are not entirely satisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- I may have had some acquaintance with courts martial in times gone by. That does not matter; but reading the newspaper proceedings of these two courts martial I cannot help feeling that there is something behind these proceedings which requires further investigation. Take, for instance, the report appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to-day of the court martial that tried a certain Captain Ravenscroft. I find that Captain Ravenscroft, in the course of cross-examination, is reported to have said that if he went into a private house, and the owner was away, and could not be found, he or any other officer or man would be entitled to take the property which they found there. That is a most remarkable expression of opinion from a member of our Defence Forces occupying the responsible position of provost marshal. </para>

                            <para>- The statement requires a very considerable amount of qualification at any time, especially in regard to a person whose duty it was to safeguard private property which came into the possession of the Australian troops. I do not want to commit myself to any opinion other than the general opinion I have just expressed until I know more about the whole position, but I do suggest to the Assistant Minister that this matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. The honour and reputation of Australia are at stake, and if there are any guilty persons connected with the allegations of looting at Rabaul they ought to be found and punished, no matter whether they are officers or privates. I therefore trust that steps will be taken to get at the bottom of this business, if only for the credit of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Bourke delivers any speech he makes in a manner which has the effect of almost compelling every honorable member to believe what he says. This morning he has quoted certain things, but he has not quoted everything. He has omitted some very vital points which, if they had been given, would have put a different complexion upon this case straight away. With regard to the letters of confession to which reference has been made, I tell the honorable member and the Committee at once that neither the Minister of Defence nor the Defence Department have received any such letters. The question is not one of having omitted them from the file which has been tabled in the Library. The letters have not been received. </para>

                        <para>On the 7th instant, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> referred to some statements which have been circulated in regard to Red Cross material forwarded to Rabaul. The charges were, briefly, that Private Campbell was in the company of another member of the Expeditionary Force to Rabaul, who purchased two suits of pyjamas containing notes from Red Cross workers in Sydney, at the dry canteen there. The report was denied by the Administrator,  Colonel Holmes,  who stated that Private Campbell was writing to the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> newspaper, informing it that the pyjamas in question were privately purchased from another member of the force. Tlie <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> however, stated that it had not received a letter from Private Campbell, and, further, that the latter denied writing such a letter. Campbell further stated that he was paraded before the officer commanding the troops, Lieut. -  Colonel W.  W. Russell Watson, in regard to the original report, and as a punishment he was sent away at a few hours&#39; notice as ship&#39;s guard to outlying island. On his return from this duty he stated that he personally purchased pyjamas at the dry canteen, which did not have Red Cross tickets on them, but were labelled&#34; O.S.M&#34;, which he took to be the initials of a Red Cross worker. A final statement is that the profits of the canteen did not go to the soldiers. </para>

                            <para>- No. The statement that Campbell made a written confession, and the fact that that confession has not been produced, goes to the very essence of the matter. </para>

                            <para>- So far as the Minister is aware there is no written confession in the Defence Department. The point that I wish to emphasize is that there has been no holding back of information on our part. The honorable member for Bourke at least inferred that the Minister had held up certain papers. </para>

                        <para>, - I have&#39; listened carefully to the statements of the Assistant Minister, and feel that while one may regret the length to which the honorable member for Bourke allowed himself to go, the fact remains that the Court found that Private Campbell had made certain admissions, and that those alleged admissions cannot be substantiated by one scrap of writing of any kind. The Court makes the statement that he signed an admission of the untruth of his statements. Surely the Court, before arriving at that finding, must have seen that written admission. There is of course the alternative that it had the statement of a number of men, and believed it, that they had seen such an admission. There is, however, something that needs to be cleared up. To my mind this is perhaps the most serious of the criticisms that have been made against the administration of our Forces in Rabaul. If it be true that these men have been selling Red Cross pyjamas, and so making money for their own use, they will have earned the reprobation and disgust of all right-minded men. It is so very serious that the whole matter should be cleared up. If the Court has made the finding mentioned by the Assistant Minister, then it ought to say why in reporting that finding it has not produced the papers alleged to have been signed by Campbell. The whole question is too serious to be allowed to stay where it is, particularly having regard to the further allegation made by the honorable member for Bourke that this selling of Red Cross pyjamas was a cold-blooded commercial transaction to make good some bad purchases previously made from Burns, Philp and Company. That further allegation also requires to be looked into, although it is not so serious as the other. In war time we cannot guarantee that everything we buy is all that could be desired, particularly when our purchases are made under pressure and stress. We have to take lots of risks. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt of that, and many people have been glad to get it. Take for instance the failure of the sugar supply reported in this morning&#39;s newspapers, as well as the difficulty in obtaining men&#39;s underwear of certain quality. War dis locates all our ordinary business transactions, so that this later allegation is not so serious as is the earlier one. If an officer has made a mistake during war time in making purchases, he can be excused, but there is absolutely no excuse for a man selling Red Cross goods, except under the direction of the Red Cross authorities themselves, and for good cause shown. That they appropriated to their own use the proceeds of the sale of Red Cross pyjamas is a heinous crime with which to charge any officers. It would be a heinous crime against the Army as well as against the country, and should be sifted to the bottom. On the evidence before us it is difficult to say whether Campbell did or did not make any such admission as has been alleged. The Court only says that the charge made by him is not proven, and unless it can be disproved by documentary or other evidence, I should hesitate to condemn Private Campbell. We have it on the authority of the Court that a confession in duplicate was signed by Campbell, and therefore T should imagine that the Court is responsible for the production of that confession to the Minister. That point ought certainly to be cleared up. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not, as the Assistant Minister would have the Committee believe, delight in charging military officers with all. the crimes in the calendar. I have no desire to do anything of the kind. Military officers are only human, and it is really in the interests of those who discharge their duties in a proper manner that we bring forward these matters. For centuries past, in war time, charges have been made against military and naval men in connexion with the commissariat and hospital supply departments. We sometimes hear members of Parliament charged with bribery. Men have gone out of their way to tell me that members of Parliament enjoy various pickings as well as their salaries; and where it can be show that a member lias been guilty of bribery or improper conduct, we should be ready at once to take action. And so with a naval or military officer against whom charges are made. Officers and non-commissioned officers in every army have, at various times, been committed to gaol for peculations, and surely when an accusation of this character is made against men who ought to be honorable, and whom we hope are honorable, they should be proved or disproved. The charges laid against the administration of affairs at Rabaul do not rest on the alleged sale of Red Cross pyjamas in the dry canteen. Men who have returned have said that in a German store they saw exhibited for sale  goods  which must have come from the Commissariat Department. Surely when a charge is made, and there is a chance to investigate it, the investigation should proceed in a proper manner. The Minister thinks that the fact that the letters O.S.M. were on the pyjamas proved that these goods were not Red Cross goods, but he has no document from Campbell to show that the pyjamas did bear these letters on them. The statement is not Campbell&#39;s. It is the officers&#39; statement. Every man in the trade knows the meaning of these letters. What does the Minister gain by introducing them in his attempt to disprove that these goods were Red Cross? </para>

                                and other ladies having interested themselves in the matter of sending pyjamas to the Red Cross Society, I did not think it beneath my dignity to sit down at a machine and sew for two days at these pyjamas. Therefore, I know exactly what was done with the pyjamas sent to the Red Cross Society. I took part in the manufacture of dozens of them, and there were no sizes marked on them.

                            <para>- Let me make my own point. There are two documents necessary, and until they are produced I shall condemn these men. On the one hand we have the statement of Campbell that he purchased pyjamas with Red Cross signs on them. On the other hand it is said that they were not Red Cross signs, but were the marks showing the size of the garment. But how can the officers prove that the pyjamas Campbell purchased were marked O.S.M. unless Campbell has said it, and if he did say it, where is the document in which he did so? If the Department cannot produce the document in which they claim that Campbell denied the truth of the charges he had made, at least we may ask where the document &#39;is in which they say that Campbell said the pyjamas he purchased had the letters O.S.M. on them. However, the Prime Minister has asked me to resume my seat, whilst some other business is brought before the Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not my intention to protract the discussion, but I desire to say that while many of us do not feel inclined to use the language of the honorable member for Bourke, we do agree that there is much in his contention. We quite understand that the honorable member always expresses his opinions in that style which is characteristic of him, and that lie does not intend to give any offence. In my opinion, it is the duty of the Minister of Defence, in order to settle this matter in the interests of the officers and the people at large, to produce the document wherein the man Campbell wrote that there was no truth in his statement in regard to the pyjamas he had purchased. The endeavour which has been made to prove that the pyjamas were not Bed Cross articles is, to my mind, another evidence of the guilt of the parties concerned. There can be no charge against the Minister of Defence, unless he fails to produce the document, or to deal with those who have said that such a document exists, because if the document is in evidence, as well as the statutory declaration by Campbell that he did not withdraw his statement, it is the duty of the Department to charge that man with perjury. </para>

                        <para>. - It is my desire to make a few remarks concerning the unsuitability of Broadmeadows as a site for the purpose for which it is being used. In my opinion, that site has only one thing to commend it, and that is the fact that it is in the angle of two railway lines, and in connexion with the north, the northeast, and the southern portions of the State. That is undoubtedly a valuable consideration from a military point of view, but in every other respect Broadmeadows is unsuitable. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so, but I think that after having had twenty years&#39; experience in military camps in this State, I am entitled to form an opinion as to the suitability or otherwise of any site. The consequences which follow the selection of an unsuitable site are felt most by that branch of the service to which I belong, because the medical officers have to correct the errors made by those responsible for camping men on unsuitable ground. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly, but will the honorable member contend that there is a good natural supply at Broadmeadows? There is a good supply of water there now, but it may be interfered with to the detriment of the health of the men who have to camp there. I have heard that there is a disposition on the part of the Defence Department to make a permanent camp at Broadmeadows. Against such a course I emphatically protest. Because of its nearness to railway communication and to the head-quarters, Broadmeadows may be considered a comfortable and convenient place at which to camp troops for a brief period; but as a permanent camp it has only its convenience to railway facilities to recommend it. In summer time the dust rises in clouds, and the food and equipment of the men is made in a condition too awful to describe. In many other ways the men feel the strain of having to return to such insanitary and unsuitable surroundings after a hard day&#39;s work. In winter time the disadvantages are aggravated to an enormous extent. The men are almost knee-deep in slush and slime, and although some are able to mitigate the effects of such conditions by providing themselves, at their own expense, with rubber boots that reach to the knee, those men are the exception. I cannot help feeling that it is the self-interest of those who are in authority which has maintained the camp on the present site. It is near Melbourne, and is in telephonic communication with the city and headquarters, and mainly for those reasons the troops have been subjected to conditions which were avoidable. Whilst some may approve of the hardening process, I think we must realize that the preparation of the men should be carried out under the best conditions obtainable. The mere fact that land is occupied by the Government at no cost is not a sufficient reason for endangering the success of thousands of men who may have their constitutions undermined by these surroundings at a time when the best that can be provided should be placed at their disposal. Much has been said of the patriotic attitude of the proprietor of the land. I understand that he is not receiving any direct payment from the Government, but he has a means of recouping himself by supplying necessaries to the troops, and in that way he is amply compensated for granting the Government the use of this land. I urge that the Assistant Minister should acquire personal knowledge of the conditions under which the camp is being conducted at Broadmeadows. I cannot accent the kind invitation of the Minister to accompany him to the camp for a week-end, because, having a wife and family, I do not feel inclined to run the risks that would be attendant on such a visit under present conditions. I am confident, however, that if the Minister were to make a personal inspection of the camp and undergo the discomforts, not to say dangers, which the troops are undergoing, the camp would speedily be removed from its present situation. We have been told that inquiries have been made, and a more suitable site has not been found. I ask the Minister what fault can be found with Langwarrin ? That locality has been used for military camping purposes for many years; there are a number of permanent buildings that can be used with advantage and the soil is of so sandy and porous a character that even after a heavy downfall of rain the camp is soon dry. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but every camp that the troops have used in Victoria is second to Langwarrin as a dirty-weather camp. Then there is the area at Seymour where the camp was held with great success during Lord Kitchener&#39;s visit. If the Minister were at Seymour now, immediately after a heavy downpour of rain, he would find a dry site where troops could be properly drilled and trained without detriment to their health. The water supply, too, is admirable. There is a further objection to Broadmeadows on account of its adjacency to Melbourne. A great deal of trouble would have been avoided if our troops had not been camped so near the city. I cannot help being impressed by the effects which have followed the bringing from all parts of the country of numbers of young men, in the full strength of manhood, and placing them within such easy reach of the temptations of a large city. </para>

                            <para>- Will the honorable member say that the objections to Seymour are comparable to the awful results which have followed the placing of a large body of men at Broadmeadows? We were all proud to see our magnificent troops marching through Melbourne on two occasions, but we, also noticed that at the end of their march many of the men showed by their fatigue that they were unfitted for the work iu which they were engaged. What had unfitted them? There is no doubt in my mind that that result was due to their nearness to a great city, and the temptations that were thrust before them. I have always held the opinion that the enemy had no better assistants in Australia than those men who were continually treating the troops whenever they came to the city. I would go so far as to intern men who were seen giving our soldiers opportunities for over-indulgence in drink. </para>

                            <para>- I have been long associated with soldiers, and I have no desire to do so. But surely, if we find the men succumbing to temptation, we should either remove the temptation from the men, or the men from the temptation ; and we should not be treating them as children, but as fellow human beings in whose welfare we have a deep and lasting interest. I hope the Government will pause before they give further favorable consideration to the idea of making a permanent camp at Broadmeadows. In summer the heat there is almost unendurable, and in winter the place is absolutely dangerous to the health of the men. </para>

                            <para>- I arn not saying one word about the conduct or behaviour of the troops; I am speaking of the physical and moral effects of indiscriminate treating. The Australian soldiers would compare most favorably with any similar body of men in any part of the world, and I speak from personal experience. It has been said that the Australian soldier is not amenable to discipline, but I absolutely deny that that is so. The Australian desires to know why he is asked to do a thing, and no more obedient man will be found when he once understands what is expected of him. As a consequence, I suppose, of their life and surroundings, a great many of them do not care to regard themselves as simply cogs in the wheels of a great machine. They have an amount of initiative, which more than compensates for the dog-like obedience on which some people, I think, place an exaggerated value. Has the Minister received any further information respecting that enormous body of derelicts who were supposed to have reached Egypt from Australia, but about whom we have heard nothing since they were sent away from that country ? Where are the physical wrecks who, we are told, passed the medical officers here in such vast numbers, and were trained at great expense and sent to Egypt, only to have it discovered that they were suffering from all sorts of diseases, which unfitted them for the ranks? It is only fair that we should know what warrant there was for the statements which appeared in the press from time to time. As to the censorship, I feel that a great mistake was committed by those responsible in allowing such palpable attempts at self-advertisement on the part of a number of men who ought to know better - men who desired to secure attention that they, probably, could not otherwise expect. I cannot help feeling that a number of members of the medical profession, who are supposed to set their faces against advertising for self-interest, have done this, careless altogether of the effect on the large number of men who have shown in the most effective fashion that they are not only well trained, but possess every attribute necessary for the efficient carrying out of the important work in which they are engaged. Before the next lot of Light Horse leave Australia, I think some further examination should be made of the horses. We have gone to tremendous expense in order to obtain the best horses procurable in Australia; but if some of those I have seen go to other parts of the world, they will be a sorry advertisement for the horse-breeders of this country. Some of the veriest &#34; crocks &#34; have been purchased ; and I am assured that a  num-&#34;  ber have died either from old age or for want of those teeth which are so necessary in the recruit, but which do not seem to be regarded as necessary in the animal that has to carry him. The whole matter deserves the most careful inquiry at the hands of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Owing to the scarcity of fodder, some farmers have not been able to sell their  horses  at all - apparently have not had sufficient influence to enable them to do so. One aspect of  the question deserves attention, and that is the number of unbroken colts which are. placed in the hands of our young trainees. Lads of eighteen years of age, who have just left the Cadet Forces tor the Militia, are given the control of, and are expected to break in, a number of young horses; and this is a dangerous and unnecessary proceeding. </para>

                            <para>- Then those men should be employed. The number of injuries the men receive in the training camps would be considerably reduced if they were not compelled to do this work. There is no more certain way of turning a decent horse into a rogue or an &#34;outlaw&#34; than to place him in incompetent hands. Above all things, we should have the services of men who thoroughly understand horses; and there are a. number of such, who, while unfit for active service, would be quite prepared to do this duty at Broadmeadows. The whole question of defence has been brought most vividly before the people of Australia by recent happenings; and I hope that what I have said will not be regarded as merely captious criticism of either the Department or its heads. I recognise the great work that has been done by the Department, and the loyalty of the Minister to the principles we have  established in Australia. I feel, however, that very often the head of the Department, or the representative of the Government, is prone to take the advice of those who are in authority below them, rather than seek information at first-hand. All I ask is that the Minister and the Assistant Minister shall avail themselves of opportunities to get personal knowledge of the conditions. From my experience of both these gentlemen, I feel sure that we should have some very rapid effects, and eventually a satisfactory solution of a problem which at the present time is causing a great deal of unrest to those to whom we ought to be anxious to render every assistance and help. </para>

                    <para>Reference has been made to the censorship of news. Could there be anything, I was going to say more idiotic or futile than the present system ? Criticism of a constructive, as well as criticism of a destructive, character is offered in this Chamber; and it appears that the censors prevent the newspapers from publishing reports of speeches of the kind. In the first place, I think it is highly objectionable that anybody should step in between a member of this National Parliament and his constituents, and prevent them from knowing the manner in which he is rendering an account of his stewardship. In the second place, the system is most futile, for there are always the records of Parliament, in the shape of <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard,</inline> which is distributed throughout Australia. The public are not permitted to have the news through the newspapers, but they have full access to the official volumes of that publication. I have been told that the circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is about 60,000; but I should say it is more like 6,000. </para>

                            <para>- That would make very little material difference. The whole facts show that the military censorship of newspapers is an absolute farce. It places no obstacle upon alien enemies obtaining parliamentary news, but places the Australian public at a  disadvantge.  If under pressure of business such, an absolutely silly and futile proceeding can take place, similar foolishness may be perpetrated in many other instances. That being so, the sooner we have an opportunity to go into the whole business the better. </para>

                            <para>- Cable messages give us a great deal more information regarding the war preparations of Great Britain than we can learn in this Parliament of our own preparations. This secrecy is absolutely futile. How would the publication of news in the  newpapers  assist the enemy? Australia is an island continent, tens of thousands of miles distant from the great centres of war. We have censors in the post and telegraph offices, so that not a telegram can be sent away until it has run the gauntlet of the censorship, and every letter is subject to the same scrutiny. Business men have told me that their letters have sometimes been detained for weeks because of the censorship, This is perfectly right. The military authorities are able to board vessels with a view to seeing that information is not sent out surreptitiously, and no letter can be handed to a passenger on a ship. It is perfectly right to take those precautions. But, all channels of communication between Australia and other countries being thus guarded, what is the sense of preventing the Australian public from knowing the condition of our defences, and the manner of the administration of the Defence Department? </para>

                            <para>- The representatives of the people should be satisfied that the best is being done for the successful prosecution of the war. Let us meet and take counsel together on this matter, irrespective of party. We are asked to trust the Minister. In my opinion, the Minister of Defence and the Assistant Minister, who might well be called the Naval Minister, are two of the ablest members of the present Administration, if not two of the ablest administrators, that we have had since Federation. But if one pair of shoulders can bear the great responsibility of  managing  the Department at a time of national danger, why could not the Minister, in times of peace, have the same undisputed authority ? Yet, in less strenuous circumstances, no Parliament would allow its power of direction to be superseded. In my opinion it is practically impossible for these Ministers to properly handle the situation. </para>

If one asks for information he is told that under the circumstances it would be better not to press the question. It may, however, be more in the public interest that the matter should be ventilated. Facts that have come to light show the need for investigation. </para>

                            <para>- A leading article was recently published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> in which the public men of Australia were charged with failing to do their duty in that they did not go out and address recruiting meetings. In order to find out what exactly was the position, I asked the Minister in the House whether all the recruits that were required were coming forward, and I was told that as many men as were wanted were offering. Obviously it is no use holding recruiting meetings if that is the case. I am prepared to go through my own district and address meetings in order to point out the necessity of joining the colours, if it is necessary, but when I am told by the responsible Minister that this is not required, there is no necessity for me to do anything of the kind. Yet, a few days after this answer was given, I saw that the Prime </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, and there is not the slightest doubt that double the number of men who have already enlisted would be prepared to come forward at once if the matter was one of urgency. We ought to know whether it is. A question was asked this morning as to reducing the physical standard of recruits. I quite agree that if there are a sufficient number of men offering of the necessary physical attainments as at present prescribed, there is no need to make any reduction. It would be foolish to take men who have physical defects if we can get men in perfect physical condition. </para>

With agreement on the utility of joint action, a <inline font-style="italic">via media</inline> could readily be found. At present, even the Government party cannot supervise or control the defence activities as in ordinary times. The Minister has so much to do that he is probably working with insufficient rest. That in itself means that he is not in a physical condition to initiate matters that might be helpful to our country and Empire at this time. It is not possible to get more than a certain amount of work out of one body. </para>

The Minister of Defence and the Assistant Minister are two capable, painstaking, and efficient Ministers, and I am not casting any reflection upon them in my criticism, but we know that the tendency is to limit responsibility and power to one or two who may object to any criticism being passed upon their actions. At the same time Parliament has every right to know what is being done, and no Minister has any right to regard himself as immune from criticism. </para>

Is any honorable member of this House satisfied about the financial arrangement, either so far as it concerns the present prosecution of the war or what may be expected afterwards? Who knows what the position is? We do not know what is being spent. We do not know what we have been committed to. We have to take all we hear on trust.

I am very distrustful of military officers. As soldiers, I have every confidence in them. That is their profession ; but as business men and as judges in cases where good conscience and equity should prevail, I have no confidence in them whatever as a class. There may be good men among them; there may be bad men among them; but as a class I have no confidence in them at all, and we know, in regard to military contracts, that cases have been brought forward where the most elementary business principles have been neglected. Why? To place the most generous construction upon it, because the military officers have been engaged in a business for which they have no qualification, or whose only qualification regarding the handling of money is the ability to spend it. This Parliament ought to have an opportunity of going into these matters. We might be able to discover some better means of expending the public money, we may be able to check abuses, and we might be able to save millions even upon the expenditure that is now going on. We know there lias been a great deal of waste. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> was appointed as business expert to lay down certain principles upon which the accounts might be kept, but it would be impossible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> to have done more than go into the general system of bookkeeping. </para>

                            <para>- I agree. Both in regard to the immediate financial arrangements in connexion with the war, and also in the arrangements which will have to be made afterwards, we do not know where we are or where we may be landed. What provision are we going to make to meet the financial obligations that we have undertaken? The present arrangements are only temporary. Some permanent arrangement will have to be come to, and no honorable member of this House can say that he is satisfied with what he knows of the arrangements that have so far been made. I feel certain that every honorable member who knows anything about the subject, instead of being satisfied, is abundantly dissatisfied. The right honorable member for Swan thinks satisfaction should be obtained by action of a party character. It is not long since I heard the right honorable member urge in this House that there should be no attempt to make party capital out of the situation in which we find ourselves - that all parties should, unite in doing the best for Australia and the Empire. That is the stand I am taking, so that it does not come very well from him to urge me to attack Ministers, and to try to do them some party injury. I believe that a lot more can be done for Australia and the Empire by an alteration of the present system of management. </para>

                    <para>Coming to the question of munitions of war, the output of rifles, and the management of the Small Arms Factory, sufficient has been said by honorable members to show that there is a very general belief that there is room for much improvement. We are told that it is impossible to obtain the additional men required to work a second shift at the Small Arms Factory. I have here, however, a letter from a man who is competent to undertake work in the manufacture of rifles&#39;, and munitions, and who has written to ask me if there is any chance of his being employed by the British Government, since he is prepared to go to Great Britain, and is fully qualified to engage in this class of work. Then, again, I saw recently a statement, by either the Prime Minister or the Minister of Defence, that he had been inundated with applications from men who were prepared to go to Great Britain to assist in the manufacture of munitions of war. </para>

                            <para>- If it is, then we ought to know in respect of what material any shortage exists. If there is a shortage of steel, the sooner we know it the better. This Parliament ought to be prepared to spend &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000 at the earliest possible moment in laying down a plant to make all the steel that we require. We should also establish a plant for the seasoning of timber. We have an abundance of iron ore deposits in Australia: There are large deposits in the east, the west, and the south, if not in the north, and to say that, in a country that has all the raw material necessary for the purpose, we cannot obtain the material required for the manufacture of rifles and ammunition, and that in face of that fact we are doing nothing to avert such a calamitous situation, seems to me to be absolutely indefensible. We are told that we must not go into such matters. We must not mention that there is any shortage in respect of the manufacture of these things. The Minister holds up his hands in holy horror and says, &#34; You are giving information to the enemy,&#34; if we talk in this strain, and ask that something should be done. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not propose to occupy the time of the Committee  at any great length this afternoon, but I must express the pleasure which the remarks just made by the honorable member for Cook have afforded me. 1 do not think that we quite realize our responsibilities to the Empire. The British Government, in my opinion, are prepared to receive as many troops as we can send; aud, if the Minister of Defence would advise them that we have another 10,000 or 20,000 troops prepared to go to the front, I am sure that their services would be gladly accepted. We read only two days ago of the statement made in the British Parliament by Lord Kitchener that he is desirous of obtaining another 300,000 troops. In view of that statement, I think we in Australia should loyally respond to the Empire&#39;s call and fill up the breach. I listened also with great interest to the remarks made last night by the honorable member for Macquarie in reference to the Small Arms Factory. He is naturally anxious that it should succeed, and 1, as the representative of a neighbouring electorate, sympathize with him in that desire. </para>

The original cost of the Small Arms Factory was &#163;300,000, and, taking the interest on that outlay at 4 per cent., we find that we are paying practically a rental of &#163;12,000 a year for the factory. </para>

                            <para>- I have taken them from a statement made in this House by the ex-Prime Minister. I understand, although I am not quite sure of my figures, that the output of rifles from the Small Arms Factory is about 12,000 a year, so that we are paying, in the way of interest on machinery and plant, &#163;1 per rifle per annum. If we employed three shifts at the factory, the output would be 36,000 per year, bringing down the interest charges on premises, machinery, and so forth, to 6s. 8d. per rifle, or one-third of the amount at present being paid. I have heard some unpleasant rumours regarding&#34; the factory. There is a movement on foot to remove it to Canberra. I cannot understand why, when one Government has seen fit to expend &#163;300,000 in erecting the factory at Lithgow, another Administration should be prepared to uproot this valuable institution and plant it somewhere else. </para>

                            <para>- All the same, some of my constituents complain that they are not supplied with rifles and cartridges. Rifle clubs have been formed all over my electorate. The members of two or three clubs were informed that they could not get the rifles, and were, at the same time, told to drill. As a matter of fact, one man suggested that the men should use broom handles. Apart from that, however, let us consider the state of unemployment in this country. Walking out of Collins-street the other day towards a park I noticed a crowd of men standing there. I asked a gentleman who they were, and he said that they were the unemployed. I think that we could do something for the men, and at the same time a great deal for the Empire, by establishing a factory to manufacture ammunition, and also explosives for mines and various callings. It was only the other day that I read in a newspaper that Canada had entered into a contract to supply the War Office at Home with ammunition to the value of &#163;14,000,000. What Canada can do, surely Australia can do ! I have also noticed that, so far, the United- States of America have supplied the Old Country with &#163;100,000,000 worth of ammunition. One of the reasons for the present situation in Australia is, as the honorable member for Hunter pointed out, .that we have no testing plant. If any persons go in for the manufacture of ammunition, it has to be sent to England and tested there before it can be used here. Many of the miners in the electorate of Hunter are denied employment, while many cannot work for such high remunerative wages as otherwise they would be able to do. I would like the Minister to inform the country day by day, or week by week, where the Expeditionary Forces are. </para>

                            <para>- Now and again some information is published. The other day I I saw a. letter in which it was stated that  Colonel Ryrie  had sent to his wife a cablegram saying that they were all happy and doing well in Egypt. If officers can send messages to their friends advising them where they are, and there is no censoring, there is no reason why the Minister should not tell the House and the country exactly where the various regiments are. Does my honorable friend opposite mean to say that the Turks do not know that the Light Horse regiments are stationed in Egypt? Yesterday, the honorable members for Ballarat and Fremantle complained of the lax. way in which promotions are made, and demanded, above all things, that the one consideration should be efficiency. They urged that the results of competitive examinations should decide whether men ought to be promoted or not. I happen to be on very friendly terms with an Area Officer, and he has confirmed what they said here. Only a few moments ago I spoke to this gentleman on the telephone, and he told me that there is a great deal of truth in the assertions made in the House last night. </para>

I was very pleased indeed to see those two honorable members so exacting with their own Government as to demand that efficiency should be the rule for promotion in the Defence Department. I hope that they will remember their statements of last night, and apply the rule to all the Departments. We do not want any preference to unionists; we want efficiency every time. Efficiency should be the guiding principle. It is one which is observed right through the Empire.  </para>

                            <para>- I was born in India, and associated a great deal with members of its Civil Service. When I went to school in England, I noticed that examinations were always set for the Ceylon and Indian Civil Service, and that no person was allowed to enter the Service unless he had passed them. He was tested as to physique and ability. I think we might well apply those tests in our own Civil Service, and only grant promotion where it is deserved by the proof of efficiency, eliminating every other consideration. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. There is an evident desire on the part of honorable members that they should, as far as practicable, be fortified in their own minds with sufficient information - not to be published - to enable thom to tell the public at large that things are going on all right. I do not know whether there is anything in the Standing Orders or the rules of Parliament to prevent the Senate and the House of Representatives from meeting as one body. I believe that a good heart-to-heart talk in camera among members of both Chambers, with the advantage of the attendance of Ministers and ex-Ministers in the Senate and Ministers and ex-Ministers in this Chamber, would throw a great deal of light upon the movements now afoot, which would be of considerable benefit. I am satisfied that there would be a cessation of much of the criticism which is now being indulged in, and that there would be a better understanding between all parties. </para>

                            <para>- Without going into that aspect of the question, I believe that the present Minister of Defence, the Assistant Minister of Defence, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the ex-Minister, know more about the defence of Australia than any other persons. Every honorable member has a certain amount of information of a confidential nature, but Ministers are in possession of most confidential information which they cannot now divulge, but which they could divulge at a joint meeting in camera. Many of us approach a debate of this character with the knowledge that we must restrain ourselves in regard to talking about much of the information that we have been able to obtain, but which we might be able to divulge at a meeting in camera with benefit to each other. I believe that a meeting such as I have suggested would do away with a considerable amount of heart-burning and misapprehension, and would establish a firmer and more united feeling in regard to the war than now exists in this Chamber. I do not know whether our Standing Orders will  permit  it. </para>

                            <para>- There is a considerable difference. I would like to have the number of rifles over the honorable member&#39;s estimate. But we cannot expect even the Assistant Minister of Defence to give us that information in the full gaze of the public. I do not claim to be the father of the suggestion, for a meeting in camera. I simply indorse remarks that have already been made; but I trust that the meeting will be held, and that honorable members will be informed of the true state of affairs, because then recriminations, which should not exist at a time when we have such great issues at stake, will be prevented, and honorable members will be able to go to the public outside more confidently, not to give information, but in order to assure them that Defence matters are all right. </para>

                        <para>.- There is on both sides of the chamber a growing and natural desire for legitimate information as to some of the important phases of our preparations for home defence and fighting overseas, and Ministers should recognise it. This is the first great international struggle in which we have been active participants. It is true that we have not learned the discipline of the older fighting nations of the world, who are content to take their punishment silently, and very often without a knowledge of the facts. In Australia, we have a very inquisitive and intelligent Democracy, and on the occasion of our first big blood-baptism we seek to know of many things that older nations are content to leave to their leaders. In this House, this feeling is utterly irrespective of party. From all sides the Assistant Minister and his colleagues are plied with all sorts of questions about which honorable members have imperfect information, and about which they desire to know something, but not with the idea of eliciting information the publication of which might prove hurtful to the country. That being so, it is time that the Ministers in charge of the Defence Department should take counsel with their leader and colleagues in Cabinet, and see whether there could not be, at an informal joint sitting of both Houses, as suggested by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, or in the respective Chambers with strangers ordered out, a heart-to-heart talk, as the honorable member calls it, about many of the important phases of the war. A debate on the question would not be sufficient, and would be .an improper way of dealing with the matter. I think that the Ministers, who would be very fully posted with information, should welcome questions put in an entirely non-party way. If we do this, many of the doubts and some of the anxieties that honorable members feel would be set at rest. I hope that the Assistant Minister, who, I believe is doing his best amid the enormous pressure of the Department to keep himself abreast of the problems and the information that honorable members desire, will at an early date take the suggestion to the Prime Minister. Let me give an illustration. I give it with some degree of diffidence, but with the  knowledge that if it is not deemed wise to give it publicity outside the columns of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> the censorship will exclude reference to it in the public press. This is a case which came under my own knowledge. I do not know all the facts, but I know some of them. Before Christmas I endeavoured to elicit information at the time that the thing occurred, but the Minister, with the reticence that seems to cover him occasionally, declined to make reference to it. It appeared a very grave scandal to those who knew anything about it. The Government chartered a ship known as the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra,</inline> altered her whole condition, and fitted her as a hospital ship, with the Red Cross flag flying above and painted on her side, and despatched her with a large hospital equipment to Egypt. She flew the international flag of peace. Some of the hospital equipment, together with doctors, nurses, and stretcher-bearers was embarked either at Sydney or Brisbane. The vessel then came to Melbourne, and when the authorities were preparing to put on. board the final peace stores, they found, to their astonishment, that there was at least 500 tons of contraband of war stored in the hold. The thought occurred to some of us: If that contraband material had not been discovered, and that vessel had been held up and searched by one of the German cruisers which were abroad at that time, what greater advertisement could Germany have giver, to the world than that one of the daughter Dominions of the British Empire was sailing a vessel under the flag of peace with contraband of war in her hold ? Surely that incident was a scandal which should have been- raked to its foundations. I endeavoured to get information about it, because I saw the ship loaded in Melbourne; but so far we have had no information that any investigation took place, or that any person, military or civilian, was punished or held responsible for the mistake. If the incident had been found out by Germany, Australia&#39;s name would have been covered with ignominy in the eyes of the thoughtful world. There are a number of other things about which, we desire information, and I venture to say that if we could have an assurance that the Department is working efficiently and thoroughly all honorable members of the House would co-operate loyally with the Government in carrying out the great task that confronts them. The rifle range problem is a question of deep concern to many of us. Some of us have .asked questions of Ministers on the subject, but, so far as we can learn, nothing has been done. I attend meetings all over the State to help the recruiting movement, either for service overseas or for defence preparation in Australia, and at every meeting I ask myself what is the good of increasing the membership of rifle clubs if the members cannot obtain rifles and ranges upon which to shoot. I have seen men who live within 100 yards of my residence go Saturday after Saturday to Williamstown or Port Melbourne and return in the evening without having fired a shot, though they had waited on the ranges three or four hours. The rifle ranges adjacent to this capital city are so congested that even the present members of rifle clubs cannot get any practice. The condition may bo the same in all the capital cities of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- They are doing that. One of the most pleasing phases of the movement is the number of officers belonging to the Forces who are giving up their time to assist in drilling the riflemen, .and making them efficient. I do not wish Ministers to think that I am saddling them with the blame, but that there is a grave problem in connexion with secondary defence goes without saying. Tt may be that we have not the rifles for the use of the men who are engaged in this secondary defence movement. If that is so, men can still shoot with borrowed rifles, and drill with or without them ; but there should be some chance of them shooting on rifle ranges, and becoming accustomed to the use of firearms, even though a big expenditure of ammunition be involved. It seems to me that there are many ways of overcoming the present difficulty. Without anything like as extensive a knowledge of the area surrounding Melbourne as is possessed by the Defence officers, I could mark half-a-dozen sites on the railway line, and within reasonable distance of the central railway station, where admirable rifle butts could be erected, and where men could be encouraged to engage in this preparatory work at least once a week. It is time the Department made a move in that respect, if it has not already moved. So far as we can see, the Department is not moving. </para>

                            <para>- I would place no conditions on the Defence Department in that respect. If the Department says that rifle clubs should consist only of men who are physically fit, I would offer no objection, or if it said that all men who could use a rifle should be given the opportunity of learning to handle a rifle, as was done by the Boers, who put up an excellent fight in the defence of their homes, I would say that those men should be given a chance. I would allow the Defence Department to settle the question, but the Department should move at once in one direction or the other. That is another illustration of the kind of information we are asked for by our constituents, and which we are unable to get from Ministers without endeavouring to publicly probe matters that are regarded as secret. I sympathize with Ministers. Often I have been requested by interested persons to ask questions, which, in my opinion, would have involved the disclosure of information which Ministers consider should not be made public, and I have declined to do so. Often Ministers have asked that questions should not be persisted in, and I think, with reasonable deference on both sides of the House, we have taken the nod from the Minister, and have not persisted. But, after allowing for all the privacy and secrecy which the enormous amount of confidential information in the possession of Ministers demands, there is a limit to such secrecy in a Parliament such as this, and I feel that Ministers would be consulting the best interests of both parties, and of the united Parliament, if, at the earliest possible moment, they took honorable members of both Chambers into their fullest confidence in camera. Those disclosures &#39; might require one or two sittings; if so, the time would be well spent. </para>

                            <para>- Admiration is what the honorable member would never have from any honorable member of the House. The honorable member ought to know, if he has enough brains with which to bait a fishhook, which I very much doubt, that 1 am not proposing a discussion on those lines. I shall conclude with a reference to a matter which is not quite related, but is of some importance, and about which I have endeavoured to elicit information, from the Minister. I refer to the censorship of mails. As the honorable member for Cook observed, the commercial community is subject to a good deal of unnecessary delay and embarrassment. We should all endeavour to relieve the business forces of this country, which mean employment and safe finance, of all unnecessary embarrassment or rigidity in connexion with the censorship. But I have heard of firms who do business with Europe, the Orient, or South Africa, sending their mails to the General Post Office in good time before the advertised hour for closing the mails, but, in some cases, they have sent letters to the railway station, and paid the late fee, and to their astonishment and chagrin, they found that the late-fee letters were passed uncensored, and the other letters which had been lodged at the General Post Office had been detained for one month. I do not mean that the censorship occupied a month, but the delay in censoring the letters resulted in their missing the mail, and they had to wait one month for the next mail. One firm doing a thoroughly reputable business with the East in clothing supplies lost &#163;1,200 through the missing of one mail. I had that on the authority of the head of the firm, whose business I am somewhat acquainted with, and whose word I accepted with every assurance. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been listening with a great deal of attention to this important debate, and I want to say at once that the question which the Committee is discussing is a very serious one, for it concerns the most important crisis in the history of the British Empire, if not the whole world. When I hear that the Small Arms Factory is only working one shift, and that we have 33,000 men out of work in Australia, I am compelled to assume that there is a serious want of business organization somewhere. It is nonsense to say that the men cannot be trained to do this or that particular work in the Small Arms Factory. I cannot see why men cannot be taken from the factory and put at the head of another shift, whose particular duty it should be to do only certain parts of the work, leaving the completion to the more experienced men. It is all a matter of business organization. I am sorry I was not in the House when the honorable member for Macquarie was speaking, but I do say that if we had a business Committee from both sides of this House, we could have a very useful discussion with the Minister. The trouble is that some men think they know everything, when, as a matter of fact, they know nothing. I found that out when I was Minister. There are brains at the bottom, but often they can never come out on top because there is no conduit. I want to emphasize the fact that the cry in Britain, in Russia, and in France to-day is for more ammunition. Here, in the <inline font-style="italic">New York World</inline> of Sunday, 28th March, is the statement, &#34; Russia short of munitions.&#34; </para>

If it is not true that Great Britain is short of munitions, why is it that,  at  the beginning of the war, America owed the Britishers $400,000,0.00, and sent gold over to Canada to meet the obligation) Now, after eight months of war, the position has turned until the balance is nearly $1,000,000,000 against Great Britain. We do not want to ask any further questions than that. Men who understand dealing with &#34;boodle&#34; know what that means. </para>

Gold has been made the international medium of liquidation, and every nation now demands gold.

                            <para>- England had a credit of $100,000,000, and Russia a credit of $40,000,000.. That is the balance of trade, and Germany says that this is lending money; and this is the cause of the feeling of Germany against America. I bring these facts forward to show that we Australians ought to turn night into day in order to get out ammunition to help the Old Country. It is idle to come into this House and say that we cannot get the men, for I guarantee that if I were placed at the head of the Lithgow factory, I should have three shifts going in two weeks. The whole trouble is that we hire a .technical mau and put him at the head; but, while a technical man is good on a section, he is not good at &#34;running the whole show.&#34; We ought to hire a thorough business man, and then put the technical man in one corner, the general man in another, and the official man in another, and leave the business man to keep all these &#34; roosters &#34; working. There is another point that appeals seriously to me. I can remember that from 1873 to. 1875, after the war, 2,000,000 starving men were tramping the United States; and we here ought to organize our financial system so as to be able to meet the conditions which will surely arise when this war is over. The trouble is that England, like America, is a commercial, a thinking, an inventing, and a developing nation which has been sending the peace missionaries of commerce throughout the world; and all the time that these two countries have been doing that, Germany has been preparing for &#34; stoush.&#34; In 1886 the capitalists of Germany, England, Belgium, France, and partly America - as America could not get the &#34;big end of the stick&#34; she did not join - organized a great munition trust. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister is unavoidably absent, but I feel sure that he would join with me in saying that the sentiments expressed in the resolution just read are shared by all Australians. We are delighted at the way in which our fellow citizens have done their duty at the front, and are sure that they will continue to do so, though, of course, we hope that the war will soon be over, and that there will be  no  further need for their services. </para>
