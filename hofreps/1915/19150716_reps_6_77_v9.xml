                        <para>- It is not usual to anticipate taxation proposals, but there must be a war tax in addition to a war loan, and in regard to it the rule of taxation will be followed that the burden must be adjusted in accordance with the ability of the people to bear it, and in accordance with the benefits derived by taxpayers from their residence in this country. The matter will be. dealt with before the House adjourns over any considerable period. </para>

A report on the subject was recently received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> upon which the Government determined to proceed with the construction of a testing station, but, as Great Britain has recently erected such a station on the most modern lines, it has been thought well to send one of the analyst's staff to England to inspect what is being done there before we go any further. </para>

Our responsibility is  for  the safety of the Commonwealth as a whole, and if any State or part of a State feels offended by what some other State or district is doing, it can easily alter the position by beating its rivals. All statistical information in the hands of the Defence Department will be made available to the honorable member if he chooses to ask for it. </para>

All trainees who are members of the Expeditionary Forces are, of course, exempt from the universal training clauses of the Defence Act as long as they serve in the Australian Imperial Force. As regards trainees who are invalided from active service abroad on account of illness or wounds, the Minister has approved, as a temporary measure, of these trainees being not compelled to render the required personal service during the present year. </para>

It is to take advantage of existing governmental machinery, whether that machinery be under the direct control of the Commonwealth, the States, or the municipalities. Particularly, we rely, in the first place, on the Post Office, and, in the second place, on the Electoral Department, which has at its disposal the most effective machinery for the purpose. Naturally, as this task is very difficult, we shall have to supplement these services from every other source available, including voluntary assistance. </para>

                        <para>- There is some difficulty in stating definitely when the new arrangement will come into force, but probably that will be on Monday next. The difficulty arises owing to our lack of power to deal with the refining side of the question. It is intended, however, as far as possible, that the new arrangement shall come into force on Monday. I beg to state, for the benefit of the public, that, although every effort will be made by the Commonwealth to retail sugar at 3d. per lb. in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart, the considerations of freight are such that we fear we . shall not be able to sell it at that price in the 'western States. I shall, however, do my best. </para>

                            <para>- No, because if I did I would go and buy it cheaper. What I wish to know is, whether there is any objection to laying on the table of the House a memorandum setting out exactly what has been done in connexion with the whole transaction. The House as yet knows nothing whatever about the details of the arrangements which have been made, and I think, in a public matter of this kind, it is entitled to know. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman is quite right to ask for such a memorandum, and the only reason why fuller information has not been given is that the details of the two transactions - with the Queensland Government and with the Refining Company - have not yet been completed in either case. I saw the general manager of the company the day before yesterday, and I had hoped at that interview to finalize the matter, but I did not succeed in doing so. The honorable gentleman must realize that the Commonwealth, in regard to the Colonial Sugar Refinery, is in exactly the same position as he himself would be. We have no power, and we have to treat with the company and make the best terms we can. As soon as the transaction is reduced to final form and put in the shape of a legal document, that document will be laid on the table. </para>

                            <para>- I have frequently had to call attention to the fact that one question has led to the asking of about a dozen others on the same subject. This morning, I think about six questions have been founded on the one originally asked by the honorable member for Capricornia. When I drew attention to the earlier practice, the Government took the course of asking for notice of each question. However, if the Government is prepared to allow these questions to be asked as they are being now asked, I do not think that there is any necessity for me to try to curtail them. </para>

                                <para>- I will answer the last part of the right honorable member's question first. No constitutional question at all is involved in this proceeding. We are doing as we are, not by virtue of our powers under the Constitution, but by virtue of the Executive power of the Government as such, and we could act in the same way if there were no Constitution at all. As to the first part of the right honorable member's question, I can only say that it is not proposed to grant preference to any State, but it is proposed to treat this as a commercial transaction. If the right honorable gentleman will only realize that the distance increases as one passes from Queensland round the coast, he will understand that by the time Western Australia is reached a great deal more expense in freight charges will have been incurred than would have been incurred had the journey ended at Sydney. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman is very fecund of suggestion and idea, but I would refer him to the system adopted on our railways, which does not lend itself to the brilliant idea of the right honorable gentleman. If he wishes to travel to South Yarra - if he is not a member of Parliament - he has to pay one amount, but if he wishes to travel to Sydney the fare is a great deal more. It is on that basis, not on the basis of the Post Office, that we are carrying out this work. </para>

                        <para>. - We are in a somewhat unique position in regard to the consideration of this measure, since no argument calling for any detailed reply has been advanced from either side. There have been only two adverse criticisms - one from each side of the House - levelled against the Bill. The right honorable member for Swan had some comments and some objections to offer. He seemed to speak of wealth as something so sacrosanct that it ought not to be touched. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to misrepresent the right honorable member, but the criticism in which he indulged certainly left in my mind the impression I have stated. He said that the tabulation was unnecessary, and advanced that argument with the object of showing that the Government should not endeavour to make any such tabulation of wealth as was proposed. Even if, as he contended, some of this information is already to be obtained from the official statistics, there can be no harm in supplementing it in the way now proposed. The honorable member for Brisbane, from this side of the House, has indulged in  a  stronger criticism of the Bill than has any other member. I gathered from his speech that he feared that the proposed manhood census meant conscription. </para>

Following the honorable member's argument to its logical conclusion, instead of having one of our own vessels to sink the <inline font-style="italic">Emden,</inline> we should have waited until our shores were attacked by her before proceeding to build a warship. The proposed census will lead to the tabulation of the manhood, the wealth, and the resources of Australia; better fit us to meet any emergency that may arise. There has been some hint of objection to the proposed tabulation of wealth. The honorable member for Corangamite said very truly last night that many people of wealth in this country are giving, and giving generously. I am prepared to say that there are many who, in that respect, are doing their duty nobly, and who perhaps are not able to go to the war. On the other hand, there are many who have equally as much wealth and are not doing their fair share. </para>

                            <para>- There are men volunteering to-day whose worldly possessions are such that in the colloquial phrase when they have their hats on their roofs are on. Those men are making the greatest sacrifice possible by laying down their lives for their country. Those who survive the campaign may return minus a leg or an arm, and compared with the sacrifice they are making, it cannot be said that those who have the greatest share of the wealth of the country are doing their duty. The real benefit of a tabulation of wealth will be in the fact that we shall be able to compel those who have wealth and are not doing their duty, to do as much as those others who are already doing their duty. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but the man who is now doing nothing will be made to do something, even though incidentally the other man is obliged to do a little more than his fair share. We must reach the fellow who is doing nothing. Several members of this House have been asked why they do not go to the front. When this tabulation is made every man will be required to go in his order; at any rate, if he is not compelled to go, his duty will be clearly shown to him. I have seen men responding to the call who have great responsibilities towards wives and families, and it was no uncommon thing during the recruiting campaign last week for women to ask me after the meeting to try to persuade their husbands not to go to the war, because there were younger men without responsibilities who could go and were not volunteering. After this tabulation every one of us will know when our duty arises, and at what time and in what order we should come forward. The honorable member for Fremantle read a letter last night in which he had notified the Minister of Defence that he had offered his services with the Expeditionary Forces, but having been rejected for active service he was prepared to place the best that was in him at the disposal of the Empire in whatever work the Government might demand of him. I think every one of us is prepared to make that offer to those in authority. I am, and if my health would permit and I thought I could be of most use in the trenches, I would be there. Failing that, my services are at the disposal of the Empire wherever and in whatever way they can be best utilized. In saying that, I feel I am expressing the sentiments of every honorable member of this Parliament. The interjections hurled at public men in regard to their not having gone to the war are very cheap. There is no public man in this country who has not a full realization of what his duty is in these times. But as one representing a country constituency, I know that since the commencement of the war my labours have increased 200 or 300 per cent. One would infer from this cheap criticism that members have nothing to do but recline in their seats in this chamber. I wish that some of our critics could realize the new responsibilities that have been thrown upon a great many of us. There have been duties arising out of this war which have often kept me at work till one o'clock in the morning, and I have been glad) that I am able to be of some service.. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those who have sent sons and husbands to the front are anxious to know about them, and a member of Parliament can iu a hundred ways do much to make the lot of those at the war and . in camp easier, and the burden of those who have given up their menfolk lighter to bear. The object of the Bill is to organize and tabulate our resources in manhood and wealth. The Leader of the Opposition left an impression on my mind that he was somewhat opposed to tabulation of wealth, for which he said there was no precedent. I have wondered 'if the honorable member had ever read of the Doomsday Book compiled by order of William the Conqueror. </para>

We know that in 1753 a Bill of this character was introduced into the House of Commons by a private member, and in 1800 it became law. In the German Empire, ever since its foundation, there has been a quinquennial tabulation of the manhood. </para>

The splendid organization of the powerful empire against which we are fighting is an excellent example of the value of what the Government now ask us to sanction. The German Empire, because of its organization, can lay its hands on the men best suited for agricultural pursuits, on those best suited for engineering pursuits, and on those best suited to serve in -the trenches. It has tabulated the abilities and numbers of its people, and can choose those whom it needs for any particular work. If we had followed its example - not for the purposes of conscription </para>

                            <para>- Like the majority of honorable members, I do not think that conscription is necessary at the present time. But we do not know what may eventuate, and if we should happen to require our fullest fighting strength, the tabulation proposed will enable us to lay our hands on the right men. What is now proposed will, when carried out, organize us as our enemy is organized.  Her  organization has been proceeding since 1751. Shortly after Germany took Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark she began to make the Kiel Canal. While the Canal was under process of construction, Germany was doing what we are now thinking of doing, and was not completely ready for war until last year, when the Canal was finished. It is a blot on the statesmanship of Great Britain that the island of Heligoland was given to Germany in exchange for the island of Zanzibar. If Great Britain still held Heligoland, the Kiel Canal would to-day be practically useless to Germany. Until the proposed organization is carried out we shall not be iu a position to offer the effective check to German encroachment that I hope we shall soon be able to offer. The Bill is a worthy addendum to what Australia has already done in this titanic struggle. It was a little disappointing to find, a few weeks ago, that a good many people were ready to throw cold water on Australian efforts. That criticism was not good. </para>

The Prime Minister said at the beginning of the war that if the last man and the last shilling were required they would be given, and the proposed tabulation will enable us to lay our hands on the last man and on the last shilling, and- to employ them effectively. It has been said that those who possess wealth merely hold it in trust for the rest of the community. If we are defeated in this war, we lose everything. It is a case of " all in." Consequently we must have some way of getting at the wealth and belongings of every person. But some of the information which is asked for seems to me unnecessary. Citizens are to be asked to state their stock in trade, and the value of their furniture and Personal and household effects. That information, I think, is not necessary. We must have expedition, but if unnecessary details are asked for there must be delay. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- To' my mind, the information is not needed by us, and its collection will cause delay. Furniture is necessary, it is something that a man cannot do without; it is not a luxury. Of course the position is very different when we come to speak of effects which really come under the heading of luxuries; and if the return were confined to these it would be understandable. I fear, however, that a tabulation of household furniture and other necessaries of life will cause considerable delay. There is another point worthy of attention. I fear, though perhaps my fear is not well founded, that there will be a danger of the timid sections of the community being victimised by what might be called agents - though they are sometimes called  ' sharks ' ' - who are everlastingly trying to make profit out of their fellows. There is a possibility that people may be approached by such men, and warned of the penalties that may be imposed for mistakes in the returns, with the result that many will be induced to pay fees in order to have the work done for them, as took place when the income tax was first introduced. I have had letters from shire secretaries, ministers of religion, and others iri mv electorate offering to place their services at the disposal of the Government in the work of carrying out the census; hut there are isolated places where people may be approached in the way I have indicated, and fees earned in a way that must be condemned. I suggest that the Government should enter into some arrangement with the State authorities, so that the services of shire secretaries, clerks of court and petty sessions, school teachers, the police, and so forth, might be utilized, even if a small fee had to be paid in return for the work. </para>

                        <para>.- ' There is no doubt that both sides of the House are in accord with the general principles of the Bill, and I should not have occupied time in discussing it further were it not that I desire to make one or two suggestions. It was my intention on a previous occasion, when I was not permitted to conclude my remarks, to outline what I believed was necessary in the way of organization, not only here, but in every part of the Empire, to meet the extraordinary crisis with which we find ourselves confronted to-day. This Bill goes a long way towards meeting some of the ideas which were then floating in my mind, though in some respects, it does not go to the full extent I should like to see adopted now and at once. We must not forget that this measure, in common with others in other parts of the Empire, is the direct consequence of our full realization that we are fighting a nation so closely organized as to give it an altogether unfair advantage over other nations not so well prepared. It is impossible for us at the present time to carry the organization of our national resources too far. I realize as well as anybody that the British race objects to regimentation of any sort. We object to compulsion ; we do not like to be put into water-tight compartments and told to do this or that. It is opposed to every ideal of that freedom which has been granted to us by suffering and effort spread over many centuries. But I do not care how far our liberties are encroached on at this time, for a period, if we can secure those liberties for ourselves in the future, and for those who will follow us for all time to come. </para>

                            <para>- I am not afraid of conscription if it becomes necessary; in fact, I think that under this Bill power should be taken in one direction of an absolutely compulsory character. What I mean is, that in certain industries we should compel certain men to stay at home and not go to the war, and that that process of compulsion should be carried out at once. There is no doubt that we are now losing valuable material ; and I" am certain we are reducing the effective force of this country by sending into the fighting line men who are urgently required for other purposes in Australia. I recognise and admire the sacrifices which these men are making,, and the spirit which prompts them, but they would be rendering greater and more effective service by staying at home. Before making the one or two suggestions I have in my mind, I should like to say a word or two about the second schedule. The Bill evidently has two purposes, one of which is to obtain to some extent a registration of our male population between certain years, in order to get some idea of how many we have effective for the fighting line and other purposes, while the other purpose is to arrive at some approximation of our resources and wealth. It would have been a great benefit to the House and the country if the Government had seen fit to announce at once and frankly what their intentions are - why they are taking this census of wealth, and in this .particular form. I do not know what the intentions of the Government are - nobody seems to know - but I can see no particular good in a tabulation of the actual wealth of the community unless it is intended in some way to directly levy on that wealth. I would not be one to raise the slightest objection to those who are gifted with great wealth paying a fair share towards the enormous expenses of the war. </para>

                            <para>- I do not mean to suggest that all classes will not be called upon to- contribute; it may be a few shillings in some cases, and thousands of pounds  in  others. I believe that, whether we appeal to the comparatively poor or the wealthy, we shall, with very few exceptions, have the readiest response; but I cannot see what good can be done by getting in tabulated form a census of the actual wealth held, unless it is proposed to levy directly on that wealth, and reduce the actual capital held by the people. If the idea of the Government is simply to levy on the product of wealth - that- is the income derived from it - they could get all the information they require without the great expenditure of time and money that must be involved in taking this census. In many cases - my own, for instance - it will be a very simple thing to put on paper the actual wealth I hold, but it will be a very different matter for others in the country. And when the information has been tabulated at great cost, it will take the Government Statistician a long time to deal with it. If the intention of the Government be to levy on the actual wealth held by the community, and not on the product of that wealth, I venture to say they will do a great deal more harm than good. Once we commence to attack the actual capital in the country we shall find that a great deal of it will "disappear. We shall destroy in a great measure the resources of the country which are used for the employment of labour, and destroy, without gaining any benefit,, a large proportion of the wealth itself. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply endeavouring to show, in no alarmist way, that if we attempt to levy directly on the capital resources of the country it must have the effect I have described. When taxation does come, as we all realize it must, it should be on the actual product of capital itself;- and if that were the idea, all the necessary information could "be obtained without going to the expense of the proposed tabulation. </para>

                            <para>- War time makes no exception to the economic rules which govern us. Honorable members, I trust, recognise, as I do, that after all is said and done, the wealth of our country rests on our system of trade. You cannot touch that system by taxing the actual capital without bringing the whole fabric tumbling down to earth like a pack of cards. All that can be done effectively, and all that the Government should attempt to do is to levy upon the actual productive wealth of the country - upon the produce of the country's resources. That can be done without going to anything like the expense that the Government propose to incur in taking this wealth census. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, and I think that is the right way to go about it. If you attempt to tax other than the income which is the result of the capital invested - if you attempt to levy  upon  the capital itself - the result must be disaster. The moment you attempt to do that everything will be thrown into a state of flux. </para>

Every class in the community must pay its tribute, be it more or less, towards the conduct of this great struggle.

                            <para>- I dare say it would be quite right if a man had £5,000 stored away in his stocking, and refused absolutely to use it, to resort to other measures. There would be some justification for the Government saying that such a man should contribute a .certain proportion, of his hoard. But I heard one honorable member - I forget who it was - when speaking on this measure last night, refer to- the fact that a large amount of money is held on fixed  deposit  in the banks. He argued that this money was not being properly used, and that, therefore, the Government should come along and use a certain portion of it. To that argument I would point out that, although the original owners of this money are only getting 3 or 3£ per cent, interest on it, the banks themselves are using the money again and again. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, it is. One man may be getting 3^ per cent., but some one else is using the same money, and getting 4 per cent, on it; whilst a person may be using the same money in a still further direction, and getting 5 per cent. It cannot be said that, simply because money is deposited by the original owner in a bank at 3 J per cent., the money is not being used. Money deposited in this way is used right throughout the whole trade and commerce of the country, and that is why I urge honorable members to be careful in any contemplated taxation not to impose the tax upon other than the produce of the country's capital resources. I do not care how heavy the tax is. It will have to be heavy. We all recognise that. The  rich  must pay in common with the rest of the community - and I believe that, with very few exceptions, everybody will be willing to pay cheerfully. It is because of all this that I believe that the wealth census, if taken in the manner that the Government contemplate, will be unnecessary. I would like to see it taken in quite a different way, and I believe the information the Government desire could be got much more cheaply , and when the actual taxation is imposed it could be imposed much more* effectively, if other methods were employed. The matter, however, is one for the Government to determine. The responsibility for what steps are taken must eventually rest upon them. That is why I regret that the Government when bringing down this measure were not perfectly frank with the House and with the country in that they did not say exactly what was contemplated, or explain the reasons that induced them tb call for a census of wealth in this particular form. With regard to the registration of individuals, I do not think the Government are going far enough. One has only to look at the schedule to see that the Government's chief object is to ascertain the number of men actually fitted for the firing line. That seems to be the one underlying idea. While I would not discount for a single moment the almost stupendous efforts that Australia has put forward up to the present time, and while I admit that the fullest tribute must be paid to those who have so grandly come forward in their country's service, no one can but admit that Australia has not yet given of its manhood to the same extent that the Old Country has. We have a long way to go before we do that. I am inclined to think that, owing to the distance that separates us from the actual scene of conflict, it will not be possible for us to give our full quota of men. But there are many other things that we can do. A great deal is wanted besides men in this war. We want material; we want munitions. As this census has to be taken, and as the expense must be incurred , I think the Government could very well have gone a little further in the matter by endeavouring to ascertain how far it is possible to organize certain particular industries. In an indirect way, no doubt, the Government will get information on that point, but I think they could get a great deal more than they will get, and the value of the information would be infinitely greater, if they set to work to obtain direct schedules affecting certain trades. Take, for instance, the textile industry. There are people working in various parts of Australia who have been trained in the textile industry, but who are not now engaged in that industry,. . just as there are men who have been engineers, but who are following some other  occupation.  The' schedule as contemplated in this measure will not result in full information on that point. </para>

                            <para>- I know it does. But what I urge is that, in regard to industries directly connected with the war,, there should be separate schedules. It would incur very little additional expense or time to issue a special schedule with a special set of questions, and I think such a schedule would lead to the organization of these industries very much more rapidly than is possible under the Government's scheme. It is a matter of common knowledge that our woollen mills are all working at high pressure, and it is also a matter of common knowledge that their great difficulty is not one of material. It is also quite possible that a good deal of labour that might be utilized in these mills at the present time is not being utilized. We do not know where it is. We cannot find it. -The people who are carrying on the woollen industries cannot find it. Here is a golden opportunity, ready to our very hand, to come in contact with every individual in the Commonwealth capable of working in a woollen mill. Why should we not get that information? Similarly, in the engineering industry, particularly in that portion of it concerned with the manufacture of munitions, it is possible that large numbers of people are scattered about the length and breadth of the Commonwealth who have been employed on that particular class of work, and whose services would be valuable now. Here we have an opportunity of finding out where these people are, and of saying to them as our organization extends, "We want you to go to such-and-such a factory." Why not take advantage of the census to do that? . Again, in regard to the industries directly connected with the equipment of troops, we should endeavour to find out as quickly as possible every individual in Australia who can assist. That information can only be obtained by the issue of additional schedules. To endeavour to pick out information such as I have in mind from the schedules" that are proposed will be a Herculean task. It will occupy a very long time, and will not produce anything like the effective result the proposal I suggest would bring about. I do not want to take up .the time of the House any longer in discussing this matter. All I want to say is that, so far as the Bill goes, I believe the idea underlying it is right, and it will have my full support ; "but I suggest, in regard to the wealth census - without knowing what is in the Government's mind - that it is quite possible that we are spending a lot of money unnecessarily, and for which there will be no adequate return. Whatever else we do at the present time, we ought not to do that. In regard to the other schedules, I think they do not- go far enough. There is certain information which we should obtain rapidly which these  schedules  will not obtain. I hope the Government will take some further action in the direction I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>.- Knowing the anxiety of the Minister in charge of the Bill to get it through, I shall not be very long in what I have to  say;  but as I intend to sound a note that has not been sounded hitherto, I think I am justified in saying a few words, so as to put forward my own position clearly. In the first place, I wish to say that neither this Parliament as a whole, nor the members who sit on one side or the other, have shown very much courage in dealing with the present situation. I might use even a more' forceful, though,  perhaps,  it would be an impolite,, description. We have been just nibbling at this matter the whole  time </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. A little, while ago I proffered my services to the Waverley Rifle Club, but, after glancing at me, the officer to whom I made the offer, said, "It is unnecessary to ask for your birth certificate; it is evident that you are above the age at which we could take you." Then again, some weeks ago I placed my services at the disposal of the Prime Minister, pointing out to him that I was quite capable of doing some of the work now being performed by men who are going to the front. I am physically as fit as many younger members of this House, and am willing to do my share in the defence of the Empire, so that the interjection made by the Minister of External ' Affairs was a most ungenerous one. The honorable member for Indi has suggested the possibility of the war being carried to our own shores. </para>

                    <para>In that event I should be as willing as any man to shoulder a rifle. The war situation is not altogether what we should wish it to be, and should this country ever be invaded, then every man, no matter what his age, will have to take up his rifle in defence, not only of his home, but of that which is still dearer to us, the honour of our womanhood. I served eleven years in the Citizen Forces, and enjoyed the reputation of being a good shot. From the first year I wore the marksman's badge, and I am glad to say that my sight is still excellent. I suggest to the Government that, instead of nibbling at conscription, they should at once declare for it. "Do it now " is a good business motto. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Having served eleven years in the Citizen Forces, I think I could help in that direction. The recruiting campaign now taking place in Victoria and spreading to the other States is likely to lead to utter chaos. We have had in Victoria a boom in recruiting - a boom in other directions is not unknown here - and I am afraid that this recruiting boom will be followed by a slump. The number of men now offering their services as the result of this boom is so large as to embarrass the Defence Department, and the slump which I fear will follow is likely to be equally embarrassing. With conscription in force, order would take the place of chaos. The difficulty of providing equipment and camp accommodation for the men who are offering would be removed as the result of the organization which conscription would insure, and there would be an end to all irregular methods. If the services of 1,000 men were required next week, the Minister, with such a. system in operation, would know exactly where to obtain them. He could call in the men in the numbers actually required, from time to time, making provision, of course, for the percentage of men likely to be rejected because of physical disability, and in this way all embarrassments would be removed. In the absence of the Minister in charge of the Bill, I appeal to the Minister of External Affairs, who is the most bellicose man in the Cabinet, to put this view before his colleagues. I believe that the Attorney-General is entirely in sympathy with it, but, unfortunately, neither party in this </para>

This Bill practically proposes nothing more than was done in connexion with the census of 1911. It will certainly give us information as to the number of men who can serve their country, and where they may be found; but it will do nothing to provide for their training or equipment. What we need is to have men ready to go into the firing line at twenty-four hours' notice. </para>

                            <para>- I do not. I say, " All honour to those who have come forward," but some compulsion is, necessary in the case of those who, having no responsibility to keep them back, are yet unwilling to volunteer. There are thousands in that position. Last Sunday morning, while strolling along Beaconsfield Parade, I overheard a party of eight or nine young fellows, whose ages would range from twenty to twenty-five years, discussing the war, and one after the other said that he did not propose to volunteer, since he believed that his services would be more useful at home. It is quite possible that these young men, and others like them, are rendering useful service in their own country, but the point that I wish to emphasize is that with conscription in force the work they are doing could be carried out by older members of the community, like the honorable member for Wimmera and myself, who are not competent to go into the firing line. Further, there are households from which several men have been taken; again, there are others from which none have been taken. Under conscription discrimination would be shown, and a just proportion taken from every household. I am the only member of this House who has declared for conscription. </para>

                            <para>- Some honorable members suggest that it is not necessary for us to introduce conscription until it has been adopted in the Old Country. As a matter of fact, the Registration Bill - a measure similar to that now before us - has not yet been passed by the British Parliament. I do not think it has gone beyond the first reading stage in the House of Commons. </para>

                            <para>- My reply to those who say that it will be time enough for us to adopt conscription when Great Britain does so is that possibly if conscription had been in force in the Old Country some years ago the present war would not have occurred. It was because of Britain's unpreparedness that this war came upon us. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but so far the services of the navy have not had to be fully exercised. I would remind honorable members that in respect of many reforms we have not waited for a lead from the Old Country. Is it not true that for many years we have been ahead of England ? Why should we not give her the lead in this case ? We led her with regard to the introduction of the ballot-box, electoral reform, free education, old-age pensions, maternity allowances, and compulsory training.Let us give her the lead in the matter of conscription. </para>

                            <para>- Then we shall have to alter the Constitution. With conscription in operation, we should always have men trained and ready to go to the front well prepared to meet any emergency, and, as the honorable . member for Indi has said, we may need the services of such men on our own shores. Instead of having to send them abroad in defence of Australia we may, unfortunately, have to employ them here. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I considered that I should put before the House the view that I hold with regard to conscription so that at least one man amongst us may be able to say when the time is ripe, " I told you so." </para>

                            <para>- Listening to the speeches of some honorable members, a stranger would imagine that Australia was a country of shirkers, and that it was necessary to use compulsion to induce our men to recognise their duty to the Empire. In these circumstances, therefore, I think it wise to mention the actual position. It is to be regretted that the Department did not get a move on earlier than it did. We do not want to repeat, in connexion with our equipment of troops, the stupendous folly that has been associated with the Small Arms Factory. After the war had been going on for ten months it remained for the Public Works Committee to show the Government that it was possible to work a double shift in the Factory. It was only then that a double shift was instituted, and we are now told that it is working without friction. It comes to us as a shock to learn that any Government could have thought it possible to turn out more rifles by working one shift of ten hours a day than by having two shifts of eight hours each. Something should be done in connexion with this Bill to enable us to utilize the services of men who have volunteered, but who, because of some slight defect have been rejected. I suggested to the Minister some time ago that the names and addresses of all men rejected should bo recorded, and that, if necessary, they should be asked to take the oath of allegiance, so that they might constitute a force for local defence - a kind of German landsturm - leaving those more physically capable to go on active service abroad. I do not believe that 33 per cent. of those volunteering are physically incapable of serving at the front, but that is about the proportion of volunteers who are being rejected to-day. And yet we are told that we ought to register men in order to secure more soldiers. Some of the men rejected are amongst the most physically fit men in Australia. They are trained athletes, who would hold their own in any arena, and yet they are rejected by the medical officers. An Imperial officer told me that he had seen men rejected in Melbourne who would be received with open arms by any recruiting sergeant in Europe. Numbers of men who have been rejected in Australia have gone to England and been accepted there. </para>

                            <para>- That brings me to the point that we are commencing our reform at the wrong end. If Parliament and the Government would concentrate their energies on preparations to receive the men who are enlisting, and who are eligible, we should do much more good, and secure a greater number of fighting men than we are getting at the present time. It is now proposed to remove the backbone of our recruiting system by calling in the rifles from the rifle clubs. Would it not be possible for the Government to secure 50,000 or 100,000 rifles, with a corresponding amount of ammunition, from Japan? I am credibly informed that it would have been possible, and is possible, now to get those rifles from Japan. " But," says one officer, " the Imperial Government cannot accept them, because it would mean that there would be two classes of rifles in the trenches." Why, there are three or four different classes of rifles in the same trenches in Belgium to-day. There are the Belgian rifle, the French rifle, the British rifle, and the Canadian Ross rifle, all being used side by side in the trenches. I have never seen any necessity for this Bill. The men of Australia are volunteering in far greater numbers than the Department is able to deal with. Instead of turning our attention to matters of this kind, the first great reform should be in the Defence Department itself, in order that some" better system might be devised for handling the men who do volunteer, and especially of discontinuing the absurdity of rejecting as unfit some of the finest men in the country. There is a suspicion that many men have been rejected, and that the high standard of physical fitness has been enforced because the Department was not able to train and arm more men. </para>

                        <para>.- It is a novel experience to hear an honorable member expressing the view that this Bill is not necessary. Until the honorable member for Franklin spoke, all honorable members had agreed that the measure is necessary. I cordially support the Bill, which I believe to be absolutely essential at the present time. I have no wish to be at all pessimistic, but I do think that the people are blind if they fail to realize the present serious position of affairs in the Old World. We may be hopeful with the hope which our race always possesses, that we shall come out of this conflict successfully, as we have always done in the past; but a man is blind if he shuts his eyes to the fact that the position is very serious to-day. I quite agree that up to the present the voluntary system has been successful in Australia, and partially successful in the Old Country. But I cannot help feeling a considerable amount of sympathy with our Allies who are fighting under conscription, and putting millions of men into the field, knowing all the while that the British Empire is not sending to the front as many soldiers as it ought to send. I was very much impressed by figures which were contained in a cablegram published in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> on Saturday night. They purport to be from an official report of the French Relief Society, and they show that, from the beginning of the war to the 1st June, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, nearly 9,000,000 men from the various belligerent countries had been put out of action. The figures which particularly caught my eye were that, whilst France has lost 1,410,000, and Russia 3,495,000, Great Britain had lost less than 5Q0,000. It does seem that we have not been putting into the field as many men as we could send, and ought to have sent, in justice to the other nations who are allied with us. One fact we have to remember is that in this matter time is the essence of the contract. The Germans were prepared for the war; we were not. They have an enormous army, and every man put into the field is a trained soldier, ready to take his place in the fighting line at once. "We are not only short in numbers, and have to raise our armies, but we have to train them. The men who ave enlisting to-day will not be fit to take their position in the field for some months to come; in fact, they may be looked upon as the soldiers who  will  be required to do the winter service in Europe. Therefore, it is necessary to so organize our forces now that we may be in a position to do moro, if necessary, at a later stage. There has been some objection to the Bill on the ground that it means conscription. The measure does not necessarily mean conscription, but it does mean that if conscription should become necessary - and it will be adopted in the Old Country and Australia only when the situation has become desperate - we shall be in a position to put the system into force at once, instead of having to spend months in gathering the information which, by the aid of this Bill, we shall now get immediately. In the Defence Act, we have recognised and approved of the principle of conscription for home defence, and have given the Executive power to call all men between the ages of eighteen  and  sixty years to the colours for the defence of Australia. In one respect, conscription is more satisfactory than the present system of voluntary enlistment; it prescribes the order in which men shall be called upon to serve. The men between certain ages and unmarried are called first, and the married men without children are called before the married nien with children. J agree with the honorable members who have said that we have been sending to the front too many youths and far too many married men. If we had a properly-organized system, or if we were operating under the conscription sections of the Defence Act, many of the men who have gone to the front would npt have gone; we would have called upon the other men who are more suitable - the single men who are without responsibility, and below a certain age. I do not say that Australia has not done well, nor do I decry the Commonwealth's contribution to the war. Nothing disgusts me so much as to hear prominent mtn who have done well in Australia always decrying the efforts of this country. It must be remembered that while Ave have been giving men, if we have not been giving in the same proportion as the people of Great Britain, we have been giving of our substance, as the widow gave her mite. This great country is in need of population, and every man we send to the front is of the country's life blood, and therefore every soldier we give is a gift of our substance, whilst the Old Country is giving probably of its surplus population. I shall not bo afraid of supporting conscription if such a course becomes necessary. I  hope  the voluntary system will continue to be successful as it has been in the past, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that if the war continues into next year, some desperate means of bringing it to a successful issue will be necessary. Having recognised the principle of conscription for the defence of Australia, it seems to me to matter nothing whether conscription is to be applied to war in other parts of the world, or war on our own shores. It is admitted that men would be called upon for service in  Australia  For what? For the purposes of defending Australia. We are defending Australia by fighting the enemy at the Dardanelles and on the battlefields of Europe. If we do not defend Australia there, but wait to fight the enemy on our shores, we shall have to fight a very inglorious battle indeed. I pity those who have to fight a victorious German army in Australia if the Allies are beaten in the fighting in Europe. It seems to me that there is no difference between sending men to Europe to defend Australia and in compelling them to serve in Australia for the same purpose. In fact, there may be more justification for compelling them to fight in Europe, because they may be able to do something of an effective nature there, whereas if we wait until the enemy comes to our shores, our men may be fighting a forlorn hope and losing their lives in what would possibly be a very hopeless final struggle for existence. </para>

                        <para>.- The scheme which the Attorney-General proposes to put into operation for taking a census of the manhood and wealth of the country is a step in the right direction. Proposals have emanated from Opposition members, who are supposed to be business men,, which would mean that the taking of the census, instead of occupying only a few weeks, would occupy a few months. To those who have had experience of handling large bodies of men engaged in voluntary work, the idea of utilizing voluntary labour for the census in different parts of the Commonwealth - which requires accuracy and expedition - is ridiculous. </para>

A number of honorable members are discussing, the Bill as if it provided for action. It does nothing of the kind. It provides merely for the accumulation of information.

It has not done a solitary thing of substance in connexion with our present difficulties beyond the passing of two or three Supply Bills. True, the Referenda Bills have been carried. This is a necessary prelude to much necessary legislation.

But no proposal has been put before Parliament for dealing with the matter. Parliament has not been asked to consider the scheme in detail, or to sanction it. </para>

If that is all that is necessary, the government of the country may be carried on by the appointment of Ministers who will undertake the management of our affairs, and elucidate problems of the greatest magnitude which arise during a time of war, when most serious consequences may arise put of what is done. If a small executive can handle the situation at a time like this unaided, I do not know what Parliament is for.Under this system it would be enough for the constituencies to choose members to form a kind of superior electoral college for the election of the National Executive. </para>

The States are continually being asked to do certain things, and some one or other of them is always lagging behind, or causing delay by making alternative suggestions. I do not' think that it was ever contemplated that the Commonwealth should go to the States and ask them for certain things, though it was contemplated that the States might offer certain jurisdiction to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Not necessarily anything. The Act makes no qualification. Where the King's Forces are is an open matter under the Act. I admit that men cannot be sent to serve outside Australia except with the consent of the Executive Government. That is not the point being argued. There has been an argument as to whether there is statutory authority for the sending of troops to serve outside Australia whether compulsorily enrolled or obtained by voluntary enlistment. My reading of the Act is that there is statutory authority to send conscript troops outside of Australia under certain circumstances. Point is given to this by the definition of " war " in the Act. The Defence Act defines war as - any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack on, the Commonwealth, or any territory under the control of the Commonwealth by an enemy or armed force. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member's interpretation is too narrow. If it were apprehended that Germany was about to make an attack upon Australia there is provision in the Defence Act for the using of Australian soldiers. at any point even outside Australia where the invasion could best be prevented. I think that the honorable member for Balaclava agrees with that. </para>

                        H. CATTS. - From the manner in which my remarks on this subject have been received, it appears to be generally admitted by honorable members that there is power to send a conscript army to Europe if there be any danger or apprehension that we may be invaded by a European foe. And our defence could best be made by attacking such foe outside of Australia.
                    </para>
                    <para>From the schedule of the Bill which calls for particulars from the manhood of the country in relation to defence, it would almost appear that it had been drafted with the direct idea in the mind of the draftsman that conscription was to be given effect to. I do not believe that to be the case ; but it would certainly seem to be so from an investigation of the document, apart from any Knowledge of what is in the minds of Ministers. The first schedule to the Bill asks the men of this country to give particulars as to their social condition arid their health. But there is no space left oh the sheet in which a man can indicate in any way whether he will be prepared to bear arms in case of necessity.  If we only ask a man as to his fitness, but not as to his willingness to fight, you either contemplate compelling him to fight regardless of his wishes, or you will need a second  census  to ascertain his mind in this respect. There is little difference between compulsion and the moral coercion suggested by the honorable member for Flinders. </para>

I was submitting that there should be a suggestion in the first schedule something like the following : - " If you are prepared to bear arms should necessity arise, you are entitled to make a statement to that effect." I do not say the question should be nut directly, but there should be some means taken to ascertain the mind of the manhood of the country on the point. </para>

                            <para>- It could be put in such a way as not to be moral compulsion. The alternative suggested is that, if occasion arise, certain names shall be picked out, and an intimation sent directly to the persons so selected that, they are expected to bear arms and take part in the defence of the country, presumably here or abroad. </para>

If the suggestions of the honorable member for Flinders be acted upon, and men between certain ages, and of certain social condition, are picked out and told that they are expected to take part in the defence of the country, it is moral coercion, and about the nearest thing possible to legal coercion. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree, and I do not mean to throw any doubt on the Prime Minister's assurance when I say that I have seen clauses put into Bills on similar assurances that they would not be used for this or that purpose, but when those Bills have come to be administered and interpreted as Acts no reference is made to the debates in Parliament in order to throw light on their meaning - the measures are interpreted according to the letter. As a matter of principle, it is always dangerous to accept assurances of the kind in Parliament, instead of having these assurances embodied in the measure. </para>

As a matter of fact, such information ought always to be at our disposal, and not only in time of war. I have wondered at the paucity of knowledge that we have been able to obtain from our Department of Statistics. For this I do not blame the Statistician, but I do blame the various Governments, who have not placed sufficient money at that official's disposal for this necessary work. </para>

                    <para>I find in -the New York <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> of 4th June of this year a complete tabulation of the wealth of the people of the United States. The article is headed, " What We are Worth"; and "Should Uncle Sam Decide to Impose an Income Tax." There is in that return a complete return of the wealth of every individual of the United States. For every man, woman, and child the amount is 1.965 dollars, and the total wealth 187,739,000,000 dollars, including exempt real estate. Following on that table is a comparison with other countries, and particulars as to the various States of the Union. The population of the States is close on 100,000,000, and the information is available at any time it is required by the Government. In this or any other country we cannot have proper material <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> which to base taxation unless similar returns are made; and I sincerely hope that now we have started the taking of our wealth census will never stop. An honorable member has interjected a remark as to the ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Timothy</inline> Coghlan, and he was certainly a very able statistician, but I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> is at least his equal. </para>

                    <para>As the Bill will probably be rushed through at the Committee stage, I desire to take this opportunity of saying a word about the machinery. It has been suggested by members on the other side that voluntary labour should be made use of in a wholesale fashion. We have large numbers of men who are prepared to offer their services. I have had some experience of the employment of considerable bodies of voluntary helpers in political campaigns, and, in my view, the honorable members who have suggested that we should make use of voluntary help in work of this character can hardly have had much experience in the organization of voluntary help in their own electorates. </para>
                    <para>In my own electorate, in the electorates that my party have asked me to take charge of in New South Wales for organizing purposes, and in the general organization of the work of the last campaign in New South Wales, I had a good deal of experience of the value of voluntary help from persons who were inspired with the ideals of the movement, who were extremely enthusiastic, and whose help was given under the best conditions, and my conclusion is that such help cannot equal in value the help that could be obtained if the same persons were regularly employed under direct and continuous supervision in some systematic and methodical way. I do not disparage in any way the great work voluntarily done for the labour movement. I am merely trying to compare voluntary, as against paid, labour for taking and analysing the census now under consideration. During the last State election I was asked to take charge of the second ballot campaign in that electorate of New South Wales in which the State Attorney-General was interested. The time at my disposal was only a week or ten days, and we had to engage paid labour to do a certain part of the organizing work; yet by its help we transformed a minority of 100 into a majority of 300 after a very strenuously-fought contest. The voluntary help was magnificent, but it would have even been more effective if we could have paid the same persons and insisted upon more rigid carrying out of instructions. If we could engage our political helpers  regularly  at an election, work on definite lines, with power to insist upon the carry ing out of instructions, our results would be immensely increased and improved. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, yes. It .was rather an important election, and I am bound to say that all the money required was available. The Attorney-General did not stick at a pound or two so long as the work was effectively done. I would like to see what employment is going to be distributed, particularly at a time like this, but the distribution must not be at the cost of inefficiency. It would be a most inefficient way of handling this matter if we were to have a number of depots in various parts of the Commonwealth. All these cards will have to come in through the Post Office. They will arrive on different days on account of the distances they have to be sent, and if arrangements could be made for their complete handling at one common centre that would be the most efficient way of carrying out the census. The idea of utilizing voluntary labour in all parts of the Commonwealth is. in my view, absurd. As many inspectors as employees would be required to see that the work was carried out. Voluntary helpers can come in when they like, do what they like, go out to lunch when they like. It is impossible to exercise the same supervision and discipline over such assistance as it is over those whose duty it is to carry out the work under effective control. I was surprised to hear the suggestions that came from honorable members of some experience on the other side of the House, and I think their suggestions ought not to be followed. If the Attorney-General, with the experience he has had of matters in this direction, would consult with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> I feel sure that they would be able to evolve some scheme which would enable the work of tabulation and analysis to be done properly and at reasonable cost. </para>

                        (Werriwa) f2.37]. - -I have great pleasure in supporting this proposal, because I think it is a first step towards that marshalling of our resources which has already been too long delayed. For months I have advocated the adoption of a system which would enable us to obtain the information that we hope to get as the result of this census. Suggestions of conscription have been made. We have been asked what the intentions of the Government are in putting forward this measure at all. I do not think we need discuss the question as to whether conscription is in the air or not. It may be quite true that this is the first step towards conscription. It may be the first step to quite a number of tilings. If a man, feeling he is in danger of robbery, gathers his valuables together, that step may mean that he is going out to spend his wealth on riotous living, or it may mean that he is going to put it in safe deposit. The suggestion regarding conscription does not affect the issue at all, although it does strike me as being an attempt on the part of the tail to wag the dog, for the dependency surely cannot talk about conscription until conscription has been decided upon at the head of the Empire. What I think the proposal does mean is that, having responsible government in Australia, we are trying to forge weapons by which we shall be able to take a full and comprehensive record of everything that can appertain to the welfare  of the people of the Com.monwealth under our present system of government. We hope, by the information we shall gain, to be able to say exactly what powers we can put into this fight, either at home or abroad, and what resources we can marshal so as to lie able to .sustain a prolonged effort. It cannot be argued that a responsible Government such as the Federal Government is should be compelled to fall in with all sorts of movements originating throughout the States. Rather should the Commonwealth Government direct the actions of the States in one comprehensive policy. We hope by this information to be able to say exactly what can be done, and what is impossible, and we can only do that by focussing our energies upon the development, not only of a higher standard of military excellence, but upon the development of all the matters that are necessary in order that we may maintain successfully, not only our military position, but also the solvency of the community. Surely we are not going to adopt a policy such as that which leads the drunkard to exclaim, " Fill it up again, boys," irrespective of what the consequences may be. We desire to know exactly what number of men of fighting age we have in the country, how they are employed, and how best they may be employed. We have also the right to know the number of industrial efficients in the country who are volunteering, and whether it is necessary to debar them from going forward; in other words, whether their labours at home will be more valuable to the general interests than -their presence in the trenches abroad. We have a right to know what wealth we have in the country, how it is employed, and how it affects the welfare and solvency of the people, and what part of that wealth may reasonably be subject to taxation, or some other demand, should the exigency of circumstances require it. The honorable member for Richmond, when- dealing with this matter, seemed hardly to appreciate the position, because no sane man on either side of the Blouse would for a moment support any system which would dry up the fountains of industry throughout the Commonwealth. Rather would he strive by every possible means to bring about an accession of power and strength in the various industries that are all essential to our success. But a large portion of our wealth is not capital invested in the production of other wealth. A large amount of money is being wasted, just as many people waste mental and physical energy. That money, I think, might, as a last resort, be employed to better ends, and we shall be able to see by this census how far it can be touched by taxation.

                        <para>- I may tell the honorable gentleman that all forms of worldly goods are included in the one term "wealth." . That part of wealth that we call capital - the money that is employed in producing other capital - ought not to be touched except in case of a desperate life or death struggle; but there is: another class of wealth that is very predominant that finds its outlet in needless extravagance, and in other directions - that creates no employment, either professionally or otherwise. People who souse such wealth would be much better engaged in either industrial or military employment for the benefit of the country, just as such wealth might be made better use of in the successful prosecution of the war. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say where it resides, but it has been clearly proved that it is here, and if a complete census be taken of the disposition of the  wealth  of Australia, I think it will be found that only a small minority of the people are engaged in what any political economist would describe as work of production. The wealth that I refer to helps to maintain in idleness or unnecessary employment people who could be much better employed, and we shall ascertain where that wealth 'is if these census returns are going to be anything more than an empty tabulation of figures. We have a right to know all these things. The Commonwealth Government also ought to be able to control the volunteer system as we know it, because it is at times so spasmodic in its action as to be almost detrimental to the interests of the country. By this census we hope to obtain a list of the people who are engaged in any industry - the people who are idle, and doing nothing of the work that is essential for the welfare of the country. We shall be- able to ascertain how many of these people, whether they be at the top' or bottom of the tree, are of the fighting age, and by means of the recruiting officers we shall be able to focus our attention upon them. In short, this census will enable us so to marshal our resources as to fit us, not only to put up a bigger light oversea, but to prepare for whatever the final shuffle of the cards may mean in regard to the defence of Australia. If because of a thousand and one contingencies that may arise, and which need not be too clearly defined, it becomes necessary to do battle in Australia itself, we shall then be able, instead of being turned over utterly bound and helpless to the enemy, to put up a final fight such as only a free people struggling for their very existence can do. </para>

                            <para>- No. I would not send any man to the front without his consent. The danger we have to face, in Australia to-day is that more men will volunteer for the front than we can properly spare, and so leave the Commonwealth utterly dependent. The spirit of freedom so actuates the people of Australia that it may be said of them, as was once said of the Yankee girls, "They have been al- lowed almost every liberty, and they take the rest." The spirit of freedom has so permeated the people of Australia that the one thing necessary in connexion with this war is to bring them to a realization of the fact that the best way to bring about the ruin of the Commonwealth is for every capable and able man to leave it. They need to be reminded that we must retain some of the capable and able of our people in order that the solvency of Australia may be maintained. Who is to say that the war is likely to end a few months hence, or to be brought to a close by one special effort? We must be prepared for a long sustained effort, and we can best make that preparation by actively developing the resources of Australia. It as in that way that the Government charged with the administration of the affairs of this country will be able to fulfil its functions while pursuing its duties in a truly patriotic spirit. I am sure my fellow-countrymen throughout the Commonwealth will be prepared to make every sacrifice. It is essential that there should be a census' of the bone and muscle as well as of the wealth of the community. And it is equally essential that property owners, as well as those who have but their labour to offer, should be prepared to make sacrifices, since all that we hold dear, all that we love, and everything that makes for the progress of humanity is now in the balance. It is not by mere spasmodic effort, nor by throwing prudence to the winds, that we shall assist in that final victory which I hope ultimately will be ours. That victory can be secured only by treading the road of self-sacrifice and self-abnegation. </para>

                        <para>.- In time of peace I am a keen Individualist, but in time of war, when the welfare of the country, and all that we enjoy, depends upon the action of the Government of our country, I hold it to be the duty of all to get behind that Government. This is particularly so at the present juncture, having regard to the fact that the terrible task which confronts the several Governments of the whole Empire, was before the people of Australia when they were called upon to make a choice of their representatives. I have just returned from a week's recruiting tour, which has afforded me many opportunities of getting into touch with my constituents, and I do not hesitate to say that the feeling of the country, if I am capable of interpreting it, is that the political mind of Australia is absolutely closed. All parties are determined to give the Government whatever assistance may be necessary for the quick and effective prosecution of the war, and to enable Australia to play her part. Marvellous enthusiasm is being manifested throughout the country. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I am going to show that the country, by its response to the appeal for recruits made during the last few days, has practically shown its approbation of the measure which the Government are now putting before us. T approve of this Bill, and shall do what I can to help its passing. Coming to its machinery provisions, I am not altogether satisfied that the whole of the details proposed to be elicited are not already available to us from State sources; but even should it mean duplication, if the Government think it necessary to pass this Bill, by all means let them have it. I believe that most of the information which it is proposed to obtain by means of this census can already be obtained through State channels. If there is one fact by which I was struck more than by any other during my recent tour of the country it was the manifest anxiety on the part of the people that a lead should be given. The Government, in bringing down this Bill, has given a lead. I found every one who was unable to go to the front anxious to know what he could do for home service. Every one appeared to be anxious to learn to what use their possessions and their individual ability might be put for the service of their country. The Government will have an opportunity of determining these questions for them when a complete registration of the resources of the country has been made. I express my regret that the honorable member for Fawkner saw fit to say last night that the men on the land had not played their part in connexion with this war. I did not interject while the honorable member was speaking because I was anxious to hear his deductions, and I certainly think that they were hardly fair ones. We have to remember that the people on the land have just passed through a terribly trying  times.  No section of the community has more contractual obligations than the man on the land, and during the dreadful time of drought through which these  people  have just passed, many of these contractual obligations have had to be suspended. In addition, we must not overlook the fact that when foodstuffs were running short an appeal was made to our farmers to redouble their efforts, and to cultivate larger areas. To this appeal there has been a very general response. Additional areas have been sown in many cases, but many young men have left the farming districts for the front. In a number of localities a very good response has been made to the call for  volunteers.  In other localities I have been disappointed. But there is no section of the community for whom I have always entertained a stronger admiration that the people upon the lands of Australia. They have never shirked their obligations at home, and a great many of the burdens of citizenship are cast upon them. In following their everyday employment they are exposed, summer and winter, to the roughest conditions, and I am satisfied that in peril or danger the white feather would never be shown by them. If the response to the appeal for volunteers has not been as large as might have been expected from our fanning districts, I think that, upon examination, it will be found that there are a good many reasons for this. I know that tremendous sacrifices have been made by some of the people on the land. In some cases two or three sons out of one family have gone to the front, and those left behind will be dependent upon outside assistance for gathering the harvest. I do not think there is much in the suggestion which has been made that the school boys would be of much use to the farmers in taking off their crop. Wheat is raised most successfully in the dry parts of Australia, and the temperatures of our wheat areas are very high; in many cases they run up to 110 degrees and 112 degrees in the shade during the harvesting season. Therefore, I do not think that school children are going to be of much service in the harvest field. They may be of use in the fruit industry, and they may do good service in  stooking  hay, but I would not place much value on the assistance that school children can give to our wheat farmers. As the honorable member for Indi pointed out, it is during harvest , time that the pace is put on ; the entire organization of a farm is then put into action. All its available horseflesh, its machinery, and its manual labour is then taxed to the utmost. The women, too, are taxed to the utmost in their domestic duties, and it is not desirable that the feeling should be created that the places of able-bodied men, who at the request of the various Governments have put large areas under cultivation, and have since gone to the front, can be taken by the children of the country. There is another matter to which I desire to refer, and I approach it with some reserve. When war is declared every man and woman is called upon to state his or her position; I feel that, for the most part, we can depend upon every man in this country" to do his duty when the time arrives. The declaration that Australia has to make is that every foot of land in this country is British soil, that there is not one inch of neutral territory. If there is any one who feels to-day any embarrassment by reason of the nationality of his parents or his own nationality, he must not forget that he has enjoyed to the full the privileges of citizenship in this country, and that now is the time to discharge the highest national obligation that could fall to his lot. Conscription, of course, brings in all. but the present system leaves it open for those of all nationalities who are enjoying British freedom in Australia, who have been able to establish homes in the Commonwealth, and have reaped the benefit of our institutions, to recognise the part that they ought to play. All that I have to say is that the response has not been as general and as uniform as we might well have expected. We might very well issue a word of warning that, in connexion with this census, the nationality of those who remain at home, as well as of , those who go to the front, will be made known, so that when the question of discrimination between duties has to be dealt with, we shall know exactly how the peoples of different nationalities living in Australia have played their part. When Australia determined upon the adoption of compulsory training, it was intended that the system should apply to all males between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five years. That system, unfortunately, had not been in operation long enough before the war to provide for the military training of the whole community. Many young men escaped by a few days the compulsion to train, others escaped it by months, and still others by years. As it is, we have, drawn off about 100,000 of the best of our young men.; but many of the others who remain at home have had the benefit of that compulsory training system. As part of: cur preparatory measures, compulsory-training should be given to everybody in* the community._ </para>

In  many  places the community has not » waited for a lead from the Government; awkward squads have been formed, and are - being drilled, and there could be no better incentive to recruiting than this form of preparatory training. With regard to the mustering of the material resources of the community, the honorable member for Capricornia, by way of question, and other honorable members by implication, have indicated the early introduction of a system of income tax to raise funds for the better prosecution of the war. With such a proposal I shall be in hearty accord. I have always advocated the imposition of an income tax in the Federal sphere as one of the best means of raising money for the good government and defence of Australia. </para>

                            <para>-There will be plenty of time to consider that proposal at the expiration of the existing arrangement. If there was ever a time when the entire wealth of Australia should be taxed for national purposes that time is the present. I know that the party now in power are committed to taxation, direct in its incidence, for purposes of defence. Their policy is that Naval and Military expenditure shall be provided from the proceeds of direct taxation. I have always been unable to understand where the Labour party could get the money for the carrying out of that policy, and now that plank in their platform is being put to the test. Nobody has a right to escape his proper obligations with regard to defence. I have never been able to' discriminate' between the duty of men who put their money into shipping, mines, or manufactures, or other classes of business, and the duty of the man who puts his money into the land. Yet the latter has been unfairly picked out by this Parliament to carry the greatest burden of taxation. If ever an exemplification, of the injustice of the system was given it was during the last period of drought, when the great producing interests of the country were in a condition of absolute paralysis. But even though the great landed interests have failed to yield a return, and the nation is at war, other people in the community have been making fortunes. Many of them have been providing the war supplies for the community. Others have been providing foodstuffs, and some have had war fortunes given to them by Act of Parliament. I refer particularly to the fixation of the price of wheat in Victoria. Could anybody say, as a matter of equity and fairness, that those who are enjoying' the greatest prosperity in war time should be exempted from contributing in proper proportion to the necessities of the country? I do not fear the imposition of a Federal income tax. I shall welcome it as the most equitable system by which the Government can finance its activities. I do not believe in the duplication of taxation, and, as I have already remarked, I would prefer that this Parliament should hand back to the States the power of taxation of land. Could there be any stronger reason for such a course, from the point of view of the present Government, than that the party which they represent in politics has governmental control in five out of six States, and is, therefore, able to deal with the land settlement and taxation problems? </para>

                            <para>- One of the reasons why I particularly support the Government in their desire to provide fresh means of taxation is that the entire resources of the country, whether in land, accrued wealth, or cash reserves - those musty cash heaps to which the honorable member for Werriwa referred - shall be at the disposal of the Government for the prosecution of the war. With regard to recruiting, I hope that the Government will recognise that those men who are from 150 to 300 miles from the big recruiting centres should be given an opportunity of registering at convenient local depots. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot allow the second reading of this Bill to pass without expressing my feelings in regard to the measure. . If there is one thing more than another that impresses me with the idea that this Bill is a measure that should not be enacted, it is the whole-hearted support which it has received from the honorable members of the Opposition. I always fear gifts from the enemy, and no matter what we may  say  the fact remains that those on the right of the  Speaker  and those on the left are deadly political enemies. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that honorable members opposite1 are not sincere. I believe they are sincere, and, therefore, it is a godsend to Australia that they are not in office to-day, otherwise we should have had conscription introduced. Some honorable member's of the Opposition have been careful to keep out of their speeches all mention of conscription, but the honorable member for Flinders, and other honorable members in reply to interjections, have said that they would be in favour of conscription if such a course became necessary. The honorable member for Flinders says that this Bill means that every male between eighteen and sixty years of age is morally, if not legally, liable to service. That statement is sufficient to indicate to me what would be the outcome of the Bill if the Opposition were on the Treasury benches. Both the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have stated that the Bill does not mean either, directly or indirectly, conscription for service outside the Commonwealth. That assurance removes a lot of my objections to the Bill. But 1 noticed that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the organ that supports honorable members opposite, does not mind what is done with the manhood of Australia so long as we do not touch the wealth. Honorable members opposite are quite satisfied to send the manhood of Australia anywhere and everywhere in the defence of the Empire,* but we must not do this or that or any other .thing with the wealth of the community. </para>

                            <para>- The whole of the honorable members of the Opposition may not hold that view, but. some of them do. There can be no doubt as to what was meant by the speech of the right honorable member for Swan. What can bo the object of the inquisitorial questions contained in the schedule? With regard to the respective merits of the voluntary and compulsory system, I wish to put to the House this point of view : Have honorable members ever heard of British, soldiers having to be driven to fight at the point of the bayonet or sword or the* muzzle of the revolver?

                            <para>- I am speaking of to-day. What are the British troops doing ? They are leaping out of the trenches and rushing to death. On the other side, we hear of men being shot down because they will not leave the trenches. That is the difference between conscription and volunteering. I remember an incident which occurred when I was in the Transvaal. The commanding officer formed up the gunners, and asked for six men who would volunteer to go to certain death. There was a slight pause, and then the whole fifty-six men present stepped forward. That is what happens under the voluntary system. Under the press-gang system all those men would npt have been ready to risk their lives. The six men who went did not put their hands into the hat to pull out their numbers; they had them beforehand. I am sorry that the Bill has been introduced. What is meant by asking electors to state whether their general health is good, bad, or indifferent; and, if it is not good, to set down the cause; and, if they are suffering from blindness, deafness, or the loss of a limb, to give particulars? If a health census is wished for, cannot it be obtained during the collection of the ordinary census? We know what will happen when the lists are published. Many men who are staying behind to maintain widowed mothers or the families of relatives who have gone to the front or who are dead will be turned out of their billets, and, although there will be no compulsion, there will be nothing left for them to do but to go to the front.- </para>

                            <para>- We would not stand that sort of thing in Queensland. I am surprised that representatives of South Australia should stand it. Electors are to be asked to state the place of their birth, and the birth place of their father and mother. There are thousands of men in my electorate who do not know where their fathers and mothers came from. I know where I was born, but I am not certain of the birth places of my parents. Why is . this information needed ? It grieves me that members of my party are congratulating the Government on the introduction of the Bill, just as members of the Opposition are doing. </para>

                            <para>- An elector would not be penalized for failing to answer a question which he could not answer. The questions regarding the possession of property will take a considerable time to answer, and it seems to me that it is hardly necessary to obtain the desired information in this way, because it can be more readily obtained in another way. It can be got from the State authorities, and from the municipalities and shires. There are also the land tax and income tax officers to apply to. I suppose there is not a State of the Commonwealth that does not collect an income tax. As for particulars of stock-in-trade, I know that in New South Wales every farmer and primary producer makes an annual return of the value of his farming implements and other possessions. I do not know what is in the minds of Ministers, but I advise them to hesitate before imposing taxation upon the landowners and agriculturists of Australia. The land-owners of New South Wales have ten taxes to pay. </para>

                            <para>- The good people in the cities have been making tremendous profits out of the war. As for land taxation, the Government would demand the last penny even of a man who had lost every sheep he once possessed. In New South Wales a land-owner has to pay, first, the Federal land tax; then an income tax, on which the exemption has been reduced to £250, and the rate has been raised from 6d. to 8d. in the £1 ; then a super-tax of 3d. imposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> for war purposes. Then comes the shire tax. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to place on record my views on this Bill, because they may appear somewhat contrary to those I have expressed in the past regarding militarism. I do not believe in militarism or in war, and I do not believe in people who believe in war. But I recognise that, at the present time, we are quite "up against it," and are involved in a war against our own wish, and that, consequently, we must make the best of a bad job. The honorable member for Maranoa seems to deprecate my want of power or influence to alter the determination of employers  in  South Australia not to employ single men who they think ought to enlist. I ask that honorable member to tell me, out of the wealth of his knowledge, what power I have over the private employers In South Australia. The honorable member knows that I have no power of the kind, and his remark, I think, was a somewhat contemptible one to make. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the honorable member's assurance that he misunderstood my remark. I support this Bill because I regard it as indicating that we are beginning to systematize our war energies ; and we all hope that this will be done thoroughly. There are honorable members who seem to be afraid of conscription or compulsory service; but, I ask, what have we to-day but morally compulsory service? We began by offering contingents in the way they were, offered by the Leader of the Opposition when in -power ; but now we are told that the war 5s ours - that the liberties of Australia are being fought for on Gallipoli, and that it is our duty to take our proper share, and not as a merely volunteer affair. As I have always said in relation to the Defence Act, if a man chooses to make his home in Australia, and yet declines to give his aid to defend it, it is time he left the country. If it be a fact that Australian liberties are being fought for at Gallipoli, it is quite time the people were told that they must step into line and give their assistance to the defence of those liberties. We should not be dependent on voluntary service. I wish no man to take my share in the defence of the country, but I do not think I ought to take my place in the firing line while others, whose duty it is to go before myself, stay behind. I am prepared to take my active share - and I think I may say without egotism that I am skilled enough to make a "good fist" of it if I got to the front. There are placards about the streets showing a cap with the. inscription, "Does this cap fit you?" Well, if this cap fits any man in the crowd who will not put it on, why should we not put it on him? Another placard shows a vacancy in a row of soldiers, with the inscription, " This place is left for you " ; and, as I said before, if it is a man's duty to be in that vacant place, why not put him in it? That is the proper attitude to take up if we mean to defend Australia. What are all these placards and other efforts but moral compulsion? We can imagine the sensations of a man after the war, who has not been to the front, and who is asked by his child what part he took in defending the liberties of Australia in 1915. It may be that such a man has done as much as any in the firing line; but the child will not realize that sitting at a desk making out pension orders for the maimed and the bereaved might take the place of fighting. I regard this Bill as the first logical step that we have taken towards the shouldering of a responsibility that is ours. Some honorable members confuse the issue by playing on the word "conscription"; but, as I understand the term, it really means the system adopted in countries where men are taken from their ordinary daily life for a term, and forced into military training, so as to be ready if they are needed. In our case, however, as soon as the war is finished, and  the man comes home either fit and well or maimed, he will resume his ordinary rights of citizenship, and could not be called out again. I am prepared to admit that the service contemplated is compulsory - and it is much better to have proper systematic methods than that men should leave for the front who, from an economic point of view, would he much more useful in Australia. Married men have gone, leaving behind wives and several children, and in case of the death of such men we are pledged to pensions for the dependents. At the same time there may he families of hefty, lusty sons who remain behind, the loss of any one of whom would, perhaps, not mean so much. The pension of £1 a week to a wife and 5s. a week for children I cannot help regarding as a mere charity dole, because, with such a provision, a woman will have to work in order to bring her family up in any way respectably. I take it that this Bill, if carried to its logical conclusion, will avoid many of these effects of the present system. Every man who can fight would be brought into line, and even supposing the Bill does not result in compulsory service, we shall at least know definitely what are our resources in men, means of transport, and so forth. We are told that all employers of labour are offering the greatest facilities for their men to enlist: and we are asked to go upon the public platform and stimulate the recruiting. I wish to bring under the notice of the House a statement which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> Massey Burnside, general manager of the Omnibus Company, and which, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of this morning, shows that he does not believe in recruiting. The secretary of the union had made some remarks in regard to wages paid, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burnside</inline> replied - </para>

                            <para>- I shall refrain from further quoting the extract. The Government have realized, though late in the day, that we must take our proper place in the war that is now going on, I am quite in accord with the taking of a wealth census; and I do not care whether or not this is the forerunner of taxation. Were I all-powerful on this continent, and had I to finance this war, I would not only take a wealth . census, but I would take the wealth. When a working man volunteers and loses his life on the field he loses his all, and his family are left unprovided for, whereas a rich man who is killed by the enemy generally leaves sufficient to provide for those he leaves behind. </para>

                            <para>- I can only hope that the honorable member's wife and children will never be asked to subsist on such an amount as that given under the "War Pensions Act. I would not like to go to the front and leave my wife and girl dependent upon the pension that would be paid to them in the case of my death. We are told that the liberty of the Australian people is being decided by this war, and that it is necessary for us to take this census in order that we may successfully prosecute our efforts in the way of providing troops and financing our part of the struggle. If, in order to do this, it is necessary for the people to give all they have got, I think that should be taken, even if it means a man's last penny. I would use every means to obviate the necessity of paying interest on any war loan, because I would not pay any man interest on the money he lends in order to protect that money. " When a man gives his life he gives all he has, and in the same way that this man has given his all, I think the capitalist, or any other man, should b"e asked to contribute all they have got. A man cannot grow another leg or another arm. He cannot come back to life once he has been killed. He has made his sacrifice, and whatever sacrifices are necessary to properly finance this war, I hope, when the census is taken, that the proper methods will also be taken to see that posterity does not have to pay for it.

                        <para>.- I heartily support the Government in this measure, which I do not think is preliminary to the introduction of conscription. The history of the war has shown us what the position is from the point of view of conscription. When the Cook Government was in power, 20,000 men were asked for. They came forward without any pressure. Then 50,000 men were wanted. They were easily obtained. Now 100,000 men are either in camp, on transports, or at the front. All that shows that the voluntary system is quite sufficient to supply our needs. I look upon this measure not as a measure of conscription, but as one that is necessary to the proper defence of the country. If it should happen that the country needs defending, the census will enable the Government to know where to look for the men capable of carrying on that defence. The Bill is the first step towards national defence. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is, otherwise I would not vote for it. No one can tell what the result of this war may be, and if the situation were to arise in which we required men here, there would be a good deal of indignation, if, owing to absence of organization, the Government had sent all available men away. I admit that this census should have been taken some time ago, but it is better to do it now than not at all, and I believe the will of the people is in favour of this census. .Just as we have taken the first step in the way of organizing the manhood of the country, so I think those who have wealth should not have the slightest objection to similar organization of their wealth. I would  like  to see a clause in the Bill under which the resources of the various States could be tabulated - the possibilities of transport from one State to the other, the rolling-stock and the number of locomotives. All this information would be useful to the Commonwealth Government. We need also to obtain a census of the number of motor cars, which would probably be a greater factor in national defence than railways. </para>

                            <para>- The Government ought to have all information with regard to transport facilities. I have not the slightest hesitation in extending my hearty support to the Bill, though I hope when it is dealt with in Committee, the Attorney-General will agree to wipe out some of the details regarding the returns which have to be submitted. I refer, particularly, to that calling for returns of furniture and personal effects, about which there is likely to be a good deal of complication and annoyance. Suppose I am in co-partnership with another party in the matter of furniture and personal effects. I should like to know who is going to fill in this return for me. That is one of the many little things that will probably cause irritation. I hope the Government will not insist upon that clause, because I fail to see how information of that kind can be of any service, whilst the task of filling in the return will be a great nuisance to people who just have a few pots, pans, and tables and chairs. However, I give the Bill my hearty support. </para>

                        <para>.- There is just one matter that I would like to bring before the notice of the Attorney-General. In our general legislation we exempt certain properties from taxation, for instance, churches and church properties. I know some anxiety has been created by this Bill on the point as to whether the people concerned with properties which are exempt from taxation will be compelled to make returns. Religious trusts and charitable trusts may find difficulty in complying with the terms of the Bill, however desirous the parties responsible may be of doing it on the ground of public duty. I would ask whether the Attorney-General would not give consideration to such cases, as in all probability if taxation 'follows as the result of this Bill - </para>

                        <para>. - This clause limits the operation of the Bill to the duration of the war, and no longer. That, to me, is most objectionable. I am quite satisfied that both the censuses proposed under this Bill are necessary, in order to make up deficiencies in our statistical information. Neither of them, however, go to the limits to which I am prepared to go. As the Bill stands, our information on these matters will cease with the war. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. In order to continue the supply of this information we should have to revive "this Act or to pass an entirely new measure. If the spirit of this clause be properly interpreted, then this information is wanted only during time of war. That being so, the Bill is for war purposes, and the information to be obtained under it is wholly, solely, strictly, and definitely limited to War purposes. 'It is quite futile for the Attorney-General to persist in his disclaimer that this is not in any sense of the term a conscription measure, since such a disclaimer is inconsistent with this clause. This census of the people, their condition, their ability, and their wealth is to be taken in order that we may use them in connexion with the war. The Prime Minister said to-day quite clearly and distinctly that the wealth census is being taken, as everybody believes, for the deliberate and special purpose of raising a war tax. </para>

                            <para>- The reflection, therefore, is on the Parliament, and not on my logic. In my judgment the information sought to be obtained under this Bill should be collected in time of peace as well as in time of war. The proposed census relates to information that we should have obtained long ago, and it could have been secured by an amendment of the Census and Statistics Act. I should like this clause to be omitted. If it were, we could continue to obtain this information after the war had ceased. We are going to spend, it is estimated, from £150,000 to £200,000 upon this census. We are going to set in motion a lot of machinery, and, perhaps, before that machinery has completed its operations the war will be over. Let us hope that it will be. The whole machinery, however, is to be set up, and as soon as the war is over, it is to automatically disappear. I object to that. I believe that the Bill is unnecessary, and unfair, and that it is opposed to the spirit of Australia and to the spirit of the times. </para>

                            <para>- I object to the whole thing. I am not opposed to the taking of a census of the life and wealth of the Commonwealth, but what is now proposed is that we shall take a war census. Despite the Attorney-General's disclaimer, this war census can be intended only for a specific purpose, and that is to enable the Government to provide men and money to carry on the war. It is very pleasing, of course, to hear the Prime Minister,  the Attorney-General, the Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Flinders, and others saying that this Bill does not mean conscription, and that if they thought it did they would have nothing to do with it. When I was speaking on a previous occasion, I said that I did not like to use the word " conscription," which is an ugly one, and probably the compulsory service to be rendered under this Bill will not be conscription in the ordinary acceptation of the word. According to <inline font-style="italic">Webster,</inline> conscription means a compulsory enrolment of men for military or naval service. </para>

More men are offering to-day than the Department can honestly and properly handle. Between 35 and 40 per cent, of those offering are being rejected for paltry reasons. Whatever the voluntary system may achieve in other countries, in Australia it has proved absolutely equal to every demand. There is no need for this census in order to ascertain what men are capable of serving, because those who are capable of serving are offering themselves in larger numbers than we can handle. A Bill on similar lines is now before the British Parliament, and Lord Lansdowne, a member of the British Cabinet, in speaking to the measure, said - </para><quote>
                        <para>The country realizes that the " old go-as-you-please system has broken down." . . . There is not a word regarding compulsory service in the present Bill, but I believe that the country will not tolerate voluntary service with the present anomalies and injustices much longer. This .Bill will greatly assist compulsory service, because it will shorten the interval elapsing between the decisions to resort to compulsion and absolute compulsion. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">I believe with Lord Lansdowne - and I find myself in unusual company in this respect- that the Bill now before the British Parliament has behind it the same idea as that which is behind the Bill now before us, and this Bill can only have the same result. What Lord Lansdowne says is correct. The Registration Bill in Great Britain means a shortening of the interval in the ultimate step towards absolute compulsion. Our Bill is a step towards absolute compulsion, and, if the definitions in Webster's unabridged dictionary are correct, " compulsory registration " is " conscription." For that reason I oppose the Bill, and likewise the proposal to take a census under the provisions of a War Census Bill. My objections would vanish if the census proposed to be taken were taken under a Statistics Act, or some such measure, and if the Government were prepared to say that, in their judgment, the position of affairs was so serious that the exigencies of the situation could not be met without compulsory enrolment and the demanding of men's services - if they said that we must have compulsion in the matter, I would be prepared to accept their decision and support them. The Government, however, cannot say that there is need for taking that step, because their own Minister of Defence says that he has sufficient men for his purposes. Evidently the Government have become scared, or they are simply slavishly following the lead of a Tory Government in the Old Country. Had the party to which I belong been on the other side of the chamber, and had this measure been introduced by the right honorable member for Parramatta or the honorable member for Flinders, every man in the party would have denounced it as being a Conscription Bill pure and simple.' I denounce it now as being a Conscription Bill. It is meant for nothing else but to compel men to serve. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Under voluntary service, the best always go, and only the best. One of the most regrettable, sad, and perplexing, yet inevitable, features of war is the fact that the best men are killed and the older and weaker men are left to carry on the burdens of their country, and perpetuate their species. The other night, when I spoke upon this subject, I was told that it was necessary to know where our engineers and fitters were, so that they could be classified and organized, but if we require engineers we do not need to spend £200,000 in order to find them. We can get all the engineers we require by asking for them. Furthermore, we have unlimited authority to reject men offering for service on half-a-dozen different, grounds. Men need not be rejected solely for being undersized, or for having defective- teeth or flat feet. They can be rejected on the ground that their services are required in Australia. If we need engineers here, all we have to say is, " We need you here. We cannot allow you to go to the front." Now that this Bill is approaching its last stages in this Chamber, I am more than ever satisfied that it is the first step towards conscription.

                        <para>. - I should like to mention what is in the mind of the Government in regard to these schedules, which are quite distinct in their nature and involve, to a certain extent, a corresponding distinction of treatment. Parliament will be asked to settle definitely the questions to be asked in reference to the schedule dealing with personal service, and the questions so settled upon should be put to the citizens in that form. This is necessary, because there is in the minds of some people an idea - which I have given up trying to remove - voiced just now by the honorable member for Brisbane, that this census is for the purpose of conscription. Parliament!, therefore, should determine the precise nature of these questions not settled by regulation. The position in regard to the wealth census is quite different. I do not think that there is any serious difference of opinion as to what information we are trying to obtain nor of the necessity for obtaining it, but there is ample room for difference of opinion as to the precise form in which these questions ought to be put. I do not profess to speak as an expert as to the precise form the questions should take. I have a number of amendments which I intend to move to the schedule, dealing with wealth and income. The Committee will have an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon each of those amendments, as well as upon the schedule as it stands. After that has been done, however, I shall not regard the schedule as being finally settled. I have already had the benefit of some advice from the Commissioner of Taxes in this State - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prout</inline> "Webb - who has been good enough to offer me the benefit of his experience, as has also the Land Tax Commissioner and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline> "What I would suggest is that after the Committee has done what it can towards making the schedule perfect in order to insure that it shall be as effective for our purpose as possible, the Government will not issue it until it has been submitted in its amended form to the Joint Committee to be shortly appointed, whose members will represent the different parties in the Parliament. In this way both political sections will have the assurance that the questions to be put under the Second Schedule to the Bill will be such as the Committee intend shall be put. And we shall thus have the benefit of the experience of the expert advice at our disposal. If honorable members will accept this suggestion, the Bill may be passed very quickly, and the discussion on the schedules considerably shortened. I have several amendments to the Bill, but I will put them as briefly as possible. As far as the wealth schedule is concerned, we shall do what we can, with the advice proffered to us by experts, to make it as perfect as possible. It will then be submitted for approval to the War Committee, representing the whole Parliament, and it will not be issued until it has been made acceptable to that body. </para>

                        <para>. - I am inclined to think that the suggestion of the Attorney-General will overcome some of the difficulties which some of us- experience in regard to this matter. I need hardly say that the wealth schedule is on© which will create an enormous amount of practical difficulty in various directions. People who have had to make out returns in connexion with land and income taxes are already making representations as to the superfluity of requiring them to undertake all that work again. If this Committee were asked to pass that schedule to-day, it would be obviously impossible to do it. We should require to debate it at length, and to make a great many suggestions in regard to it. As I understand the suggestion put forward by the Attorney-General, it is that the personal service schedule should be put in order now, so that it may come into operation at once. Then the wealth schedule is to be passed in its present form, but, as clause 7 gives the Government an unlimited power of modification- </para>

Under ordinary circumstances I should be very sorry to vest the Government with power practically to enact legislation by means of an Order in Council. If the Attorney-General will give the further assurance sought by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, I shall be very glad.

If the Bill is to go through Parliament next week, and to be at- once put into operation as far as the personal schedule is concerned, it is obviously impossible for the requisite investigation fe&gt; take place before then. Consequently, I would suggest that after the War Committee has gone fully info the matter, and after the Government have framed a regulation upon it, that regulation - as Parliament will then be sitting - should be laid upon the table of this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>. - I understood the Attorney-General to say that the Committee should determine the terms of the First Schedule to the Bill, but that in regard to the Second Schedule he would prefer that the Government should be given an opportunity to alter its terms if they so desire. After the honorable gentleman's promise that the Government will not in any way attempt to alter the First Schedule, I feel disposed to move an amendment which I have framed to put this clause in order. My amendment is that we should strike out the words " with such modifications or additions as are prescribed," and insert the following proviso : - ' ' Provided that the second schedule may be modified by additions or alterations as prescribed." The adoption of that amendment would give the Government power to alter the second schedule, but not the first. </para>

                            <para>- It is the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders that these words should be omitted, but if honorable members wish the words to be retained I shall have no objection. I ask honorable members to observe the difference between the objects of clauses 9 and 10. Clause 10 provides that an officer shall not, except as allowed by the Act, divulge the contents of any form or any information furnished in pursuance of the Act. That relates particularly to those persons engaged in dealing with the forms, but clause 9 will cover all those persons - and  their name will he legion - who, throughout the Commonwealth, will he assisting in any way to instruct the people how to fill in the forms? It is perfectly proper to draw a line of demarcation between these two clauses. The contents of the schedules will be quite confidential. A person will fill in his form and post it, and nobody will see it unless the person furnishing it asks for assistance in filling it in. The words "of secrecy" may be omitted without danger. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause provides for a fine not exceeding  £50,  or imprisonment not exceeding three months, or both, or, for an indictable offence, a fine not exceeding  £500,  or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. In connexion with the decennial census a person filling in the forms is given every assistance. A collector leaves the forms at the various houses; the householders are assisted in filling in the particulars, and if they fail to give information they are fined. Under this Bill, however, no assistance is to be given to the general public to obtain the papers. The public are expected to secure the papers on their own initiative; the cards will not be delivered to the houses. I can well believe that throughout the Commonwealth there will be hundreds and thousands of people who will know nothing whatever about this Bill or its contents, but they will still be liable under it to the penalties to which I take exception. I ask whether the services of the Post Office could not be availed of, as they will be later to distribute pamphlets dealing with the referenda proposals, to send these schedules to the people throughout the country? Honorable members will agree that the taking of a census in the United Kingdom, where  45,000,000  of people reside within an area that could be hidden away in one corner of Queensland, is a very different thing from the taking of a census in Australia, where, although I admit millions of people live in the big cities, neighbours in the country may be  50  miles apart. I think that the services of the Post-Office should be availed of to furnish these schedules to the people; and we should not ask them, under penalties, to obtain them for themselves. </para>

                        <para>. -  It would be a mistake to suppose for a moment that the Post Office Department could carry out this work without so impairing its efficiency for the performance of its ordinary functions as to result in a practical breakdown. In connexion with the census, the Government Statistician had  7,000  collectors, whose sole business was to go round with the necessary forms, and they were weeks at the work. The collection of the forms after being filled in was done by this same army of workers. The difficulty will be, not as the honorable member for Capricornia seems to think, in the people getting the forms, but in the filling of them up. It is not for this Parliament, that has passed compulsory electoral registration, to baulk at this proposal. We make a man register as an elector, whether he likes it or not; we make him send his children to school; we make him see that they are vaccinated, and so on. I remind honorable members that the people of this country are now inflamed with the desire to do something, no matter what it is, to help in the stupendous task before the nation. The people, animated by this spirit, may be trusted to carry out the duties imposed upon them under this Bill. In existing circumstances we need not despair of people performing duties with enthusiasm that, in normal circumstances, they might ignore. Consider the circumstances. There are at least  100,000  households in Australia, and perhaps not less than  1,000,000  people, intimately concerned in this matter, because their husbands, sons, or brothers are at the front, or about to go to the front. They cannot, and will not, neglect the duties imposed upon them under this Bill, or treat them as if they were the ordinary functions of a citizen in normal times. We are here asking them to do something which, if they will not do it, cannot be done at all. I say deliberately that if the people will not do this for themselves, it cannot be done within a reasonable time, and unless it is done quickly it is useless to do it at all. As for penalties in a measure of this description, penalties must be provided' for. We must show that we are in  earnest, and intend to get this information. </para>

                            <para>- These are heavier. Under the Census Act a penalty of £10 is provided for. It must be remembered that the penalties set out in this clause are maximum penalties. Magistrates in many cases do not seem to be able to understand this general rule, governing practically all Commonwealth laws. There may, therefore, be some misunderstanding; but I repeat that these are maximum penalties, and there is no reason why a magistrate should fine any one more than1s., or should fine him at all, for an honest mistake or an innocent oversight. An offence under the Bill for which the maximum penalty might be imposed would have to be one in which it was plain that the mind of the citizen went with the offence, and that it was committed with a criminal intent. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the penalties provided for in this clause are excessive, and I am fortified in that opinion by what the Attorney-General has said. He says that in 100,000 households throughout the Commonwealth there are people who are intimately concerned about this matter. That statement is surely inconsistent with a proposal to impose a penalty of £50, or of £500, and in default, three to twelve months' in prisonment, for failure to comply with the provisions of this measure. I remind the Attorney-General that failure to register for electoral purposes is met by a maximum penalty of only £2. I believe this clause will be a dead letter, as the penalties proposed are monstrous. By proposing such heavy fines and imprisonment for offences under this Bill, one would think that the Attorney-General desired to make criminals of the people. I do not believe in manufacturing crimes or criminals, and I am altogether opposed to these heavy penalties. </para>

                        <para>- I am entirely in the hands of the Committee in this matter. Two suggestions have been made. There is no difference of opinion on the point that the second schedule shall not come into force until it has been approved either by the War Committee or by this House. In my view, the War Committee could best deal with the matter, but I do not press that. I propose to make a number of amendments in that schedule now, because I do not desire that the Bill should go to another place until we have done the best we can with it. When it is returned from another place, in whatever form the second schedule may then be, the regulations relating to it, together with the schedule, will be submitted to the War Committee or to the House. Honorable members can please themselves as to the body to whom they are submitted. </para>

                            <para>- Another matter to which I direct attention is this: Citizens are to be asked to state whether their general health is good, bad, or indifferent, and - Question7 - if their health is not good, to state the cause. Personally, I should have no objection to answering the latter question, but I have had the advantage of a discussion with the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable and learned member for Flinders, and they have convinced me that the question may be regarded by many as inquisitorial ; and, therefore, I am willing that it should be struck out of the schedule. If a man says that his health is bad, we are not really concerned as to the cause, and the man who does not tell the truth in replying to Question 6 is not likely to give a true answer to Question 7. It is enough for us to know that a man is unfit, and it will be time enough to ask why men are unfit when we have reason to believe that they are malingering. By inserting a question regarding the possession of fire-arms, and striking out the question as to the cause of ill-health, we shall improve the schedule. The Committee has the positive assurance of the Government that the form of questions submitted to the citizens' will be that approved by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>.- Is there any reason why the question should not he asked - " Are you prepared to join the Army for active service?" Answers to that question should materially assist the Government. Thousands of men are ready to enlist, as is shown by the way in which volunteers have been coming forward in Victoria; and what has been happening in this State will, within the course of a few weeks, happen in every other State of the Commonwealth. There will be a general recruiting campaign, and an enormous body of men will volunteer, to join the colours.. There are two principal objects in these attempts to organize the community - one is to ascertain what number of nien is fit to go to the front, and the other is to discover how best we can organize the community for the supply of material, equipment, and munitions for war purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I have said that the time has come when the Government should compel certain men to remain in Australia. As the Defence Department, by using the organization which we are creating, increased its equipment we could, were these questions asked, call up recruits from the classes best fitted to serve. The Minister of Defence would be able to call up the men, have the equipment ready for them, and put them straight into the camp. I think that would be infinitely better than the method we are adopting, and that is why I suggest that these questions should be put in." There is one other question I wanted to mention in connexion with the schedule, and that is in relation to those industries, those particular industries, which I think I referred to at an earlier hour. There should be a' special effort in this census to organize every man who can be utilized in those particular industries; but I do not think this schedule is drafted in such a way as to enable that to be done. It does ask a man what employment he is actually in, and what .other employment he would be willing to engage in ; but there are certain industries for which particularly we require men. Take, for instance, the .textile industry, our Woollen Mills. In Australia there are many men who have had experience, perhaps, not in woollen mills, but in textile industries. where looms are employed, and I think their services might be gathered in on this occasion. Then, in regard to the manufacture of shells, I know of two or three cases myself of men in country occupations who have had experience in the arsenals in England. I do not think the details of such employment will be obtained by the census in its present form, and, therefore, it is probable that the services of such men may not be secured. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not agree with the honorable member for Richmond that the questions as they already stand do not provide for all that is required so far as concerns registration and the discovery of the occupation which a person is best fitted to perform, apart altogether from any work he may be engaged, in at present. The questions 9a and 10 set out the position very clearly, and any intelligent person filling in that return, if he has information of that character to give, will feel called upon to supply it. I have no doubt that if further questions were prescribed the effect would be really to limit the number- of persons who fill them in. </para>

We are aware that we have a quantity of information, but the essential part is not available at the present moment. By means of this census, however, it can be brought up to date speedily and completely, and I believe every honorable member on both sides of the House, and among all parties, will be very happy indeed to have this information furnished to the Government, not to determine who shall go to the war in the first instance, but so that we may be able to mobilize our resources for the use of the people, and to enable the Government more effectively to protect the country from foreign foes. </para>

                            <para>. - I only want to say that if this Bill does not refer to the war, and is not intended as a war measure, it has absolutely no meaning. It is a war census. It is not for any civil purpose, but for war purposes only, since its operation is specifically limited to the duration of' the war. </para>

                                <para>- Is not the purpose of the Bill to classify our material and men - men in particular - for the purpose of ordering and mobilizing our forces to the best advantage? Some men, for instance, can serve the country better in Australia than at the front; and the Bill is intended, I take it, to get such knowledge as will enable the Government, when they make their appeal for volunteers, to classify the men, and show what they are best fitted to do in the prosecution of the war. It may turn out when the census is taken and applied to those already at the war that we have sent men whom we could very much better have kept at home. Until we have all the factors of the case before us in a tabulated form, we may not know where to make our appeals with most effect, and decide who ought to go to the front and who ought to do duty at home. This is part of the proposal which I hope will be carried much further, so that by means of the Committee, and in other ways, we may be able to mobilize the resources of Australia, both in men and material. Since that is the unmistakable intention of the Bill, may I suggest that no good purpose is served by trying .to make the Bill appear what it is not? This is a war census, and nothing else - it is so stated in the Bill - and its operation is limited to the duration of the war. </para>

This is a war measure introduced for two reasons in particular.

We are going to take two censuses, one of which is in regard to the wealth of the country. The Prime Minister stated quite clearly, what we all know and expected, that we are going to have a war tax, and that that tax is to. be based on the wealth census taken under this Bill. </para>

Is it a war Bill, but not intended for use during the war? I take it that the object of the legislation is to get information as to what men there are between certain ages suitable to go to the war. There would be no advantage in having that information if the suitable men do not go to the front. What advantage would it be to the country to know that there are many thousands of men between certain ages who are fitted for the front, unless they are at least told that they ought to go ? If these men say that they have other obligations and duties, and are not prepared to go - what then ? </para>

                                <para>- I am not in favour of conscription, because I do not think it is necessary just now. I think, however, that the object of the Bill is to enable the Government, if we do not get sufficient response without conscription or a legal demand - whatever we may call it - to ascertain what men are available and legislate accordingly. There ought to be no blinking of the facts; otherwise, why go to the trouble of taking the census? What can be the object of taking a census if, when we get it, we do nothing with it? The response has been too good already to demand any coercion, but I am not in favour of going to a great deal of trouble to collect information unless we are able to see what we are going to do with it when we have got it. The Bill is to have effect only during the war, and the information will soon be out of date unless it is kept up. Most of the information we require we have already. The Commonwealth Land Tax Department can tell us the value of the lands in estates above £5,000 in value, and the States can tell us the lower amounts. The Federal Statistical Department and the State Statistical Departments know all about the wealth of the country, the incomes of the people, and so on. I asked the Attorney-General to let us know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> thinks about this matter, and what information is desired that he cannot get from his own Department or from the Land </para>

                        <para class="block">Tax Commissioner, or the State Statistical Departments, but the Attorney-General has given me no reply on that point. If something more than we have already got is wanted we should devote ourselves to that point, and not go over the whole gamut, and try to get the whole of the information anew, with all the attendant trouble and expense. I would, of course, like to have all possible information catalogued, printed, and available, but I do not believe that it is to be of use to us during the war, unless it is to be for the purpose stated by honorable members opposite - to ascertain what men within certain ages are available to go to the war, and to make them go if they do not volunteer. </para>

                            <para>. - I despair of being able to impress on the minds of honorable members who have lived in an atmosphere utterly remote from that now being breathed by the modern world, any conception of what the Bill is for. It is for the purpose of organizing the nation. It is a belated attempt to do that which, had it been done long ago by England and by us, would have made this war absolutely impossible. We are fighting an organized nation. The right honorable member for Swan says we have all this information. That is a voice coming from the tombs of the Pharaohs. We have not the information. He asks what is the use of having information if we do not make use of it. The right honorable member is saturated with information that he does not make use of. We have not the information we want. We have to get it. We must do now hurriedly work that we ought to have had in leisured preparation for years. The honorable member for Brisbane has the bee of conscription in his bonnet, and because of the obstinacy of his race I give him up. On the other hand, I have the right honorable member for Swan. If this Bill means conscription, I say devoutly, without any reservation, that those two will be the first to go. If the Bill served no other useful purpose, it could not then be said to have been altogether futile. </para>

                        <para>The Bill will organize the forces of the nation. My honorable friends are unable to see that for the first time in the history of the world it is the whole nation that is at war - not the 100,000 fighting men that we are going to set up at the front, but the nation at large. We must face the fact that, unless we organize, we cannot keep 100,000 fighting men at the front. It means the bleeding of the best resources of the nation in men and money, and a disorganization of commerce and industry which we cannot tolerate. We must put our house in order. This Bill is to enable us to do it. Its purpose is not to send certain men to the front. Its purpose is to find out what numbers of men we have to do the things which have to be done. So many men have to be engaged in the primary industries. We cannot carry on the war unless we can sell our primary products. Cut off as we are, and must be, from those financial resources upon which Australia has depended for over 100 years, we must now depend, for the first time, on what we grow and make ourselves. Just as a man confronted with tremendous obligations determines to utilize and develop his resources to the uttermost, so must this nation. And the first step towards this great work is to take stock. This is a national stocktaking, and the purpose for which we utilize the information must necessarily depend upon the circumstances of the case. The Bill is not for the purpose of conscription for service either in Australia or abroad. In no circumstances would I agree to send men out of this country to fight against their will. If the day ever comes when men will not fight when their country is at death-grips, it will be because the country is rotten to the core, and not worth fighting for. If the enemy comes here it will not be a question of conscription at all, for every one, young and old, must take what comes to his hand, and die, if need be, in the attempt to defend the country. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not propose to move any amendment on the lines I suggested just now, because, if I did, I should be as one crying in the wilderness; but I do urge upon the Government that, before this Bill goes through another place, they should consider the suggestions that I have made for obtaining additional information. Nothing was further from my mind than the idea of raising any controversy regarding conscription in the suggestions I made as to the direct question as to service being asked. May I repeat, as the Attorney-General has pointed out over and over again, that this Bill is to organize the people ? Surely, when we are going to spend a large sum of money, as we are in this work, we should secure the greatest, amount of organization possible. How can we get better organization than by finding out exactly the men who are prepared to go to the front? Thousands and thousands of affirmative answers may be expected to that question. Some of these men will be engineers, some cloth-weavers - men whose services will be of more value here, and whose desire to go should be known to the Government. Are not these men worth discovering? </para>
