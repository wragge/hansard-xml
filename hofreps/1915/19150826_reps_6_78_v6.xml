                            <para>- I understand that all reports come through His Excellency the Governor-General. He is the first person to receive any report. A few days ago the right honorable the leader of the Opposition asked a question regarding the expenditure of the money subscribed for the purpose of providing travelling kitchens. The answer is that the kitchens subscribed! for up to the end of last year, and not intended for local use, have been shipped to Egypt. Those made in England and paid for . by private subscriptions, were delivered, it is understood, in Egypt, between April and June last. It cannot be definitely stated that all the kitchens are actually at the front, as their allocation for use in Egypt would be at the discretion of the General Officer Commanding. All the motor ambulances subscribed for up to the end of last year, and ordered in Australia, were sent to Egypt early this year. Any delay in the delivery of the motor ambulances ordered from the High Commissioner&#39;s office would probably be due to the enormous demands existing in England for vehicles of this character for War Office purposes. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for the Navy recently promised to consider the advisability of paying recruits from the date of their acceptance. In the case of many recruits the period of three or four weeks has now elapsed from the date of their acceptance to their being sworn in, and I should like to ask the Minister for the Navy if any decision has been arrived at as to the payment of these men during that interval ? Has the Government taken the matter into consideration, and is payment likely to be made? </para>

I have suggested to the State Premiers that the subject might very well be discussed by them at the Conference which is shortly to take place. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking generally, I have no doubt, nor have I ever had any, that the States have no constitutional right to interfere with the free flow of trade between the States. The only circumstances under which such a right can arise is after the States have acquired the commodity in question. That is my opinion, and it furnishes an answer to the first two parts of the honorable member&#39;s question; but when the honorable gentleman asks me what I propose to do, I confess that it is a question easier to ask than to answer. The States have at their disposal a weapon, sharp and efficient. If we say they shall not interfere, the States can acquire the commodity, and any prosecution which may be instituted by the Commonwealth at once becomes a farce. While the States have this rod, which they can hold over our heads, it appears to me that any attempt by the Commonwealth to enforce the provisions of the Constitution must be futile. </para>

                        <para>- I read a newspaper report of the honorable member&#39;s speech, and my attention has also been drawn to it by a question in this Blouse. I do not hesitate to say that I deplore the utterance in question. I consider that it reflects on the honour of Australia generally, and that if it were believed by the people it would be degrading to the troops who are fighting our battles&#34;. I am pleased that the honorable member for Batman is present. So far as any reference to myself is concerned, I recognise that I am a subject for public criticism, but it is a well-known axiom that our defenders in the Army may not reply to any such criticism. I decline to believe that there are walking about Melbourne people who would cut a throat for half-a-crown. I believe that the honorable member for Batman belongs to a learned profession, the members of which will accept a brief to prosecute a man for an offence, and move the Courts, which employ the police, to execute their orders, even to punishment by death and extraction of money from poor people. I think the honorable member&#39;s remarks are a grave reflection on our defenders. </para>

That is the case with the northern rivers of New South Wales, which are included in the first military district, and, I think, also with Broken Hill and the Riverina, the men from those districts being sent to camps which are outside their own State. I ask the Minister if he will investigate those cases in order that men so situated may have the same facilities for reaching their home as recruits who enter camps within their own States? </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that the Victorian Government have been endeavouring to obtain meat from Queensland, and I have given them every assistance. Many applications have been made for permission to export both mutton and lamb from Australia. A Victorian exporter waited on me to-day to request permission to ship oversea some mutton which he was holding in another State. I declined to grant permission, in the same way as I have refused permission to others during the last six or eight weeks, unless the shipments were definitely on Imperial account. We know what quantity of meat the Imperial authorities require in the Mediterranean during the year. Although permission has been sought within the last two days for the export of 93,000 carcasses, no permit has been granted to anybody. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no intention to delay the Committee for any great length of time, because I deem it our duty, particularly at this stage of the session, to make our remarks as concise as possible. I, with other honorable members, appreciate the great importance of the statement that has been made by the Treasurer, and I realize that, next to the war itself, no greater problem exists in Australia, or, for that matter, elsewhere throughout the Empire, than that of finance. So gravely important is this question, that, in connexion with it, no honorable member can shirk his responsibility ; and it is our duty to endeavour to grasp the difficulties involved, in order that we may assist towards its solution. I share the view already expressed that this should be essentially a non-party matter, and I am anxious to show no feeling whatever, but simply to give expression to the passing thoughts in my mind. I have deemed it my duty to closely look into the statement submitted, and I think I can put the matter almost in a nutshell. The Treasurer, so far as the ordinary services are concerned, anticipates an expenditure of &#163;18,266,025. Our obligations to the States represent a sum of &#163;6,200,000, and the special war expenditure is put down at &#163;45,749,450, while, for new works in all Departments, the estimate is &#163;3,827,629. Then it is proposed, out of loan expenditure, to do certain work in connexion with the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway to an amount of something like &#163;3,000,000, making a total estimated expenditure of &#163;77,043,104. The right honorable gentleman, having to advise the Committee as to the method by which he anticipates meeting that expenditure, proposes to rely on indirect taxation through Customs and Excise to the extent of about &#163;15,000,000, and on direct taxation to an extent of about &#163;6,453,000, made up of land tax, probate and succession duties, and income tax. He contemplates receiving &#163;1,766,000 from the land tax, and though the returns from probate duties paid last year were not up to his expectation, owing to the disagreeable attitude of wealthy men, who would not die, he relies on them to bring in a revenue of &#163;687,000 this year. </para>

                        <para>- This revenue is always an uncertain quantity; it is always a matter&#34; of guesswork. The most important feature of the direct taxation is the new proposal for the imposition of an income tax which, it is contemplated, will bring in a revenue of about &#163;4,000,000. What may be regarded as the direct aUd indirect domestic or local means of obtaining money with which to meet the year&#39;s expenditure amount to &#163;27,540,000, and the Treasurer proposes to resort to loans to the extent of about &#163;49,000,000 in order to&#39; make up portion of the balance of his anticipated expenditure for the year. The first source from which he will derive this money is the Commonwealth loan of &#163;20,000,000, now in process of flotation. For the first time in the history of Australia we are called upon to rely on our own resources for raising loans. Possibly it will prove to be a valuable and useful experience, for I am confident that the fervent patriotism of the people of Australia, of the rich as well as of the more humble in circumstances, will so respond that the loan will be a gigantic success, and when we learn the result of this flotation we shall be in a better position to see what will be our chances of resorting to a similar source for loan moneys required in the future. In addition to this &#163;20,000,000, the Treasurer has a balance of &#163;10,400,000 coming to him from the British loan, and he proposes to resort to the Australian Notes Fund for about &#163;3,000,000 for new works. This is a doubtful means of providing money for our requirements, because, when we remember the vast sum which is already represented by the issue of our notes, approaching, so far as commitments are concerned, something like &#163;46,000,000, we must realize that we are straining our resources very gravely in this respect. In addition to these sources that I have mentioned, there is still the sum of &#163;16,103,104 to be provided for, the source of which has not yet been stated by the Treasurer. Altogether we have to face a deficit on the year&#39;s transactions of about &#163;53,000,000, to meet which we contemplate imposing an income tax estimated to produce &#163;4,000,000, and raising &#163;49,000,000 from loan sources. At this present juncture honorable members dare not be too critical. We are living in heroic times, when heroic measures are justified, and indeed necessary, for the purpose of dealing with extraordinary emergencies. We must prove <inline font-style="italic">ourselves</inline> equal to these emergencies, and the most ready means of dealing with them is to be found in raising loans to the extent of &#163;49,000,000. Later on it will be the responsibility of this Parliament to deal more fully with this matter of raising loans. It will probably be found necessary to take into consideration the wisdom of establishing a system of annuities by which those who desire to provide for their old age may purchase annuities, and by which the Government will be able to secure what may be regarded as an inconvertible loan. This is a matter worthy of consideration, and many precedents can be quoted in its favour. In dealing with this great financial problem it will be essential to look at all the means at our disposal for the purpose of doing justice to Australia. The whole community looks to Parliament to give most thoughtful consideration, to the important issues confronting us, and I trust tha? honorable members will be found equal to their responsibilities in this connexion. One of the most important features to which we are expected to have regard is whether our departments and our ordinary public services are based on business and economic lines. We are not justified in asking the public to pay further taxation unless we satisfy them that we have given the utmost consideration and thoughtful care to the matter of carrying on our public services in this way. Some honorable members have already invited attention to the comparison between the actual expenditure for 1914-15 and the estimated expenditure for 1915-16. I also invite the attention of honorable members to the figures which have been placed before us. The total expenditure for 1914-15 from revenue and from loan was &#163;25,434,121. The Treasurer estimates that it will be necessary to spend during the current year &#163;24,466,000 on ordinary services, and &#163;3,827,629 on new works, or a total for 1915-16 of &#163;28,293,629 from revenue, or also taking into consideration the proposed expenditure from loan moneys, &#163;31,293,000, as against an actual expenditure of &#163;25,434,121 for 1914-15 from revenue and loan funds. This means an estimated increase in ordinary expenditure of &#163;3,881,000, an estimated increase in new works expenditure of &#163;1,157,393, and an estimated increase in loan expenditure of &#163;821,115, or a total estimated increase of &#163;5,859,508 over the actual expenditure for the year 1914-15. From this sum must be deducted about &#163;1,300,000, the estimated interest on the war loan, and something like &#163;500,000 for war pensions, or &#163;1,800,000 altogether, leaving the net estimated increase for the current year at &#163;4,000,000. It is perhaps a coincidence that &#163;4,000,000 is the sum which it is proposed to raise by income taxation. It has been stated that income taxation is essentially war taxation, but on the figures I have given it is obvious that the income tax is to be imposed to meet the increasing expenditure. That is a very serious matter in these times. Economy is necessary; I do not mean by economy anything that would impair the effective conduct of our ordinary services and constructional policy, or would in any way discount efficiency. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson&#39;s</inline> report on the Postal Department, which has been opportunely presented to Parliament, conclusively demonstrates the need for economy and business reform in the Public Service, and these things should be undertaken before the burdens of the people are increased. The &#163;4,000,000 raised by income taxation should be ear-marked for war expenditure. The people will readily bear the burden of taxation if they are convinced that it is necessary for the prosecution of the war ; but they will be consumed with resentment if they realize that they are being taxed because the cost of the Public Service is being unnecessarily increased. The pre-Budget statement that has been put before us contains no evidence of economy, notwithstanding the need for it, not only on the part of private individuals, but also on the part of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Probably the expenditure will be less than the appropriation by at least &#163;2,000,000, but taxation is proposed on the assumption that the whole appropriation will be spent. </para>

                        <para>- Victoria passed through a bad time, but the retrenchment policy which was carried out was demanded, and approved by the people. I do not suggest the starvation of the Public Services; that would be deplorable; but extravagance in administration is not justifiable. The Estimates might fairly be referred to the Public Accounts Committee, which is a body representing both political parties, and might well be allowed the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> to enable it to make a thorough investigation, so that we could be assured that the Estimates have been framed on a business basis and without extravagance and that there is justification for increased taxation. In my opinion &#163;2,000,000 could easily be saved, though I am not able to say arbitrarily what items should be curtailed. If such a saving were made, it would not be necessary to raise more than &#163;2,000,000 by income taxation. I should be sorry to think that any section of the community would endeavour to shirk its responsibilities at the present time, but I think it was contemplated that the taxation of incomes would be confined almost completely to the States. It is not to be forgotten that income taxation discourages the investment of capital. That is not a mere <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> or casual statement. It is our policy to establish factories throughout the length and breadth of the country. But if a British or foreign capitalist establishes a factory in Victoria, another in New South Wales, and others in other States, he has to pay taxation on his profits in each State separately, and in the Mother Country, and it is now proposed to compel him to pay income tax to the Commonwealth Government as well. All income derived in Australia by British residents or companies has to pay not only the income tax at Home but also State income tax. &#34;Upon the top of all this we are now going to impose an excessively high Commonwealth income tax. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but we are not discussing Unification. We have deliberately laid down our policy of encouraging the introduction of capital to Australia. Every tax of this kind acts to some extent as a discouragement, and this excessive tax will be particularly effective in that direction. What I would therefore urge is that, instead of imposing a tax from which we hope to secure the sum of &#163;4,000,000, we should be satisfied, under the existing financial exigencies, with &#163;2,000,000, particularly when we bear in mind the heavy taxation imposed last session, when the land tax and probate duties were very largely increased. It is admitted by the Attorney-General himself that the tax to be imposed reaches the high-water mark, and, for the reasons I have stated, I think that in imposing it we shall be acting very unwisely. I know some honorable members will be disposed to say that this is the old bogy, but it is impossible to be mixed up with the business affairs of this community day after day without realizing what the effect of excessive taxation is likely to be. We all realize how necessary it is that capital should be invested in Australia for the purpose of encouraging every branch of industrial enterprise. All the capital coming to Australia from abroad adds to the wealth of the country, and it is undesirable, particularly during the present condition of crisis, that we should do anything to discourage the introduction of that capital. In seeking to justify this income tax, the Attorney-General laid down a number of wholesome principles upon which all sound schemes of taxation must rest. I&#39; listened to his enunciation of those principles with very great interest, and I hope they will be recognised as fundamental and vital by the members of the Attorney-General&#39;s party, although there have been many voices of dissent. The Attorney-General was anxious that what he described as the &#34;economic equilibrium &#34; should be disturbed as little as possible. The productivity of a country, he said, depends mainly upon the manner in which the available capital is used and the efficiency of the labour. He declared it to be a mistake to impose taxation upon wealth used in the production of more wealth, adding that the basic principle of the taxation Bill which he was then introducing was the taxation of the country&#39;s surplus wealth as distinguished from capital. I commend the sentiments expressed by the Attorney-General on that occasion, though I am disposed to think, after a comparison between the measure he introduced and the sentiments to which he gave expression, that we were only listening to a fine stroke of humour on the part of our humorous Attorney-General. I have closely examined that measure in order to see how these fine principles were being carried out, but I have not discovered the slightest evidence of them. If the Attorney-General suggests for one moment that this income tax wilt; only affect the surplus wealth - what he called the &#34; margin of luxury &#34; - he will be. utterly mistaken. The capital that is going to be taxed will be the working capital of the community, which the Attorney-General himself said should not be taxed. I admit that taxation is necessary to a certain extent, but this taxation means the lessening of the country&#39;s productivity in ratio to the amount of taxation that is imposed, for practically all the capital of Australia is working capital. We have not the advantage of those luxurious surpluses enjoyed in older-established communities. Our position as a young and growing industrial community is such that in the taxation scheme recently introduced we shall be deliberately taxing our working capital. That is the grave and serious aspect of the situation, an aspect that prompts me to urge strongly that that process of taxation should be applied in the lightest possible form. </para>

                        <para>- There is all the difference as between a debtor and a creditor country. A somewhat amusing feature of the Attorney-General&#39;s declaration was his strong Free Trade speech delivered oblivious of the fact that he is a member of a Protectionist Government. He deplored the fact that in Australia indirect taxation has always borne to the whole a much larger percentage than in the United Kingdom. He complained of the large amount paid by the masses, chiefly in Customs and Excise. In order to justify his argument in favour of the proposed tax, he stated that in the United Kingdom direct taxation amounted to &#163;4 10s. 5d. per head, and indirect taxation to &#163;2 15s. 2d. per head, whereas Victoria imposed direct taxation to the amount of &#163;3 13s. 9d. per head, and indirect taxation - as in all the other States - to the amount of &#163;4 per head. The direct taxation in some of the other States is higher than in Victoria. But the Attorney-General forgot that the indirect taxation of the United Kingdom is a dead weight round the necks of the workers, having regard to the fierce labour  competition  that they have to meet from the rest of the world, whereas in Australia it is that very process of indirect taxation that purchases for the worker his employment. It is by this process of indirect taxation that he gets his Wages Boards, his Arbitration Courts, and all his other industrial tribunals - that, in short, he gets his good wages. The Attorney-General forgot the part indirect taxation has played in the establishment of something like 15,536 factories, employing 337,101 hands, and paying &#163;33,606,087 annually in wages. He forgot the great factor it has been in the investment of something like &#163;75,000,000 of capital in secondary industries. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that question at the present time. I am simply dealing with the Attorney-General&#39;s argument as a justification for the imposition of the income tax, that we are already too heavily taxed, and have always been too heavily taxed, in an indirect way. The same indirect taxation, by assisting in the establishment of the industries to which I have referred, means a yearly increase in the value of the material used to the extent of &#163;65,153,286, and a total yearly output of the value of &#163;161,560,763. In support of my statement that indirect taxation has assisted in procuring good wages for the worker, I would point, out that whereas in 1909 the average wage of the men and women employed in these factories was nearly &#163;S3 per annum, in 1913 it was upwards of &#163;104 per annum. It will thus be seen that the indirect taxation of which the Attorney-General complains has established great and valuable industries in Australia, has secured for our workers employment and good wages, and has also made us to a very substantial extent self-contained. To have a self-contained Australia at the present time would be a matter for congratulation. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but we have made a big development in that direction, and indirect taxation has played an important part in enabling us to do so. T do not feel justified in further detaining the Committee by dealing with this matter; but when the Income Tax Bill is before the House I shall once more refer to it. I -would urge honorable members opposite - and I am speaking without the remotest party feeling, being actuated only by a desire to serve the public interest - to recognise that, for the reasons I have stated, the taxation proposed by the Government is excessive. If an additional &#163;4,000,000 must be provided we can readily make savings to the extent of &#163;2,000,000, and, instead of imposing the excessive income tax rates proposed, should so reduce them as to make the tax return something like &#163;2,000,000 instead of &#163;4,000,000 per annum as estimated. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to take advantage of this opportunity to discuss the finances of the Commonwealth, more particularly as, owing to the urgency of our immediate conditions, we find it necessary to impose still greater burdens on the people. I have no doubt that those burdens, whatever they may be, will be willingly borne; but the most unfavorable feature of the situation is the fact that the Commonwealth and State Governments are going to continue to levy on the same people and in the same way. During this debate hints have been dropped as to Unification, and I have no hesitation in saying that &#34;we at least need, and need very badly, a unification of the finances of Australia. That, to my mind, is the only sane course to pursue. I can well understand the critics dwelling upon the vital necessity for the Commonwealth and States arriving at a complete understanding as to how they should levy taxation on the people. Despite State divisions, we are one as a people and as a country. Our interests are identical, and obviously the only proper course to pursue is to bring about a clear-cut arrangement by which the public funds shall be contributed in a definite way, and adjusted in businesslike proportions to the needs of the. States and the Commonwealth. Under existing conditions, the one governing power does not know what the other is doing. T venture to say that the financial adviser to the Prime Minister is not thoroughly conversant with the situation of the States, or with the incidence of State taxation on incomes that we are now proposing heavily to levy upon. Unification of finance appeals to me more than does any other form of unification, not only because it is absolutely necessary, but because it is such as to attract the trained minds of the community. We should thus be more likely to secure that amicable working together which can be associated only with the best-trained minds. Say what you will, the average ordinary man will not work harmoniously with his fellow. Little differences arise, and that which was begun in amity generally ends in chaos. There is no such danger when big financial matters are being handled by men who thoroughly understand what they are doing, and who are well trained in business. In order to show how little we know what we are doing, and the extent to which we are in conflict with the States in respect of taxation, I wish to give the House a typical case, which clearly illustrates the situation that has to be faced by a number of property-owners in Australia today. It is unnecessary for me to say that I hold no brief for those who revel in great wealth. But, while that is so, I think it our duty to see that justice is done, and that when endeavouring to levy equitable taxation we do not impose it in such a way as to destroy the vital forces of the country, and to kill enterprise. The figures that I am about to quote have been thoroughly accredited to me, and are fully substantiated. They relate to a specific case in which rents are drawn from an Australian property and applied in England. The annual return by way of rents from a certain property in Sydney is &#163;3,906. The State land tax, now by Statute made the municipal tax, on that property is &#163;356 17s. lOd. ; the municipal and other local rates amount to &#163;618 14s. lOd. ; the Federal land tax to &#163;914 18s. 7d.; the State income tax to &#163;166 18s. lOd. ; and the Federal income tax, if the formula recently appearing in the Sydney press be correct - and I understand it is - will amount to &#163;250. A total of &#163;2,307 10s. Id. has thus to be paid by way of taxation, leaving the owner of the property &#163;1,598 9s. lid. From that amount has to be deducted, in respect of insurance premiums, &#163;158, leaving the property-owner &#163;1,440 9s. lid. out of his gross return of &#163;3,906 per annum. That residue of &#163;1,440 has to bear income tax in England, which is a substantial impost, and it is estimated that not more than &#163;1,000 per annum will remain to the owner of the property. I can produce documentary  evidence to show that all these figures are correct. It may be said that  &#163;1,000  per annum  is  enough for any man to live on, but that is hardly the point in question. We have to consider whether we are raising such a barrier in the way of those who would otherwise invest here as to considerably interfere with the development of Australia. Until we have a much better system of civilization than we at present enjoy, we must subscribe more or Jess to the conventions of the day, and they are that, before you can develop any particular line of industry, you must have capital. If the conditions are so harsh that capital is diverted, this country will suffer unless the Government are prepared to jump in and do all capitalistic work. That, in my opinion, the Government are not qualified to do, and the people are not yet educated up to such a thing. Hence, we must consider the situation as it exists, and not levy taxation in such a way as to make it unprofitable to invest or to undertake enterprises in Australia. Even a working man who wishes to start a little business on his own must have some capital, and is more or less a capitalist. The capital value of the property to which I have referred is something like  &#163;75,000,  so that, after paying taxation, the owner has a return of less than  2  per cent. The Government have authoritatively laid it down that4&#189; per cent, is a fair return for those who have capital to invest. We are prepared to allow that rate of interest on our war loan, and to exempt it from all taxation. People who invest in that loan need have no business worry or trouble of any sort. They may secure their  4&#189;  per cent, free from any of those charges which operate against the returns from ordinary business enterprises. That being so, it is fair to contend that our taxation should be so adjusted as to leave a return of, at least,  4&#189;  per cent, to the owners of property. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to think that they were, but I am sorry to say that they are not. In the case to which I have been alluding the property has been producing very high rents, but these have . lately been reduced owing to the special times in which we are living. When one has a number of empty shops or offices, it is impossible to talk of securing high rents or of increasing rentals. Taxes of the kind now proposed by the Government cannot be passed on. Those who understand the principles of land taxation regard it as an axiom that such taxation cannot be effectively passed on as long as the land tax is sufficiently high to make it unprofitable to allow land to remain idle. Our proposed income tax partakes of that character, and, in so far as it does, is good. But there is a limit beyond which we cannot go, and it is hardly fair so to levy on those who are drawing incomes as to take from them, as in this case, practically  75  per cent, of their returns. I would emphasize the point that since we have set up the standard of  4&#189;  per cent, as a fair return on capital invested, under circumstances which do away with all business worry and. trouble, we have a right to see that those who come under our taxation shall he allowed the same return from their property, instead of, as in this case, less than  2  per cent. The case to which I have referred is by no means singular. There are other aspects of the Income Tax Bill with which I shall deal later on, notably the provision relating to companies that sell large numbers of allotments or buildings in course of construction, and enter them on their books as if the transactions were complete, whereas they are made on a time-payment basis. Some provision will have to be made to meet such cases. Other general matters to which I desire to refer affect the expenditure of the money we are raising. Before dealing with these, however, I desire to support what the honorable member for Kooyong has said regarding the doubtful necessity for raising  &#163;4,000,000  by means of an income tax and for ante-dating the imposition of the tax when we need only some  &#163;2,000.000  to pay interest on the war loan. If the Prime Minister will tell us that some of the revenue to be raised from this tax is to be utilized as a sinking fund- </para>

                        <para>- If it is, it should be stated. We are told that this special tax is for the purpose of paying the interest on the war loan. As a matter of fact, it will more than doubly pay the interest, and unless it can be shown that a proportion of the taxation is to be utilized as a sinking fund, the taxation will require a good deal of justification. With regard to expenditure, I am of opinion that until we introduce into the official circles which now control the expenditure of public money, and especially into the Defence Department, some good buying ability, and some good business capacity - men who are not nurtured in red-tape - we shall wage this war at a disastrous cost. If an appeal had been made to the Chamber of Commerce or the Chamber of Manufactures to patriotically advise and supervise the purchase of certain goods for the Minister of Defence, they would, from a sense of honour, have done their best. And if they had not been actuated by that high sense of honour, the fact of a number of keen business men taking an interest in the matter would have provided us with a check one on the other. I know that goods have been paid for by the Government at prices 100 per cent, above the imported cost, despite the fact that the goods were bought on tender. If the Government had utilized the machinery which the Chamber of Commerce provides, they would have had the services of men who know at what price articles are imported. Had the Government asked the merchants to supply them at bedrock import prices, they would willingly have done so, and the country would have been saved a considerable sum of money. Unfortunately there has been too much conservatism displayed, and Ministers have relied too much on officials, who, although trained for war, have considered themselves specially endowed with business ability also, and have accepted an onerous duty, and discharged it presumably to the best of their ability. I do not question their good intentions, but their capacity for business affairs and for handling bulk lines is <inline font-style="italic">nil,</inline> and the consequence is that the tenderers put their heads together. Where they can privately make arrangements, they will get the best possible price out oi the Government, but had they been appealed to through a chamber having an official status, they would have given the Commonwealth a better deal, and the country would have been saved 100 per cent, on the goods which they have had to buy for defence purposes. Another matter is the supply of warm clothing for the troops during the coming winter. There is to-day an organization called the Sheep-skin Fund Committee, which is actuated entirely by patriotic motives, and I have been asked by those interested to suggest to the Government that they should continue the work which has been done up to date in a purely voluntary spirit, and insure that our men at the front are equipped with sheep-skin vests and basil pants, which are calculated to keep out almost any degree of cold. Samples of sheep-skin clothing are on view in the corridor. </para>

                        <para>- I am as much a commercial traveller as I am a member of Parliament; without a knowledge of business a man is hardly fit to keep an eye on the affairs of this country. As a result of the charitable effort and the ingenuity employed in the production of sheep-skin clothing, the complete outfit, comprising cap, pants, vest, and gloves, can be produced for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> and the Government might well set about utilizing the organization which has been brought into existence by these voluntary workers. The lady who has controlled this fund has put heart and soul, and a good deal of her money, into the work, and the result is that some 20,000 sheep-skin vests have been forwarded to the troops in Flanders. Members of the Committee are now anxious that the Australian boys at Gallipoli, where the weather becomes extremely cold in winter, should be similarly equipped. If these sheepskin suits can be provided at a cost of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per head by utilizing the machinery and organization now in existence at a factory which is being maintained by private people, the Government cannot do better than take up this work at once. It is not necessary to obtain an official report on it, and then, perhaps, pay twice as much for the article. That is what invariably happens in connexion with Government Departments. Whilst I do not reflect on the integrity of the Defence officers, I say that a soldier is by nature unfitted to be a business man. That fact has been demonstrated over and over again, and it is time that the Government enlisted the aid of those who have proved their commercial ability. Another proposed expenditure is the now familiar suggestion to build a Small Arms Factory at Canberra. I have sufficient data to convince the Committee of the unwisdom at this stage of incurring a wasteful expenditure in order to gratify a whim to build a mythical paradise at a cost of something like &#163;100,000, which, I estimate, will be the expenditure required to have the Factory removed from Lithgow to Canberra. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire, in the first place, to refer very briefly to a reply given by the Prime Minister to a question I asked today as to whether holders of State securities would be subject to Federal income tax, or whether prospective flotations by the States would be exempt from that taxation. The Prime Minister&#39;s reply was not definite, but he said he was bound, as the representative of the National Government, which was charged with the supreme responsibility of the defence of Australia, to guard every portion of the area of taxation open to the Federal Government. While it is true that the National Parliament is responsible for defence, and that the Commonwealth Government are charged with the obligation of providing men, munitions, and money for the conduct of the war, yet, in a very vital sense, the States co-operate in the provision of that money, because it is the production and the industries of the States that must provide it. At this juncture finance is a very vital question to every State of the Common wealth. The pressure is as severe on the States as on the Commonwealth, and it is unfortunate that it should come at a time when a disastrous drought has made the position of the States extremely critical, apart from the demands which the war is making on the resources of the Commonwealth. We must remember also that the Commonwealth has been gradually trespassing on the preserves of the States, which have been left a very small margin indeed for extra taxation for necessary administrative purposes. The first encroachment by the National Parliament was the imposition of a land tax, which- was one of the direct sources of revenue on which the States very largely relied. Very soon an increase in the tax followed, and now we have the disheartening prospect opened up by the decision of the Adelaide Conference that another dose of land taxation, up to the limit of ls. in the &#163;1, shall be administered. So that land taxation, which is one of the few sources from which the States obtained their revenue, has been pretty well exploited already by the Federal Government. The next Commonwealth impost was the probate and succession duties, and again the States were penalized. Their taxes were duplicated by a tax that is one of the most severe in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The dual tax is the highest, but the incidence of the Federal tax is exceeded only in the State of Queensland, where it reaches, I think, 17-j per cent., though as to this I cannot speak with certainty. At any rate, there is one State in which the limit is higher than in the Federal arena; and when the Federal tax is added to the tax of that State, then, as I say, the dual taxation is the highest to be found in any part of the world. </para>

                        <para>- In any one of the States the dual tax represents the severest to be found in any part of the world. Then we have recently had another increase in the Tariff, though that, of course, is hardly appropriate in this relation, because it is the reserved area of the Commonwealth. Having in view the dual form of taxation adopted hitherto, I am not sure that the Government would not have acted wisely if they had again gone to the Customs for some slight increase that would have been borne by every section of the community without distinction. </para>

                        <para>- I shall show later on that the form of taxation proposed will probably press as heavily on the relatively poor, in the indirect effect of its incidence, as would a tax through the Customs House such as I have indicated. The proposed income tax will be a severe experience for the people of Australia, reaching, as it does, to 5s. in the &#163;1 on certain incomes. I am quite of opinion that wealth ought to pay its full share, and possibly more than an even share; but if the taxation be excessive and unreasonable, it may have a reflex influence, which, if not disastrous, may prove very burdensome to the people. &#165;e cannot regard Australia as a country in which there is any very large measure of surplus wealth. As some one interjected this afternoon, it is idle1 to judge the taxing conditions here as if they were similar to those obtaining in the Old Country. Why, the whole world may almost be said to be the debtor of the people at Home. There we find an enormous amount of taxable wealth, which, however, is somewhat differently placed from the wealth in this country, inasmuch as nearly all the latter is used as the working capital of the country. We have a few rich men, though not many; but even their wealth, if not directly by themselves, is indirectly, through the banks and other financial organizations, employed in the various avenues of production. No doubt wealth has to be taxed when necessity demands it, but if the taxation be unreasonable and unjust - if it goes beyond sound principles of administration - it simply withdraws capital from those avenues of production. As wealth is thus withdrawn,, the avenues of production must shrink; and we must not forget that it is production that has to pay the cost of this war. Instead of interfering with, or putting: any impediment in the way of, production, we ought to do everything that is humanly possible to increase it. </para>

                        <para>- That is all rubbish. Some men who know mighty little about production may be of that opinion; but it is quite an erroneous one. In many cases the land tax is passed on ; indeed, it is passed on in more instances than otherwise. However, I do not wish to be drawn aside from the immediate question before us, because it is my desire to assist the Government to conclude our business by next Thursday. If the proposed income tax is not justified by existing conditions, then instead of assisting the Government in a time of financial stress, it will retard their efforts to find the wherewithal to meet the burdens that are  being placed on the community. There is another point worthy of consideration. Is. this excessive income tax to be a war tax pure and simple? The people of Australia believe this to be the case, and are, therefore, content to swallow the dose uncomplainingly in order to provide for the prosecution of the war to a victorious conclusion. If it is not purely a war tax. - and the evidences contained in the statement of the Prime Minister go to show that it is not all to he appropriated for the purposes of war - we ought to be straight and let the people know exactly how much is for war and how much for the ordinary purposes of . government. If some portion of the revenue thus raised is to he diverted to meet the ordinary expenditure of the Government, we ought at once to assure the people of the country that the pruning knife is to be applied to the public expenditure, not by starving the services, but by checking the extravagant and shocking waste due to inexperience and incapacity in the management of our public affairs. I do mot advance this contention in any &#39;spirit. of captious criticism, because it applies to all those who have had the administration in their hands from the beginning of Federation, no matter from which side of the House they have been selected. In this Parliament there are members of large administrative experience in the States, and it was to be expected that their administrative capacity would be such as to place the public Departments of this country, and the Service generally, on a sound basis. I know that this observation requires qualifying, because, up to the time that the operation of the Braddon section expired, the revenue of the National Parliament was relatively small, and when people have to handle only a small revenue they become a bit Scotch, and do not indulge in extravagance. When, however, the Braddon section ceased to operate, and the National Parliament inherited a windfall of extensive wealth, that wealth was. spent with almost unparalleled prodigality. Not only was the whole of the additional revenue spent, but, concurrently with the inheritance of the big legacy, the Government of the day cast about for revenue from taxation at a time when that step was altogether unjustifiable. The enormous influx of wealth consequent upon the handling of the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, less the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> ought to ha.ve been sufficient to finance the National Parliament without resort to direct taxation. We have had extravagant and inefficient administration, and what has struck me during the six years I have been a member is that the House has never had a proper grip or control of the finances of the country. It has been exceedingly difficult for honorable members to- analyze the public expenditure. In spite of repeated demands, we have not been afforded that detailed information regarding public expenditure which is our right. It is the right of every individual member of the House to he placed in possession of such information, for otherwise he cannot faithfully discharge his responsibilities to the people who send him here. However, there have- recently been created a Public Works Committee and a Public- Accounts Committee, and I have hoped, and I continue to hope, that an analysis of the- public accounts and the oversight of public expenditure lay one of these Committees., will place this </para>

                <para class="block">House in a position to deal with the affairs of this country as we have never hitherto been .able to deal with them. I have, outside this Parliament, particularly during the last appeal to the country, told my constituents that waste, extravagance, and inefficiency in administration in all public Departments were responsible for upwards of &#163;1,000,000 a year. That could be saved; but, taking into consideration all public expenditure, both from loan and from revenue funds, to-day I am convinced that an efficient system of administration would possibly be responsible for saving nearer &#163;2,000,000 than &#163;1,000,000. We have, for instance, the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> upon the Postal Department. It is no- revelation to me, or to many honorable members; but, nevertheless, it reveals a shocking condition of affairs, which is not to the credit of the National Parliament or the National Government. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> inexperience and- incapacity, and the lack of ordinary business principles in the administration of the Post aud Telegraph Department alone are responsible for a wastage of &#163;353,000 a year, which could be saved straight away by the adoption of more competent administration. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> indicates that a larger amount could be saved. The honorable member for Gwydir, who for a time was  chairman  of the Postal Commission, which did a large amount of laborious work, and very good service, contends that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson&#39;s</inline> report is practically, if not entirely, on the lines of the recommendations of that Commission, and that the weak spots in the Department were discovered and reported upon five years ago. Yet what was known to exist, and what was reported to be existing five years ago. and its existence has been now indorsed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> still remains. </para>

Possibly he has followed the evidence obtained by the Postal Commission!. At any rate, he indicated pretty well the extent of the improvements, and consequent economy, that should be secured, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> has laid down as desirable. </para>

                        <para>- Very likely there will be. It was the policy of the party now in Opposition when before the country to create in the Defence Department a commercial side to be charged with the business aspect as apart from the military work of the Department. There can be no more extravagant men, or no worse business men, than are to be found, as a rule, among those who&#39; wear gold lace. Taking them as a whole, they may be very fine men and very competent and efficient on the military side, but they are poor business men, and poor administrators. There are exceptions, but I am afraid we have not any of them in our Department. They are reckless in regard to expenditure. They exercise no caution or care in regard to the expenditure of public money. Last week the Prime Minister made a statement in regard to the Defence Department that was a straightout admission, not only of inefficiency, but also of something very much worse. When it was hinted that the Government should have two or three keen business men to take over the business side of the Department, the Prime Minister said that if keen business men had been at that work some patriotic people would be in gaol to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Those people ought to be in gaol, and many others who have been playing on the inefficiency of the Department in order to scoop in big and unwarranted profits. I have no time for such people, especially in the time of national disaster. But the administration of the Defence Department has been unbusiness-like from top to bottom ; otherwise many of the little games that have been practised upon it would not have been possible. The Department has been engaged in purchases running into millions of pounds sterling, but there has been little or no application of business principles in the handling of such enormous transactions, and when we find that the Government have not employed in such a gigantic business an independent Board of the most capable commercial experts that could be found in the community there is a serious reflection upon their administration. If the Department were freed from red-tape, and if purchases were submitted to a Board of independent, competent, expert men, conducted on proper lines, corruption in the matter of public supplies would be next to impossible. We have been very fortunate indeed in that the instances of looseness of administration have not been worse. The Prime Minister has said over and over again that the States must practise economy, and that people  in  their private  capacity  must do so. I say to him, &#34;Physician, heal thyself.&#34; The Federal Parliament has not even attempted to practise economy. In fact, it has gone in the opposite, direction. For a Government to bring down Estimates with large increases over what sufficed twelve months ago does not look like an effort at practising economy in a time of great calamity. It is no encouragement to the people. It will not tend to stimulate their patriotism or assist in inducing contributions to the loan. It is about time that we insisted on immediate economy. We should insist on the Government reducing their expenditure to a point not greater than the amount needed last year. We need economy in every direction, but the National Parliament ought to lead in this matter. If the States have been prodigal in their expenditure - and they have been - the National Government has been prodigal too. There is not, however, much fear as regards the States in the future, because the National Government has first call on the revenues of the country, arid the stringent necessities of the moment will demand rigid care and economy, from which escape will be impossible. We need economy in the carrying out of public works, in regard to which at the present time day labour is employed, and control is exercised, not by our experienced professional officers, but by industrial organizations outside. In a time of stress like the present, this sort of thing must and will come to an end ; it will break down of its own weight. I do not think that in connexion with any public work has there been more scandalous incompetence, inefficiency, and waste of public money than prevailed during the first year in which the East-West railway was under construction. The waste ran into fabulous sums, although evidence of it could not be obtained to-day except by an investigation nf experienced engineers into every schedule of work done. The control of the work is now under an engineer of the highest experience, capacity, and character, who won a big reputation in the State of Queensland. He was often quoted as having constructed lines in Queensland under the day labour system more cheaply than they have been constructed under other systems elsewhere in Australia, but his first report to the Government showed that those lines were constructed, not under the day labour system, bat under the small contract or butty gang system, the day labour system being used only when the others could not be resorted to. To-day this engineer is bound by the cut-and-dried policy of his Government, or, perhaps, I should say, of industrial forces outside this Parliament. We shall never get efficiency in public works expenditure until day labour estimates have to run the gantlet of public competition. It is all very well to say that work is done by certain Departments more economically under the day labour system than it could be done under the contract system, but I challenge the submission of a single instance. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that contract, if I have time. In it my honorable friend and others discovered something of a mare&#39;s nest, and the fact that the present Minister of Home Affairs paid <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith the full amount of his account without any deduction is conclusive proof that his work was satisfactory. The honorable member and some others are beginning to learn the truth in these matters. The estimates of public Departments cannot be accepted until they have run the gantlet of competition with those of public tenderers. Public competition is the only protection that the taxpayers have, and it is about time that they were considered. About twelve months ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Timms offered to complete the East-West railway for the sum of &#163;2,000,000, trains to be running over the line within two years of the date of the signing of the contract. The offer was declined by the Government - I believe on the advice of the Engineer-in-Chief, who had to follow the policy of the Government, and resist the contract system in favour of the day labour system. The reasons given by the Engineer-in-Chief for the rejection of the offer have been published in the newspapers, and his report has been laid on the table. It was only recently that I could secure a reply from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms.</inline> I am not here as his apologist, nor as the apologist of any contractor, but I have persistently advocated the submission of day labour estimates in competition with public tenders. If day labour estimates are lower than public tenders, and work can be done more cheaply by day labour than by contract, by all means adopt day labour; but every new proposal should be tested by calling for public tenders, otherwise the taxpayers&#39; interests are not properly considered. The following statement has been prepared by the quantity surveyor employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Timms, with the latter&#39;s authority: - </para>

To maintain the necessary speed the strongest road possible would be necessary. An unballasted line would not permit of a speed of more than 15 miles an hour. </para>

                    <para>As the quantity of ballast required would be approximately 2,800,000 cubic yards, the cost of this must be added to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell&#39;s</inline> estimate of &#163;830,000, admitting, for the sake of argument only, that such estimate is a fair one. The cost of this ballast placed in position would be not less than 7s. per cubic yard, or an additional cost to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bull&#39;s</inline> estimate of &#163;080,000, making the total cost of work usually let by contract, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> &#163;1,810,000. </para>
                    <para>That the estimate of &#163;830,000 is quite unreliable is proved by the fact that, in his deductions from the total costs for work other than usually let by contract, he includes rolling-stock, &#163;350,000. This evidently includes plant required both of a permanent and temporary character. It will be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms&#39;</inline> offer includes the purchase of plant required for construction purposes at a valuation which would at least amount to &#163;50,000. Again, on materials for bridges and culverts, &#163;21,000 is deducted. Such expenditure is invariably borne by the contractor, and is provided for by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms.</inline> Miscellaneous, &#163;11,953, may mean anything or nothing. If it means unforeseen contingencies, it is, of course, the business of the contractor to provide for it, and it was taken into consideration in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms&#39;</inline> figures. </para>
                    <para>Water supply accounts for &#163;456,000. The contractor would, of course, have to provide for his own water supply, as did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith on his contract, and, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms</inline> would have to provide a certain amount on the same account- knowing that the departmental methods of making provision for permanent supplies would be quite unreliable for construction purposes - as no attempt has been made to construct dams until the head of the road has passed the sources of supply, instead of being constructed ahead of the work. </para>
                    <para>It may, therefore, be assumed that, even if the work usually let by contract, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> amounted to &#163;830,000, exclusive of ballasting, then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms&#39;</inline> estimate of &#163;2,000,000 for the completed road was, apparently, a correct one; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> can carry out the whole of this work at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms&#39;</inline> figure, he will have to be credited with equal executive and administrative ability. Whatever the line may cost above that sum will represent the loss to the country by the day-labour policy of construction. The line should now be sufficiently advanced for an approximately correct estimate to be made. </para>

                    <para>.- May I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Wakefield as to the value of the report presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McC.</inline> Anderson on postal -matters, though I regret that his report suggests no way of putting the house in order. In addition to this report, however, the Government have now before them the report of the Postal Commission presented some years ago, and also much criticism of the Post Office, and I hope that now they will make some serious effort to put the Department into a state of efficiency, and to save the enormous waste that has been going on from year to year. Up to a few years ago an item was placed on the Estimatesfor the purpose of encouraging inventions or suggestions that might improve the working of the Post Office, and I regret that that item no longer appears, notwithstanding that, during the whole of my parliamentary experience, not more than &#163;4 was expended out of that vote in any one year. A big Department like the Post Office, employing many thousands of hands, must possess brains worth more than &#163;4 a year, and I hope the Postmaster-General will reinstate the item to which I refer, and give more encouragement to the rank and file to make suggestions for improving the Department&#39;s efficiency. . I do not complain of the ability shown by the men at the head of the Post Office, yet they do not know everything. They do not constitute the whole of the brains of the Department, and there must be many minor matters coming under the notice of the men in the ranks capable of considering improvements. </para>

                        <para>- All I know is that boxes used to be placed in the various general post-offices for the purpose of receiving suggestions, which it was understood were to go direct to the fountainhead. Had I the time, I could point out where many suggestions for improvements made by subordinate officers have never seen the light of day because of the action of higher officials. I desire, also, to enter a most emphatic protest against the action of the Department of Home Affairs&#39; and the Government in applying the system of preference to unionists to the Electoral Department. The Government claim to have received a mandate from the people in favour of preference to unionists in Government employment generally; but I&#39; do not think that any one, even In his wildest stretch of imagination, ever thought that this preference would be extended to the Electoral Department. We. have always prided ourselves upon the thought that our elections have been carried out on proper lines, and by nonpartisan officials. During our investigations, into electoral matters, I came to the conclusion that the electoral officers did their best to carry out the elections impartially. </para>

                        <para>- In answer to a question some time ago, the Minister of Home Affairs told me that preference to unionists would be adopted in the appointment of temporary officers in the Electoral Department, who constitute 90 per cent, of all the employees in the Department. Temporary appointments, where they can be avoided, in any Department are always a mistake, but particularly are they a mistake in connexion with the Electoral Department. A good deal of the trouble and the chaos that has existed in the past has been the result of temporary employment, and I hope the Government will, as far as is possible, officer the Electoral Department with permanent men who will be able to operate the Department upon a system preferable to that which has hitherto prevailed. If, however, the system of granting preference to unionists is to be applied to this Department, the Government may, in the very near future, find itself charged- with having introduced the &#34; Tammany &#34; system, which has been most reprehensible in its effects elsewhere, to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am relying upon the information given by the Minister of Home Affairs, who told me that in future all appointments would be made on the basis of preference to unionists. I hope that before long the recommendation of the Commission on electoral matters will be carried out, and that, as far as possible, the administration of the Electoral Department will be removed from Ministerial control. Another Department that I think should be removed from Ministerial control is that of the Commonwealth Statistician. Notwithstanding the confidence I have in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> as a  good, strong, reliable Statistician, I am very much afraid that the Government have at times directed him to make returns according to order. This Parliament is indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> for the very valuable works that he has put before us from time to time, and I should like always to be able to think, as I do now, that those works are reliable, and that there has been no interference by the Government with their compilation. We shall feel more secure in this respect if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> is entirely freed from Ministerial control. I was much interested in the reference made by the honorable member for Robertson to the horses now under the control of the Defence Department at Maribyrnong. I do not agree with all that he had to say with regard to them. They certainly would stand a little weeding out, but, on the whole, they are a very fine lot. The honorable member referred to the dual control exercised with regard to defence works. The fence, as described by him, was certainly a menace to the safety of thousands of horses at Maribynong, and I heard an officer say that he had to obtain permission from the Department of Home Affairs before he could do anything with it. If the Department of Home Affairs stands in the way in such a matter, it should get a move on, and take care that public property is not jeopardized by its indifference to the wants of the Defence Department. I propose to make a brief reference to the taxation proposals of the Government. By rigid economy, we might avoid any further taxation at the present time. The income tax, as proposed by the Government, in my opinion, is not justified; but, even if it is, the people of Australia, who will be called upon to pay it, and who, believing it to be a war tax, will cheerfully do so, are entitled to the assurance that strict economy is being observed, and that the expenditure of the money so raised will be strictly supervised. I am inclined to think that the income tax is not a war impost, but simply a tax to square the ledger, and that, apart altogether from the war expenditure, the ordinary expenditure of the Government will swallow up the whole of it, as well as the return from other taxation which has been foreshadowed. By the exercise of economy, a saving of millions could be effected. Let me refer to one or two items: The referenda, which will probably cost about &#163;150,000, could very well stand over for a little while. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. Most of our general elections cost up to &#163;100,000, although no pamphlet or literature of any kind is circulated in connexion with them by the Government. The issuing of this pamphlet might very well be dispensed with. The people of Australia to-day, if they care to give any consideration at all to the referenda questions, are probably as conversant with them as they will choose to be before they vote. The public mind of Australia today, however, is not in a fit state to consider such questions. The people have quite enough to read and think over in these troublesome times without being asked to wade through a lot of arguments regarding the referenda proposals. </para>

That suggestion was that the States should be asked to concede to the Commonwealth Parliament powers that would enable it, during the war, to control food supplies and the necessaries of life generally. </para>

                        <para>- In time of war we have to do many things which we would not otherwise do. I admit that the public are being fleeced by middlemen and others, while the Government are standing by and doing nothing. My suggestion was a short cut to the absolute control of food supplies and the necessaries of life by the Commonwealth Parliament. The Government, however, had pinned their faith to the referenda proposals, and said they would have them or nothing. By the time that they are passed, and Bills under them are submitted to this Parliament, I hope that the war will have ended. The people, at all events, will have been bled severely owing to the inactivity of the Government and the do-nothing policy which has been characteristic of them during the last twelve months. Quite a number of charges have been made against middlemen. The honorable member for Illawarra recently said that they were exploiting the public, and I think there is a good deal of force in that statement. It is idle, however, to complain unless we do something, and I charge the Government with having done nothing to prevent the exploitation of the people during the last twelve months. At the same time, I do not charge them with having failed to attempt to do anything. When they have made such an attempt they have gone to the very people whom they have been blackguarding for the last twenty years. When they wanted money they went to the banking institutions and obtained from them a loan of &#163;10,000,000 without interest: That was a very good deal. They went to the very institutions which for the last twenty years, to my knowledge, they have described as bloodsuckers. They appealed to them to help them out of their difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I said they had attempted to do something, but had absolutely failed. In this instance they went to the banks and induced them to do what was wanted. When- they made a deal in sugar they asked that &#34; hydraheaded monster,&#34; the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, to transact the whole business for them. They have told us that no money is needed ; that the Government have handed the whole thing over to the company, and are merely directing the business. I venture to say that before the sugar question is settled the Attorney-General will wish he had never heard of it, and that the public of Australia will rise in rebellion against what has been done by this Labour Government. Then, again, when they proposed to do something with regard to the shipment of wheat they went to the Shipping Combine - one of the most powerful rings in the world. </para>

                        <para>- I am thankful to them for their assistance, and to the press of Australia, particularly the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier,</inline> which helped us nobly in the fight against the combine. But for their assistance we should not have won through. I headed the movement, and was nobly assisted by those who were interested. The dairymen of Australia today are reaping the benefit. Their freights cannot be raised - no matter what combine may operate - until the expiration of the present mail contract. I come now to the manufacture of munitions. Although we have been at war for over twelve months, we have not produced a shell or a gun other than the rifles turned out by the Small Arms Factory. Private enterprise has been mobilized for six months- </para>

                        <para>- The construction of that Factory would occupy eighteen months, but there are private factories at the disposal of the Government at which the manufacture of small arms could be commenced to-morrow, if the Government so chose. One firm in Ipswich offered to put its factory at the disposal of the Government free of cost for the term of the war. It is only a small establishment, which would employ perhaps 100 or 200 men, but something could be produced there which would be helpful in the prosecution of the war. We must bear in mind, the remarks made recently by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> French that the war has now resolved itself into a contest between Krupp&#39;s and Birmingham, and if the Allies are to succeed, we must help to do the work df Birmingham. We should be producing half a million pounds worth of munitions* per month in Australia, and we could do that if the Government would give private enterprise a lead in this matter. We have not a gun or a shell with which to defend ourselves if Australia were attacked, and the time has arrived when this matter must be tackled in earnest. So far, the Navy has been a very sure defence, but raids may be made on Australia, and we have not even a pop-gun with which to keep the enemy off. The whole of the Defence Department needs an overhaul. We ask men to go to the front and fight for the Empire for a miserable amount of 6s. per day. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to admit that the Australian troops are the best paid in the world, but if we ask men to fit up transports for the conveyance of troops to the front, they insist on receiving 12s. per day, and a very handsome price for overtime. We are fighting against a well organized nation, whose soldiers fight in the ranks, or work in the factories for ls. 8d. per day. If men in Germany do not prove suitable in the factory they are sent to the front; their permission is not asked. There should be more adequate control over defence matters, while the Empire is in danger. When we see the Minister going cap in hand to the trade unions, and asking their permission to fit up transports, and when we know that, because the Minister would not fall in with the demands of the unions, troops were delayed in Melbourne for six weeks at the cost of the country, and probably with great loss of life amongst the others at the battle front, we have proof that something is radically wrong. The authorities should have power to instruct the workers to fit up transports. The time has arrived when we should have conscription. </para>

I did so a few nights ago at Fitzroy, where another honorable member advocated a different policy, and I was cheered to the echo. Under the present system the best manhood of the country is being sacrificed, and the Government are being involved in enormous expense because they have not the power to act. </para>

                        <para>- We require conscription not only in regard to men, but also in regard to munitions, and in order to enable us to organize our industrial forces. Another point which I wish to make is that no compensation is provided for dependant&#39;s of the brave boys who are shot unless they make claims as paupers. The soldier dies, and is forgotten, but if a man is killed in any other occupation in Australia, his relatives are able to claim compensation under one or other of our statutes. </para>

                        <para>- And the Government are playing into the hands of the money lenders by the terms they are offering for the war loan. They have raised the price of money 1 per cent., and if one asks for gold an extra 1 per cent, is charged. I propose now to call attention to a few leakages in the Defence Department as a result of the policy of the Government or the ineptitude of the officers responsible for the administration of Defence affairs. When I spoke of the Enoggera bread contract previously, I was not able to state the whole of the facts, and the Minister very carefully sidestepped me by saying that he had let the contract to a certain contractor because he employed unionists. I am now able, by means of information taken from the departmental file, to prove my case up to the hilt in regard to the gross political influence brought to bear on the Minister and the enormous extra cost which t the letting of this contract has entailed. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen from the -vouchers that four days&#39; supply was paid for before the contract was completed. The Minister was parleying in order to get the contract reduced to 14s. 6d., but he accepted it at 15s., and actually paid for bread at 16s., four days&#39; supply, previous to the contract being approved by him on 4th February. This bread was paid for by cheque on 6th March. The fact that this man was apparently overpaid for bread which he did not supply lends colour to the other charges I suggested when putting a question to the Minister, that there were short weights. I believe I am credibly informed that 850 lbs. to 870 lbs. were supplied by Shead, who was credited with 1,000 lbs.; but when the responsible officer was approached on the matter, he said he had no time to deal with it, and asked his informant to put it into writing, so that it could be investigated. There is another way in which the Department has been &#34; bested &#34; by this contractor.  His  payments were based on the price of flour, and, in evidence given before the State Royal Commission on the Supply and Distribution of Wheat and Flour, at a sitting in Brisbane, it was shown that Shead had contracted for 376 tons of flour in February, and he asked the Commission that the pricecpaid should not be published, but he did not take the necessary precaution to close the mouths of other witnesses, so the manager of - the firm which had supplied the flour gave evidence to the effect that the contract was at 13s. 9d. per cwt., or &#163;13 15s. per ton, for the 376 tons to provide for the contract with the Defence Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shead,</inline> however, included in his vouchers invoices for a few tons of flour which he had purchased at &#163;17 10s., and the Department paid him on the basis of &#163;17 10s. for flour which he really had bought for &#163;13 15s. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister, after calling for tenders for bread for the troops, made an inquiry in regard to one contractor, but he went to the  president  and secretary of the Operative Bakers Union for his information. Those men are employed by Shead, who was the other tenderer, and consequently the Minister got his information about one contractor from the other, and it is only natural to suppose that a competing firm would not &#34;boost&#34; up the other fellow. The Minister, therefore, was guided in his action with regard to this contract by information which he received from a competitor, and the Minister gave Shead an immediate preference of 2s. 9d. per 100 lbs., with a prospective preference of 5s. 8d. The vouchers showed that this preference amounted to &#163;635 up to the 15th April. This might appear a trivial matter to some honorable members on the Ministerial side, but when we are about to inflict on the public of Australia an additional burden of &#163;4,000,000 in taxation, surely we cannot afford to fritter money away in any direction by giving &#163;1,300 or &#163;1,500 to a man simply because he is a unionist, and in order to bolster up the pet ideals of a political party. The documents show that, up to the 15th April, this contractor was paid &#163;635 more than the figure at which the other people tendered, and from that date to the end of the contract the price was increased from 16s. to 18s., at least, and probably more than that, for I have not seen late documents. It is quite certain, at least, that he was overpaid to the extent of &#163;1,270, and it is quite reasonable to suppose that he was actually overpaid &#163;1 , 500 for his five months&#39; contract compared with the price given by the Automatic people. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. This only shows that the Government were ashamed at what had been done, or that they had not made proper inquiries in the first place with regard to the other tenderer, because if the Automatic people are good enough to get the contract now, they were surely good enough to have been given the contract five months ago. There has been no change in the situation. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, whether the letter was addressed to him or not, the honorable member was acquainted with the facts before he read it. He knew that Millard was employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shead,</inline> and Millard&#39;s signature, as  president  of the Bakers Union, is discounted considerably by the fact that Millard was in the employment of the firm most interested in the contract. If this were the only contract in which there was a leakage, one could pass it over with the remark that the Government were &#34;got at &#34; by their supporters, and influenced to do something which was wrong, and of which they have repented, and for which they have tried to make amends since; but there are other contracts just as important which have not come to light. I maintain that an inquiry into the Defence Department would appal Australia in respect to the waste, extravagance, and leakages that are going on. On a previous occasion in this Chamber I referred to the fact that an additional price of 3s. 6d. per pair was being paid for the manufacture of trousers, but that charge was not investigated, though I was prepared to stand by the statement I made. When the war broke out, the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Kanowna</inline> was chartered to proceed to Rabaul and some of the islands, and there was the stipulation in the contract that all provisions that were not consumed were to be taken over by the contractor on the return of the boat; but when the boat got back to Thursday Island many tons of foodstuffs were jettisoned, and again outside Moreton Bay they threw the rest overboard. </para>

                        <para>- It shows that there was corruption somewhere, and that these things should be probed to the bottom. In another case the Government paid the contractor &#163;500 in order to cancel a contract. I am quite prepared to discuss these matters with the Minister, or to prove what I have said, should a proper and impartial inquiry be held; but there have been so many faked answers given to the charges of honorable members by those who are responsible that one hesitates to give names, unless he is assured that there will be a thorough inquiry into the matter which is brought forward. Whenever full inquiry has been made the Defence Department has come out very badly. There is a state of chaos in the Department. In Brisbane, in June last, the officers were unable to close their accounts, and were obliged to obtain the assistance of men from the State Government in order to balance their books on the 24th June and send their returns to Head-Quarters. The trouble in the Defence Department is that men who do not understand clerical work are given this kind of work to do. They are probably well-trained military men, but in the management of business affairs they are absolutely wanting. One other matter to which I wish to refer is the question of ascertaining the exact number of unemployed in Australia. I can hardly realize that the Commonwealth is in the bad plight that some honorable members on the Ministerial side would have us believe exists. With 100,000 men taken from the labour market is it possible that there . are so many people unemployed ? I would be sorry to learn that it is. I would be sorry to put any impediment in the way of these unemployed receiving help from the Government or from philanthropic individuals. </para>

                        <para>- About ten weeks ago the Minister of Trade and Customs gave to the press certain information that led the public of Victoria to believe that he had done something which was going to considerably reduce the price of meat to local consumers. He made his first mistake in giving publicity to the statement that he had done something to cheapen meat, which, up to the present time, the public have not realized. He obtained a lot of kudos out of the announcement, but, unfortunately, the public got no meat, and that, after all, appears to be the one thing which they are looking for. I understand that they are about to get 40 tons of boneless shins, a lot of cast-off stuff in Queensland, but that will find its way to the public, if it does at all, in the shape of sausages, so that the local demand for meat has not been met. I ask the Minister, if he is able to justify his attitude, if he was in earnest about giving to the public of Victoria cheap meat, inasmuch as he did not acquaint himself with the position of the meat trade in this State before he started. I am given to understand that certain exporting firms in &#39;Victoria had in cold storage 35,000 or 40,000 carcasses of lamb, which they were not able to export. They were exporters only, not dealing with the local trade, and the Minister took no steps to release that meat to the public in this State.  His  answer to the honorable member for Wannon today clearly proves that he was not aware of the state of the meat trade here when he made the arrangement which he explained. He made an arrangement with the Queensland Government, who were a party to this deal, to violate the spirit, as well as the letter, of the Federal Constitution by prohibiting Inter-State trade in meat supplies. </para>

                    <para class="block">The original provision of the Constitution was amended in 1906, the amendment being necessary to enable the election of senators to take place at periods convenient for the election of members to serve in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, where the amendment was proposed, the subject was discussed at some length, and from many standpoints; but in this Chamber the discussion was short, its report occupying only four or five pages of <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline> The honorable member for Darling Downs had charge of the Bill. In his speech in support of it, vol. xxxiv., page 5046, of the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates,</inline> he dealt merely with the broad principles involved ; and &#39; the present Leader of the Opposition briefly gave his reasons for approving the proposal. The amendment, which was duly approved by the electors, served its purpose until the simultaneous dissolution of both Chambers last year. This has thrown the machinery provided for the simultaneous election of both Houses of the Parliament out of gear. The House of Representatives is elected to serve for a period of three years, though it has never yet sat for its full term ; and last Parliament was so brief that in the retrospect it seems almost a dream. This Parliament will expire by effluxion of time on the 8th October, 1917, but, under the Constitution, one-half of the members of the Senate must present themselves for re-election on &#187; date which will enable the new Senate to assemble on the 1st July, 1917. Therefore, the elections of senators and members of the House of Representatives, if they took place simultaneously, would have to be held in April or May, 1917. As that is not what the people expect, nor in accordance with the Constitution, it is proposed to extend the term of office of those senators who, as the law stands, must present themselves for  election after three years, for two months. That will enable elections for both Chambers to be held after the House of Representatives has been in existence for nearly three years. If the dissolution of Parliament came by effluxion of time, the elections would have to be held at such a date as would enable the return of the writs to be made within 120 days from their issue, which, allowing for the requirements and practice of the electoral law, would be towards the end of September, 1917. </para>

It will not do anything for this House of Representatives,but will permit the election of both Houses to take place at the end of September, 1917. This Bill, if agreed to, will enable this House to sit for nearly its full tenure of three years from the date of its meeting. </para>

                    <para class="block">I say that that is still the desire, not only of this House, but of the country. It is too much altogether to ask the House of Representatives always to sacrifice from six to eight months of its existence. The present honorable member for Kooyong emphasized this with great force when the proposed amendment introduced by his Government was before the Senate. I repeat that this Bill will not extend the legislative life of this Parliament by a day. But, for the first time, it will enable the triennial principle to operate. It will enable Parliament to live not quite, but very nearly, its full term. This, it has never yet been able to do. The Parliament of 1906 lived for two years and six months. In the last Parliament we had a short and feverish career of about fourteen months. </para>

                            <para>- I want to say that, in my opinion, this Bill represents such an amendment of the Constitution as ought to be made. It is on all fours with the amendment introduced by the Deakin Government, of which the honorable members for Darling Downs and Kooyong were members. That amendment of the Constitution would have served the purpose of this Parliament very well had it not been for the double dissolution of both Houses last year. Because of that double dissolution, it is necessary to amend the Constitution again. This Bill will serve the purpose of fixing the elections for both Houses simultaneously at all times, except in the case of a penal dissolution of the House of Representatives. It may be said that, technically, we have no power to fix the date for an election of the Senate; but in practice we have, and it will not be disputed. I ask the House to accept the Bill without unnecessary debate. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not pretend to enter into the merits of this question. I have not had time to look up the debate in connexion with the previous effort to rectify these undoubted anomalies: but my recollection of the measure then introduced is that it did not, as this Bill does, permanently add to the life of the Senate. That is the great distinction between the former Bill and that now under consideration. So that it cannot be said that the two measures are on all-fours. By merely shifting the dates this Bill provides for a continual progression. </para>

                            <para>- But there are, apparently, to be no more sacrifices. Under this Bill, the sacrifices are done with, and henceforth the term &#34; privilege &#34; is to be substituted for &#34; sacrifice.&#34; I shall not argue that point. Everything should be done to make the elections run simultaneously. That is a principle that should be adhered to as far as possible; but whether we should permanently add to the life of the Senate in order to do that is another question. We have before us the alternative of extending the life of the Senate, or of shortening the life of this House, in order to make their terms synchronize. This is not a perfect proposal from any point of. view. Any proposal which throws the general elections* into December may be seriously criticised, having regard to the interests of the people of Australia; and any proposal throwing a subsequent election into February is equally inappropriate, particularly as that is the time of the monsoonal rains in Queensland and some parts of <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I think we might get as accurate knowledge of the country without having to swim our way to that knowledge. This, however, is one of the natural consequences of the progressive dates such as those arranged for in the Attorney-General&#39;s proposal. . I do not intend to debate the merits of this proposal. In ordinary times any attempt to make the elections synchronize as far as possible should receive the earnest and favorable consideration of the House ; but our position is that, at this period, we are against referenda, lock, stock, and barrel. Therefore, the attitude of members of the Opposition is quite clear. We are against this referendum proposal just as we are1 against other referenda proposals being submitted at the present time. </para>

                        <para>.- The framers of the Constitution, whilst doing their best to make a clear definition of what the term of Parliament should be, failed in their purpose, because they made the life of the Senate date back instead of forward. Consequently, from time to time Parliament has had to alter the Constitution for the purpose of bringing it into line with its real intention, which was that the House of Representatives should continue for three years. No Parliament with which I have been connected has had a life of three years, excepting after an amendment of the Constitution to secure the same. The framers of the Constitution did not claim perfection, otherwise they would not have provided for a means of amendment; but since they have provided a means of amending the Constitution where it is ineffective, it is the natural corollary of such provision that Parliament should have sufficient courage to exercise the power so as to bring the Constitution into accord with what its framers had in view. Had the honorable member for Darling Downs, when Minister of Home Affairs, recognised that, he could have done what we are now trying to do, when he framed the original amendment - he could have brought the lives of both Houses into line. Instead of doing this, he merely introduced an amendment dealing with the then prevailing conditions. The reason we are in our present position is that the honorable member for Darling Downs did not realize the limitations of his amendment. Now we are asking for constitutional authority to extend the life of this Parliament to the term provided for in the Constitution. No man can object to that; but, as the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition points out, there will be difficulties in the application of this amendment. It is not sufficiently elastic. It will not give Parliament power to fix its elections to take place at times convenient to everybody. Under this proposal each election will take place two months later in the year than the previous election. </para>

Had the House the courage to do the right thing, it could so arrange matters that the elections would always take place in May, a season of the year that would be universally suitable; but, owing to the desire of members of the Opposition to make capital out of what is a necessity, this course, apparently, will not be pursued. Because honorable members opposite feel it incumbent upon them to oppose the other referenda proposals, they look upon this little amendment as another to be butchered upon all the platforms of the country. If the public understood what was required - if members of the Opposition would develop an inclination to tell the people what was right - there would be no hesitation about such an amendment as I have suggested, which would be both effective and advantageous to both House and country. Since that cannot be, on account of the attitude of members of the Opposition, who are trying to make political capital out of the contemplated referenda proposals, we have to do the best we can. </para>

                        <para>. - The Attorney-General was not quite correct when he stated that this Bill proposed to do substantially what was done by the House when it made the original alteration in the Constitution in 1907. The object of that alteration was simply to enable the general elections to take place in April or May, and it merely extended the term for six months for one period only to enable that object to be achieved. This is quite a different alteration, because, if it is carried, the term of senators, after the first six years are over, and if there is no double dissolution, will be permanently fixed at six years and four months. The life of the House of Representatives will, therefore, be nearer the full three years. That is, we shall be able to have the full three years from the date of our first meeting, and, instead of having to be dissolved, the House will possibly be able to expire by effluxion of time. </para>

                        <para>.- I cordially support the Bill. All this difficulty has been brought about by the double dissolution of last year. When it took place everybody knew that this difficulty would arise, and this Bill seems the easiest way out of it. This is supposed to be a triennial Parliament, but, with the exception of the third Parliament, we have  never sat three years. The third Parliament ran out by effluxion of time, by reason of the last amendment made in the Constitution regarding the Senate elections. </para>

                            <para>- That may be; but I do not want to follow the example of the States in anything, and certainly not in the length of the life of Parliament. We have always sacrificed the life of this House to bring the two elections together, and senators have never been sacrificed, but I see no reason why we should sacrifice the life of the House of Representatives. So far as the present House is concerned, in order to make its life fit in with the next election for the Senate, we should have to submit to a bigger sacrifice than has yet been made. We should have, practically to cut off nearly six months of its life. This House will not expire by effluxion of time until 8th October, but it would have to be dissolved in April in order to bring about an election simultaneously with an election of senators before the 30th June, 1917. I do not think we are called upon to do that. I fail to understand why the sacrifice should always be on the part of this House. All that it is now proposed to do is to extend the life of the Senate in order to give this House an opportunity to run its full term of three years as fixed by the people of Australia when they adopted the Constitution. It is perfectly true that, as the result of this alteration, our elections, instead of taking place at one fixed period of the year, will vary from time to time. It may be said that it will mean an election during the summer months, but in course of time we shall also get into the winter. I do not know that any particular period may be described as good, from a weather point of view, for the holding of an election. We may have a moderate summer, or, as we had last year, an exceptionally moderate winter. I should have been sorry to contest an election in my electorate last year if we had had anything like an ordinary wet winter. It seems to me useless, therefore, to suggest that any particular period of the year may be fixed upon as the most suitable, from a weather point of view, for election purposes. The monotony of holding our elections at a fixed period will be done away with, and there will probably be, on each occasion, an extension of two months. The Bill means that the Senate will be continued for a further period of four months. That extension is not material. It will not actually mean an extension of the life of the Parliament, for the elections will take place, as in the past, before senators&#39; term of office has expired. I think the proposal should be adopted as the best means of overcoming the difficulty, and of giving this House its full life of three years. I can understand the position of the Opposition. I do not think they object to this proposal, but they are opposed to the referendum on the Constitution Alteration Bills, and they realize that they would place themselves in a difficulty if they approved of this Bill, since they would have to justify the taking of a referendum next December. It seems to me, however, that they might very well say, &#34; While we do not believe in the proposal to take the referenda at the present time, it is absolutely necessary that this change should be made, and a referendum is justifiable in order that it may be carried into effect.&#34; As it is, they show a little want of courage; they are afraid that if they approved of this Bill they would be twitted with having justified the expense of a referendum at the present time. No party feeling would be created by a referendum on this question, and I think that the House should approve of the Bill in order that the people may be able to express an opinion on the subject. </para>

                        <para>.- The objection that I have to offer to the Bill is that raised by the honorable member for Darling Downs. At the present time, the Ministry of the day can always fix the dissolution of the House of Representatives for a date that on the whole is best likely to secure a representative vote; but this continuous pushing forward of the time of the Senate elections would take away that discretion from the Executive. </para>

                            <para>- Senators who were elected at the top of the poll at the last election will have six years and four months of office, and that means that under this Bill an election will have to be held in the month of February. In respect of the next batch, four months would have to be added, and that would bring the date of election to May. The House of Representatives would have to be dissolved, so that the election for it would fit in with that for the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the Attorney-General&#39;s reasoning on that point. The only objection to the Bills is that, in order to have the elections for the Senate at the same time as the elections for the House of Representatives, the House of Representatives must be dissolved at different periods, so that it will be impossible to fix the elections for a date that might best suit farmers and agriculturists generally. Under this Bill, the elections in some years will take place at most inconvenient periods. The only way to get over that difficulty would be to make such an alteration of the Constitution as, after a time, would bring us back to the state of affairs which prevailed before the last dissolution. If that were done, and the seats of senators became vacant as from 1st July, the electoral machinery would very seldom be thrown out of gear, because I do not think there are going to be many double dissolutions. </para>

                            <para>- Having tried it once, with the result, as the Attorney-General has said, that we had a very short, but feverish, session, I do not think double dissolutions are likely to be of such frequency as to make it worth while to alter the Constitution in this way. I do not consider that the proposed alteration is called for. All that is necessary is to make such an alteration as would push forward the election for the Senate to the middle of the year, as was the case before the last dissolution. </para>

                        <para>.- Apart from the fact that this is a most inopportune time for taking a referendum, it seems to me that the arrangement for which the Bill provides is a most clumsy one. Under it, the first election for the </para>

It seems to me that the elections would be a movable feast, and that the House of Representatives would be kept dancing attendance upon the Senate in the desire that its elections should take place simultaneously with those for another place. The Attorney-General might have found a more convenient way of overcoming the difficulty. The arrangement embodied in the Bill is awkward, but the responsibility must rest with the Government. I am opposed altogether to the referenda being taken at the present time. The Opposition have already expressed their opinions on that subject. We have spoken and acted in the strongest possible way, feeling that in doing so we are not only giving expression to our own views, but that we have the people of the country with us. Opposed as I am <inline font-style="italic">bo</inline> the referenda proposals being submitted at the present time, I would like to do all that 1 can to prevent them being accepted by the electors, and shall, therefore, vote against the Bill. At the same time, I think that the object which the Government have in view might have been attained in a much simpler way and without the necessity of always compelling members of this Chamber to reduce the term for which they have been elected, in order to make their period of service expire coincidentally with that of senators. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sorry that my honorable friends opposite did not support a proposal which was put forward by me in this Chamber some time ago. In my opinion,- it would have operated far more satisfactorily than will this amendment. I would like to direct the attention of the Attorney-General to the fact that the framers of our Constitution decided that the term of senators should extend over six years - just double that of the period for which honorable members of this House are elected. Now, the States have the control of the election of senators, and through their Executives. they may decide that honorable senators shall retain their seats for their full term, which, under this Bill, will be six years and four months. The House of Representatives, I repeat, is elected for only three years, In these circumstances, it will be possible for the State Executives - if they are not in accord with the Federal authorities - to say, &#34;We will not allow our senators to go to election until the expiration of their full term.&#34; What is to happen during the interregnum? One of my complaints against the system in vogue is that the general public are under the impression that their representatives in this Parliament receive &#163;600 per annum. As a matter of fact they do not, because, at each election, just when they most require the money, they are deprived of several weeks of their parliamentary allowance. I would like to know whether the Attorney-General has thought of this matter - whether it has occurred to him that the members of this Chamber may be compelled to await re-election until the full period for which senators will be elected has expired? In my opinion, this trouble might have been overcome but for those illiberal members who belong to the Suicide Club - that club which brought about the double dissolution. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the point raised by the honorable member is covered by what I said upon the motion for the second reading of this Bill. Although theoretically the States have a right to fix the date for the Senate elections subject to the term for which senators are elected, as a matter of practice we have fixed the date, and shall continue to do so. The two months interregnum of which the honorable member spoke is absorbed by the elections. </para>

                    <para>.- The outstanding point which has been demonstrated in this debate is that, in the temporary Estimates of Expenditure for the year, there is no evidence whatever that the Government propose to economize. Honorable members have only to turn to the Treasurer&#39;s figures to see that, notwithstanding the fact that the Government propose to raise &#163;4,000,000 of additional taxation, they propose to spend the whole of that sum on the ordinary services for the year. Moreover, the revenue will not be within &#163;750,000 of the expenditure on the ordinary services. During the life of this Parliament, we have imposed increased land taxation, and new probate duties, and the Government now propose to raise &#163;4,000,000 by means of an income tax; but the fact is outstanding that the proposed expenditure on annual services will swallow up the whole of that extra taxation, and the Government propose to spend &#163;750,000 in addition. I shall defer my further remarks on this subject until the Income Tax Bill is again before the House. I desire to refer again to the subject of nurses&#39; outfits, and to tell the Government what I believe has been proceeding, and is, to a great extent, continuing now. In the absence of the Minister for the Navy, I ask the Minister representing the Government to have a thorough investigation made, not by the officers of the Defence Department, who have been responsible for what has taken place, but by some outside authority; and if what I believe to be true is found to be so, those responsible should be immediately sent about their business. I believe that in the answers which have been furnished to the Minister in connexion with questions asked in this House, the Minister has been deliberately misled. The actual facts have been hidden from him, and a system has been in progress which has not only prevented the Minister from finding out really what was taking place, but has necessitated nurses leaving for the front paying for their equipment infinitely more than was necessary. When I brought this matter forward a little time ago, the Minister did make some inquiries, the immediate effect of which was that he added &#163;6 to the amount which was allowed to the nurses for the purchase of their equipment. He also sent  Colonel Fetherston  to Sydney to inquire as to who was responsible for issuing the circular which was sent to the nurses. I venture to say, with all due respect, that the one person who, in all probability, would never find out who had issued the circular, was  Colonel Fetherston.  Some time ago, a question was asked in another place as to how the original allowance of &#163;15 was made up, and the answer given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was that an officer had estimated, after inquiry, that the cost of the outfit would be about &#163;15, made up as follows : - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="078331191508264_39_0.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para class="block">That was the answer put into the mouth of the Minister. When I made inquiries about the list, I ascertained two things: First, that the list did not comprise one-third of the things which the Department was asking the nurses to provide, one noticeable omission being the outdoor uniform, and I will endeavour to show why no outdoor uniform was mentioned; second, that the amounts set opposite the various items were infinitely more than the garments could be purchased for. I submitted this list to a friend in the wholesale softgoods trade, and he submitted the matter to a customer in the retail trade, with the result that I was furnished with an estimate showing that the goods which the officers said should cost &#163;14 ought to be bought for &#163;611s. That is to say, the estimate of the Defence authorities was so far out as to the cost of the garments that it should have been possible to purchase them for half the amount set out in the answer given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the Senate. A point I wish to emphasize is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in giving this answer, stated that it was made after inquiry ; but if all our Defence expenditure is based on similar inquiries, members can form some sort of an idea of what we are paying in excess of what we ought to pay. I venture to say that if for this particular list tenders were called, the Minister would find that these garments could be purchased for about &#163;6 10s. A second point I desire to emphasize is that this answer was supplied to the Minister by a responsible officer - who, I presume, was an officer in Melbourne - with the full knowledge that it did not cover one-third of the actual articles which the nurses were asked to take with them on active service. I have the official list which was issued to the nurses at the time that this answer was given; and, though it is a long one, I think it ought to be read to the Committee, because I consider this one of the grossest cases that has come under our notice of the way in which the officers of the Department, or some of them, are absolutely fooling this Chamber as to what is going on there. In the answer to the Minister, eight items were cited, but the list I have contains, I do not know how many, including one grey serge dress, one grey serge cape, one bonnet and veil, one grey cloak, one pair grey gloves, one commonwealth brooch, two sets silver buttons - nine for indoor and nine for outdoor uniform; three grey zephyr dresses - and they say take four, as three are insufficient; four grey zephyr aprons, eight white linen face sheeting aprons, two shoulder capes - scarlet; one pair black boots, six collars, six pairs cuffs, four caps of white French organdie muslin ; may take one pair black gaiters, if desired ; six white linen arm badges, two cotton washing hats or one panama, one warm grey cap, knives, forks, spoons, cups, plates, serviettes and ring - all plainly marked ; sheets, towels, pillow slip&#39;s, stretcher, deck chair, cabin trunk, suit case, hold-all, pillow, cushion, rugs, eiderdown and blankets, and good supply of underclothing for both summer and  winter. These were the articles which the Department required nurses to take with them on active service; and yet the Minister, when he asks an officer for information to supply to Parliament, is given a list which does not cover one-third of the items, and as to the items that were given their values are inflated more than 50 per cent. After a good deal of trouble I have discovered how this original estimate of &#163;15 for the nurses&#39; equipment was arrived at. For some years past - in fact, almost since the inception of the Commonwealth - there has been an Army Service Nursing Corps in existence. In times past the ladies who volunteered for this particular class of service in connexion with our Forces had a uniform which was stipulated for them ; and, it being a purely volunteer corps&#62;, they had to provide their own uniform. What was- done was that sealed patterns of the uniform were deposited by the Defence authorities with, I believe, a firm in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and the other capital cities, respectively. The nurses had to obtain their uniforms at these particular establishments, because the firms had specialized in the articles. At the outbreak of the war, the first nurses who left Australia were all volunteers from this corps, and, as they had their uniforms, the original &#163;15 was granted to them to meet expenditure in regard to other garments which they required. The amount would, I believe, have been enough to provide those garments, other than the outdoor uniform they had to take with them. Subsequent to the statement which I made to the House about this matter some time ago, Messrs. David Jones and Company, of Sydney, wrote a letter to the press, and 1 quote the following from une <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline><inline font-style="italic">-</inline></para>

                    <para>Each nurse&#39;s outfit is turned out as a costume to order, necessitating two fittings, and the material used is of high grade. At a later date the supply of material held by the company became exhausted, and the company had to pay a greatly increased price locally. Hie Department agreed to give another guinea for the costumes  wherever  the cost of the material warranted it. 1 ask the Minister in charge to pay particular attention to this; and I want to remind him that the Minister representing the Defence Department in this House stated over and over again that the nurses were free to go where they liked for their outfit. This letter from which I am quoting, and which David Jones and Company sent to the press, shows that a Government official waited upon them, representing that they would have to make a great number of uniforms, and arranged the price. </para>

                        <para>- I believe it was issued in Melbourne and Brisbane, and every other capital city. It appears that a private arrangement was- made by the head of the Army Medical Corps and the Principal Medical Officer with these firms; and that, although the Minister was saying in the House that the nurses were free to go where they liked for their costumes, the facts show that influence was brought upon them to go to these particular firms. Honorable members know that this is so, because a great number have had complaints about this trouble. </para>

                        <para>- There, again, I am not perfectly sure; but I understand that a Melbourne firm is also doing this business. David Jones and Company is the only firm of which I can speak with personal knowledge, although I have heard rumours that the same thing has been done in Melbourne and Brisbane.  The point I want to make is that an official waited upon this Sydney firm, representing that they were to make a large number of costumes; and, as a consequence of that, influence was brought to bear upon the nurses to go to that place for their costumes. The Minister, admits that a circular was issued to the nurses in New &#34;South Wales containing such an instruction, but it cannot be discovered who issued that circular. </para>

                        <para>- The Department were quite right in endeavouring to get the uniforms from one source; but my complaint is that they endeavoured to do it in a round-about way, after trying to lead honorable members to believe that nurses could secure their uniforms where they chose, and without calling for public tenders - without attempting to protect the nurses from being charged twice as much as they ought to have been charged. I do not wish to labour the question to-night, but I do ask the Government to have a proper and thorough investigation into all the circumstances surrounding this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I have already mentioned how that came about. All the nurses who went away with the first contingent were members of the Army Nursing Corps, and had their uniforms, and they were allowed &#163;15, so that they might get the other things which it was necessary to take away with them. I believe that it was sufficient to equip the first lot of nurses who went away, but the firms which had the sealed pattern uniform were those which were waited upon by a representative of the Defence authorities, and asked to continue making these uniforms, and between them - the departmental officer and the firms* - this price was fixed, which, I say, is grossly excessive. At the very outset the Department should have called for public tenders for the supply of these uniforms. In fact, this should be done now. </para>

                        <para>- The cost arrived at in that way would probably be more than the cost of the uniforms made in outside establishments. I think that the method suggested by the honorable member was that which was followed in arriving at the allowance of &#163;7 13s. 6d., and I believe that the Clothing, Factory is now turning out nurses&#39; uniforms; but, for all that, I ask the Minister to see if it is not possible to submit nurses&#39; equipment to public tender, and to do as New Zealand does - that is, give the nurses their uniforms free. Many of the nurses have had to pay anything from &#163;40 to &#163;52, according to where they have purchased their equipment. It is not the proper way in which to treat those ladies who are willing to take on this noble service, and leave Australia with our Expeditionary Forces. </para>

                        <para>- This matter merits investigation from top to bottom, in order to ascertain who was responsible for what was done, and also who has been responsible for the misleading answers that have been given over and over again to honorable members; and when the Minister has sheeted home the responsibility, the officer concerned should not remain in the Department another minute. I come now to the question of nurses&#39; pay. I understand that it was proposed to pay nurses 7s. a day, and to give them a mess allowance of 3s. 6d. a day where food was not provided ; but in order to give honorable members an idea of what is taking place I shall read a portion of a letter from one of the nurses who has returned in a hospital ship from Egypt. This letter proceeds - </para>

                    <para>The statement that we receive about &#163;170 per annum means, in point of fact, that we receive &#163;60 per annum as salary, and the balance of &#163;113 per annum has gone to the caterer in Egypt. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Instead of receiving 3s. 6d. per day which the nurses believed was to be their mess allowance, they were allowed only 2s. 6d. when they got to Egypt; and, in the next place, the arrangements which were made with a caterer for their mess were such that their food cost them 5s. 6d. a day. Thus, their actual cash remuneration was cut down to &#163;60 a year. Was that what the Minister intended ? I do not think it is what Parliament intended. We understood, when we were sending these nurses away, that we were paying them well. As a matter of fact, the New Zealand rates have been fixed as follows: - Matron in charge, &#163;150 per annum; sisters, &#163;120 per annum; nurses, &#163;100 per annum. And the New Zealand nurses get those salaries, whereas the Australian nurses in Egypt have been receiving only &#163;60 a year. I ask the Minister to have this matter also inquired into, in order to see who was responsible for making this arrangement with the caterer, which has resulted in the nurses losing the difference between 7s. a day and &#163;60 a year, because that is what has happened. Some one, when the nurses got to Egypt - I suppose it was done in the same way as that in which the uniforms were arranged for - arranged with a . caterer to cater for their mess at 5s. 6d. a day. The Department should pay the caterer, and not leave it to the nurses to pay him ; yet this is how these girls have been treated. It is not just. Surely they are worthy of better treatment at the hands of this country. I have no desire to take up very much more time. I have put my case as briefly as I possibly could. I could have given very many more particulars. But I do think that I have clearly shown the necessity for holding a thorough investigation to fix the responsibility for the arrangements which were made on the shoulders of the proper officer, and see that he is suitably dealt with. </para>

                <para>I sincerely regret that the financial statement contains no evidence of a real desire to economize in any shape or form. Honorable members on the other side seem to think that this is a time when we should expand the public expenditure to the utmost extent, but I do not. I believe that we ought to rigidly economize. I do not mean to suggest for a moment that charges on the revenue, such as old-age pensions, should not receive from the House the same full consideration as they have always had. Those are matters in regard to which we have no right to practise economy; indeed, we cannot economize there. But there are many other items where economy is possible. I am sorry, too, that there is no indication of anything approaching to national organization to meet the emergencies of the existing situation. I believe that the time has come when national organization should be undertaken throughout the British Empire. Call it conscription, or whatever you like, in my opinion the time has come when we ought to call upon the men from one end of this country to the other to join the flag. I do not necessarily mean that they should join the flag to take up arms. What I mean is that every man should be prepared, under the direction of the State, to do what it believes he can do best to serve his country at the time. What are we doing in Australia? We are sending out of the country scores and scores of men whose services, I believe, would be of infinitely more value to Australia and the Empire in Australia. We are divorcing them from those services, and leaving in the country scores and scores of men who are not serving the nation in any particular way. I believe that the time has come when that sort of thing should cease. Recently I addressed a large number of public meetings in New South Wales. On nearly every platform I advocated this national service, and I can assure honorable members that my advocacy was greeted with the greatest applause from every audience which I had the honour to address. They all realized the necessity for instituting national service. I believe that if the Government would handle the question boldly they would find the great mass of the people behind them. I do not suppose for a moment that there are not some persons who would object. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind the point is that we are not organizing the nation to get the best possible results, and many of those recruits, in my opinion, should not be taken. A case came under my notice the other day of a man who volunteered for active service, believing that it was his duty to do so. He came from a peculiarly skilled trade, and his enlistment threw idle a whole mill which was being worked practically twelve hours a day in making material for the Expeditionary Forces. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that if every physically fit man were to walk out of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, go down to the recruiting office, and offer his services to the country, we are not in a position to send the men back to their job. It is high time, therefore, that the Government boldly tackled the whole question of national organization, root and branch. </para>

I hope that, as a result of the census which is being taken, the Government will endeavour to organize the country, as far as possible, for the purposes of this war. We are not making that use of the census which we ought to make, and, to a very great extent, it will be a waste of money in that regard. </para>

                <para>In my opinion, the time has come when the Government should tackle  this question, and, above all, endeavour to put the finances in a proper condition. We are drifting along. Although, during the life of this Parliament, we have imposed practically &#163;5,000,000 of additional taxation,, we propose to use the whole of that money, .and &#163;750,000 not yet provided for, in meeting the ordinary expenditure of government. I include in this the interest on the war loan and the war pensions, which, from this time forward, will be recurring liabilities. I am not opposed to additional taxation at the present time, because I believe it to be necessary; but the revenue obtained from such taxation over and above what is needed .to meet the interest on the war loan and the war pensions should form a sinking fund to pay off the war loan. I do not think that any one will object to additional taxation at this juncture if its distribution is equitable, and the money is used for the prosecution of the war. But we have a right to object to additional taxation if the money is to be spent in meeting the ordinary liabilities of the Government, and increasing the various Government establishments. If we increase the annual expenditure of Australia to &#163;28,000,000, we shall create vested interests which it will be almost impossible to destroy later. The Government have not exercised any originality in its taxation proposals. Something might have been done to tap the surplus wealth of the community - that spent on absolute luxuries. Only the other day, when passing a football-ground in Melbourne, 1 noticed that a vast crowd was attending the match. Personally. I do not think that sport of that character should continue at this time. The Government might very well impose an amusement tax, because money spent on amusements is money which the people have to spare over and above what is required to purchase the necessaries of life. An amusement tax would be easy to collect - it could be in the form of stamp duty - and would give a vast return if levied on tickets of admission to the boxing stadia, the race-courses, the picture shows, theatres, and other places of amusement. </para>

                <para class="block">An amusement tax would be a direct tax on luxuries. I do not believe in taxing the necessaries of life, which should be as free as possible. The Government, unfortunately, propose to tax heavily money that is being used for the development of the country. Australia&#39;s position differs greatly from that of Great Britain, whose wealthy people derive, perhaps, the major portion of their incomes from investments abroad. Great Britain, too, is fully developed, while we need, and are using, our surplus income in developing and opening up the country. The Government have recognised, in some measure, that money so used should not be heavily taxed, because it has imposed a flat rate on the undistributed profits of companies. If companies carry undistributed profits to reserves, and use the rooney in the development of their business, they are to be charged a flat rate of ls. 6d. in the &#163;1. There are squatting families in Australia, and other families, who have floated their interests into companies. These companies employ their undistributed profits in the development of their properties, the improvement of their herds, and  sp  on; and are charged a fiat rate of ls. 6d. in the &#163;1 on such undistributed profits. But individuals equally wealthy, doing the same thing, are not dealt with in the same way; and if very wealthy, are required to pay taxation at the rate of 5s. in the &#163;1 on money that they are using for the development of their property. After a good season, the ordinary farmer does not spend the money he has earned. He uses the greater part of it to &#39; reduce his overdraft, to increase his cultivation, or to improve his stock. By taxing heavily income which is used for developmental purposes, the Government are reducing the means expended in opening up the country, which cannot be deemed to be a wise method of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring to exceptional cases. My point is that by far the greater proportion of the surplus income of the people of Australia is used, not in luxury, but in the development of the country. Many squatters and farmers  received no income last year. Scores of them have fallen behind, and have been losing money for months. If in the following year a farmer has a really good wheat crop, from which he will earn &#163;2,000, though he got behind to the extent of &#163;750 last year, the &#34;probability is that the family will live on about &#163;250, they will pay off the debt of &#163;750 incurred in the previous year, and will use the balance of the &#163;2,000 in the development of their property, or by putting by a little nest-egg to meet a hard time in the future. By far the greater amount of the income of the people of Australia from year to year goes into the development of the country. If we take a large proportion of it from the people by taxation, to that extent we shall retard the development of the country. I do not mean to suggest that the Government should not have proposed an income tax if the money to be derived from it is to be used for war purposes, but I say that they are proposing to take from the people more than ought to be derived from that source, and to that extent will be trenching upon a vast sum of money which would otherwise be usefully employed in the development of the country. In order to emphasize the position I have endeavoured to put before the House, I move as an amendment to the motion - </para>

                        <para>- That will satisfy me. When a move such as that just made by the honorable member for Richmond takes place, I become envious of the position of honorable &#34;members on the other side, because, as a supporter of the Government, my lips are, to a certain extent, sealed, and I am not free to exercise what abilities I have in criticising their proposals. After dinner, and when the galleries are full, I always feel that it would be very pleasant to be a member of the Opposition. The object of the honorable member for Richmond is, of course, to defeat the income tax proposals of the Government, but when an Opposition opposes a Government proposal they should, at least, suggest something to take its place. Honorable members opposite have throughout this debate endeavoured to show that the taxation proposals of the Government are in excess of the requirements of the country. No Government who introduce taxation can expect to become popular. As a young man I once joined a league, one. of the main platforms of which was &#34; No taxation.&#34; I thought that I was discovering quite a new idea, but since I have assumed the responsibility of a representative of the people I have learned that no Government can carry on the affairs of a country without the necessary financial resources. It should be remembered &#34; that an income tax can be levied only upon those who are in a position to pay it. If a country is prosperous, the revenue derived from ah income tax will be better than when it is not prosperous. The object of the taxation proposals of the Government is to enable us to pay the interest on the war loan, to continue public utilities during the war, and to stimulate the confidence of the people of this country. If the revenue is curtailed, the Government will have to reduce its staff. I remember when, during the lifetime of the Disraeli Government in England, in 1866, proposals were made by the Opposition to reduce taxation by taking . off the duty of 6d. per lb. on tea, and that of1d. per lb. on sugar. The cry was a popular one, and upon it the Gladstone Government came into power; but twelve months afterwards Gladstone was refused a hearing in his own constituency of Greenwich, for the simple reason that, having reduced its income, the Government had had to reduce its expenditure, and it began by reducing the employees at the Government dockyards. If honorable members opposite are anxious to follow a policy of that kind, they will not have the people of Australia with them. A taxation upon incomes is the only means by which the Government can tax the people of Australia. When the Labour party came into power in 1910, direct taxation was first introduced, but taxation of that kind was not required in 1913, because, when the Labour Government went out of office, they left a surplus of &#163;2,600,000, which the succeeding Liberal Government transformed into a deficiency of &#163;600,000. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite understand that it is disagreeable to honorable members opposite to hear the truth, but so many statements have been made about the extravagance of this Government and the possibility of further extravagance, that it is only right the people should know what burglars the late Government were. In his statement to the House the Prime Minister pointed out the necessity for this taxation. If the Government should find itself in the position of having too much revenue, which I do not think is likely, the surplus will go to the relief of future taxation; but as honorable members know, the proposed tax is necessary in order to pay interest on the loan of &#163;20,000,000. No Government has a right to ask Parliament for a loan without making provision for the payment of interest, and though I hope this loan will be the only one required, it is evident from the statements that have been made that further loan moneys will be necessary. I believe every member of the House shares my view that the Government should maintain itself in a position to keep its employees going, and not have <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> discharge them on account of reduced revenue. The honorable member for Richmond spoke of a tax on luxuries. I am sometimes at a loss to understand what luxuries are. What is a luxury to one man is very often not a luxury to another. Men who would do away with sport and luxuries would stop the wheels of progress, because all these things give employment, and to stop them would make unemployment a serious factor. - 1 am sure the honorable member for Richmond does not want to do this, but the course of action he proposes would have that effect. Proposals for the buying of extra 1d. stamps simply mean fiddling with the question, and cannot be regarded as statesmanlike. I do not believe the honorable member is &#39; really in earnest in moving the amendment, which is simply an Opposition trick to get a vote against the Government, because I challenge the Opposition to give a vote against the main question. They dare not do so. The people recognise that in the present trying circumstances the income tax is a necessary form of taxation, and I hope the tax proposed by the Government will be sufficient to meet all contingencies. At any rate, the Government&#39;s proposal shows that they have foresight and determination - qualities which a National Parliament expects its Government to possess. The honorable member for Richmond some time ago drew attention to the pay of nurses and difficulties which had occurred in the provision of their uniforms. Their pay is, perhaps, too small, but the &#163;15 dress allowance seems fair for their requirements. If it was fixed at &#163;25 some of the ladies would probably want still more. I would support a proposal that the Government should allow the nurses their uniforms in the same way as they do the ordinary soldiers. It was alleged that the nurses were told to procure their uniforms from certain business firms in Sydney. There is no more respected firm in that city than that of David Jones Limited. </para>

                        <para>- The present and past matrons of the Sydney Hospital admit that they have always told the nurses that David Jones Limited would make their uniforms. It appears that about ten years ago the firm were asked to quote a price, and that other firms were asked by the military authorities to quote prices. The firm did quote a price, and some time afterwards the material required underwent a rise in price, increasing the cost of some of the garments by 10s. When the war broke out, the officers of the Defence Department and the matron of the Sydney Hospital drew the firm&#39;s attention to the fact that a large number of uniforms would be required to equip the nurses, and the firm agreed to reduce the cost of the &#163;1 article to 10s. in view of the increased quantity they had to supply. The reason assigned for going to the matron and using their influence to secure the job of making the garments was that their material was in accordance with the regulations, and, as the nurses were very anxious to get their uniforms as soon as they qualified, it would be better for them to go to this company, which was always prepared to give special attention to the work, and suspend work on other orders in its favour. There would thus be no waiting, as a special staff was always kept for the purpose. All New South Wales members know that ladies delight to go to David Jones Limited, where they are always well served and well fitted, each dress receiving individual attention. I am asked to tell the Government that the firm court inquiry into the whole transaction. When the war broke out. David Jones Limited had not in stock a sufficient supply of this material. They sent a code message to England for fresh supplies, but were unable to obtain any, and had to purchase some locally at a greatly increased price. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may know something about sheep and wool, but he knows very little about nurses&#39; uniforms. I have here a statement setting out the cost of the material and labour involved in making a nurse&#39;s uniform, as well as the selling price, and the profit made by this firm. Various dates are given. On the 24th March, for instance, the cost of material used in making such uniforms was &#163;1 19s. 9d. ; and the cost of labour &#163;2 10s. 8d. ; or a total of &#163;4 10s. 5d. The selling price was &#163;5 15s. 6d., showing a profit  of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 5s. Id. </para>

                        <para>- I have to admit that Messrs. David Jones Limited are not conducting a philanthropic institution. They are in business to make a profit; but. like most of the business people of Sydney, they are fairly generous. Citizens of New South Wales think that the Leader of the Opposition, before bringing this matter before the House, should have instituted some inquiry. Matron Gould and Matron  Creal,  who have been charged with using their influence to induce nurses to obtain their supplies from Messrs. David Jones Limited, take a deep interest in the nurses, and those who know them would never think of charging  them  with using their influence in such a way in order to secure a commission. </para>

I have endeavoured to justify the statements which I have -made by quotations from the document which I hold in my hand. When honorable members make assertions without warrant, and refuse to accept proof in rebuttal of them, it is idle for me to attempt to convince them of their error. The members of the firm which has been attacked are citizens of New South Wales, whom everybody respects. I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Sydney</inline> Jones many years ago. He is a gentleman who has rendered great service to the State from which I hail, in the matter of technical education, and he also assisted to bring about social reforms long before the Labour party became a power in politics. I would be unworthy of my position in this House if I did not invite the Government to institute the most searching inquiry into the transactions of his firm. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to call attention to a matter of considerable importance to the people of this State. It has reference to our Postal Department. Owing to the determination of the Railways Commissioners, a very large number, of trains on country lines have recently been cancelled. As a result, our mail services are being seriously interfered with. To-day I attended a deputation to the Railways Commissioners, at which I ascertained that those gentlemen hold the view that it is their province to carry mails when trains run on country lines, but not otherwise. That attitude appears to open up a very serious position to many persons in Victoria. I should like to know what the Government propose to do to meet the special difficulties which have arisen. In many places to which there have previously been daily trains, only so many trains a week are now to be run. A large expenditure is being incurred in the city, and as a result the country is being called upon to suffer. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that that is so. This question is one of great importance to the people of Victoria, and I desire to know what the effect will be on the subsidiary mail services. Wherever these trains are running in the country districts they are met by contractors under the Postal Department, and if the mails are not conveyed to them by train their services fall through. I do not wish to see the interests of the contractors interfered with, and still less do I wish to see the interests of the people interfered with. One of the first essentials in country districts is that the mails shall be delivered regularly and in accordance with the service decided upon. Can the Postmaster-General state whether this matter has come under the notice of his Department? If so, what does he propose to do to meet the difficulties which have arisen ! </para>

                    <para>. - On the subject of mail services I wish to put a concrete case before the Postmaster-General, and to request him to depute an officer to make inquiry. On the Gheringhap-Maroona railway the Department went to a lot of trouble eighteen months ago to cancel the old mail service &#39; by0 coach, and to arrange for the mails to be carried by train. Now, I believe, the Railway Department intends to cut the train service down to three passenger trains per week, by which alone the mails will be carried. At the same time goods trains will be running through to Ararat over the same line, but will carry no mails. I ask the Minister if he will ascertain whether the goods trains cannot carry mails, so that people may have a daily service, which they have always been accustomed to ? </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to refer briefly to some criticisms passed upon me this afternoon by the Prime Minister in reply to a question asked by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition. I do not, of course, complain of criticism on the part of the Prime Minister. As a junior member of his party 1 have claimed, and exercised, the right from time to time to criticise the right honorable member, and, therefore, I acknowledge his right to criticise anything I may have said or done of a political or international character; but I do complain of his making animadversionst  upon me on the strength of a newspaper report, without having first asked me whether the report was correct, or in any way sufficient to convey my views. For my part, I have never been willing to plead either guilty or not guilty to charges in newspaper reports. My own experience, and that of the party of which I am a member, is such that I would feel that I was belittling myself and my party if I felt under an obligation to canvass, deny, or question reports or editorial statements appearing in the press from time to time in condemnation or criticism df me. And I venture to remind the Prime Minister that this Labour party, of which he is now the distinguished head, has come into existence, not because of, but in spite of, the press. It has been the experience of members of the party that they have held their meetings on street corners and other difficult places in order to express their views in the face of a hostile press. I am proud to think that we have beaten down that reactionary influence, and it is to the organized effort of the Labour party, disregarding these objectionable and undemocratic influences that the right honorable gentleman owes his present exalted position. In regard to the meeting to which the Leader of the Opposition made reference, the right honorable gentleman having referred to repeated statements of mine, I should like to say that I have addressed, in connexion with this most disastrous war, two very large meetings, one of which was held in the heart of Melbourne and the other in the Town Hall of my own electorate, and it is significant that there was scarcely a word of dissent from anything I said. The explanation of that fact may be easy enough to those who hate and despise the policy of the Labour party. The explanation they would suggest, and which some correspondents of the press have suggested, is that those persons who listened to me are an inferior type of disloyal individuals, who, having no regard for their country, but, being dissatisfied with the economic conditions, are prepared to pander to any one who in turn will pander to them. But I do not think that is an explanation which will appeal to the Leader of the Labour party. He will admit that an audience almost filling the Fitzroy Town Hall and gathered at random by advertisement is likely to be fairly representative of the Democracy of this country, and it is a remarkable thing that it was only after a report of my remarks had appeared in the press, and certain correspondents had written to the papers, and editorial comment had been made on the address, that it seems to have excited any public ill-feeling. It so happens that, as a result of a fairly bitter experience, I had my speech reported verbatim. I do not intend to quote the speech verbatim to-night, but I shall read some passages from it, and make some comments upon what I then said, and still believe. I practically commenced my speech in these words - </para>

I repudiate that idea now, as I did then, and as I shall resolutely continue to do. t then went on to discuss the very live question of conscription or compulsory service; and I reminded my audience that from that very platform the honor- able member for Flinders, in addressing a recruiting meeting, had spoken on that question, which had become a question of present-day importance, by reason of the fact of a motion in another place. I claim the right to discuss such a question freely and frankly in my own electorate, before my own constituents. I spoke of young men of eighteen years who were enlisting, and said - </para>

                <para>I put that as an argument against conscription. I then went on to discuss the question of what one worthy senator has called &#34;moral conscription&#34;; and from that I also dissented. I said that as I was opposed to conscription by law, I was also opposed to either economic or moral conscription - or, in other words, that I was against any undue influence being brought to bear against those who did not enlist as a conscientious duty. I wish to add that, as I said before I say now, I will not submit to dictation from a hostile press. However, when it comes to the Leader of my party deploring some utterances of mine, a very different set of conditions arise. I may say that, not only am I jealous of my good name with my party, but I am also jealous of my good name in the House. I respect the opinions of honorable members opposite; but I would like them to understand that if they are led by the reports in the- press, or by arguments and letters in the press, to believe that I have gone to these meetings for the purpose of winning cheap  applause from any section of tha community, they very much mistake my purpose, and, if I may say so, my character. Everything that I have said in connexion with the war has been said under a sense of the public duty to frame views and express them to the people who have returned me. I should like the Bouse to understand my object. That can never be gathered from carefully selected extracts from my speech made by persons who are only too glad to place me in a false light.

I may, of course, be quite wrong; but when I see, as I have seen in some newspapers, that not less than 800 representative men of democratic unions have issued a strong indictment against the German Government and the Kaiser, and the Junkers, as I call them, who support him - when I see that men in the Reichstag itself have openly taken the risk of condemning their policy - I venture to form the opinion that if the Democracy in central Europe are making a concerted attack on Prussianism - it is more than possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> have some justification for their view. I believe, too, that if, on the other hand, we adopt the policy of German extermination, as it is sometimes called, it will greatly prolong the war. I have nothing more to say than that I realize that I am entirely in the hands of the House, which is the master of its own membership, in the first place at all events, though ultimately the country is the adjudicator. All I wish is that the House shall understand the object I have had in view. If honorable members think that I have been indiscreet, and had better have left things unsaid, that, of course, is a matter of opinion, and it is for them to say or do what they think proper. I cannot surrender the right to express ray opinions. I cannot think that we have arrived at that conditions of affairs in Australia when a&#39; section of the community, holding opinions, shall not be able to express them - that we have reached that stage when a section of the press shall dominate and stifle expression of opinion, especially when that section of- the press, after  yeaTs  of effort, have failed in their violent opposition to the Labour party. I have endeavoured to do my best in my position as a member of Parliament, and if I had been fully reported - I will not say fairly reported, because I do not expect that - I do not believe my leader would have made the observations which he did this afternoon. </para>

                    <para>. -  Until the complaint concerning country mails was brought under my notice I had not heard of the changes in Victoria. I regret to have to say that &#39; the contract entered into some seven or eight years ago with the Railways Commissioners is a most unsatisfactory one, and it is our intention to put an, end to it in a very short time. The charges are exorbitant, and the railways practically control our mails, especially on long distances, with the result that where they have reduced the train service from a daily to a tri-weekly schedule, mail contractors have to carry their mails accordingly, unless they have other business which enables them to keep up a daily service. On the question of carrying mails by goods trains, I want to point out that the Railways Commissioners are exempt from any liability or responsibility for mails so carried. However, I  promise- to have an inquiry made into the question, which has been submitted by the honorable member for Echuca, and the honorable member for Corangamite, with a view to ascertaining whether it is possible to make some arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the safety of the mails is the only difficulty involved; but, I would point out, that some people would not regard a triweekly mail service as a very great hardship, because they have to bc content with a weekly service. I have every sympathy with the country people, and I hope we shall be able to make some better arrangement for the carriage of mails. </para>
