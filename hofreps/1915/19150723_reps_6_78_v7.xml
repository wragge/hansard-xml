The subject having been raised, I should like to express my opinion that the British Government does not yet realize to the full the real position of the distant Dominions in matters that very nearly affect us. </para>

Will the Minister inquire into this matter, and see that, in future, when our heroes return from the front, they have special consideration, and that, if necessary, special trains are provided to take them to their homes ? </para>

                            <para>- A member of our Expeditionary Forces was reported to have died in May last, but since the reported date of his death several letters have been received by his relatives stating that he is not dead, but in hospital at Malta, and a letter from a fellow soldier to the same effect has also been received. I understand that the man's relatives have sent half a dozen cablegrams to the hospital authorities at Malta, and have received no reply to any of them, and I now ask the Minister whether it is not possible to deal with those who are responsible for not having replied to these cablegrams. Honorable members can imagine the feelings of the parents. They are told now to apply for a pension, but they know full well that their son is alive. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member entirely misunderstands the position. There is no more necessity for a Royal Commission in this case than there was in the Australian Metal Company's case. The directors of that company have been removed from their positions, and interned, and the company declared an enemy firm, as it is proposed to declare one of these other companies. The Government are not going to submit this matter to a Royal Commission, or any other body. </para>

                    <para>- The Leader of the Opposition asked me if I would have some statement prepared with regard to the amount earned by the carriage of cargo on transport ships. In reply, I have to say that the gross freight received for vessels used for transport purposes up to 22nd July of this year was £1,300,147. This does not include freight due on two large ships, the account for which has not yet been received, and which is estimated to amount to £30,000. The estimated gross freights for detained' ships used as cargo vessels solely are £300,000, and the receipts from detained vessels under charter to the Western Australian Government and one or two private firms amount to £3,937. It will be seen, therefore, that about £1,300,000 has been earned by transports and detained German vessels. From the gross freights there will be deducted the expenses of loading and discharging cargo, which may possibly amount to 25 per cent. The amount earned is a set-off against the cost of transporting the troops, and is paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and credited to the vote for the Expeditionary Forces. The amount earned by five ships used as cargo vessels goes into the revenue. </para>

It is, I think, only necessary for me to read it in order to induce the Government to take some action; and if the course I am taking this morning has that result, every honorable member will be delighted. It is heartrending to think that our wounded soldiers, after fighting the battles of the Empire, should be treated in the way these poor fellows were treated when on their way to their homes last Saturday. The letter is as follows : - 21st July, 1915. </para>

                    <para>I wish to bring under your notice the scandalous treatment meted out by the military authorities to the returned wounded soldiers from New South Wales and Queensland who were landed from the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra</inline> in Melbourne. These heroes, who fought for us in the Dardanelles, were forced to travel by the express on Saturday mixed up with the other passengers, although some of them were on crutches, and others in bandages with their eyes shot away. Many of them were unable to travel alone, and nurses were in attendance. When Seymour was reached, and the rush for refreshments were made, these men had to take their chance with the rest, and many were unable to get anything, their nurses being unable to get them into the rooms. They were hustled by the railway officials into their seats - despite remonstrances by many civilians and fellow passengers. Many of the soldiers had no money - and had it not been for a generous few of their fellow travellers and others, who bought up the available supply of fruit, &amp;c., and pushed it into the carriages, they would have had to starve until Albury was reached. Some of the wounded men complained bitterly at the treatment meted out to them, and stated they would have been better off if they were in a German camp. Their luggage and rugs had been taken on by an earlier train, so they were cold and hungry too. In God's name why was those gallant fellows made to travel by the express? Surely a special could have been provided for them and their nurses - or, failing this - a special should have been reserved for them, and there should have been no necessity for them or their nurses to hustle for refreshments - they fought for us like heroes, and nothing was too good for them.I have waited until now expecting some one else to ventilate this inhuman justice. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, subsequent altogether to the first registration. The remaining amendments all relate to the second schedule. The first of these - No. 4 - provides for the omission of the word "possess" in paragraph 4, and the insertion of the word " own " in lieu thereof. The amendment was suggested by the Victorian Commissioner for Taxes. Amendment No. 5 provides for the insertion, in paragraph 4, of the words " or other motor vehicles " after the words " motor cycles." This addition, we believe, will improve the paragraph. Amendment No. 6, substituting the word " owned " for the word " possessed " in paragraph 4 of the second schedule was also made at the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prout</inline> Webb, in order that the meaning of the question might be made perfectly clear. The same remark applies to amendments 7 and 8, which are of the same character. The next amendment is in paragraph 6 of the second schedule, the words " trust account" being left out, and the words " account of other persons " being inserted. This amendment is made so as to cover agencies as well as trustee ac-&gt; counts. The more general term was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prout</inline> Webb, and it seems a good suggestion. Amendment No. 10 is a recasting of item <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of paragraph 6, in order to distinguish between the unimproved capital value of land and the improvements thereon. It was pointed out that ' ' improved capital value ' ' as used in the original -paragraph was not a term known to taxing bodies. We have made this amendment in order that what is required of the person answering the question shall be made perfectly clear. "Unimproved capital value" is a well-known term having a definite meaning. The same may be said with regard to the words " value of all improvements." The amendment makes for greater clarity of expression, and the new items have a definite meaning well known to taxation bodies. </para>

                        <para>- The improved value of any land made the subject of this return may be easily ascertained by adding together the figures given in respect of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of item <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> whereas if the two divisions were put under the one heading we should not be acting in conformity with the. principle of taxation followed where unimproved values are singled out.

                        <para>- I shall not argue the point. This point will come before, the Joint Committee, and may be discussed by it if there is any difference of opinion. My view is that this amendment considerably improves the schedule. Amendment No. 11 relates to paragraph 6, item iv. of the second schedule, the words " value of share of assets in partnership as per last balance-sheet " being substituted for the words " partnership interests." This amendment has been made at the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prout</inline> Webb. It was also at his suggestion that amendments 12, 13, and 14 were made. Amendment No. 12 inserts after "deposits" in item vii. of paragraph 6 the words "fixed or at current account." This addition has been made because there might otherwise be some doubt as to whether both fixed and current account deposits were intended to be included. Amendment No. 14 leaves out of paragraph 7 of the second schedule " 30th June, 1915," and inserts " 31st December, 1914." This will enable most persons who now come under the income tax to send in their schedule as supplied to the Taxation Commissioners of the various States, and which are made up to the 31st December, 1914. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly they were. In the original question the reference was not to " freehold land," but to " land," no matter under what tenure it might be held. I consider that the amendment made in another place materially improves the question as originally framed. A man will now know what he is wanted to do. Amendment No. 15 is similar to an earlier one to which I have already referred, and is framed to include agencies as well as trust accounts. By amendment No. 16, item iv. of paragraph. 7 is amended by inserting after the word " pension " the words " not being Commonwealth old-age or invalid pension." We do not need to be supplied with information regarding such pensions, since it is already available to us. Finally, it is proposed to amend paragraph 7, item v., of the second schedule relating to deductions by inserting the words " or Friendly Societies" after the word " Fund." That will put contributions to friendly societies on the same basis as payments to pension and superannuation funds. </para>

                        <para>- That amendment substitutes for "partnership interests" in paragraph vi. the words " value of share of assets in partnership as per last balance-sheet." "Partnership interests" is <inline font-style="italic">p</inline> rather ambiguous term, and might include goodwill and a number of other considerations, but " partnership assets as per last balance-sheet " is more definite. Such a balance-sheet will be available to partners, who can give the information already compiled. The amendment has been made upon the suggestion of the Commissioner of Taxes. I think it is an improvement, and will avoid a good deal of trouble in respect of partnership accounts. I move - </para>

                    <para>- These amendments by no means affect the principle of the Bill as originally introduced, but appear to be purely statistical. I can quite understand these amended returns being furnished for purely statistical purposes, but whether a man pays on the basis of the improved or the unimproved value of his land will not materially affect the operations in Flanders, and therefore some of these amendments do not seem to relate to a War Census. They are something extra to the adjective " war." I do not for the moment, however, see much objection to such an amendment as that relating to the unimproved value of land, viewed only from a statistical point of view. It may help us hereafter in studying our statistics if these matters be analyzed into their constituent elements. One result of these amendments will be a more detailed analysis of a man's possessions no matter what they may happen to be. Amongst other things they will furnish excellent work for valuators, adjusters, auditors, and accountants. Incidentally this census will afford a great deal of employment. </para>

The multiplication of expense that will be incurred in providing these additional returns in this particular way suggests that something else i3 in view besides prosecution of the war. However, I think we may allow the schedule to go through, particularly as I understand we shall have further opportunities of considering it when the War Committee is called together. The Attorney-General has promised to submit the second schedule to the Committee. </para>

We cannot expect these companies to do this in the time allotted to individuals, and whilst we do not propose to make any alteration in the Bill, every latitude will be given to companies in this matter. Compared with the tremendous number of returns that we shall receive, those from such companies will he few, and their classification, along with the other returns, can be proceeded with as they arrive. </para>

                    <para>. - As far as I have been able to follow the amendments, they seem, on the whole, to be rather in the nature of improvements, but if we were being asked to express a final decision now, I should press for further time for consideration. The Attorney-General has already given an undertaking that this schedule will not be brought into operation until the whole matter has been submitted to the War Committee, and that I understand will sit almost immediately. That Committee will have an opportunity of inquiring, not only from the expert officers who have been dealing with our taxation Acts, as to the most convenient methods of dealing with this proposed return, but also from the representatives of commercial bodies, who have, I understand, already expressed a desire to make certain representations as to how the return could be most quickly and effectively made. That being the case, I would deprecate lengthy or detailed discussion at this stage. Some of these alterations are of enormous importance, though, on the whole, I think they are in the right direction. </para>

                    <para>- I have never been able to regard this proposed collection of statistics as a business proposition. I can understand that it would be a good idea when the general census is taken, in order to get information regarding the social condition of the people, if we could then ascertain the wealth of the community. Such information would be interesting to reformers and those whose desire it is to alleviate the social condition of the people. But in such a census we ought to give every assistance to those who are under the obligation to furnish returns, just as we give assistance in the collection of the ordinary census. We are not proposing to do anything of that kind now. If there is any object in this proposal at all, it is to ascertain the wealth of the community for the purpose of taxing a certain portion of their wealth or income - the only business way would be to deal with income - in order to meet the war expenditure. And therefore we propose to compel over a million families, who 1 suppose are not worth very much, to furnish a return just as we are proposing to ask those who are moderately well off, and those who are wealthy, to give statements of their wealth. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe that this return when it is completed will be of any value to the Government, nor do I think the Government will have any time to deal with it. By the time they have any time to bother with the wealth schedule it will have ceased to be of any value, on account of the changed value of property and securities, and the consequent change in the circumstances of the people concerned. There is one pathetic item in this schedule - ' ' How much money have you lent?" What will be the position of a pawnbroker in regard to that item, and of the unfortunates who pawn their property? He has to-day certain amounts out. Probably within the next three or four months' time that amount will have been increased by hundreds of pounds. The same argument applies generally, and in my view the schedule, when it is complete, will be of no value whatever. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with the honorable member for Capricornia with regard to the wealth census, but there is one item proposed in these amendments to which I desire to draw particular attention - the alteration of the date from the 30th June, 1915, to the 31st December, 1914. The Attorney-General stated in the course of his introductory remarks it was not proposed to use these returns for the purpose of taxation. I hope it is not. </para>

                        <para>- The States at the beginning of the present year collected taxation for the year ending 31st December last. That procedure is all right, but in this amendment we are proposing to get information for the year 1914 to form the basis of taxation to be collected in 1916. Such a course would be most unfair. There are two classes of incomes that have been made during the last twelve months. The first is that of a man who has made a tremendous income, amounting in some cases to a colossal fortune, out of supplying goods to the Defence Department. If there is one class of income which, more than any other, should be a fair subject of taxation in the near future, and taxation to a considerable extent, it is such an income as that. But for it no return will be obtained at all for the purpose of a war tax. </para>

                        <para>- Your contention is that the period ought to end at the 30th June last. That is, no doubt, a fair argument. The reason why the 31st December was fixed was that the income returns for that period had already been made out. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the 31st December would, from the official point of view, be the more convenient date. The second class of income to which I refer is that of the person who was hard hit in 1914-15 by the drought, -whose income has been very small and whose losses have been enormous. If we are to. ignore the results of that year and tax the man on his income for the year when he did make some money, we shall be adding insult to injury. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the tax for the year just past is always collected in the early month of the current year. Another point to be noted is that a great deal of the statistical information in Australia is practically useless, because it covers a period in which there were two half seasons. In a great producing country like Australia we should endeavour to arrange the collection of our statistical information so that it will cover a complete season. In the older countries of Europe the calendar year does cover a complete season. We, in Australia, have adopted the European practice for general convenience, but our calendar year comprises two half seasons. A great deal of our statistical information is rendered valueless for purposes of comparison by the fact that part of it is collected over portion of two years, and the remainder for the calendar year. For the purposes of this census it would be advisable to ask for a return covering the period of the financial year, 1st July to the 30th June. </para>

                        <para>- As this is our final opportunity of dealing with the measure, I desire to emphasize the point made by the honorable member for Richmond, namely, the unfairness of using the information obtained under this Bill for the year ending the 31st Decem- ber last as a basis for the taxation of people whose incomes since that date have been very much reduced owing to the drought and other causes. If the tax is levied on the basis of the figures obtained by this census, they will have to pay out of their shrunken incomes an amount very much out of proportion to their actual earnings during the period for which they have to pay the tax. On the other hand, there are persons who have had an enormous increase of income owing to the national calamity and the position they have occupied as suppliers of various requirements for war purposes. In some instances persons have risen from comparative financial obscurity to positions of affluence, and if the tax be based on information obtained under the census for the period set out in the amendment, those persons will escape their proper share of taxation. Another point that is worthy of consideration is, that persons of comparatively small means might be allowed to pay the taxation in instalments extending over a period instead of in one lump sum. Many persons have experienced a substantial reduction of income, and have had to meet constant appeals to their patriotism, on behalf of various war funds, and they will be placed in an awkward position indeed unless they can be given some consideration in the manner I suggest. </para>

                        <para>- That Bill will have been framed, and there is always a disinclination on the part of a Minister to accept amendments, which are invariably regarded, especially when they emanate from the Opposition, as hostile. Therefore, I mention these points now so that the Attorney-General may give them consideration before drafting the Bill. Some provision ought to be made in the taxing measure to prevent discrimination against members of Parliament by the State departmental officials. In New South Wales there is discrimination against Federal members in regard to State income tax. There provision exists for deducting the amount of money expended in earning one's income, but such a deduction is not allowed to Federal members resident in New South Wales. They are not permitted to deduct even election expenses, and are allowed as a matter of grace only a paltry deduction of £10 from their parliamentary allowance, notwithstanding that they have to maintain two homes, and incur many other expenses which they would not have to do as private individuals. </para>

There should not be discrimination against a taxpayer, because he happens to be a public man. Members of Parliament should be treated in exactly the same way as private individuals.

After the lapse of that interval a prosecution may follow, and the Senate has provided for a fine of £5.

                        <para>- I think that there should be no fine at all. Persons in the back country are continually changing their residences. Many of them live in tents, which they are constantly moving from one place to another; and, according to a decision under the Queensland electoral law, a tent is not a residence. How will such persons be affected by this provision ? </para>

                    <para>. - It is understood that the Government intends to propose an income tax, and I assume that the details obtained from the wealth census will not be used for the income tax assessments, but that citizens will be required to furnish special income tax returns. If information regarding the work of the community is required for record purposes only, it does not matter much whether the date which has been discussed is fixed as the 31st December, 1914, or the 30th June, 1915. As to the income tax returns, however, would it not be fair to base the income tax for next year on the income for this? </para>

                        <para>- Am I right in assuming that a trading company may make up the return required under the Bill from its last balance-sheet, even though that balance-sheet may be six months' old ? Many trading companies cannot make up their returns quickly, because they need some months for stock-taking. </para>

                        <para>- The matter must De considered. Personally, I think that that would be unnecessary, except to provide a check. We wish to ascertain the wealth of our citizens; but it may be that some of the wealth of the community is so held that it would not be shown -by any partner's or shareholder's returns. Certain reserves might be of that nature. In such cases, we should need returns from the company as well as from those constituting it. I do not think that that could happen with partnerships. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the idea seems to be to keep 100,000 men in the fighting line ; and to do this we must have from 130,000 to 150,000 men enrolled. At present we are getting the men by voluntary effort, and in Victoria in two weeks something like 20,000 enlisted. It appears to me that these statistics, regarding men from eighteen to sixty, will be practically useless, so far as this war is concerned, if the ultimate goal be what I have indicated. We must recognise the fact that the expense limits the number of men we can put in the field; and if we think that 100,000 is a fair contribution, that number can be raised by voluntary effort. Anything  necessary  in the way of the selection of recruits can be done by regulation, so as to retain those here who are required in the manufacture of munitions. </para>

                        <para>- I was under the impression that this was regarded as the last opportunity we should have to consider the measure, and that we were discussing it as on a third reading. However, I shall confine myself to a more limited area. Different methods are adopted in different States in the collection of income taxation; and in no State has it been found necessary to have a wealth census before imposing the taxation. If the idea is an income tax, or even an increased land tax, where is the necessity to throw on the people of Australia such an enormous amount of work? I largely agree with the remark of the honorable member for Capricornia, that, unless there is an idea of taxing some of the capital wealth of Australia, the Bill will cause, I shall not say a waste of public money, but, at any rate, useless  expendi.ture  at the present time. The information called for may be all right for statistical purposes, as an addition to the information gathered at the present time by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> ; but, in the absence of an intention to impose a wealth tax, I fail to see its utility. </para>

                    <para>.- It is just as well for us to remember that honorable members have drawn certain conclusions from these amendments, as they will affect taxation proposals in the future ; and, if we are to regard this measure from a taxation point of - view, we ought to be very careful to have every question so plain and intelligible that it can be thoroughly understood by those concerned. Every person between the ages of eighteen and sixty has to furnish truthful returns; and I suggest that the Attorney-General, before he accepts amendment No. 10, should go carefully into the matter, and see whether it is as intelligible as it appears on the surface. For instance, what does the " unimproved capital value of land " mean ? What does it include <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Does it include freehold and leasehold, or does it merely mean the capital value of freehold lands or those in process of becoming freehold ? If it does include freehold as well as leasehold, where is the necessity for the amendment which asks the individual to give a return of the unimproved value of his leasehold land ? Although I am supposed to have some acquaintance with the land laws of Australia, I do not know what these provisions mean; and I do not see how, under the circumstances, we can expect a truthful and intelligent return to be made by a country youth of eighteen or a little over. Such a youth, of course, is under penalty in the event of making a mistake ; and it is most inadvisable to have any overlapping or duplication. Under one provision which is not affected by the amendments before us, an owner of property has to give a return of the value of his live stock; and I ask the Attorney-General to inform me how a man is to arrive at the unimproved value of a leasehold' estate if it be separated from the stock that the leasehold carries. What value has a leasehold without the stock ? These are all matters that ought to be made quite clear, so that youths of eighteen and over may be able to reasonably, truthfully, and quickly supply the information sought. I say definitely that if I cannot get an expression of opinion from the Attorney-General on these points, I propose to move at the proper time that we do not accept the amendment No. 10. </para>

                    <para>- The Attorney-General told us that the alteration in amendment No. 10 is purely a matter of convenience, and that the new methods proposed had' been adopted because the original form was not recognised in any Taxation Department. I point out, however, that the new suggestion will bring in a great deal more revenue than the old one, because it alters the basis of taxation in a very large degree. It represents all the difference between taking a property over as a going concern and buying land and stocking it afterwards. If a man wishes to make a good sale, he does not sell a property as a going concern, but usually disposes of the land and the stock separately; and, as I say, there is just about the same difference between the old and the new methods of taxation proposed. There is a vast difference between the unimproved capital value of land and the capital value of land including the value of all improvements ; and I hope that the Attorney-General will not - unintentionally, of course - deceive the Committee by saying that there is no difference. If the new method is adopted it will mean probably half as much more taxation as would the old method. There is another point that appeals to the man with practical experience on the land, and that is, that an owner has to return the value of " all improvements, including houses- and buildings thereon." I hope that the valuation under this measure will not be on the same basis as that usually selected. The usual way of arriving at the value of improvements is to find their cost and allow a certain ' amount every year for depreciation. But tha does not give the value of the improvements. In many cases, owing to altered conditions, the value has ceased to exist. The cost may have been heavy in the first place, and the percentage written off for, perhaps, only three or four years, and yet the value may have vanished absolutely. One man may make improvements at the cost of thousands of pounds, and a subsequent purchaser of the property may put these, not at what they cost, but at their real value, which may be only a few hundred pounds. Unless we are going to crush the people who are responsible for production, it is essential that we should have the unimproved value of the land with the improvements thereon - not separately - and that the improvements should be put at their real earning value, and- not at their cost less an amount for depreciation. I hope that the War Committee will go fully into these two phases of the question, because the matter is of some importance to the producers of Australia, and will have an important bearing upon the future of the production of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I said, a few days ago, when the Bill was under consideration, that the second schedule would be referred to the War Committee. That is quite in conformity with the principle affecting government by regulation, lt would be quite open to the Government to send out the schedule, without referring it to the Committee, and with any question we liked to put upon it. The Bill provides for that being done; but, in order that the House might know exactly what it was doing, I said that the Government would not, in any circumstances, allow the first schedule to be dealt with by the War Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think there is much force in the argument just advanced by the honorable member for Indi. The Government are given power under this Bill to make regulations, and a regulation will be framed covering any amendment made in the second schedule. It is proposed that that schedule shall he submitted to the War Committee, and no doubt any reasonable suggestion made by the Committee will be adopted. I would remind the honorable member for Indi that from day to day regulations are made by the Government, and that those regulations have to be laid on the table, so that the House if it thinks fit may disagree with them. Although it is not expressly stated, I gather from the second schedule, as amended by another place, that leases from the Crown will be included in this return. It seems to me that the proposal to require a return as to the value of improvements on leasehold as well as on freehold lands should be carefully considered. Improvements on land leased from the Crown are of no value to the tenant unless he is to have a continuous use of that land. I think it would have been far better to omit from the schedule the provision that a return shall be made in respect of improvements on Crown lands leased from the States, and to confine the census to freehold lands and freeholds that are leased. I do not approve of the Bill at the present time, as it will not be necessary during the war, and I certainly do not think the second schedule is necessary. I fail to understand why in this time of trouble and difficulty we should burden the people of Australia by taking such a census, in view of the fact that the information to be collected is, I believe, for all practical purposes, already in the possession of the Statistical Departments of the Commonwealth and States. Unfortunately, when a pertinent question is put to the Attorney-General, the only answer given is usually an offensive personal remark. A few days ago, I asked him whether the information proposed to be obtained was not already for the most part in the possession of the Government Statistician?  That was a pertinent and courteous inquiry, but the only reply I received was that the views I held dated back from Pharaoh's tomb. That was a rude answer to a courteous question. The honorable gentleman is, I regret to say, very apt to make an offensive reply to an inconvenient inquiry.  </para>

All that is proposed is that the War Committee shall have an opportunity to express its opinion on the final revise, and to make any suggestions. The Government, however, must be the responsible authority, and it cannot share its responsibility with any one. </para>

The honorable member for Flinders said he would permit the schedule to go through in its present form, though he said there were important alterations that must be made before the schedule is submitted to the people. I assume that the honorable member for Flinders, being a member of the War Committee, will, in that case, make a determined effort in that Committee to have the schedule altered in accordance with his ideas. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that this portion of the Bill will come under the Attorney-General's immediate supervision, I take it that he will not only be a member of the War Committee, but that he will preside over its deliberations on this particular matter. That being the case, I see no reason why a special meeting of this Committee should not be convened by the Attorney-General, who, as he will preside, ought also to be the convener. If the War Committee can meet on Wednesday, there is no reason why the schedule as then finally agreed upon should not be submitted to this Committee on Thursday. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the suggestion that any amendments to the schedule introduced by the War Committee should be placed before the House is a good one, but the point to which I desire now to draw the notice of the Attorney-General is that no protection is afforded in the schedule to soldiers who are at the front. If we pass the Bill as it now stands, the men fighting at the Dardanelles will be brought under its penalty provisions. Cannot some further clause be inserted, taking that aspect of the situation into account? Regarding the proposed amendment to question 7 in Schedule 2, by which " 31st December, 1914," is to be substituted for "30th June, 1915," I wish to foreshadow a further amendment altering the date back to 30th June, 1915. As a matter of convenience, the 31st December will suit most country people. Income-tax returns, returns for the Pastoral Protection Boards and other bodies have to be made up to that date. The .preparation of these returns often means a b:g income for solicitors and agents who now are employed on behalf of their country clients. I know that many farmers in my own electorate pay more in fees for the preparation of their schedules than the amounts actually collected by taxation. For the convenience of these people, and for general convenience, I would like to see the date in the schedule altered to 31st December, 1914, but I do not think that it is right that people should be taxed for six months prior to the date when the tax is due, and I sacrifice the convenient aspect of the question in order that people should not be called upon to pay more than they are entitled to pay. </para>

I am sorry if the right honorable member thought that I intended to be rude to him. It was a mere jocular remark. T. ask him to accept my assurance that I did not intend to be rude.

                <para>The honorable member for Maribyrnong, and other honorable members, have spent a good deal of time discussing the proposal that the war census schedule should be submitted to the War Committee. I am sorry now that I ever made that suggestion. I made it with the object of saying time. It has not saved any time at all, for honorable members are now discussing the schedule with such avidity that it might be regarded as the only bone upon which their legislative jaws could find exercise. Yet there has not been one suggestion for the improvement of the schedule. If honorable members do not desire the Committee to make amendments, why do they not themselves suggest how the schedule may be improved ? The schedule has been materially improved since it was first submitted to the Chamber. I am told that the honorable member for Flinders says that the schedule requires drastic alteration. I dc not think it does; but if it does, I invite honorable members to point out what those drastic alterations should be. I agree that the War Committee should be called together to deal with this schedule as quickly as possible. I ask honorable members to make the labours of the War Committee an absolute sinecure by making the schedule perfect before it leaves this House. To send the Bill to the War Committee and then bring it back to the House would not be the way <inline font-style="italic">bp</inline> expedite business. If the War Committee make any suggestions which involve a radical alteration of the schedule, we will submit it to the House again, but mere minor alterations relating to the manner in which the desired information is to be obtained are not matters of importance to the House at all. If there be drastic alterations which alter, limit, or extend the scope of the inquiry beyond the bounds set forth in the schedule as printed, I will submit them to the House. </para>

It is suggested that the War Committee shall meet at 2.15 on Wednesday next, so that the schedule can be dealt with before the House meets on that day. After all, the Government have the responsibility for any alteration, and no alteration of a vital nature will be made without the House having a further opportunity of discussing the schedule. </para>

I take it that the Committee will be bound by the general intentions of the measure. The object will be to get somebody from outside Parliament who will have to do with the ultimate making up of the returns, and ask him if we can achieve the objects of the Bill without undue interference with people's private affairs. </para>

What is the use of putting the public to unnecessary trouble when the same ends can be otherwise achieved, whilst at the same time reducing inconvenience to a minimum. If there be any changes of policy suggested by the War Committee, surely honorable members can trust the Government to attend to them. The War Committee can do nothing except what the Government ultimately permit them to do. </para>

                        <para>- What outsider can alter the schedules? Parliament has given the Government infinitely greater plenary powers in connexion with the war regulations than in connexion with the war census. In framing all his war regulations, the Attorney-General has, no doubt, obtained information wherever it was obtainable, with a view to making the regulations as effective as possible, whilst at the same time causing a minimum of inconvenience to the people. This schedule is in the absolute power always of the Executive of the country. The criticism by honorable members opposite means that they cannot trust their own Executive. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the honorable member for Calare. It must be obvious to every man who has read of the circumstances of all Australia, that the incomes of many people in 1915 will be vastly different from their incomes in 1914. For instance, the incomes of the sugar farmers, the dairy farmers, and other men on the land for 1915 will be much lower than their incomes in 1914. I think, therefore, that we should adhere to the schedule as it passed this House, providing for a return of income for the year ending 30th June, 1915. </para>

                    <para>.- We shall be making a mistake if we do not accept the Senate's amendment providing for a return of income for the year ending 31st December. Most business firms, as well as private people, have already made up their balance-sheets to the end of 1914. and I do not think the Government desire to inconvenience large firms and business houses by involving them in the expense of making a special balance-sheet for the year ended the 30th June, 1915. </para>

                <para>This is purely a financial matter, but it may not be out of place to give honorable members some information as to the actual position of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. It is thought that the line will be open for traffic at the end of 1916, and I have no reason to doubt that, if no unforeseen contingency arises, the estimate will be correct. The speed limit at first will be 30 miles an hour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> when Engineer-in-Chief of Railways, made an estimate for an unballasted track and 70-lb. rails. </para>

                            <para>- It has been repeatedly urged that this Government has increased the cost of the line, but it is easily seen that an unballasted track with 70-lb. rails must be less costly than a ballasted track with 80-lb. rails. According to the progress report for the week ended 17th July last, the earthworks at the Kalgoorlie end of the line had been carried as far as 289 miles 40 chains, while the platelaying has been completed as far as 288 miles 28 chains, and the telegraph line has been erected for the same distance. At the Port Augusta end the earthworks have been made for 292 miles 8 chains, and the platelaying and telegraph lines have been carried out for 290 miles 48 chains. The men employed on the construction works number 2,477, of whom 1,281 are working at the Kalgoorlie end, and 1,196 at the Port Augusta end. The total length of the line will be 1,053 miles, and the rails have been laid for 579 miles, or more than half the distance, although the line has not been properly ballasted for any great length. In the opinion of experienced engineers, including the Engineer-in-Chief, a speed limit of 30 miles an hour is a fair one for an unballasted track. </para>

                            <para>- There is a school of engineering whose members preach the advantages of cheap unballasted tracks, and are not very particular about the safety of the travelling public. There are a great many engineers of that school in America. It appears not to matter much to them how many persons are killed or meet with accidents, because compensation can always be offered. On the other &lt;hand, there are those who believe in a safe, solid, and well-ballasted track. As an illustration of such work, I may point to the Canadian railway now in course of construction, though I do not think quite finished, from Quebec to Port Rupert, about 450 miles north of Vancouver. That line is being built partly by the Canadian Government and partly by the private company, and large sums of money have been spent in making the track solid and substantial, the promoters being of the opinion that this is the most economical method of construction. There are many other points of interest in connexion with that railway to which reference could be made, but time does not permit, and I refer honorable members to it as a very notable event in the history of railway construction. Of course I do not wish honorable members to think that an exactly similar policy is being carried* out by the Government in connexion with the transcontinental railway; but we have taken what I might call a middle course. I do not know that, as a layman, I have any right to express an opinion, but I do hold very strong views in opposition to a cheap and unballasted track. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have sleepers for about 900 miles, and rails for about 800 miles have been delivered and paid for. Questions are asked in this House about the progress of the work and the cost; but we must not lose sight of the fact that we have not only paid for the rails and the sleepers, but for a considerable amount of material that is not being immediately utilized, but will certainly represent a part of the cost of the finished line. I refer to this matter only because, on one or two occasions, honorable members have pressed for a report in connexion with this work, and to such requests for information I, of course, raise no objection. I point out, however, that unless a report embraces all these facts that I have mentioned it is only a partial report, and might result in misleading the public. I ought to mention that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, at their new works at Newcastle, are rolling rails for this railway, and will supply all that are necessary for the complete construction of the road. It is only just to say that this company is turning out first-class rails, which have passed all tests, and, according to our own engineers, are absolutely satisfactory. We are all, of course, more or less anxious to keep work as much as possible in the country, and it does not matter much whether that end is attained by the Government or by private employers. The fact remains that steel rails can be rolled in Australia, and are being rolled at the present time. </para>

Rolling-stock to the value of about £500,000 has been paid for, and the total expenditure up to date is £3,700,000. </para>

                            <para>- I have not the figures as to that. I may mention that the first estimate was for 70-lb. rails instead of the 80-lb. rails now being used, the change having been made in accordance with the best advice, and, it is understood, parliamentary wishes, as indicated in debate. Should any honorable member be inclined to object to the alteration, I may remind him that Parliament did desire that there should be 80-lb. rails. It is also worthy of note that the estimate of cost was practically for an unballasted line, and was based on a lower rate of wages than that we are paying at the present time; and, further, the war has affected the price of manufactured material that is necessary in the construction. However with an efficient staff, and the co-operation of the men, we have been able to "peg along," and I have no doubt that we  shalt  succeed in constructing this line within the estimated time, and at the estimated cost. </para>

                        <para>.- There is one very significant admission from the statement just made by the Minister of Home Affairs. Last night the Prime Minister made a very interesting statement, which, however, I understood was only forestalling in an incomplete way what the Minister of Home Affairs was going to tell us to-day, and that was with reference to the linking up of this line, by arrangement with the Western Australian Government, from Kalgoorlie to 'the sea. The Minister has made no reference to that matter. I take it, therefore, that the Prime Minister's statement was based entirely upon some informal discussions he has had with members of the Western Australian Government. </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter. On the South Australian side we can get our material by sea to the railway base. We can ship our material to Port Augusta and send it on from, that point. On the Western Australian side, however, we have to carry our material over the State railways, and have had to pay enormous haulage charges. Those charges having been paid - and I do not blame the Minister - we are now going back from our place of commencement to the place of supply. This is an absurd way of constructing such a line; but no one, apparently, is to blame for it. </para>

                    <para>I am glad that the Minister agrees with me that it would be false economy to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar. In other words, this railway, if it is to be of any value at all, has to pay as an express service.- It is not a transcontinental line in the sense that an American transcontinental railway is in the United States. Until the opening of the Panama Canal there was practically no communication between east and west except by railway, and the onlY competition was that existing as between rival companies. In this country, however, sea communication between east and west is practically as short as Land communication, and unless this line can beat very materially the time occupied by sea transit we are  not  going to secure any passengers for it. </para>

                            <para>- As far as I have been able to go into the matter, I am satisfied that, provided we are able to secure a through communication from Melbourne to Fremantle - if we can do away with any break of gauge either at Kalgoorlie or Port Augusta - and construct a line on the gradient I laid down, namely. 1 in 100, at an average speed of 45 miles per hour, the actual saving of time will be such that people will be prepared to pay the increased cost of travelling by rail. But if we are going to run this service on the basis of the Victorian and New South Wales express rate, which is 33 miles per hour in the case of the best services, we shall not induce any one to travel on this line, and the whole of our capital outlay upon it will be practically wasted. In that consideration the matter of ballast was absolutely vital. When I became a Minister I found that the only provision for ballasting was practically in respect of level crossings. The amount on the estimate was insufficient for practically all other purposes. I immediately gave orders that the line was to be ballasted throughout. Unless that is done we shall secure only with the utmost difficulty a maximum of anything like 30 miles an hour. I am inclined to think that the rate given by the Enginner-in-chief and quoted by the Minister was quoted, not as the average, but as the maximum speed over an unballasted track. There is, of course, a tremendous difference between a maximum and an average speed. On a line with the proper curves and gradients an average speed of 45 miles per hour can be secured, and we must aim at getting an average from Adelaide to Fremantle of at least 45 miles per hour on this service. To do that the Government will have considerable difficulty with the South Australian Government, even if they are able to negotiate themselves out of the difficulty that has arisen with the Western Australian Government. The' Government of Western Australia - and I am not reminding honorable members of this fact with the object of creating any hostility in respect of the present or any past Government of that State - undoubtedly pledged themselves to build at their own cost, simultaneously with the line we are building from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, the railway to the sea to which I have referred. They have not carried out that pledge. I arn not here to hamper with my criticism the negotiations now going on, but, unless our line is linked up with the sea by a 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge railway with the same curves and gradients as our own, all that we are now spending 'will be of very little value. The Government of Western Australia, whether because of force of circumstances or some less worthy reason, have deceived us in the past, and it will be necessary in any negotiations to bind them to build the line to the sea according to the same gradients and the same speed ideal that we are observing in the construction of the transcontinental railway. </para>

                            <para>- There are at present near Kalgoorlie one or two gradients of 1 in SO, which were made before I took office. It is no serious disadvantage, however, to have such a gradient over a short section. It is an easy matter to obtain an additional engine to haul a train over a short section where you have such a gradient, but the moment the ideal I have mentioned is departed from we shall have brought into operation the old State ideal of quick curves and steep gradients, which traffic officers in all the States have been lamenting from the time of its institution. The construction of a line on the cheap-building and heavy-haulage basis is the most expensive of all methods, and its adoption in this case would be suicidal. We must have on the transcontinental railway an .absolutely express service as understood in America or the Old Country. Without it our line will be of no use. There is an extraordinary difficulty with the State  Government  so far as the South Australian end is concerned, and it is due largely, I believe, to the personal views of one of the officers of the South Australian Railway Department. When I held office as Minister, I urged very strongly that the utmost pressure should be put upon the South Australian Government - and I endeavoured to do this, also, personally, over here - to insure that the new line from Adelaide to Port Augusta should be built according to our models with respect to gauge, gradients, and curves. It appeared, however, that the South Australian Chief Commissioner of Railways thought that the line to Port Augusta should be built on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, his reason for this being that it would be extremely inconvenient to have a break of gauge in Adelaide! We do not want any break of gauge anywhere. Our desire is that the line shall be built on the same gauge right through from east to west. We do not want any sectional or parochial influence to interfere with our ambition in this respect, which is absolutely vital. We have one hold over the South Australian Government, and that is that a uniform gauge line from east, to west is vitally a defence proposition. Indeed, the prime reason for this Parliament entering upon this project with the unanimity with which it eventually entered upon it was that it was recommended by Lord </para>

                    <para class="block">Kitchener as ,a defence proposition. Now, if there is any point where a ' break of gauge is a matter of supreme military concern it is where you are away from your centres of mobilization. A break of gauge in a mobilization centre is not vitally important, because there you can get your men away in any direction by any of the lines; but with a break of gauge far removed from your centre of mobilization there is absolute chaos, rolling-stock converging from both ends, and an absolute dead-lock taking place in the free passing of troops east and west. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly; but I am putting forward the defence ground now, because it is a lever that we may use to move the State Government. Many a State Government has the unfortunate habit of saying to the Commonwealth when it is approached, "This is our business; be good enough to look after your own." We have to consider what weapons we have at. hand when met with such an argument. I am pointing out we have this defence weapon, and if South Australia will not meet us in our desire that there shall be a line of uniform gauge right through to Adelaide, we might ourselves build a line, under our defence powers, from Port Augusta up through Quorn. The only difficulty likely to arise would be in securing the same grades and curves between Port Augusta and Quorn. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but the linking up of this line from Port Augusta to Adelaide direct on the 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge cannot be too strongly urged at the present moment, since . the State Government are already pushing ahead with their 5-ft. 3-in. project. I believe that at base it is the false doctrine of the one man to whom I have referred which is at the back of that project. </para>

                    <para>There is one other consideration and that is as to the running rights of our carriages on the Australian railways. Long before the present Minister came into office the various State Railways Commissioners arrived at an arrangement in regard to the load gauges, for tunnel purposes, and so forth, of all new rolling-stock to be built. We are building to that load gauge, and I think we ought to aim ultimately at securing free running rights for our trains over all Australian lines. I have in mind the ordinary free running rights which obtain even as between rival railway roads in the United States of America. Any train going from Sydney to Fremantle ought to be able to run straight through without passengers being called upon to change at any point. </para>

                    <para>This is not the time to talk about closing down this railway construction. Such a decision would involve very serious waste. The country in certain districts is of such a nature that, if an embankment were constructed to-day, it would probably be blown away to-morrow if left uncovered; so that the quicker the rails and ballast are put into position the better. As a matter of fact, no wind at all is needed to disturb that soil. I remember seeing an excavator working at a distance of 10 miles. There was a huge pillar of dust above. The soil is so light and friable - so very fine - that it is taken up by the merest breath. </para>

                            <para>- It is not; and, recognising the arduous and trying nature of their work, I gave an increase of wages to the men. For the safety of the line, and in the interests of economy, the quicker the ballast and the rails are put down, the better. I, therefore, urge upon the Minister, whilst pushing ahead with his platelaying record - which I recognise is good - to also remember this aspect of the question. Do not let us contemplate the possibility of being able to travel only 30 miles an hour over the line completed in 1916. Let us have something better, so that we may be in a position to realize that within a very short time of the opening it will be possible to travel at true express speed over a finished line from Fremantle to Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Wentworth cannot be in touch with the real difficulties in the way of construction, or he would realize that the absence of ballast is not the only anxiety being felt in this work. The chief difficulty is the absence of rollingstock. </para>

                            <para>- It was insisted that this work should be done in Australia by Australian contractors; but in no single instance has a contractor kept to the terms of his arrangement. Engines that were very badly required have not been delivered, and I understand that the Toowoomba firm engaged in engine construction is practically in a state of insolvency. Contractors for the rails have similarly been behind time, and the remark applies particularly to the gentleman from New South Wale3, who sat in the gallery for months and months, until he got the contract. </para>

                            <para>- Then I will ask the Minister that, before any arrangement is fixed up with Western Australia, he will give the House an opportunity of knowing the details. I have it on good authority that if that line is left in the hands of the Western Australian Government there will be no trains running in June, 1916. They have not the necessary plant, and without that the work cannot possibly be proceeded with, though it is very necessary that we should push on, because of the large amount of capital already involved. There is no doubt that considerable dissatisfaction exists amongst the men working at the different ends of the line, and I want to impress upon the Minister the fact that it will be calamitous if anything in the nature of a strike takes place just now. </para>

Work in these sand-hills, where the average rainfall is only about 6 inches, is much harder than it would be on firm country. At the Western Australian end the position is much easier from the point of view both of working and camping. When the Minister of Home Affairs conceded an additional rate of wages to the men at the Port Augusta, end, it was because they had to work in difficult country ; and I hope that, before the Minister comes to a final decision on the question of wages, he will bear in mind that there are other circumstances to be taken into account beyond that concern ing the mere cost of living. It is a fair thing that all the men employed should get an equivalent rate of pay, otherwise there will be trouble. I have every confidence, if there is no cessation of work, that by June, 1916, the two branches of this line will be nearly linked up. But it must be clearly understood that the line cannot be ballasted by that time, on account of the absence of rolling-stock. </para>

                            <para>- I think better water has been found now; but, in any case, there is no doubt this has been a colossal work. The material that has to be transported now is equivalent to one-third of the whole transport over the Victorian railways, a fact which speaks eloquently of the work that had to be done. There may have been mistakes, just as there are mistakes in all big works; but I feel confident that in the end this railway will stand out, a magnificent undertaking, a credit to the men who have carried it out. I think both  ends  will have been connected within the time stipulated, unless there is labour trouble; and in this regard I would urge the Minister to give the men the benefit of any doubt he may have in his mind. The wages paid are 13s. at one end, and 12s. 2d. at the other, and it is difficult to induce the men to believe that there is that difference in the work which would justify a variation of lOd. per day in the wages. I feel confident that the Minister will do his best to agree to what is a fair proposition. I again impress upon him that there is no more uncomfortable section of the line than that which the men will have to work on in the next stage. I speak as one who has done railway work under contractors in Victoria, and I know how arduous it 's to be continually shovelling sand in a climate such as that in which the men on the transcontinental railway are working. </para>

                        <para>. - I am much obliged to the Minister for the information he has given to the House. It must be gratifying to every honorable member to be told that the rails have been laid for 578 miles out of the whole length of 1,053 miles - more than half the length of the line. The progress henceforth will, I believe, be more rapid. The sand hills in South Australia, west of Tarcoola, represent the only extensive stretch of sand along the route, and when they have been negotiated the . line will traverse level country for the whole distance to Kalgoorlie. When Western Australia is criticised for not having constructed a broad-gauge line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, as the Parliament of that State undertook to do, I hope it will not be forgotten that there is no statutory undertaking to that effect. There was a statutory undertaking covering a period of five years., but that period has expired, and now the only obligation on the State Government is one of good faith. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure we can. The default has not been due to the unwillingness of the Western Australian people or Government to carry out the undertaking, but to the fact that the State has temporarily fallen on bad times- The Government, are short of money, and they have a deficit of over £1,000,000 on current account. The present Premier has repeatedly said that he is willing to fulfil what he acknowledges to be an obligation, but he has not the means to do so immediately. If some arrangement for providing the means can be devised between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline> will be willing to proceed with the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle section of the line. I understand that a survey has been made, and that a ruling gradient of 1 in 80 has been obtained. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I understand that they have found a suitable route. I think the Western Australian Government are undertaking; a good deal more than is necessary. To build a new line from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie is unnecessary at the present time. That work would cost, perhaps, £1,500,000, and the difficulties of getting money in these days are very great. I have been informed that it would be possible to lay another rail along the existing track. </para>

At any rate, it seems to me that the building of a new line is at present a serious matter for the State Government to undertake. Therefore, I hope they will utilize the present line, and improve it when they have the means and the opportunity. The east-west railway has always been associated with Western Australia. The fact seems to be overlooked that 600 miles of the total length of 1,053 miles is through South Australian territory. The railway will be of just as much benefit to the people of South Australia as to those of Western Australia, but the latter is committed to the construction of a broad gauge line from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie - a distance of 387 miles - whilst South Australia is not asked to spend a farthing, and this while there are 600 miles of the railway in South Australia, and only 453 miles in Western Australia. I hope that people will remember that fact, and also realize that Western Australia at the present time has a much smaller population than South Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">Act for the transfer of the Northern Territory many years after. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth Government will inquire as to the way in which the State Government can be assisted in regard to the building of the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle section. It may not be possible to put that work in hand at present, but the two Governments must endeavour to work together in some way, so that the work may be completed, and there may be a through line from Adelaide to Fremantle, with only one change of gauge, I hope at Adelaide. I do appeal to the Minister to try to induce the South Australian Government to construct the line from Port Augusta to Adelaide on the 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge, so that the break of gauge shall be at Adelaide, which will then be the terminus of the east- west railway. In conversations I had with a member of the previous State Government of South Australia, he seemed to take a reasonable view of that proposal. It must be better to have the break of gauge in a great city where there is accommodation for passengers, rather than at a much smaller centre. I believe it would be of advantage to South Australia, as it would certainly be to Western Australia and to the passengers on the line to have the one break of gauge in Adelaide. I should like to point out the advantage that this east-west railway will be as a connexion between the eastern and western railway systems. The Commonwealth had in 1913-14 22,000 miles of railway, of which 4,000 were in Western Australia and 18,000 miles in eastern Australia. A line of 1,053 miles will connect up two systems, and of that distance 578 miles of rails have been laid. In the matter of railway construction Western Australia is far in advance of South Australia and Tasmania, and even in advance of Victoria. According to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> for 1913-14, the mileage of open railways in the various States was: New South Wales, 4,246; Victoria, 3,886; Queensland, 5,213 ; South Australia, 2,357; Western Australia, 3,910; Tasmania, 766; and the Northern Territory, 146. </para>

                            <para>- No. The foregoing figures represent only lines that are actually open. Everybody must realize that a work which will connect two separate systems of 18,000 and 4,000 miles respectively must be of great advantage to the whole Commonwealth. Sometimes this line is compared with a railway to places where there is no population. The transcontinental railway will pass through the Golden Mile, which is 387 miles from Fremantle, and is the richest square mile of gold-bearing country in the world. Kalgoorlie and Boulder have a population of 30,000, and I repeat that a railway which is to connect eastern Australia with a community such as that cannot be likened to railways that are to be built for developmental purposes and have no immediate reproductive outlook, although it is hoped and believed that they will be of great value in the future. The east-west railway will not pass through a desert. The idea that the territory between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie is a desert of sand has been exploded. The only considerable extent of sand is situated on the South Australian side, westward of Tarcoola, and there is no sand at all on the Western Australian portion of the route. For 600 miles the line crosses an open limestone plain, which, although there is no surface water, is covered with vegetation in good seasons. There are 20,000,000 acres of land there covered with grass and salt-bush, the herbage in very good seasons being a foot high. The rainfall on this area is within the 10 inches per annum, but I think is rarely that amount. Honorable members know that many fairly good sheep stations are situated in country having an average rainfall of less than 10 inches. The railway will enable sheep to be moved into this district when feed is plentiful there and scarce elsewhere, and will allow them to be taken away again when the feed there becomes scarce.I do not think that I need say any more on the subject now. The work has got beyond the stage at which it meets with opposition. I would only add that, notwithstanding my long connexion with, and advocacy of, this project, I never heard it even mentioned until about a year ago that the line was originally designed as an unballasted line. According to the then Engineer of Commonwealth Railways - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> - report, dated 20th September, 1911. an estimate is given of the approximate cost of the whole work, giving the items of cost in detail, and among the items is " sleepers and ballast, £1,038,000." A few weeks ago I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> in this building, by accident, and told him that I had heard it said that the line was designed as an unballasted line. He replied, "Nothing of the kind; the reason that that is said is because for a long distance the track crosses a limestone plain, where the foundation is sound, and little ballast will be needed." Thus the cost of ballasting is much less than it would be if the surface were everywhere loose. According to an official minute which the Minister has just handed to me, it is stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> original estimate of the cost of the line is £4,045,000, not including ballast. This statement is at variance with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> report on 20th September, 1911, above quoted, and is altogether at variance with my own knowledge of what was being done, for I need hardly say I would never have approved of an unballasted line. I have always said that the work would be carried out for £4,000,000, but it now seems likely to cost £5,000,000. It must be remembered, however, that the rate of wages, which was 8s. a day when the work was commenced, is now 12s. 6d. a day; that 80-lb., instead of 70-lb., rails are being used; and that many other things have tended to increase the cost. Everything is being done for the comfort and health of those employed on the line. A friend of mine, who is a medical officer connected with the work, showed me in Perth some photographs of his quarters and of the hospital, both of which are on wheels. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Swan that the people of Western Australia will have cause for gratitude when the line is finished. The fact that the completion of the line is now within measurable distance is very pleasing to those who in days gone by have taken a prominent part in advocating its construction. T do not wish to sound a discordant note, but it is not to be forgotten that, although the right honorable member for Swan has consistently advocated and supported this project, it is the Labour party that must be given the credit for carrying it out. The honorable member for Wentworth said that thirty miles an hour would be the maximum, rather than the average, speed travelled on the line, but he has overlooked the fact that ballasting is being proceeded with as fast as rolling-stock for the purpose is made available, and .within the next eighteen months a considerable length will be ballasted. On the ballasted sections the speed will be more than thirty miles an hour, and the average is likely to be quite thirty miles an hour. </para>

                            <para>- In Western Queensland the speed on earth-ballasted lines is limited to eighteen miles an hour. The ideal to be aimed at on this line is an average speed of fifty miles an hour. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the line will not have been opened long before trains are running over it at that rate. I am glad that the Government is discussing with the Government of Western Australia the question of a loan to provide for the widening of the gauge of the line between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle. The Scaddan Administration had provided the money necessary for that work, but, owing to the stringency of the London market eighteen months" or two years ago, it had to re-appropriate the money for other purposes. Now that the Commonwealth Government is likely to come to its assistance, the work ought to be completed before very long. The honorable member for Grey wanted to know if I had any authority for saying that the Government of Western Australia would discontinue the making of developmental lines, to concentrate its energies on the widening of this line. I had no authority for saying that, and I did not say it. What I said was that the Government of Western Australia has constructed hundreds of miles of railway each year, and that it is absurd to suppose that it has not plant for the widening of the gauge of the line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. The Government of Western Australia is as desirous as we are that the widening of the gauge of that line should be completed simultaneously with the completion of the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. The honorable member for Grey would have us impose conditions upon the spending of the money proposed to be lent, but recently, in advancing £18,000,000 to the States, we imposed no such conditions, and there is no need to do so in this case. </para>

                            <para>- The loan will be a pure matter of business arrangement between the two authorities, but the money will have to be advanced without imposing any stipulation as to its expenditure. Honorable members must not lose sight of the fact that the Western Australian Government have over 3,000 miles of railway to deal with, besides the particular work to which I have referred. As the Fremantle-Kalgoorlie line is, in a sense, an artery running east and west through the State system, the State authorities will be faced with the question of converting the whole of their lines to a gauge of 4 ft. 8£ in., or have breaks of gauge here, there, and everywhere. It is not merely a matter of the State undertaking the financing of 387 miles of railway; they will have to face the continual cost of trans-shipment at each junction from the time the line is built until, with the expansion of their finances and commerce, they can undertake the conversion of the remainder of their system. I could mention at least half-a-dozen places where it would be necessary to tranship traffic if the FremantleKalgoorlie is linked on to the main line. </para>

I do not know what the State Government intend to do. A survey is completed from Midland Junction to Kalgoorlie, and at present the remainder - a matter of about 20 miles as the crow flies - is being surveyed. Should money be available through the Commonwealth Treasurer, as I hope it will, the 'State Government will then be in a position to make a commencement without delay. They ought to experience no difficulty whatever in completing this section within a reasonable time, and inaugurating the service from Fremantle to Port Augusta. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to add a word or two to what the honorable member for Grey has said in regard to the payment of the men who are doing the practical work of this railway. It is quite easy for us, of course, to discuss ways and means, and talk about curves; and we are prone to forget that away out in this arid desert, if we choose to call it so, these men are bringing about the consummation of this great work. The conditions under which they live and labour are such as no honorable member would care about " touching with a 40-ft. pole." I have been out to the 98-mile peg, and I had the pleasure of riding back on an open truck in the face of a gale of wind and small rain. I was like a Red Indian when I arrived, and it was a week before I was able to thoroughly clean myself. The Minister has had an assurance from the union that controls the work on the line that they will give an undertaking, as they did to the ex-Minister, to do the whole of the work a.t a given rate ; and it is now within the power of the honorable gentleman to close with an agreement that will insure the line being constructed within the time specified. These men are not asking one penny more than has bs:m granted to the workers on the western section. For a long time the workers on the </para>

                    <para class="block">South Australian side were working at the same rate as the men on the Western Australian side; but the latter realized that their labour was worth more, and they successfully sent their representative to negotiate with the Minister in Victoria. The men on the South Australian side claim that they entered into an agreement with the ex-Minister, and honorably kept it; and that honorable gentleman made the arrangement because he realized that their claim was justified. The men are now getting into the very heart of Central Australia, and work under conditions that it would be hard to parallel anywhere, unless  further  north. Further, the conditions, apart from those of the work, .are not of the best; and all they are asking for is 13s. a day - the same rate that has been granted on the Western Australian section. It has been argued that the cost of living is greater in Kalgoorlie and on the western section ; but I submit that the cost of living should not be taken as the basis. We must admit that on the Western Australian side the country is wooded, and altogether better to work in. We have the assurance of the secretary of the organization last week that on one occasion when he was on the job on the eastern side the men had to sleep out in the open, because all the tents were blown down in a squall. If an agreement were entered into on the terms desired, the Minister would be on safe ground, because he could calculate on the work being done to a finish. To show that the rate asked is not an outside one, I may mention that, in the fruit-growing areas of the ranges of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Buchanan ha3 awarded railway men  a minimum wage of 10s. a day, although their conditions are infinitely better than they are in the middle of Australia, the proximity of the capital giving them opportunities for better food. At the present time, men on the eastern section are receiving 12s. 2d. per day, and they ask for an extra 10d., now that they have fulfilled their agreement with the ex-Minister. The argument is all iu favour of the men; and I hope that the Minister will realize that the moTe quickly the line is finished the better it will be for the Commonwealth. Even from that point of view, it would be wise  to enter into the agreement, but I am supporting the men on the ground of justice and equity. If the Minister is well advised, he will make the conditions such that the men will do their best to carry out his desires. </para>

                    <para>- In the course of my remarks last night I stated that a delay had taken place in the Department of External Affairs in the sending on of a message from the Defence Department. My reason for saving that was that, on the file given me from the Defence Department, there was a letter dated 30th March, whereas the High Commissioner referred to a cable from the External Affairs Department dated 7th April. I have received from the Minister of External Affairs a statement prepared in his office to the effect that the letter requesting the transmission of the telegram, although originally dated 30th March, was not sent on that date; and that on the copy that the Department of External Affairs got the date of the Defence Department's request was altered to the 5th April. That does not appear on the file that was given to me. But the letter was only received by the Department of External Affairs on the 7th, at which date the cable was despatched. I make this personal explanation so that the blame may not rest on the wrong shoulders. There seems to he an additional cause of complaint against the Department of Defence. </para>

Quite recently the Prime Minister announced that he had received from the Home Government what was practically a request that we should send to the front every man of military age whom we could spare; and I would like, therefore, to learn whether, amongst the 800 immigrants on the <inline font-style="italic">Benalla,</inline> who, no doubt, are Being brought out by State Governments, there are any men of military age. If there are, then I can only say that their coming here <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> inconsistent with the appeal from the Imperial Government. I question the wisdom of bringing immigrants to Australia at the present time. No doubt the time will arrive when the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the State Governments, will have to take into consideration the advisableness of carrying out a system of immigration, but this is not an opportune time for such a policy. Notwithstanding that thousands of men are leaving our shores to participate in the struggle now going on in Europe, the number of unemployed in the different States shows no sign of diminution. From my point of view, the States are pursuing a cruel policy in bringing hundreds of people to Australia during the present time of depression. </para>
