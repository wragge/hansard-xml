                    <para>. - This is a fitting opportunity for making reference to the serious losses which the House has suffered since we last met. It is not often that a  Speaker  has to announce two deaths on the one occasion, and those deaths preceded within so short a space by a third - that of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur,</inline> whom we so greatly deplore. Since the adjournment we have lost <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jolley,</inline> a member of great promise, who represented Grampians, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Howe,</inline> an older member, who represented Dalley. I wish, on behalf of this House, and in conjunction with my right honorable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, to express to the relatives of these gentlemen our sincere sympathy with them in their sad bereavement, and the hope that they may be sustained by those Powers which are always gracious in times of great trial. I trust that it may be long before we have again such a record. I desire also to welcome back, with the greatest cordiality, the  Hon.  Carty Salmon, who is an old member of the House, and whom I am glad to see back, although he differs in his political views from the members of our party. I welcome, too, the new member for Bendigo, who has served in the Parliament of Victoria. I am sure that I voice the feeling of all members in offering a hearty welcome to these gentlemen, and in wishing them every success in the conduct of the national duties to which they have now devoted themselves. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with my right honorable friend, the Leader of the Government, in voicing the deep regret that we all feel at the untimely decease of two members of the House. How long the procession of deaths will continue to move thus rapidly one cannot tell, but the visits of the great enemy of us all have been paid so frequently of late as to have become positively tragic. However, these members have done their work, and have gone hence to complete it, perhaps, elsewhere. They have contributed their modicum of public service in an honorable way towards the building up of the reputation, the credit, and the resources of this great Commonwealth. Happy shall we be if, at the end, it be found that we have done our level best to continue this work, and to give effect to our best aspirations for the land in which we live. I congratulate the two new members on their election to the House. I wish them good health and good luck, and trust that they may render the best of service while they remain with us. I congratulate, too, the honorable member for Corio on his restoration to good health after a very severe illness. I am glad to see him back again in his place. </para>

                            <para>- Whether there will be any further interference with the shipping it is, of course, impossible for me to say, because the transport of troops is, I understand, the first consideration at the present time. However, every effort will be made that the shipment of fruit and trade generally will be interfered with as little as possible. The vessels which are used for the transport of troops, and other defence purposes, are loaded with produce as far as is practicable, and the British Government have asked us to give meat preference over every other commodity. Unfortunately, there has been a great interference with shipping, not only here, but in every part of the world. The </para>

                        <para>- It will be well known, perhaps, to members that the Government announced their intention to remit the duty on oats, straw, hay, and certain other products on account of the conditions under which Australia was suffering during; the recent adjournment. While the Government had no power to remit the duty directly, it was their intention to put a sum on the Estimates to recoup the importers. The Cabinet gave serious consideration to the question of putting maize on the same footing as the other products I have mentioned; but, in view of the fact that, according to information obtained from the States, the production of maize in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria is this year equal to that of other years, the Government could not recommend that step to be taken. The question was considered on several occasions by the Cabinet, but it was not considered advisable to remit the duty. </para>

                        <para>- The Defence Department has its own officers, who proceed through the several States purchasing horses. There are many private agents who correspond with different sellers of horses, and the horses secured by their efforts are rounded up at certain towns on certain days. The officer of the Department then goes to those towns and buys the horses. The Department has no cognisance of anything that takes place between the agents and the sellers. It is only responsible for the actions of its own officer. </para>

                            McCheyne  Anderson was appointed to go through the accounts of the Defence Department, and he has made his report, which I am glad to say is a very satisfactory one. The Government have retained his services in order that lie may investigate in the same manner the accounts of the Department of Home Affairs and the Post and Telegraph Department.

                        <para>- The statement which has appeared in the press in regard to the appointment of a Commission, comprising the honorable member for Herbert and the honorable member for Lang, to visit the islands referred to, is quite correct. The Government have received a great many complaints - some, I think, were received when the honorable member for Angas was in charge of the External Affairs Department - concerning the manner in which the mail contractors are carrying out their obligations. The mail contractors are also traders, and one complaint is of unfair treatment to shippers of cargo to Australia and of goods to the islands. The complaints have been continuous over a number of years, and in Sydney recently they were brought under my notice by a deputation. In the circumstances, it being difficult to obtain reliable advice otherwise, it was found necessary to appoint this Commission to make an unbiased and exhaustive inquiry. </para>

The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department supplied a statement to the effect that they had carried the letters in accordance with instructions supplied to them by the Defence Department, and I understood - I am speaking from memory - that an officer of the Department was in charge of those mails. The point that the right honorable gentleman discussed with me was resolved in this way: that after the troops had been diverted from their original destination to Egypt the mails had gone on, but since that was ended there was no further bother, and no complaints. I have investigated one or two that were brought under my notice, but all complaints arose prior to the notice being given to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department to arrest the mails and keep them in Egypt. </para>

                <para>On the 18th December last, when moving that this House should adjourn until to-day, I stated that while I hoped Parliament would not have occasion to meet before that date, the critical situation of war might render an earlier meeting necessary. I am glad to say that such a, course has not been necessary. The Empire has now been at war for eight months. We have seen many changing phases of the greatest struggle of history. There is no cause for dissatisfaction with the record to date. During these eight months the Navy has realized our highest hopes. Great Britain has succeeded in asserting an almost complete command of the sea. Britain has pushed forward great preparations for a land campaign in Europe. The military resources of the Empire have proved far larger and more quickly available than were thought possible. We have held during a terrible winter an important portion of the French lines in the West, and indeed have made progress; we have achieved considerable local successes in other parts of the world; we face the opening of Spring with the highest hopes for success in this great struggle for freedom. </para>
                <para>Australia has not been neglectful of her duty to the common cause. It may be that the immunity afforded Australians by the command of the seas possessed by the Allies has perhaps prevented our people from realizing to the fullest extent the terrible nature of the struggle in which they, with all other parts of the Empire, are engaged. But we must remember that they have been called upon to face, besides the war, the trials of an unfavorable season. Notwithstanding this, Australia has despatched for service at the front and has in camp preparing for active service there a grand total of 70,101 troops of all ranks, comprising 2,074 officers and 68,027 men of other ranks, with 30,946 horses and 3,098 vehicles. Of this total 43,146 men of all ranks have already been sent abroad; 24,976 are preparing to leave; 1,522 have already seen service in German New Guinea, where a garrison of 457 still remains; and I am more than pleased to be able to announce that, approximately, 80 per cent, of the forces sent abroad have been Australian born. I regret to say that the forces have suffered slight loss. There have been 99 deaths in the force sent abroad and 20 casualties in the force of occupation in German New Guinea. I attach a table showing the position in detail. </para>

                <para>The unchangeable policy of the Government is to train, equip, and transport to the seat of war every available man fit to help defeat our enemies. </para>
                <para>The equipment of such an army has naturally been a task of the greatest magnitude, calling for every ounce of energy that can be exerted. In the matter of woollen material and blankets, practically the whole of the output of the woollen mills throughout the Commonwealth is required to equip tha Expeditionary Forces. Twenty-two mills have been requisitioned and are working up to their full capacity, and in many instances overtime is being worked in the endeavour to execute orders at the earliest possible date. Orders are now running with the different mills for altogether over 2,000,000 yards of cloth for jackets and greatcoats and cord for breeches, for over 1,250,000 yards of flannel for shirts, ica, and for nearly 250,000 blankets. </para>
                <para>These supplies are required before the end of the current year to equip the Expeditionary Forces, together with reinforcements and replacements. </para>
                <para>With regard to clothing, applications have just been invited throughout the Commonwealth from firms willing to make up material into garments for the Department, and orders have been placed with, altogether, 124 firms for a total of 636,210 garments of various kinds. </para>
                <para>Arrangements have been made for the supply of nearly 1,000,000 pairs of boots by 31st December, 1915, distribution being made amongst firms throughout the Commonwealth, while master tanners have been required to guarantee sufficient supplies of leather for all military purposes. </para>
                <para>This effort on the part of Australia in the short space of eight months is a subject for gratification. It stands on a parity proportionate to population with what is being accomplished by our great sister Dominion of Canada. </para>
                <para>But this is not all. The Royal Australian Navy has continued to perform the good work which it has carried out since the outbreak of war. I had the pleasure, when in New Zealand recently, of hearing everywhere expressions of appreciation at the part played by the Australian Navy since the outbreak of war, and of thankfulness for the protection it afforded to New Zealand in a time of great danger. It is a fact that the superior naval force presented by the Australian Fleet Unit was to a considerable degree responsible for driving the German Squadron from the Pacific to its doom at the Falklands in the Atlantic. </para>
                <para>The Australian Navy has done effective work, and the Government has been at all times in close touch with the Admiralty. The officers and men are generally fit and well, and it is a remarkable tribute to the efficiency of the ships and the care bestowed on them by the crews that since the outbreak of war they have never been in. dockyard hands for any serious defect. </para>
                <para>Fifty-three vessels have been taken up as transports by the Government, six interned German steamers have also been utilized as transports and officers and crews provided for them by the Naval authorities. Twelve interned German steamers have been requisitioned for use as cargo ships, and full crews provided for them. These cargo ships, which are controlled by the Navy Office, have done much to relieve the congestion consequent on the requisitioning of so many steamers for military purposes. </para>
                <para>In order to protect trade routes and to embarrass the movements of enemy vessels, the Government was reluctantly compelled to impose considerable restrictions on coal export. This has entailed some hardship on the coal trade, which, however, has generously responded to the requirements of the situation. </para>
                <para>Work is proceeding at Henderson Naval Base, where 217 men are engaged. At Flinders Naval Base 333 men are employed. Engineering data is being obtained at Port Stephens and Albany. At Cockatoo Island, works authorized in Estimates are in hand. It is expected that the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> will be launched and the destroyers fully completed this year. </para>
                <para>Railways. It is estimated the East-West Railway will be completed in less than two and a half years&#39; time, and there are reasons to believe that the same gauge from Kalgoorlie to Perth will be in existence before that time has elapsed. The Government have had under consideration the question of a strategic railway for greater security and defence, which, joining the East-West Railway in the neighbourhood of Port Augusta, will link up the capital cities of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. They have made arrangements for a preliminary investigation of a proposed route. As soon as the report is received, Parliament will be advised. </para>
                <para>Financial Position of the Commonwealth. In the Budget Speech of 3rd December, 1914, the financial position of the Commonwealth was dealt with at length. It seems desirable, however, that a further statement should be laid before honorable members, showing the action which has been taken up to date, and summarizing the position. It will be remembered that the estimate of expenditure out of revenue totalled &#163;37,583,715, including special expenditure consequent upon the war, amounting to &#163;11,742,050. The Treasurer proposed that the expenditure should be provided for as follows: - </para>
                <para>Ways and Means. Surplus brought forward from previous years, &#163;1,222,401; estimated revenue of 1914-15, including revenue under the new Tariff and increased Land Tax, as well as new Probate and Succession Duties, amounting in all to &#163;23,273,000; Treasury bills to be issued for war purposes, &#163;1,242,050; Treasury bills to be issued for other revenue purposes, &#163;1,346,264; loan from British Government for war purposes, at &#163;1,500,000 monthly, for seven months, &#163;10,500,000. Total of estimated expenditure provided for, &#163;37,583,715. </para>
                <para>Receipts. The following is a comparison of the receipts estimated for the year, and the actual receipts up to 28th February, 1915: - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="076331191504142_12_7.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para>There were unusual difficulties in framing the estimates of revenue, but I am pleased to be in a position to state that, according to present indications, the Estimates of revenue for the year will be found satisfactory on the whole, because, though there probably will be a shortage, its amount is not likely to cause serious embarrassment. </para>
                <para>The Customs and Excise revenue to 31st March, 1915, amounts to &#163;11,181,000, which may be compared with &#163;11,353,000  received  in the same period of the previous year. We estimated that in the whole year we should receive &#163;717,000 less than in the preceding twelve months, but in the nine months the decrease has been only &#163;172,000. While it is too early, as well as unwise under present circumstances, to commit oneself to a definite forecast, it may be stated that the estimate of Customs and Excise revenue for the year is likely to be exceeded; but, even so, the excess will not be as much as has sometimes occurred under less disturbing conditions. </para>
                <para>We expected the Post Office to return in the whole year &#163;55,000 more than it did in the previous year. Up to 31st March, 1915, the total revenue was &#163;3,423,000, being an increase of &#163;37,000 above the amount collected for the same period in 1913-14. It seems, therefore, that Post Office revenue is coming in at about the expected rate. </para>
                <para>Up to 31st March, 1915, we collected probate and succession duties amounting only to &#163;804. For manifest reasons it is almost impossible to make a reliable estimate of revenue from this source. As the Commonwealth duties are levied on the estates only of persons who died after 21st December, 1914, and as some time necessarily elapses before the amount payable in any case can be ascertained, it was not expected that prior to 31st March there would be any considerable revenue. From information now in our possession, however, it would seem that the estimate of &#163;1,000,000 for this financial year was too high, and we do not expect to collect, before 30th June, more than &#163;100,000. </para>
                <para>The land tax this year promises a larger amount of revenue, but I am doubtful if the estimate will be realized. </para>
                <para>Expenditure. The following was the state of the Expenditure Accounts on 28th February last: - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="076331191504142_13_8.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para>Since the Budget Estimates were framed no further estimate of expenditure has been made, but it is known that the war expenditure will exceed . the estimate. Such excess will be met out of the proceeds of an additional loan granted by the British Government. To this loan further reference will presently be made. </para>
                <para>We shall require &#163;3,500,000 more than is set down in the present Estimates for expenditure in connexion with the despatch of Expeditionary Forces. </para>

The increase has been caused by the increase in the number of troops despatched, and was not covered by the Estimates laid before Parliament. There were two courses for me to follow - to bring down a Bill giving the necessary authority for what is proposed, or to bring down further estimates. I have mentioned the matter to the Leader of the Opposition, and I have decided to bring down fresh estimates covering the proposed expenditure. </para>

                <para>On 28th February, 1915, we had already sold Treasury-bills amounting to &#163;2,995,000 to cover the deficiency referred to. The Treasury-bills were bought by the Australian Notes Fund; that is to say, funds were created by the issue of notes, and these funds were used for the purchase of the Treasury -bills. The amount is in excess of the estimate of &#163;2,588,314, but an improved financial position has since enabled us to reduce the amount of Treasury-bills outstanding to &#163;2,795,000, and when the land tax is received at the end of the year we expect to reduce it further. </para>
                <para>In the estimated total expenditure of &#163;37,583,715 already referred to, provision was made only for the services which are usually paid for out of revenue. In addition, the Treasurer estimated that he would spend in the year the amount of &#163;2,162,580 on the transcontinental railway, land in the Federal Territory, conduits, and other services which are usually paid for out of loan funds. Up to 28th February, 1915, there was expended on these loan services &#163;1,301,482. In order to raise the necessary loan funds, the Treasurer sold to the Australian Notes Fund, Commonwealth Inscribed Stock and Commonwealth Treasury-bills. </para>
                <para>Imperial Loan. The estimated receipts during this financial year include &#163;10,500,000, being seven monthly instalments of the &#163;18,000,000 which the British Government has agreed to lend to the Commonwealth. This loan was granted in order that war expenditure might be met. The first instalment was received on 15th December last, and in each month since an instalment has been paid, making a total to date of &#163;6,000,000. The Commonwealth is to pay to the Imperial Government on the &#163;18.000,000 the rate of interest at which that Government itself has borrowed. The period of the loan is indefinite, the date of repayment being a matter which is to be agreed upon between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government of the Commonwealth. It is understood that the British Government is making the loan to the Commonwealth out of the proceeds of a loan of &#163;350,000,000 raised by the British Government. This loan is repayable between 1st March, 1925, and 1st March, 1928. The price of the issue was &#163;95 per cent., and the rate of interest 3&#163; per cent. Until the date at which the Commonwealth has to repay the loan has been fixed, it is not possible to calculate the effective rate of interest. It will be a little more than 4 per cent. Since the date of the Budget it has been decided to increase the strength of the Expeditionary Forces, and the amount of &#163;18,000,000 will not suffice. The British Government has, therefore, agreed to lend us a further amount of &#163;6,500,000 for war purposes, making a total of &#163;24,500,000 to be received by the Commonwealth up to 31st December, 1915. In addition, the British Government has agreed to lend us before the date named the amount of &#163;3,500,000, in order that Commonwealth works already in progress may be continued. </para>
                <para>Assistance to States. Before the British Government agreed to lend the amount of &#163;18,000,000, it was the intention to meet the war expenditure out of the Australian Notes Fund, but money for the war having bean obtained in the manner previously referred to, wo were able to use the resources of the Notes Fund for loans to the States for public works. Accordingly, on the 5th November, 1914, the Commonwealth Treasurer entered into an agreement with the States that the Commonwealth should lend and the States should borrow the following sums : - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="076331191504142_14_10.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para class="block">The money is to be available in London and in Australia, and the amount borrowed is to bear interest at the rate which it costs the Commonwealth of Australia to raise money for its own purposes, but such rate is not to be less than 4 per cent, per annum. In the agreement the States engage not to borrow otherwise during a period of twelve months from the date of the agreement, except for renewals of existing loans falling due, but the States are permitted to sei&#93; Treasury Bonds over the counter to an amount not exceeding sales in a normal year. </para>
                <para>As the precise rate of interest payable by the Commonwealth to the British Government is not yet known, we cannot at present state exactly what interest the loans to the States will bear. It would seem that the amount will be slightly more than 4 per cent. Each monthly instalment of the loan to a State will be repayable by the State to the Commonwealth two years after the date at which the instalment was paid to the State. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Treasury is making its advances to the States out of the Australian Notes Fund on or about the 15th of each month. Each monthly instalment amounts to &#163;1,500,000, and the first instalment was paid in December. Previously Victoria had received &#163;350,000, and South Australia &#163;100,000, but these sums will be deducted from the instalments payable to these States in a future month. </para>
                <para>Agreement with Banks. The Australian Notes Fund could not have been used in the manner indicated without the assistance of the banks, which have agreed not to present notes at the Treasury for gold until the close of the war. The right is reserved to the banks, however, to make use of the Australian notes for banking purposes. The agreement does not compel any bank to hold any particular amount of Australian notes. It may pay the notes away to its customers or to its other creditors. The Treasurer on his part has agreed with the banks that the increased issue of Australian notes is to be considered an emergency issue, which is to be redeemed in gold at the close of the war. The banks have further undertaken to lodge gold in the Commonwealth Treasury amounting in all to &#163;10,000,000, and to take Australian notes in exchange for the gold. Up to date the Treasurer has called upon the banks for 3,000,000 sovereigns, which have been placed in the Treasury vaults, and are now part of the reserve for the redemption of Australian notes. </para>
                <para>The agreement with the banks provides further that the Treasurer shall, if required, make advances to the banks in Australian notes, the banks to deposit in gold one-third of the amount of the notes advanced, and to give a deposit receipt at 4 per cent, per annum for the balance. Deposit receipts are to be payable in twelve months after the end of the war, and the banks have the option of redeeming the same at any time before maturity. Deposit receipts amounting to &#163;241,000 have been received from the banks under this arrangement, and the banks have exercised their right to redeem the deposit receipts to the extent of &#163;40,000, the amount outstanding being &#163;201,000. </para>
                <para>Australian Note Issue. On 12th April, 1915, the Australian notes in circulation in the hands of the banks and the public amount to &#163;26,664,323; in addition, up to that date, the Treasury had received interest on investments of the Notes moneys. Such interest, after deducting all expenses of the note issue, amounted to &#163;601,460. The total Note Funds at that date, therefore, amounted to &#163;27,265,783. These funds, on 12th April, 1915, had been disposed of as follows : - </para>

During the recess, the Ministry have given special attention to the necessity for providing relief to the labour market, both skilled and unskilled labour, owing to the increase in unemployment consequent upon the closing down in certain directions of private industries. With this object in view, practically the whole of the works voted by Parliament were put in hand immediately the Estimates were passed, including a large number of drill halls, rifle ranges, military depots, and additional buildings in connexion with the Aviation School at Point.

                <para>Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank has been of great service to the Commonwealth during the war crisis. </para>
                <para>It granted to the Government an overdraft in London during August last i&#187;f &#163;100,000, and during September &#163;130,000, at a time when all the banks in England, except the Bank of England and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, were observing the moratorium. </para>
                <para>At the request of the Minister of Defence, the Bank also arranged to provide funds to pay for purchase of horses for the Expeditionary Forces throughout Australia, pending the passing of a Supply Bill, which arrangement enabled the Departmental officers to immediately proceed to purchase and pay for horses without waiting for Supply to be passed. At the same time the Commonwealth Bank agreed to assist the State Governments in London with their financial arrangements. The Bank also assisted four banks in three different States in -Australia and in London, and arranged to assist another if necessary. </para>
                <para>At a time when the other banks in London were strictly observing the moratorium, the Commonwealth Bank did not do so. It assisted a large number o&#39;f Australians resident in England and visiting there. Passengers who have since returned are loud in their praise of the action of the Bank during the crisis. It need hardly be added that the prestige of the institution has thus been considerably strengthened. </para>
                <para>The Bank continued uninterruptedly to negotiate in London bills on Australia, and many merchants in this country were glad of its assistance in transferring funds to London. </para>
                <para>The Bank has on behalf of the Treasury continued to redeem Australian notes and silver in London, and owing to the despatch of the Expeditionary Forces this phase of its transactions has assumed comparatively large proportions. * It has helped, during the war, and still can help, stranded Australians at almost all places outside the actual theatre of war, a fact which may be interesting to many of our people in this country. </para>

                <para>At the same time the Bank has continued to deal with applications for advances from constituents throughout the Commonwealth on normal lines, and practically every application has been granted where a proper and ample security has been forthcoming.

                <para>As regards the Savings Bank Department of the Bank, it has continued to progress steadily, despite the war crisis, and between the 30th June, 1914, and 31st, December, 1914, the balance at credit of depositors in this Department increased by &#163;1,362,000, an average of well over &#163;50,000 per week, whilst the number of accounts during the same period increased by 31,666. </para>

                <para>The Savings Bank in London was established primarily for the benefit of Australians or intending Australians, and generally to assist emigrants leaving England for Australia, and has been almost exclusively made use of in this  respect.  Other persons are not encouraged to deposit with the Savings Bank Department in London, and several suggestions that the Bank should receive deposits from the public throughout Great Britain have been declined. At the time of its establishment the British Post Office Savings Bank was consulted in the matter, and took no exception whatever to the establishment of this portion of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank of London, and the friendliest reciprocal arrangements still exist with the British Post Office Savings Bank, and also with the New Zealand Post Office Savings Bank throughout that dominion. </para>
                <para>Agencies of the Savings Bank Department are now established at well over 2,000 post-offices throughout the Commonwealth, and arrangements are now in course of preparation for the opening of many hundred more agencies at additional  post-offices </para>

At most of the camps permanent agencies of the Savings Bank have now been established, in order to meet the convenience of the men. As soon as it became known that the troops were to be quartered at Cairo, arrangements were made for the Bank&#39;s agents at the centre to- cash cheques and pay withdrawals on Savings Bank accounts, and also to enable cable remittances being  forwarded  direct from Australia to Cairo, and in cases where lodgments represent military pay, they are forwarded either by cable remittances or through the Savings Bank Department free of any charge for exchange. The facilities made available in this way have been generally availed of by friends and relatives of the men who are with our Expeditionary Forces. Extensive arrangements are also being made to enable the members of the Forces to receive remittances and cash their cheques throughout Europe, as may be necessary, and also to forward remittances in local currency to men who are at the actual theatre of war, where banking facilities may, for the time being, be nonexistent. </para>

                <para>The Season. It is pleasing to be able to mention the widespread rains that have within the past few days benefited the Southern States of Australia. The rains of November and December which broke the long dry spell of the winter and spring of 1914 covered most of Southern Australia, but whilst the rains were continued in the Western State during January and February, over all Southern, Central and Eastern Australia there was a return to the dry conditions. At the close of March, however, there were useful rains in parts of New South Wales. During April monsoonal influences have greatly relieved the situation by moderate to heavy rainfalls generally throughout the agricultural belt of South Australia and the whole of Victoria and Tasmania. This re-awakening of monsoonal activity is an indication that the period of drought has broken, when we may expect a return to more normal conditions. </para>
                <para>I can only add that I have no regret for my frequently-uttered public statements of optimism with respect to the possibilities of Australia; and I ask those honorable members who are not acquainted with the whole of our great continent to reserve their  opinions  about its possibilities until they know something about it. No one has greater sympathy for the distressful sufferings of those who produce from the soil than myself and my colleagues. </para>

                        <para>- No. It is still a &#34;little&#34; drought compared with that of 1902-3. Over a very considerable part of Australia the drought has been a3 bad as I saw in 1902-3 - perhaps worse; but to speak of it as an Australian calamity in the sense in which the drought of 1902-3 was is not correct, and is certainly not patriotic. </para>

                        <para>- No. Our flocks and our herds are largely with us, whereas in 1902-3 our flocks were devastated to the extent of 50 per cent., and our herds, with the exception of those in the great Gulf country, were almost wholly wiped out. We have a land that stands out, taking one season with another, above other lands in its production, which, notwithstanding droughts, is greater than that of any other country in the world.
