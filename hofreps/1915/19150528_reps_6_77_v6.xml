Is the right honorable gentleman of opinion that the statement of a responsible Minister in Australia that the appeal of the leaders of our Army and Navy at the front to the men in British workshops to hurry preparations in order to increase the efficiency of the forces in the field, is only bluff, ought to be cabled to England? Will the Prime Minister prevent that statement of the Minister of Defence from being cabled to England pending the Minister&#39;s reply to the question of the Leader of the Opposition? </para>

Assistant Minister of Defence seen the statement attributed to Captain Bean, in this morning&#39;s newspaper, that 30,000 Australasians went to the front at the Dardanelles? Does the honorable member consider it wise that our censor should permit the world to know the number of troops operating at the Dardanelles? </para>

Is he aware that one steamer has been -waiting in Newcastle for some weeks for a cargo of coal, but cannot get it because of these restrictions ? As the Pacific is now clear of enemy vessels, will the right honorable gentleman take steps to get the Admiralty to remove these restrictions, in the interests of the coal trade of Australia? </para>

As the arrangements for this procession do not seem to have been completed yet, will the Assistant Minister of Defence take into consideration the fact that a large patriotic and charitable demonstration for the relief of distressed Belgians and Servians, for which great preparations have been made, at considerable expense, is to be held in the Royal Park at 2 o&#39;clock, and will he endeavour to arrange that the procession shall not clash with that demonstration ? </para>

                        <para>- On looking through the War Precautions Regulations, I notice that regulation 54, which deals with powers of arrest, has been substituted for a former regulation, which was No. 9, and provided that a competent Naval or Military authority, or an officer of Customs, might arrest, without warrant, any persons whose behaviour was of such a nature as to give reasonable ground for suspecting that he had acted, was acting,  or was about to act, in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the Commonwealth., or to authorize the arrest where an offence had been committed. The regulation which has been dropped impliedly gave the right of trial to the man who was arrested. I wish to know whether this right has been deliberately withdrawn, or whether the omis-  mon is an oversight? Will the Attorney-General have the matter looked into? </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta rose to make a personal explanation because of interjections across the chamber. From time to time I have allowed many questions to be asked which I considered to be irregular, but when it becomes necessary for an honorable member to make a personal explanation as a sequel to an irregular question, I feel that it is my duty to take action. A question is asked, and answered, whether rightly or not is not for me to Bay. Then five or six further questions are founded on the original one. My predecessor in this Chair refused to allow this procedure, but I refrained from taking that course, desiring to give honorable members the fullest opportunity of obtaining information; but, if this form of question is to continue in the irregular way in which it is developing, I shall feel obliged to take some action to protect the House from itself, unless the House orders me to do otherwise. </para>

                        <para>- The Government have remitted to the Attorney-General, for immediate action, the question of the character of the investigation by the court martial and the procedure followed. It will take action to deal with the whole question, quite irrespective of what the opinion furnished on that question may be. I think we want, first of all, to ascertain whether the inquiries were made according to prescribed rules, but whether they were or were not so made, the Government will take action to secure a thorough and impartial investigation of the whole matter. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Prime Minister noticed that a movement is on foot in Sydney to approach America with a view to raising charitable funds for our returned soldiers, and that the Premier of* New South Wales has telegraphed to the various State Premiers inviting their assistance in the organization of a big scheme to raise funds for this purpose ? Does he not think that this is a reflection on the Federal Government? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation in regard to a question I asked yesterday concerning works at the Federal Capital. I asked the Minister of Home Affairs when he would be prepared to make the general statement regarding those works which he promised when I asked a previous question. The honorable member answered sharply that he had made that general statement on the day after I asked the question, but he would have no objection to repeating the statement again. That reply made me look rather foolish. I have referred to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to see what general statement the Minister had made, and I found that a week after I asked him that question he answered one question which was put to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> and another put by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austin</inline> Chapman. As those answers represent the extent of his general statement, I do not think there was any necessity for the honorable gentleman to give a reply yesterday by which he tried to make me look foolish. </para>

                        <para>.  - I was referring last night, when progress was reported, to the shipping that  came  into the port of Hobart last year. The tonnage of the New Zealand Shipping Company&#39;s twelve boats was 72,104 tons, and the light dues paid under the existing system were &#163;300. Under the proposed Federal system of 8d. per ton, the light dues paid by that company would be &#163;2,404. The inward cargo on those boats amounted only to 8,244 tons. The total number of steamers of the two companies - Shaw  Saville  and Albion, and New Zealand - was twenty-five. The total <inline font-style="italic">tonnage</inline> was 162,642 tons, and the light dues paid by the two companies to the port of Hobart were &#163;625. Had the proposed Federal system been in existence, they would have paid &#163;5,422. The outward cargo on those ships in 1914 amounted to 58,605 cases of fruit, 697 passengers were landed at Hobart, the through passengers for New Zealand numbered 10,258, and the coal bunkered was 5,239 tons. If the Department insist on putting these heavy light dues on the ships, the companies will have to put up their freights by 7s. a ton to cover the extra cost. The port cannot stand it, and the result will be that the ships will not come to Tasmania. The Mayor of Hobart, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Williams, a business man, has stated that the people passing through Tasmania spend &#163;30,000 a year there. It will be disastrous to Tasmania if these dues are allowed to be inflicted on us. To show the unfairness of the proposal, a ship may come to Fremantle, pay 8d. a ton, and then trade right round the coast for three months, calling at every port, and using every light along the coast. </para>

                            <para>- We know all about it: These are the regulations likely to come into force if we do not fight them. I shall do my utmost with, I hope, every honorable member from Tasmania, to prevent this injustice being perpetrated upon us. A ship trading round Australia uses every light on our coast, but the majority of the ships entering the port of Hobart will use only two or three lights. These vessels come straight from the Cape to Hobart, where every provision is made for them, and then proceed to New Zealand. All &#163;hey have been asked to pay in light dues is &#163;25, whereas under the new system, such a vessel as the <inline font-style="italic">Ionic</inline> would be called upon to pay &#163;216 17s. 4d. The Marine Board of Tasmania has laid itself out to cater for this traffic, and it has paid well; but the trade will b&#169; simply paralyzed by the introduction of the new dues. </para>

                            <para>- The reason is that it is not necessary for these boats to call at any port in Australia other than Hobart, because the cargo they bring for Launceston is carried over the Tasmanian Government railways for the same inclusive freight as to the former place. A pier, unequalled in any port in Australia, has been built at Hobart for the accommodation of these vessels. At the end of this pier there is a depth of 64 feet of water, capable of accommodating a <inline font-style="italic">Titanic,</inline> and vessels can enter the port at any time. The Minister has asked me to  make  a suggestion, and, in my opinion, there is nothing to prevent the Department levying what I should describe as a  port-of-call  charge. What I mean is that such vessels as I have described would pay a due of 3d. at Fremantle, and a similar </para>

                    <para class="block">*um at each port at which they happened to call; and this would dispose of the Minister&#39;s objection that a boat for &#34;Queensland would have to pay dues at half-a-dozen ports. If these vessels used all the lights on the coast, there would be no objection to the proposed charges, but there is every objection when they happen to use only one or two. To show how the Marine Board of Hobart is trying to develop this trade, I may say that they are willing to  give  up dues on the river lights, which do not come within the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Customs; and their main reason for this concession is that the charges under the new system are so high that in all probability it would be impossible to get vessels to call. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to -say that Tasmania sends about 1,000,000 cases to the ports of Australia; and yet honorable members ask, &#34;Where is Tasmania?&#34; Why, Tasmania has to supply New South Wales with potatoes for the half-year, not to mention the fruit that is sent to Queensland ; and, further, when the Queensland people become physical wrecks they resort to the island State in order to build themselves up. Yet we are asked, &#34;Where is Tasmania?&#34; For about three months in the year every available man in the waterside unions is required to work the ships; and they meet the occasion loyally, working as long as thirty-eight or forty-eight hours at a time. In the winter, however, there is a slump, and large numbers of fine, able-bodied, willing men are unable to find employment. What can be done to retain these men at the ports if the boats cease to call ? And when the summer arrives, how is the necessary labour to be obtained ? I appeal not only to the Minister, but to the Government and the House, to give Tasmania fair consideration. I know that it is the intention of the Department to improve the lighthouse service of Tasmania; and I may say that if it had not been the intention of the Commonwealth to take over the lighthouses, the State Government, in conjunction with the Hobart Marine Board, would have inaugurated a better system of lighting on the west coast. In my opinion, the shipping trade of Tasmania will increase if proper facilities are afforded; and there is every warrant for the arguments and suggestions I have submitted, because the Government of Tasmania is harnessing up a power the like of which does not exist in any other part of Australia. We have on the great lake a splendid hydro-electrical system. During my trip through Switzerland I saw nothing to equal it, and I am credibly informed that the Government will be able to sell electrical power to anybody requiring it at a price lower than any other body can sell similar power in any State. A company is in process of  development  with the object of making calcium carbide. We have the limestone adjacent to the river I spoke of. We can get coke quite easily from Newcastle, and with the electricity produced by the means I have mentioned, we shall have all that is necessary for the production of calcium carbide. All this will increase the trade of the port of Hobart, and I feel sure will do much to make for further progress in the State, provided it is not hampered in the manner that this proposal contemplates. I  only  wish to refer to one other matter, and I shall be very brief. I do not know the conditions under which lighthouse-keepers generally are living at the present time; but when this matter is being dealt with I hope that an investigation will be made so that we shall be able to know how these people spend their leisure hours, in order that everything may be done to make their lives much more tolerable than I am afraid they now are. There are a large number of magazines taken at intervals from the Parliamentary Library table. I do not know what becomes of them, but if it &#39;is possible for some of these magazines or for some books to be sent to these lighthouse-keepers, something will have been done to cheer their lonely lives. </para>

In many cases, also, leave of absence has not been forthcoming as it should have been to these people, who should be entitled to some relaxation from the noble work  they  are doing. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, it will cost more. I am not complaining of the Minister paying his officials big salaries, but as I pointed out last night an increase of from &#163;12,000 to &#163;34,000 requires explanation. At the same time I do not wish it to be understood that I am opposed to the expenditure of money for the purpose of making the conditions under which these lighthouse-keepers live somewhat better. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the Minister will do what he can to make some provision in this regard. We give scholarships to young people who live* in other parts of the Commonwealth, and I think some means might be discovered of educating the children of lighthouse-keepers at the expense of the Government. It would pay the Commonwealth, because they would turn out better citizens. In conclusion, I hope the Minister will not take anything I have said as personal. The subject is one that is near to me, because X am desirous of seeing Tasmania in general, and Hobart in particular, progress, as I think they should progress. I do not want to see anything done to stop industry or to prevent that which brings about national progress everywhere. I do not want to see commerce or shipping interfered with, as is likely if this proposal becomes law, for I feel sure it will have a disastrous effect upon Tasmania, and! be the means of putting the State back: many years. I hope the Minister will&#34; give. the matter his earnest consideration,, and that he will be able to make a statement to the House that will alleviate the fears that have grown up that Tasmania is going to be crushed out by this newsystem. </para>

                        <para>. - I only want two minutes, in order to repudiate some of the very scandalous statements that were made by the honorable member last evening concerning myself and my Government. I merely made a friendly interjection, when the honorable member turned on me with his usual ferocity and told me of the things that our Government did not do for Tasmania, of the neglect we had shown towards that State, and of the things which the present Government had done. I have had to withstand a good deal of adverse criticism in Tasmania by the honorable member and his party, but I have always done my level best to help that State. _ The best proof of that will be found in the fact that we gave Tasmania. an additional &#163;400,000, which, his Government refused to give. </para>

                            <para>- Tasmania has an infinite and continuing advantage. Not only that, but I believe that my Government was the first to give Tasmania a sleeper contract, which was refused by the Fisher Government. Moreover, my Government did not talk about what it was going to do for Tasmania. It took steps to see that she got a very much better mail service over the water than the Fisher Government had given her. </para>

                            <para>- It is just about time that this clap-trap about the attitude of this deponent and his Government concerning Tasmania ceased. And now, to crown all, the honorable member goes on to answer himself beautifully. After saying what we would not do for Tasmania, and what the present Government is <inline font-style="italic">going to do,</inline> he quotes the lighthouse charges that were in vogue when the Cook Government was in office, and is demonstrating what an enormity it will be to Tasmania if the Fisher charges are imposed. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to speak long. I am very strongly tempted to follow the lines just adopted by the Leader of the Opposition, and make a few remarks in regard to his statement about class feeling and racial feeling, but the time is short. My purpose in rising is to get some information about the Estimates and the lighthouses. I am very sorry indeed that there has been so much delay on the part of the Commonwealth Government in taking over the charge of the lighthouses. A start was made, and now I understand action is postponed until the 1st July of this year. </para>

The coasts of Australia are exceedingly dangerous, and with the growing size of steamers they are becoming increasingly dangerous. The northern coasts of Queensland, in particular, are dangerous, and though an effort was made by the previous Minister of Trade and Customs to erect two lighthouses there, I understand that very little progress has been made. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FINLAYSON.- Why is it not specified? A sum total of &#163;485 is set down on the page, but there is nothing to indicate to honorable members the purpose for which the money is spent, by whom it is received, or indeed whether there is any justification for the expenditure. Careful particulars as to contingencies are given in regard to No. 3 District, which includes New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and Bass Strait. Items as low as &#163;1 are particularized under that heading, but regarding what is done with the &#163;485 for salaries we know nothing. The total expenditure for last year was &#163;6,031. I do not think that is a very heavy expenditure, considering the importance of the work. The probability is that the expenditure for this year, although &#163;61,000 is provided, will not exceed &#163;10,000 or &#163;12,000. What possibility is there of the lighthouses being taken over by the Commonwealth on the 1st July, and what progress is being made with the erection of the new lighthouses, which, to my mind, are urgently required ? That information I would like to get from the Minister. May I say a word now in regard to the questions raised by the honorable member for Denison? Some four years ago I put myself in communication with the State Premiers, and, without exception, they favoured me with some very useful information in reply to questions. I discovered that in all the States there were some arrangements, more or less well organized, for the provision of libraries, magazines and newspapers to the various lighthouse-keepers, but there was a considerable divergence in the methods adopted for ensuring a regularity of the exchanges, and particularly in regard to the transfers of the men. In some of the States there was a very good system, and in others a very loose one. The main point which needs to be borne in mind is that special consideration should be given to the men in the more isolated places, which perhaps the Government steamer only visits once in two or three months. Where the families are grown to school age and have to be brought to the mainland to be educated, special arrangements in regard to leave of absence to the men ought to be made. I think that, as a rule, two months is considered a fair time for a man to occupy a position in an isolated lighthouse. The same thing applies to other conveniences which we know the men engaged in this work have to sacrifice. It is too early for us to criticise what may be done. But it is not too early to express the pious hope that the Minister, in making regulations for the taking over of the lighthouses from the States, will provide for the regular and frequent interchange of hooks, magazines, and newspapers, and . above all will make such arrangements as will permit the education of families by transferring married men from the more isolated stations to places convenient to schools. </para>

                        <para>.- There are two matters for which I ask the Minister&#39;s consideration. The Lighthouses Act provides that where practicable lighthouses shall be connected with the nearest telephone exchange. At the present time many lighthouse men and their families Are isolated, and are thus put to serious inconvenience and danger when illness occurs. The other matter does not strictly come under the Department of Trade and Customs, though it affects those in the lighthouse service. I ask the Minister if he will see that, before voting takes place  in  connexion with a parliamentary election or referendum, arrangements are made for the recording of votes by lighthouse-keepers and their families. In my electorate, about twenty-six persons were unable to vote at the last election. The nature of their duties prevented these persons from attending the polling places. Whatever objection we may have to some systems of voting, we should see that these persons are not deprived of the highest privilege of citizenship, the right to take part in the government of the country. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Denison has brought forcibly before the Committee the wrong that will be done to Hobart and to Tasmania if certain proposed light dues are charged on oversea shipping touching at Hobart but at no other port in the Commonwealth. The effect of these charges will be to prevent that shipping from coming to Hobart as surely as if it were prohibited by an Act of Parliament. I know that the figures presented by the honorable member are authentic. Under the present proposal, light dues which now come to &#163;25 will be increased to about &#163;260, and 25 per cent, of the revenue from freight on the cargoes usually carried will be needed to pay them. The difficulty which faces the Minister is the objection to getting away from a uniform charge. No doubt if a vessel called at each of -the principal ports of Australia, and was charged &#163;25 for light dues at each port, she would have to pay in all more than the sum that I have just named. But the charge to which I object will be made on vessels which come direct to Hobart from oversea, land passengers and mails for Tasmania and the other States, and take on board coal for the continuance of their voyage to New Zealand. If this charge is persisted in-, these vessels will probably evade it by coaling outside the harbor. I am certain that the Minister is not wedded to the departmental proposals, and I hope that now that the facts have been pointed out to him, he will not sanction a charge which would be so prejudicial to Tasmania. Possibly the new charge may be less than the old for vessels calling at a number of ports in different States, but it will be very unfair if applied to vessels calling at one port only. For years the people of Hobart and Southern Tasmania have been doing all that they can to secure and maintain a direct service from overseas. The port charges of Hobart have been so light that when Lloyd&#39;s recently published a list of the shipping ports of the world, Hobart appeared on it as the cheapest port in existence. As the honorable member for Denison has pointed out,&#39; splendid wharfs have been constructed at Hobart, at which the largest vessels can load fruit with despatch, wharfs of which any State might well be proud. The shipping is brought close up to the city, and vessels can lie with their bows touching one of the principal streets. But if the proposed charge is levied, the direct service of steamers between Tasmania and other parts of the world will be stopped. That would be a serious blow to Tasmania. For one thing, all heavy freights from abroad would then have to be landed at Melbourne or Sydney, and brought across to Tasmania by an Inter-State steamer. There would then be double handling and double wharfage to pay, which would be a great hardship on the business people of </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Hobart, and on those in country districts who use heavy machinery. At the present time the existence of a direct service from London keeps the Inter-State charges within bounds. Were that service to stop, Tasmania would be at the mercy of any shipping monopoly. This would be disastrous, not only to the general interests of the State, but also to the waterside workers at Hobart, who now get work in connexion with the despatch of the oversea steamers at a time when InterState traffic is slack, and there is little else to do. Indeed I often wonder how they manage to get through the winter. I do not think that this House would allow any Government to do an act of injustice to a State such as would be involved in the shutting off of that State from oversea communication. Oversea intercourse is of vital importance to the trade of an island State like Tasmania. If there is one thing more than another that is necessary, it is direct communication with the outer world. The increased cost of labour, of living, and of production make it necessary to reduce the cost of transport as much as possible. </para>

                            <para>- During the luncheon adjournment I was asked by an honorable member why any special consideration should be extended to Tasmania. At the risk of repetition, I should like to point out that these vessels come from England, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> the Cape, direct to Hobart, and then proceed to New Zealand. Hobart is their one Australian port of call. I believe that the result of these charges will be to absolutely prohibit these vessels from calling at Hobart. Under the Navigation Bill, oversea vessels now carrying passengers between the mainland and Tasmania will be prohibited from doing so. Tasmania and Western Australia will be directly hit by the provisions of that measure which prevents English liners from carrying passengers between the States and along their coast. In addition to this disability under which these two States will suffer, the Department now proposes to impose prohibitive lighting charges which will absolutely deprive Tasmania of the only oversea trade that she has, and will inflict upon her an injustice that I am sure this Parliament upon consideration will not tolerate. I know that the Minister has been looking into the matter, and </para>

                            <para>- No. I would have a minimum and a maximum charge, and would provide that after what was considered to be a just amount had been raised no further charge should be levied. I would, for instance, make a port charge on every vessel touching at Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane; a charge in respect of every port at which it called. If that were done, the &#163;25 per vessel now being paid under existing conditions at Hobart would be found to be far more than was thus secured. </para>

                            <para>- They would not use any Australian lights until they struck the South- West Cape light. They come direct from the Cape. This is a very serious matter for Tasmania. If this line of steamships is shut off as it undoubtedly will be by these charges, Tasmania will be deprived of the only direct communication that it has with the outside world. All oversea goods for Tasmania will have to be landed at Melbourne and transhipped by the InterState boats. There will, consequently, be two handlings, two rates of freights, and costly charges to provide for before they reach their destination. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that it is not what this Parliament desires, and I believe also that the Minister will realize the justice of our claim, and the enormous handicap to which Tasmania will be subjected if these charges be made. The present charge will be multiplied more than ten-fold. Some of the vessels now paying &#163;25, as they have been doing for years past, will have to pay &#163;260 in respect of the one trip. Such a charge is so monstrous that I wonder at any Department daring to put it before Parliament. I have no desire to labour this matter. I think a fair case has been made out for the consideration of the Minister, and I am very hopeful that he will see that some radical alteration is made in respect of these charges. If he does, he will prevent honorable members doing that which they dislike to do: appealing from the Minister direct to the House for a recognition of the justice of their claims. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government, in approaching the consideration of this matter, found themselves face to face with the problem of fixing the lighthouse charges on such a scale as would make that branch of the Department pay for itself. The lighthouses will be transferred to the Commonwealth, I hope, on the 1st July next, and the charges which it is proposed then to bring into operation will be on the basis I have just mentioned. It is not expected, however, that they will be sufficient to meet the whole of the expenditure on lighthouses as well as pay interest on the value of the transferred properties. The honorable member for Denison, in estimating the amount spent in Tasmania at the present time at &#163;12,000, did not allow one penny by way of interest on the value of the buildings now being used. A responsible officer of the Department of Home Affairs, acting on behalf of the Federal Government, as  Colonel Miller  did, in respect of the other transferred properties, will determine, with a representative of the other side, I presume, the valuations to be placed on the lighthouses, land, and equipment taken over. Assuming that they are valued, in the case of Tasmania, at &#163;100,000, that means that an additional &#163;3,500 will have to be provided for in respect of interest. There will also be an increase of &#163;500 in the cost of the upkeep and repairs of Tasmanian lights, whilst the salaries proposed to be paid tinder the rates fixed by the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner will be about &#163;1,200 more than is now being paid. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that point in due course. It is estimated that even if these charges be made there will be a loss of from &#163;10,000 to &#163;12,000 per annum in respect of the lighthouse service of the whole Commonwealth. It is not thought that the Commonwealth should be asked to bear that loss. This matter was before the late Government, but no decision was arrived at, because the arrangements were not sufficiently advanced to enable the charges to be fixed. The departmental files show, however, that the question was before the right honorable member for Swan as Treasurer, and also, I think, before the present Leader of the Opposition when he held office as Prime Minister. The late Government were trying to determine upon what basis the lighting charges should be fixed, but nothing was done. When we took office, we had to deal with the matter, and it was after I had given notice through the public press of our intention to make a charge of 8d. per ton per quarter on every vessel using any Australian port that an objection was received from Tasmania. The peculiar position of vessels which call at one port in Australia only, and do not proceed to other Commonwealth ports, but to another port oversea, was pointed out to me by a deputation attended by the honorable members for Franklin and Denison, and I have, in the course of interviews, admitted the justice of the claim that these vessels should have different treatment, and stated that I thought that in their case we could reduce the; charges by half. Therefore, I think that we can meet their position by a substantial reduction in the charges. The suggestion put forward by the honorable members for Franklin and Denison that the charge should be so much per trip would hit Tasmania if no maximum was provided. </para>

                            <para>- But that ferry-boat uses four or five lights. I am not in favour of charging so much per ton per trip. There should be a quarterly basis. The only other objection is that raised by the New Zealand company in regard to its vessels which travel between America and Sydney. These vessels pass one light only, and do the whole of their business in Sydney, as that is their port of destination. On this account the Government consider that there should be some differentiation between vessels using one port only <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to another port outside Australia, and vessels coming to any port in the Commonwealth. The question of the treatment of the people employed in the lighthouse service has been raised. I consider that the Commonwealth has a greater responsibility in regard to these people than in regard to other persons who are not in its employment. Their position is different from that of people who go out into isolated places and make homes for themselves; they are compelled to reside in these spots, which are on remote capes, promontories, or islands. </para>

                            <para>- Not only are there no picture shows ; unfortunately, there is also very little facility for education. I think that we all realise that the Commonwealth has a responsibility in that direction. We must see that the children of these Commonwealth servants who are isolated on capes or islands do not grow up in ignorance, and when we are taking over a new service, it is our duty to see that we provide the means of giving education to the children of those employed by us. For this reason the cost of the service will probably be higher than it was under State control, and I say this without any desire to cast any reflection upon what the States have done in this direction. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think there is very much difference. The vessels upon which they will fall mostly are those of the tramp class. In regard to the question of the honorable member for Wimmera, about the time the Lighthouses Bill was passed, the State of South Australia, which has always been charging light dues, commenced to call them port dues. Precisely the same amount of money was collected under the new title. The name was changed so that there would be nothing to hand over to us. On the 30th July, 1914, a letter was sent out to the different States by my predecessor, the honorable member for Darling Downs, and New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland agreed to hand over their lights to the Commonwealth ; while during the last week or two I have seen representatives of Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia, and they have verbally told me that their lights will be handed over to the Commonwealth on similar conditions, though this has not actually been done so far. We have not been hasty in the matter; we have already waited for nearly ten months and have not yet got the lights. Therefore, I have given notice to-day of my intention to ask leave to bring in a Bill next Wednesday for the purpose of amending th* Lighthouses Act with the object of allowing the Commonwealth to take over these lights if they are not surrendered. Of course, if we can get them without passing the Bill it will be an advantage. </para>

I hope that it will not be necessary to pass the Bill, and that we shall receive word that the lights will be handed over. Western Australia and Tasmania have already agreed to surrender portion of the dues they collect, but the other States have not said anything in regard to this matter. Western Australia will discontinue to charge half the dues collected, and Tasmania the dues charged for lights other than local harbor lights, which will remain under the control of the State. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot help that. At four or five Inter-State conferences resolutions were adopted asking the Commonwealth to take over this service. A Bill was introduced into the Senate, first of all, by the honorable member for Kooyong in 1909, when he was a member of that House. It was eventually passed in 1911, and preparatory work has been in progress ever since. Lights have been altered in a number of cases, and other lights have been constructed. The honorable member for Brisbane asked to-day for information as to what lights were  in course of construction on the Queensland coast. I know that the Wilson&#39;s Promontory light, which is passed by more ships than any other light in Australia, was brought up to date about twelve months ago. The lights at Fort Point and Point Emery, on the Northern Territory coast, were completed and lighted last week, whilst the construction at Cape Don was commenced one month ago. With regard to the lighthouses north of Cooktown, the foundations at Dhu Reef have been completed, and the tower is in course of construction. Six other lights and towers on that portion of the coast are being constructed in turn. The light tower at West Point, Tasmania, is under construction. </para>

                            <para>- We hope that they will be completed before the hurricane season  sets  in. The work can be conducted on the reefs only at certain seasons, and when the hurricane season sets in the vessels and men are compelled to return to the nearest port on the mainland. Last year they were paid off at Cooktown, but they are at work again in the endeavour to complete the operations before the advent of the next hurricane season. It is expected that three lights north of Cooktown will be completed this season. It is not intended to do the whole of this work at one time, but to spread it over a period of six years. That policy is in accordance with the suggestion I made to Commander Brewis in 1911-12, firstly, .in order that there should be no undue financial strain, on the Commonwealth; and, secondly,, because, having got together a body of men skilled in this work, they could be&#187; utilized at the various sites in turn. I think it was through this proposal to spread this work over six years that the Ship-owners Federation got the idea that we intended to pay during that period the whole cost of the lighthouses which the Commonwealth took over from the States, and that the allowance for depreciation would be fixed accordingly. </para>

                            <para>- The estimate is that the whole cost of maintenance - that is, lights, wages of employees, and the expenses of the vessels which visit the lights - will amount to from &#163;10,000 to &#163;12,000 more than we shall receive in revenue, after allowing a small amount for depreciation. It is not proposed to make any profit out of the lighting service, nor do I think we should attempt to do so. If it is found by experience that the proposed charges will leave us a profit, I shall advocate that they be reduced to a rate which will no more than enable the service to pay for itself. But we do propose to make the conditions of the men engaged in this work as comfortable as possible, and we :are hopeful of being able to arrange for <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> periodical transfer of officers so that their children may have, an opportunity of getting education, which they have not had in the past. The honorable member for Gippsland suggested that arrangements should be made whereby the lighthouse officials may record their votes at election time. I will bring that suggestion under the notice of the Electoral Department, in order to ascertain if such arrangements can be made. The proposal may present difficulties, but, if it can be carried out, I certainly think that we should give an opportunity to men whom we send to out-of-the-way places to record their votes. . If there is any other point on which honorable members desire information, I shall be pleased to give it. </para>

                        <para>. - In regard to light dues, what the Department tried to do when I was in charge of it was to induce the States to remit the dues which they charged, because there was a great danger that the public would be taxed twice for the same service. We urged the States to avoid duplication of taxation. At the Pre miers&#39; Conference in 1914, a statement was submitted which showed exactly the expenditure of the various States on this service. It was shown very clearly that the States have been grouping the light dues with the harbor and tonnage dues, and that it is very difficult to separate and re-allocate them. The Premiers promised to look into the matter, but I understand from the Minister that the answers received have been unsatisfactory. Any default on the part of the States in this respect must not be attributed to the Minister. The only danger I see is that of making the dues excessive. The light dues paid by the shipping community will be added to the freights and passenger fares, so that ultimately the charge will fail upon the people who are exporting, as well as those who are importing. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will carry out his expressed intention, and, instead of trying to make a profit out of the service, reduce the light dues as low as possible, if he finds that the revenue is increasing. I should like to ask the Minister if he proposes to give three months&#39; notice of the proposed new rates ? </para>

That measure has been passed by the Senate, and is now before this Chamber. The Government consider that it would not be wise to proclaim the Navigation Act until that Bill becomes law. A Director of Navigation has already been appointed, as has also a Chief  Clerk.  The latter was appointed about a week ago, and applications have been invited, with a view to filling the positions of Examiner and Surveyor. These applications are now being considered. Work is in progress in the matter of preparing regulations, and I may remark that these regulations will in themselves form a very thick volume. Under the Navigation Act there will be ten times more regulations than under any other Act. </para>

                        <para>. - The creation of a Navigation Department by the Commonwealth will mean running an entirely fresh Department concurrently with the existing State Departments. The intention of the late Government was - as soon as a Director of Navigation was appointed - to get into touch with the States, with a view &#34;to preventing unnecessary duplication of work, and to organizing the Department upon a uniform basis throughout Australia. I should be glad to know if any progress has been made in that direction. We do not desire to superimpose a seventh Department upon the existing State Departments. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I think so; but, as the honorable member will see, the death rate is very low, considering that there has been an average of over 8,000 men in camp during the whole of the time. This information, I think, will completely refute a lot of those wild statements which have been made. </para>

                        <para>- It will compare very favorably with the outside rate. Since the formation of the camp in August last, up till 25th May, the total number of cases of sickness has been 1,180, and the total number of sicknesses during the four weeks ending 22nd May, during the time when the bad weather was experienced, and when we heard statements about 250 at Broad meadows, was only 185. Of that number there are in treatment at the Broadmeadows Camp five, and at the base hospital seventy-four. I want to say that if these figures are analyzed, as they should be, it will be seen that we have nothing to complain about with regard to the mortality or sickness at Broadmeadows, and certainly there is nothing to be alarmed about. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say what they were, but I have given figures covering the four weeks ending 22nd May, and I can assure the House that we are doing everything possible to insure the health of the troops in camp. I think we ought to be very well satisfied with the position as disclosed in the return, and certainly there is no justification for the allegations about cruel treatment of the men in camp, and no justification for those wild statements which have been hurled at the Government, and perhaps also at the medical gentlemen connected with the camp. The return, I am confident, will ease the minds of all persons in Australia concerning the treatment which their relatives are receiving at the camp. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire once more to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the position of the coal-mining industry in the Newcastle district owing to the shortage of explosives. Since I referred to the matter recently in this House I have been, furnished with further information, and. I think it is my duty to lay the matter before the Prime Minister. I have received from the secretary of the Colliery Employees Federation a statement showing the number of unemployed in the* collieries in the Newcastle and Maitland districts, and also the state of the mines in regard to the shortage of explosives. The information forwarded to me  shows that  in the various mines of that district there is a total of 2,931 men unemployed or partially unemployed, owing to the shortage of explosives. The details are given as follows: - </para>

                    <para>Just recently a deputation waited upon the Minister of Mines, pointing out the urgency of the erection of this station, owing to the shortage of explosives at that time in the Newcastle and Maitland districts. The manager of the Westonite Company was on the deputation, and stated to the Minister that if a temporary testing station was erected he could then get on and manufacture explosives, and relieve the position that was so pronounced over the shortage of explosives. </para>

                    <para>We suggested to the Minister that an old tunnel could be temporarily erected whereby a test of the explosive could be made, but we have gone fully into this matter, and men we can safely rely upon assure us that a fair station could be erected for &#163;3,000. The Minister, in reply, stated that&#39; he had given the matter every consideration, and was very much in favour of the erection of a temporary testing station, and would recommend immediately to Cabinet the advisability of going into this matter at once. Wc would suggest, in view of this statement, that the Federal Government co-operate with the State, and ask them what they are doing to relieve the unemployed over the explosives question. </para>

                <para>I suggest that the Prime Minister should get into touch with the States, ascertain what is required, and what is being done ; and, further, that he should communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid in order to ascertain whether explosives could not be obtained from some manufacturing companies at Home, so as to relieve the acute position here. The question of a testing station could be discussed with the representatives of the States, and it ought to be, for it is, in my opinion, a national question. There ought to be a testing station for all explosives, so as to encourage manufacture here, and, in times such as the present, render us independent of outside supplies. This is a most important question, worthy of earnest consideration. We ought, in the first place, to provide for the temporary difficulty, and then take such steps as will insure that Australia in the future shall, in the matter of explosives, be self-contained. </para>

                    <para>. - In regard to the return as to sickness at Broadmeadows read by the Minister, I asked a question some time ago as to whether the cases detailed were cases of what is known as &#34;bed sickness,&#34; or whether the men were able to move about. The usual course pursued in camp is to have a sick parade. The men who are reported by a noncommissioned officer as being sick, are marched in charge of a corporal to the hospital at a time fixed in Orders. The time is fixed, not by the medical officer, but by the camp authorities; and if a parade is fixed for 6.30 o&#39;clock in the morning, that is not by choice of the medical officer, but by -order of the Commandant, who is solely responsible for routine matters. A triple report in relation to each case is made, and no man is seen or treated by the medical officer unless he is reported. We have heard that a medical officer refused to attend a in an who had been sent down in the course of the day by some officer ; and it must be understood that that medical officer was acting strictly in accordance with the regulations, which provide that attendance or medicine cannot be given unless the proper form is presented. Every man, no matter what his condition may be, who requires medical attendance or medicine, even though it be only a packet of salts, must have his name on the sick report ; and if the whole of the names of those who are on the sick report are included in the return read by the Minister, I can only say that the sickness in camp is miraculously slight. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot imagine for a moment that there has been any selection of cases. The only distinctions are between men who go into hospital and men who return to the tents, or to light duty or whole duty. I impress on honorable members the fact that of  the three reports one remains in possession of the medical officer, another in possession of the orderly corporal, while the third is placed on the file in the Regimental Office, and I cannot imagine that out of these records selections have been made. I am sorry that the Assistant Minister did not say anything about the letter which was read here, and which I understand was handed over to him for inquiry. </para>

                        <para>- There is just one other point I should like to mention. On a previous occasion I referred to the fact that cable messages had been received from members of the Forces abroad, asking their friends to send money to them, and that it had. come to my knowledge that a number of these were bogus and fraudulent. Cables have been sent purporting to come from members of the Expeditionary Force at Malta, while those men were still in Egypt ; and, therefore, the messages were forged. I ask the Minister to consider whether some means cannot he adopted to provide that such applications should come through the Pay Office, or some responsible officer who has some idea of the identity of the men. I only want the Government to protect those anxious relatives who are being victimized and exploited by a number of men who are taking advantage of long distance and of the natural anxiety felt by people regarding those for whom they have an affection. Several cases have come under my notice - one involving the sum of &#163;20 - and I am sure there must be a much larger number than I know about. </para>

                    <para>.- May I, in support of what the honorable member for Hunter has said, point out that the question of establishing a testing station for explosives has been brought forward on behalf of the miners several times in recent years. I remember when in the State Parliament that we made an effort to get a station established, but were not successful, and I fancy the fact that makers have had to send to England for whatever explosives they require has mitigated against Australian inventors taking up the question. I call to mind, for instance, the case of an old soldier who had invented an explosive which he thought was eminently suitable for coal-mining purposes, and I was appealed to to obtain for it a trial in the mines. I did this on behalf of both miners and managers at several collieries, whose opinions were that it was the best explosive they had ever used in a coal mine, both from the standpoint of safety and of production. To my surprise, however, the syndicate formed to manufacture the explosive in the State of New South Wales was refused a permit to make it. I have often thought, since then, that if there has been in existence in Australia any ring, it has been a ring of importers of explosives. This action on the part of the New South Wales Government has meant that the importers of the various kinds of permitted explosives have controlled the market. Now, owing to the absence of explosives from England, the coalmining industry is being paralyzed be cause the Coal Mines Regulation Act provides that only explosives that are on the permitted list shall be used. Surely in a national crisis like this, when such facts as these are known - and they can be substantiated by the cleverest mining  experts in our district - something can be done to meet the situation. The position has become very serious in the districts that are affected. Not only have mines been closed through the absence of any export trade, owing to the acquisition of ships and charters, and the embargo on coal, but the collieries at which work is going on will be in no better position unless explosives are forthcoming. </para>

                        <para>- No, I am not challenging it, except to this extent, that, though the Imperial Act and the New South Wales Act provide for the use of permitted explosives, we have no guarantee that when the explosives arrive they will be up to standard ; hence the necessity for a station at which the so-called permitted explosives from the other side of the world can be tested at any time. But this is the point: We are now in a necessitous position and require explosives. I have not seen the explosive known as &#34; Westonite,&#34; &#34;but, from what I have learnt of it, I think it is just as safe as some of the permitted explosives we have been importing - some of which, by the way, come from Germany. I have seen permitted explosives flare up in mines exuding any gas at all. However, the matter is so urgent that I do not think any time should be wasted, not only in establishing a testing station for Australia, but also in getting into touch with the Government of New South Wales, to see if it is not possible to give some assistance to an industry which is of such importance to Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The other night the honorable member for Bourke made a serious statement about a gentleman who occupies a prominent position in Sydney - <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Antill</inline> Pockley, whose son was killed in New Guinea nearly nine months ago - to the effect that he has not yet been able to secure any of his son&#39;s effects. That may not be a very big matter, from a national point of view, but the father naturally desires some relics of his son, and I ask, in the interests of the family, if the Prime Minister cannot see that these effects are returned to the family of the late Captain Pockley. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the remedy for the matter referred to by the honorable member for Hunter is not so very difficult, but what my honorable friend is suggesting would be no remedy at all. If you started tomorrow to build a testing station in Australia, by the time the plans and specifications were passed, the tenders called for, and an agreement arrived at between the Governments concerned, the war would be over. The honorable member&#39;s suggestion offers no immediate remedy. I think the remedy lies much nearer home. It is a fact that the people in Australia can make explosives that are both safe and efficient. All that is needed is for the Government of New South Wales to alter its Coal Mines Regulation Act, during the period of the war, so as to permit of locally-manufactured explosives being; used, under proper supervision. </para>

State with the view to see if anything can be done to provide immediate relief, and the second was that, if immediate relief cannot be provided, a testing station should be erected for future use, so that we might be able to establish our own factories. </para>

                        <para>- That will not give any immediate relief to the unemployed. Only one thing can do that, and that is relief from the conditions now imposed by the Act in New South Wales. I think that ought to have been done long ago. I cannot bring myself to believe that we cannot manufacture here explosives which would shoot coal and be perfectly safe, even though they be not on the approved list. That is the only immediate way out . of the situation. </para>

                    <para>. - A few days ago the Assistant Minister of Defence, in reply to a question, stated that the Department was not prepared to proceed with the work at Port Stephens.  A sum of &#163;5,000 is provided on the Estimates for the purpose, and I am informed that the survey is sufficiently complete to permit of men being employed at once.. The nation would get full value for its money, and the work would be very useful. We must all admit that eventually Port Stephens will become a very important harbor, as well as a means of defence. The answer to my quest-ion was not quite in accordance with the facts. I .am given to understand by those who know the locality that men could be set to work at once, and that the plant required would be a very small one, inasmuch as there is a great quantity of rock and mullock to be - shifted, which, of course, could be done with a few tools. According to the information I have received, it would take a very short time to arrange for a large number of men to be employed. The work is preliminary work, which must be carried out before any important operations can bc started. As an amount is provided oh the Estimates for the purpose, it seems to me that this is a very opportune time to provide employment. The men are very suitable to the work to be done. It is not a case of giving to men work for which they are not suitable. It can be easily started, because there are no engineering difficulties, and, as I said, not a very large amount of plant is required. </para>

                <para>Regarding the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Pockley,</inline> of Sydney, that he should be furnished with the personal property of his son, who was killed in the operations at New Guinea, I think that, if possible, it ought to be done, and will ask the Minister of Defence to take immediate action in that direction. </para>
                <para>With reference to the suggestions from the honorable members for Hunter and Newcastle, I think that a testing station for blasting powder ought to be established in Australia. War has its purposes and its lessons. Had a testing station been established here, I have no doubt that we would have had an explosive manufactured which would be absolutely safe.  We have simply rested on the fact that it would cost &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 a year to maintain it, and we have not such a station. It fs not fair to Australian inventors of explosives. Any person who knows anything about the subject is aware that one cannot transport a commodity, made into an explosive, to a testing station 10,000 miles away, and land  it there in the same condition as when it was shipped here. Therefore inventors are at a disadvantage. </para>

                        <para>- The State Government will be communicated with immediately, and if anything can be done by the Commonwealth Government to help in any way the use of an explosive made in Australia we shall do so; but I think the honorable member will see that primarily it is a matter which rests with the State.It is largely a coal mining affair, but I am bound to say that, as a question of policy, although we have always been against the proposal on the ground of cost, I think that the time has come when we must not only take risks, but be prepared to incur a considerable expenditure to put ourselves in a position to carry out what we have to do during war as well as in times of peace. </para>
