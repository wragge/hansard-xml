                        <para>- I cannot answer the question by merely saying &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34; No.&#34; The contracts - if I may apply that term to them - which existed before the war, would, were they still in force, prevent the sale of the products of the Broken Hill mines to the British Government, or to British manufacturers, and, if the Enemy Contracts Annulment Act, which was passed by this Legislature, had not annulled them, would still do so. But in my opinion, the Act is a valid exercise of our legislative authority, and is effective for the purpose for which it was intended. Some of the companies, however, assume that the measure is invalid, and, in consequence, concentrates and metallic products are not being sold to the British Government or to British buyers as freely as, I think, they ought to be sold to them. </para>

                        <para>- I have not had an opportunity of preparing a statement, but, by leave of the House, I shall shortly reply to the honorable member&#39;s question. This Government have come to an arrangement with -the Government of Queensland under which the latter have acquired the whole sugar crop of 1915 upon varying terms which average &#163;18. per ton for raw sugar, 94 per cent; net titre. This Government will, take over that sugar, and have made arrangements with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for refining and distributing it. We have come to an agreement with the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria - and I have no doubt that the Governments of the other States will cooperate with us, although we have not yet received replies to our communications to them - whereby we shall be able to retail sugar throughout Australia at a . maximum price of 3d. per lb. The discount now generally allowed to wholesalers will be extended to manufacturers, but no other discount. We have also taken over from the Colonial Sugar Re- . fining Company the sugar which it is importing from Java - both that which has arrived and that which is to arrive- upon terms that are satisfactory to us, and, shortly, are these: We pay the net cost to&#39; the Company of bringing the sugar to Australia, and from the 19th July, or  thereabouts, we shall put that sugar on the market. It is estimated that by the time that sugar has been consumed the new season&#39;s crop will be available. I am not able to speak in detail of the arrangements between the Queensland Government, the millers, and the cane-growers, but I have been given to understand that they are quite satisfactory. In regard to the remission of duty on imported sugar, the Government were faced with many difficulties. The quantity now to be imported is 14,200 tons; but, with the further shortage which is certain to arise about the end of February or the beginning of&#39; March, probably 80,000 to 120,000 tons more will be needed. It is impossible to speak with greater accuracy of this shortage, because neither the exact quantity of the present crop nor the date on which the new crop will begin to be available are known. It is clear that if the 1916 season is early the period of shortage will be abridged, and the importations will be less than they must be should the season be late. The Government were, therefore, confronted with the difficulty of remitting duty on, not 14,200 tons, but probably 130,000 tons. Considering all the circumstances, we decided that the welfare of the community, and of those engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland, whose interests as much as those of any other section must be considered, would be best served by spreading the duty on the 14,200 tons over the whole quantity of sugar that we have acquired, namely, 14,200 tons of imported sugar and 120,000 tons of Queensland sugar. That will make the duty about 12s. per ton spread over the whole crop. &#187; The terms upon which we have acquired the sugar, and the cost of refining, distributing, and placing it on the market will enable the Government to sell it to the community at 3d. per lb. As the Government have no power to fix prices it was necessary to secure the cooperation of the various State Governments, and consequently I saw the Attorney-General of New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Hagelthorn,  and the Premier of Victoria, and they have agreed to cooperate with us, and fix the wholesale price of sugar at such an amount as will enable this to be done. No sugar will be sold except upon the condition that it is retailed at the maximum price of 3d. per lb., and it will be sold in &#91;169&#93;- 2 </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Brisbane at the same price at which it is sold in Perth, namely, 3d. per lb. The position in regard to the New South Wales crop is different. The Commonwealth Government have not taken it over, and no arrangements have been made to do so, but I am authorized to say that it is the wish of the New South Wales Government to take it over if the growers of New South Wales so desire. In that .case the Commonwealth Government will extend to raw sugar so produced in New South Wales the same treatment as that given to raw sugar produced in Queensland, and it will be retailed at the same price, and treated in exactly the same way. </para>

The only occasion when a greatcoat becomes really necessary to recruits is when visiting their friends in the evenings, and on these occasions men wear their own private clothes. By far the greater majority come into camp with overcoats; those who do not are only in the same position as they were before joining the forces. However, the Department, with .almost an undue solicitude for the welfare and comfort of the soldier, has sanctioned the issue of a greatcoat to all men immediately on joining, and these garments should certainly have been provided as directed by Head-quarters. This matter is now the subject of separate* correspondence. </para>

It was well cooked, of first-class quality, and comprised roast beef, baked onions, boiled potatoes, bread, and tea. Later I visited the kitchen, where the cooks were preparing a warm evening meal for the men, who were having a field day. That meal consisted of beef, vegetables in ample quantity, potatoes, onions, and carrots. As there was an abundant supply of good, wholesome, clean food, I was satisfied there was no room for complaint on that score.

My son, Private Ernest Watkins, A Company, 17th Battalion, was at Liverpool Camp for four months prior to his departure on 12th May for the front. On his visits home and to my relatives, who visited him, ho spoke highly of the way men were treated at the camp. They were well fed, well treated, and had little to complain of. He made no complaints. The tents were rather crowded, hut he knew this was unavoidable, and even it was improving. They had no beds, but plenty of blankets, which were, he considered, sufficient. </para>
                        <para>My son was dangerously ill in hospital for about a fortnight while at Liverpool, and was most grateful for the care and attention he received from the doctors and nurses. He had a comfortable bed, and everything was satisfactory in every way. </para>

It was not necessary for him to visit Melbourne, because the officer is stationed at Echuca, and Bendigo is a recruiting centre, where finality in regard to medical examination can be obtained. This officer could have gone to Bendigo from Echuca in one day. He did  apply  for three days&#39; leave, but the original application, which I have with me now, does not mention anything about going to Melbourne. In regard to another case which has been mentioned, the officer, who was stationed in Melbourne, absented himself without leave, and, consequently, his lost time was deducted. No application for leave is in the hands of the  Deputy,  but if an application is received, and leave is desired for recruiting . purposes, the officer will suffer no reduction of pay. I have given instructions that no impediment is to be put in the way of any officer who desires to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> to the front. Notwithstanding what his position may be. every facility will be given to any officer who volunteers. </para>

                        <para>- Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the various statements which have recently&#39; appeared in the press, that large sums of money are leaving Australia for investment in the Imperial war loan. Does the Prime Minister intend to raise a loan in Australia? If that is his intention, does he not think it would be well to make an announcement on the point as early as possible, in view of the circumstance to which I have referred? </para>

                        <para>- I will look into the matter, which has my entire sympathy. Representations were made on the point some time ago, but the only shipping company over which we had any control was the Orient Steam Navigation Company, as mail contractors. I believe they have been doing what was required ever since. I will, however, go into the matter with a view to seeing if it is possible to carry out, in other directions, the honorable member&#39;s suggestion. </para>

                    <para>- By way of personal explanation, I desire to refer to a report appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of Monday, 5th instant, relating to a meeting addressed by me at the Bijou Theatre, Melbourne, on the previous evening. In regard to that report I desire to say that it was the report of a speech which occupied an hour and a half in delivery, and was neither adequate nor accurate, nor did it fairly convey the views expressed by me at the meeting. I desire also to refer to a leading article appearing in the following day&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which misrepresents me in the following particulars: - (1) It misrepresents me as favouring the application of conciliation and reason to persons engaged in the horrible atrocities of war, while in truth and in fact I pointed out that the horrors of war precluded both conciliation and reason, and justified the policy of my party and myself in favouring the settlement of international disputes - not atrocities - by conciliation and arbitration. (2) It misrepresents me as being willing to argue with fiends; as being complacent at the sufferings of my countrymen and their Allies, and as regarding with contempt those who are fighting in the war, while in truth and in fact I pointed out the futility of arguing with such persons so inflamed with the blood-lust of war. I referred in feeling terms to the sufferings of the soldiers and those who were bereft of those near and dear to them, and, to the best of my ability, I paid a tribute to the bravery of the troops at the front. (3) It misrepresents me as referring sneeringly to our soldiers as &#34; war-like persons,&#34; whereas the expression was used in reply to a hostile interjection of a political character, and the reply was of a purely political character. It had a political application, referring to persons whose names I cannot properly mention under cover of a personal explanation, but not to soldiers in any way whatever. In addition to these outstanding misrepresentations, I have to- say that the whole article from the first line to the last, by assertion, suggestion, and innuendo is a mere licensed vilification of myself- </para>

The men who would be considered in an arrangement such as proposed will be available for embarkation as reinforcements almost as soon, if they contemplate harvesting as early as possible and enlist immediately they are in a position to do so. In the meantime, the men who are available will be drawn upon for present requirements. </para>

A member of this House addresses a party meeting and tells those present that he declines to talk in Parliament because he refuses to immerse himself in party strife! The impertinence of the statement ! He goes to a meeting of a political league which supports his own side in politics to say that the men who are opposed to him are traitors to their country!  His  speech proves him to be a man who is absolutely unreliable, and who is not responsible for what he may say in public. I <inline font-style="italic">am</inline> sorry that the honorable member is not here, so that I might throw back his statement in his teeth. We, on this side, are not traitors to our country; quite the contrary. We are in favour of the referenda proposals, which we decline to discuss as party questions, because this country needs saving from other than European enemies, and because the enemy within the gates is of more danger than the enemy without. </para>

If honorable members continue to make statements like that of the honorable member for Balaclava, I shall not sit silent under them. Had the honorable member been present to-day, I should have had still stronger things to say of him. At the meeting at which his statements were made, it was said by an ex-member of this House that if the Minister of Defence had had a son at the front a second shift would have been installed at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow long ago. A more despicable statement was never uttered in public. Honorable members opposite ought to be ashamed that at their party meetings statements like that are allowed to go unchallenged. Such statements are not likely to bring about the cessation of party warfare, and I am going to fight attacks of that kind whatever the quarter from which they may come. I may have something more to say about this matter later, when the honorable member for Balaclava is present&#39;. </para>

                    <para>Last Thursday I put a question to the Assistant Minister of Defence regarding the rejection of volunteers. On the 29th June, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. J.</inline> R. Lee, speaking at a meeting held in the Malvern Town Hall, said that there is too much red-tape about the system of examining volunteers, the rejections, according to the newspaper reports, being 50 per cent, of the men volunteering. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. J.</inline> Leon </para>
                    <para class="block">Jones said that to his own personal knowledge fine, able-bodied men, who would be a credit to any country, had been rejected, and weeds had been accepted. According to the press reports, in Victoria, on Thursday last, 297 men volunteered for service, and of these 124 were rejected as medically unfit. On the 2nd July, the volunteers numbered 263, and the rejections 97. On the 3rd July the volunteers were 411, and the rejections 173. On Monday last, 1,129 men  volunteered  and 316 were rejected; and yesterday 1,949 applied for enlistment, and 977, or nearly half, were rejected. In June 5,564 men volunteered in Victoria, and only 3,381 were accepted. The magnificent response of the men of Victoria to the call now being made is most creditable to the State ; but the position is seen to be serious when it is remembered that about 40 per cent, of those who offer are rejected as unfit. Is the  manhood  of Australia - because the results obtained in Victoria are an indication of the position in the other States - becoming unfit for military service ? It is the best men who are offering now. The best men always offer first. From volunteering you get better results than are obtained by conscription, and it is a sad state of affairs if the manhood of Australia is degenerating so greatly, from a military stand-point, as it would appear to be if these figures can be taken as a correct guide. What makes the position worse is that since the 2nd July the Defence Department has reduced the standard of  height  the standard of measurement, the requirements in regard to teeth, and the requirements in regard to other physical Qualifications, and that, nevertheless, the percentage of rejections increases. In Great Britain the experience has been the same. During the Boer War a p&#39;osition of affairs such as that to which I am now alluding was made plain in Great Britain. Thousands offered for service, of whom an immense number were rejected. The Inspector-General of Recruiting, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Maurice, reporting on the subject, made some rather startling statements. He said that there was an alarming proportion of the young men of the country unfit for military service on account of defective physique, and added that at the end of two years more than 40 per cent, of the .men -wishing to become soldiers would not be found serving; or, in other words, that 60 per cent, of the men offering were physically unfit to serve as soldiers. I have here a table showing the reasons for which men are rejected. It compares the rejections obtained in 1891 with those obtained in 1902, as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Director-General of the British Army Medical Service, who was asked to report on that matter, somewhat questioned the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Maurice, but the. latter pointed out that, although the military medical statistics showed that the rejections were only thirty-seven per 1,000, a large number of men failed to pass the recruiting sergeant and did not come under medical inspection ; and that there was also a large percentage of men who, knowing their inability  to pass the test, did nob offer themselves. On these grounds, it was considered that the estimate of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Maurice, that 60 per cent, of the manhood of the British Isles were incapable of rendering military service, was well within the mark; and the position was regarded as so serious that King Edward appointed a Royal Commission, which undertook a very full and complete examination of the position. It dealt with such things as infantile mortality, hereditary taint, employment of mothers late in pregnancy and too soon after childbirth, decrease in breast feeding, defective milk supply, parental ignorance and neglect, school system, risks of contamination during adolescence, syphilis, insanity, eyes and ears, teeth, and so on. I do not wish to go into all these matters. I merely n6w refer to the question of teeth, to which the honorable member for Richmond has rightly drawn attention.

                        <para>No, with the one exception of the teeth. It is an obvious fact that the teeth of the people of the present time cannot stand comparison, in point of durability, with those of the earlier inhabitants of Britain. Those who have the opportunity of examining ancient .skulls cannot fail to be struck with this. . . . In the white races of Europe the jaws are undergoing a slow process of shortening. The stunted character of the wisdom or backmost teeth, the small amount of space allotted to  them,  their variability, their late appearance* and, indeed, their frequent failure to appear at all, bespeak this change in the jaws. Through it the teeth are reduced in size, more crowded together, and, therefore, more liable to disease. Indirectly this may tend to favour the early degeneration of the teeth which is so marked a feature of the present age; but I take it that the real cause of this degeneration is the striking change which has&#62; taken place in the character of the food. </para>

                    <para class="block">That an unreasonable number of men is being rejected in Australia on account of defective teeth is very evident. I think that these men are being rejected on very unnecessary grounds. We find it impossible to believe that, because a man happens to be short of a few teeth, or has artificial teeth, he is thereby prevented1 from fulfilling the duties of a soldier satisfactorily and effectively. The fact that the majority of the people of Australia have to resort to artificial aid to mastication is most regrettable, but should not in the slightest degree detract from their ability to serve their country, though probably it may place them at a disadvantage occasionally. The military authorities are unreasonably strict in rejecting men because of bad teeth. However, the whole question of the number of rejected men, and the reasons for their rejection, is a very important one, which the Government should take into consideration. The social conditions of the people, the kind of life we have to live,, the conditions under which we are living, the houses we occupy, the food we eat, the cooking of our food, and the hygienic surroundings of life generally - all these matters ought to be the subject of a very searching inquiry. Undoubtedly, they are affecting the physique and efficiency of our race. Australia is able to supply, in proportion to its population and resources, a much larger number of men and quantity of equipment in support of the Mother Country than any other Dominion but the fact stares us in the face that if we had to depend entirely on our own resources for the repelling of an invasion, we should be in a very sad position indeed. Some of us deplore most regretfully our inability to serve the Empire at this juncture; but if we are to have a continuation of the physical degeneracy that seems to be affecting the British people, as indicated by the figures I have given, and the reports I have read in regard to the British people, and by the statements appearing in our press as to the number of men rejected in Australia, . it would really seem that, before long, we must regard ourselves as a degenerate nation. If the war, which has opened our eyes to certain weaknesses in our military organization, and also in our civil affairs, also opens our eyes to those social and moral questions so intimately associated with the welfare, physical development, and mental improvement of the people, it will have done some real good. </para>

                        <para>.- I am pleased to have the opportunity of thanking the Prime Minister for his intimation of the intention to appoint a judicial tribunal to inquire into, the charges I made in this House on Thursday last relative to the management of the military camp at Liverpool, because I feel sure that nothing bub good will result from such an inquiry. As I made my charges after personally investigating the truth of them, I am prepared to stand by them. I do not detract one charge I made in regard to the management of the camp, as I feel sure that I can verify every statement I made ; and it was my intention to-day to give the House the benefit of my experience at the camp on Sunday last. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be only too pleased to give the Commission the sources of my information. I hope that the Prime Minister, in justice to myself, will recognise the urgent necessity for appointing the Commission speedily, and taking evidence, not in regard .to the Camp as it is now, but in regard to what it was before I made my charges. A wonderful difference has taken place at Liverpool since Thursday last. The Assistant Minister of Defence is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 3rd July to have said - </para>

                    <para>There was a temporary shortage of military overcoats at Liverpool depot. However. 1,000 overcoats had been supplied to them that day, mid if si further deficiency was found on inspection, additional supplies would be provided. </para>
                    <para class="block">Evidently the gun that I levelled at the shortage of overcoats was loaded. On Friday last the military authorities went through Sydney buying up all the available overcoats to supply the men who had been without them for weeks. Mattresses were also unearthed suddenly from some mysterious recess, and the men are getting the benefit of them to-day. On Monday the troops were lined up, and the officers went round and asked each man to step forward and state what particular clothes he was short of - whether underclothes, dungarees, overcoats, or anything else in the shape of personal equipment. Consequently on investigation into the conditions of the camp at the present time, or next week, or the week after, would not be fair to me. My charges were levelled against the Department in regard to the conditions prevailing ;it Liverpool a week ago. The Assistant Minister of Defence read a letter this afternoon that the Minister of Defence had received from the mother of a recruit. I may be permitted to read a letter that I received from one of the men in the camp. It is as follows: - </para>
                    <para>Just n line to tell you there is a vast difference in the Camp routine since your speech in the House last week. I may say that overcoats and warm underclothing are being served out to the men with post haste, also straw mattresses are being provided in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> huts. </para>
                    <para class="block">That the military authorities are endeavouring to rectify their shortcomings as speedily as possible is quite evident. There was a general cleaning up at the Camp last week-end. Men who have been stationed at Liverpool since. February say that they have never seen such activity. It was because the Minister and </para>
                    <para class="block">I were, expected there on the Saturday. I believe that the position at the hospital, on which remarks of a eulogistic nature have been passed to-day, was ludicrous. Though men in the past have had to wait an hour or so for attention, on Saturday one man who was carried up on a stretcher was absolutely rushed by four doctors anxious to attend to him. Seemingly my charges are bearing fruit. If they have resulted in giving the men -better conditions - in fact, in giving them that to which they are perfectly entitled - I shall be satisfied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> went .to the camp and has made a report. I have the statement on good authority that he simply went to the officer commanding,  Colonel Kirkland,  and, accompanied by  Colonel Stanley,  they went down the lines and asked &#34; Any complaints? &#34; Could anything be more ludicrous ? </para>

                            <para>- Then why did not the Assistant Minister of Defence allow the matter to rest, without introducing fresh matter beyond that which I mentioned in my speech? The Minister referred to the quality of the food. I did not speak about the quality of the food; I complained of the way in which it was served. The food is good enough, but it is the manner in which it is issued that I object to. I contrasted its issue with the issue of the food at the German Internment Camp, and I asked the authorities to take a lesson from the management of the internment camp. By so doing they would greatly benefit the men at Liverpool. This letter continues - </para>

                        <para>On the question of accommodation. On arrival we were given three blankets, one rubber sheet, and told to sleep in a long shed, which at that time was devoid of windows, except in places. Since then windows of tin have been constructed. But that first night will be one long to be remembered for the bitterness of the cold and the hardness of the boards. No one slept, and all, pretty well, were coughing violently. I do not wonder at pneumonia under those circumstances. Two days later we received sacks, which we filled with straw; these were our mattresses, given the day after you advocated them. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I wish to emphasize the point that those mattresses were issued only on the day after I advocated that course in this House. </para>
                    <para>Needless to say, they made things more comfortable. They talk about overcrowding in the city; well, you should see how we sleep in one of those sheds - cold and bleak and draughty as they are. We are packed so close that our breaths mingle and our shoulders touch - forty of us each side of the shed, eighty in the shed. There is no room to dress, and everything is disgustingly cramped and unhealthy, and we are told we ore responsible for all things issued to us. How can we be in an overcrowded shed, without convenience or comforts, or a place to put our things except the floor (not even a nail) ? We get our food like animals, and have to eat it on the ground in the dust, which is 6 inches thick. As you know, the stew is brought over in boilers, or dixies they call them, and there is a rush. One man is supposed to serve from this to the others, but the men are naturally impatient, and help themselves, and there is confusion confounded. The same applies to the tea and coffee, which is likewise brought in .dixies. For tea we get dry bread and jam. After our meals certain of our number have to wash out these boilers; there is no hot water provided to wash the grease off them and the plates; <inline font-style="italic">lit</inline> lead, we have to rub them with a dirty red sand and wash them in the river or under a tap - a slow and dirty process. We have to then fill them and take them back to the cooks - this, mind, is for the convenience of the cooks, who will not give hot water to do it. Then eating our food in the dirt is abominable - and dirty. Why cannot a table be provided that we can eat our food from ? With regard to washing, there are far too few taps- </para>
                    <para>I may say that there are only five taps for 400 men. The conveniences in this respect are altogether inadequate. There are no basins of any kind, and some men have to wait for over half-an-hour before they can reach the taps, and consequently many of them have wet boots and trousers before they can wash themselves - and the spectacle is common of crowds of men waiting to wash themselves, their tin plates, and to fill their boilers and rinse them out. Far more taps should be provided, and more conveniences erected. The sanitary arrangements are crude and devoid of all privacy and decency to a disgusting degree. Little wooden or iron cubicles should be erected; instead there is simply a rail with tins underneath. In the matter&#34; of accommodation, as I said, there is neither convenience nor comfort, and there is overcrowding, rendering the loss or theft of articles quite easy. </para>

This is a lie, and let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> become a recruit and he will agree it is. We have given our all, our lives, and left comfort, convenience, and congenial company, and the least the Government might do is to give us some place where we can eat our food in cleanliness, where we can sleep in comfort, where we can wash decently, where the sanitary arrangements are better than a black&#39;s camp, and where the food is served with system and with sufficiency. </para>

                <para>Dear Sir,</para>
                <para>I was delighted to&#39; read in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> of the stand you have taken on behalf of our recruits at Liverpool Camp. The following may interest you : - My only son enlisted, and was duly drafted to Liverpool Camp. He complained of the cold nights in Camp, and longed for something warmer to lay on, but &#34; stuck &#34; it like he should. </para>
                <para>On Thursday, the 24th, he had awful pains in the stomach, and desired to see the doctor. He had to walk nearly 2 miles to get to the doctor&#39;s place, and he was so bad that his mates offered to carry him there. He said &#34;No,&#34; he&#39;d get there somehow, and did. </para>
                <para>An orderly asked what was the matter; he told him, and there was a conversation between the orderly and a third person. My son then heard the following remark : &#34; It won&#39;t hurt him, anyway,&#34; and a dose of oil was given him to take. He walked back again and had a terrible night. </para>
                <para>The next I heard was a telephone message that the civil ambulance was taking my boy to the garrison hospital, at Victoria Barracks, and as he was pretty bad I should get there quickly. </para>
                <para>An examination there showed that he was suffering from acute appendicitis, and an immediate operation was the only chance he had. </para>
                <para>Thank God for the Christians he was then amongst ! The doctors went without their dinners to get to him right away, the matron and nurses treated him as if he was their only son, and to-day he is making a rapid recovery. </para>
                <para class="block">I trust that there will be an examination into the whole of the management of thai  camp  and that evidence will be obtained from the men who were at Liverpool at the time my charges were made. The Government must recognise that men are leaving for the front daily, and if the investigation is delayed, in all probability many of those who gave the evidence which I have placed before the House will have left &#39;for the seat of war, and their testimony will riot be available. </para>

                            <para>- We are men of the world, and we know what human nature is. I say that we cannot have these camps too well lighted ; and if it is necessary to light the German Camp with electricity, why not give the Liverpool Camp the same advantage? One of the writers whom I have quoted complained of the lack of hot water with which to cleanse the dixies. Perhaps it would surprise the Assistant Minister to learn that at the German Camp it is quite the usual thing for some of the men to receive hot baths. Our boys at Liverpool have difficulty in getting hot water even to wash their utensils in. I am not desirous of hampering the Government in any way in this matter, but the points that have been raised are common knowledge up there, and it is the men who are complaining. On the previous occasion when I visited the camp I was alone. This time several honorable members of this House accompanied me. They are prepared to substantiate the statements I made, and hundreds of men are also prepared to indorse them. I am delighted that the Prime Minister has expressed his willingness that the matter should be investigated by a judicial tribunal; but what I do ask is that the inquiry shall be held as speedily as possible, because men are leaving the camp daily, and delay would not be fair to me. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with keen interest to the remarks of the honorable member for Nepean, and I think the House and the country ought to congratulate the honorable member upon having brought the treatment which soldiers have been receiving at the Liverpool Camp before the notice of the House. A great many of my electors have gone to the front. More of them are now in course of training at the camp; otherwise, I would not have spoken on this subject. </para>

I discussed affairs with him. I asked him whether he was well looked after when in hospital. He said the nurses were all male nurses, very willing, and though rough, and not accustomed to nursing, they did their best. I said, &#34; What nourishment did you receive - what food ? &#34; He said, &#34; That is the point; all they gave me was three courses of gruel a day.&#34; I said, &#34; How long did you receive this?&#34; He said, &#34;For a week.&#34; &#34;After that,&#34; I said, &#34;you were convalescent?&#34; He said, &#39; &#39; Fairly so ; and all they gave me was three rounds of bread and marmalade a day.&#34; I said, &#34; Were they big rounds?&#34; He said, &#34;No; they were not very much better than a lady would receive at afternoon tea.&#34; Three slices of bread and marmalade a day ! </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, I am giving the story as I received it, and I will believe this soldier, just as I would believe the Postmaster-General, and I say that without casting any reflection on the Postmaster-General. I asked him what the food generally was. He said it was very .good, though badly cooked. With regard to the camp, he told me they had long sheds with boarded floors 3 feet from the ground, but between each board there was about an inch of space, through which there was such a draught that he preferred to lie on the floor than upon the boards. I was very much struck with the statement made by the honorable member for Nepean regarding dirty medicine bottles. I asked this young fellow if the facts were as stated. He said they were. I said, &#34; Don&#39;t you think the story that persons went to the doctors with dirty medicine bottles looks very much like a tale?&#34; He said that the men took these bottles to the doctors thinking they would be taken away and their medicine supplied in clean bottles, as they had no facilities for washing the bottles in the camp. </para>

                            <para>- There are, or should be, facilities in the dispensary. Honorable members know that in every country town in New South Wales men go round the town buying medicine bottles, which are cleaned and used again. The same thing might apply to this camp. These young fellows came along with dirty bottles, and I was informed that in many cases medicine was put into the bottles and mixed up with the ingredients already there. I am surprised more of them were not sick. I asked my friend if the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> regarding the coats and clothing generally supplied to the interned Germans was correct ? He said it was absolutely correct. I asked him how he knew, as he was not there. He told me that the motors passed close to the camp, and that the soldiers used to watch the lorries carrying all kinds of luxuries for the Germans, and to wish that they could be treated in a similar manner. </para>

                            <para>- I will give the name of this man, if need be. I am surprised that the Assistant Minister, after having heard the statements made in this House by the honorable member for Nepean, should have allowed a week to elapse without making personal inquiries. Every other consideration should have been placed on one side by the Assistant Minister. It is suggested that enlistment is being discouraged by these statements. My retort to that is that enlistment is being encouraged by our criticism. The young fellows who give up all for their country are entitled to the best treatment possible. We should exert ourselves to the very utmost to make them comfortable, and to see that they get everything they need. Nothing is too good for them. </para>

                            <para>- I do know what I am talking about. Here is a letter on the point. This man enlisted as a private on 2nd May; he has been acting sergeant, and is still getting private&#39;s pay. I do not wish to create any ill-feeling in this matter. All I want is to see that things are run on proper and right lines. I believe that a good deal of what is complained of has been done in ignorance. I am afraid that the Minister is too much inclined to accept the reports of officials. 1 believe the Prime Minister is actuated by motives of patriotism. </para>

I hope that the Minister of Defence, in view of what has been said, will at once make a personal investigation of- these matters.

I cannot but admire the interest the Opposition now display in the men in camp.

That honorable member has an interesting story to tell of the conditions which prevailed in the shearing sheds of Australia when he was a young man. I am pleased to find honorable members opposite displaying some consideration for shearers and others now in camp, and I hope that those who have enlisted will return from the front fit in wind and limb to take their places once more in the industrial army of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I do not accept as gospel every statement made by honorable members opposite, and we have learned this afternoon that most of the allegations made in regard to the Liverpool Camp have been disproved. Whilst I was serving with the Militia in South Australia I attended three camps, and am able to say that life in camp means a rather rough time. Whilst there I ate food at which I should have turned up my nose had it been offered to me at home, and my limbs often ached as the result of sleeping on the ground instead of on a well-made bed, such as that to which I was accustomed. But I recognised that I went into camp to be trained as a soldier, and that I had  to rough it. If honorable members opposite were not so ready to listen to a few who will never be satisfied, we should not have so many complaints as we have had. I trust that when our troops come back, and take their places in the industrial fighting line of Australia, honorable members of the Opposition will give equal attention and interest to their demands for fair conditions of employment, and for reasonable wages, so that they may be able to. buy spring mattresses, overcoats to keep out the cold, and comfortable  houses  The Opposition will have an opportunity to do something to better the conditions of these men when they return, but I am afraid their wail will then be that the men are always asking for something for nothing, and that they do not give a fair return f or_ what they are receiving. I did not rise to criticise the Opposition, but I felt that I could not allow the opportunity to pass without making a reply to some of the statements we have had from them concerning the treatment of our troops. I wish now to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister of Defence a complaint regarding the treatment meted out to a medical officer of the Friendly Societies Medical Association of South Australia, who, because he holds that position, ia ostracised by the local branch of the British Medical Association. That association has fought the Friendly Societies Medical Association most bitterly from its very inception, and apparently the same bitterness is now Being evinced in connexion with the making of arrangements for the care of our wounded. Doctor Holmes, who holds the rank of Captain in the Army Medical Corps in Tasmania, and is at present a medical officer of the Friendly Societies Medical Association of South Australia, recently presented his commission to the commandant in Adelaide, and offered his services either in connexion with camp work or the treatment of wounded soldiers returning to South Australia. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and also a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, so that he is a properly-qualified medical man. In order to prove that he did not make this offer merely with a desire to get into the limelight, I think it well to mention that he is nearly seventy years of age.  His  son, Lieutenant L. G. Holmes, went with the First Contingent to Egypt, and while there was made Aide-de-Camp to the Brigadier of the Third Brigade, and promoted to the rank of Captain. He has since been wounded at the Dardanelles. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Holmes,</inline> as I have mentioned, made application to serve his King and country by attending soldiers in camp, or wounded soldiers returned to Australia. The reply that he received from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Shepherd,</inline> the Principal Medical Officer, could not have been more terse or cutting than it was. It was addressed to him, not as &#34; Captain &#34; or &#34; Doctor &#34; Holmes, but as &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holmes,</inline> 24 Parade, Norwood,&#34; and was as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- Professional etiquette should have been sunk in this connexion; but, in any event, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Holmes</inline> was entitled to be addressed as &#34; Captain Holmes,&#34; since he still retains his commission. I hope that the Minister will demand that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Shepherd</inline> shall extend to every military officer the respect and courtesy that he would expect to be shown to himself. I hope, further, that the Minister will inquire whether, on the 18th May last, the date on which this application was made, there was really no vacancy for medical men in the directions indicated. If there was a vacancy it will prove conclusively that the feud existing between the local branch of the British Medical Association and the Friendly Societies Medical Association was responsible for this refusal. In any event, I trust that the Minister will direct <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Shepherd&#39;s</inline> attention to the fact that, as a military officer, he must, when addressing a military officer, have due regard to the ordinary courtesies aud requirements of the service. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to take this opportunity to make a few suggestions, which I am sure the Assistant Minister of Defence will accept in the spirit in which they are offered. I am pleased to learn that the Government have decided that a Judge shall be appointed to inquire into the condition of things alleged to have existed at the Liverpool Camp prior to the speech made in this House by the honorable member for Nepean, in which attention was directed to the matter. Since that date, I have visited the camp in order to interview some of my own constituents there; but, in view of what is taking place, I shall make no statement now regarding what I saw. I wish, however, to remind the Assistant Minister, and the Committee, that the Liverpool Camp is a permanent one, established on property purchased by the Commonwealth at a cost of something like &#163;150,000, and that it will be well for the Minister, in view of the large expenditure so incurred, to avail himself of the best services that the Departments can offer him in his desire to make the camp what it ought to be. I suggest to the Minister that he should avail himself of the skilled advice of  Colonel Owen,  Director-General of Public Works, who, being a military officer, would understand camp requirements. He should ask  Colonel Owen  to furnish him with a lay-out of the ground showing how it may be used to the best advantage, and setting forth what permanent structures and conveniences are necessary to make it all that it should be, not only for its present purpose, but as a permanent military area. In the first place, it would be well to ask  Colonel Owen  if it is possible to provide the camp with a proper system of sanitation by means of septic tanks. </para>

                            <para>- I think it can be done. I hope it will not be thought that, in making these suggestions, I do not realize what camp life means, or that there is any desire on the part of the Opposition to make feather-bed soldiers of our men. We realize what camp life means, but recognise, at the same time, that a certain measure of comfort and convenience should be provided for men who are doing the highest work that can be performed for their country. We do not wish to spoon-feed these men, but, at the same time, we think they should have some conveniences. There should be, for instance, a better system in connexion with the serving of their meals. The men have their food supplied to them in a small boiler with a cover, which they call a &#34;Dixie,&#34; and they eat from tin plates, which, with the &#34;Dixies,&#34; they are expected to return clean to the cook, or else to pay him 6d. per week for cleaning them. At present cold-water taps are the only means provided for cleaning these vessels, and, as honorable members know, it is impossible to properly clean greasy vessels by the application of cold water. I suggest that  Colonel Owen  should be asked to report whether it would not be possible to introduce some system of steam jets, or hot water, for the cleaning of such vessels. There should also be a better system of lighting. At present, the camp is lit here and there by a kerosene lamp on the top of a post, and men on sentry duty find it scarcely possible to identify persons in the poor light provided at night. Reading in their tents at night, the men have to use candles, which waste quickly and give but a poor light, because of the way in which the flame is blown about by the draughts. Would it not be better to provide electric lighting for the whole camp? I think that the Minister should visit the camp, and obtain his information at first hand. At present he relies.  too much on his officers, and, while I admire him &#39;for sticking to them, I know that officers are not faultless, and that a surprise visit would teach the Minister a great deal as to how money can be best spent in fitting up the camp, not merely for temporary occupation during the present training, but for all time. What I have asked for I look upon, not as .luxuries, but as necessaries. When a man wishes to wash his face, he has to catch with his hands the water from a tap, no trough or basin, being provided. Thus water is wasted, and the process is uncomfortable to the washer. Every navvy or timber-cutter has a dish, supported on three posts, for service as a wash basin, and our soldiers would not be spoon-fed if they were provided with similar conveniences. As to clothing, several hundred boys assured us that they were three weeks in camp before they received their dungarees. Many a boy leaves home with only the suit in which he stands up. He thinks that other clothes would be a nuisance, and he knows that it would be difficult to send them back. I had considerable trouble in getting the belongings of a soldier who had left for the front returned to his friends. Under these circumstances, men should be supplied with dungarees within a few days of their joining the camp. There may be reasons for not providing uniforms at once, but dungarees could be given. I left the Liverpool Camp at 5.45 on Friday night, and the outside sentry, who, I understood, was there for the night, was without an overcoat. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, I accept the explanation; but had the Minister visited the camp with the honorable member for Nepean, a large number of matters could have been dealt with straight off. I have not been able to take interest in the Liverpool Camp, because of distance from Melbourne; but when my boy was at Broadmeadows I visited the camp there several times, and various complaints were brought under my notice. I learned, however, that there are two sides to most questions. The honorable member for Calare instanced the case of an acting-sergeant-major, who, he said, was not getting the pay of his rank. The honorable member first omitted to say that the man was only acting as sergeant-major, which makes all the difference. Very often, before a man can qualify for promotion, he is permitted to act in the rank to which he aspires. A private&#39;s first step is to the position of corporal. The corporal may become a sergeant, and so on. It is of advantage to a corporal who wishes to become a sergeant to be permitted to act as a sergeant. Such a man has a better chance of passing for sergeant than a man who has not acted in the position.  </para>

                            <para>- There may have been some hardship in that case, but most young fellows who aspire to a higher rank are glad to act in the higher capacity before submitting themselves to examination to prove their qualification for promotion. As to the supply of overcoats, I know that members of one contingent were not given overcoats until shortly before they left. But overcoats are often stolen. One young fellow of whom I heard had his overcoat stolen by a tent mate, and became liable for its replacement. </para>

                            <para>- As the Government intends to appoint a Judge to inquire into all these matters, I have no doubt that good will come of the discussion. I am sure that the honorable member for Nepean was actuated by the best of motives. Things are happening in these camp which I cannot mention here, and which it would be almost impossible to imagine. Another matter to which I wish to refer is one to which attention has been drawn by the honorable members for Bendigo and Melbourne. Some time ago the honorable member for Bendigo referred to the voluntary contributions that were being made for many laudable objects connected with the war, and asked for some Government supervision of the collections, and to-day the honorable member for Melbourne asked that there should be a central authority appointed lay the Government to control the numerous patriotic collections. I under stand that the Government have replied that they are taking the matter into consideration. I hope that they will take it into their serious consideration. Though they cannot prevent any voluntary association collecting money without full approval of the State Governments, I hope that the time will not be far distant when the Commonwealth Government, working in conjunction with the State Governments, will see that no collections are taken up without the full consent of the Commonwealth Government, and that there is proper control over these organizations. Otherwise, we shall have a tremendous scandal in Australia. Our people are open-hearted and generous, and at this particular juncture are ready to subscribe right and left to anything arid, everything in connexion with the war, but it is due to them that the Government should see that the money is collected by people who are properly authorized to do so, and that there is Government control in connexion with every effort in this direction. We have had grave scandals in the past in connexion with voluntary subscriptions. I believe that in connexion with the Creswick disaster the trustees took some of the money that they should not have touched. There is in Great Britain a very large fund called the Prince of Wales&#39; fund, amounting to &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000, which money has been collected on behalf of wounded soldiers ; but in Glasgow the cost of distributing lis. from this fund is 9s. Of every &#163;1 raised, 9s. is spent in the cost of distribution. Some may not imagine that such a thing could happen in Scotland, where the people are so careful with the bawbees, but, seeing that it has, we can well imagine what may happen in other places. Naturally there was some outcry when these Glasgow figures were made public, and the. defence put up was that, as the work of distribution was put in the hands of clerks who were out of employment, the money paid to these clerks could be set down as relief pay. I do not say that nothing should be done for the unemployed, but it is hardly fair to raise money for wounded soldiers and use it for the relief of the unemployed. The Lord Provost of Glasgow took &#163;17 10s out of the Prince of Wales&#39; fund in order to go to London and make some inquiries, and when this matter was ventilated in the press the Town  Clerk  of Glasgow pointed out that, as the Lord </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Provost went to London on general matters, his expenses should not have been drawn out of this fund, and it was only done by mistake. However, the fact remains that the money was taken by the Lord Provost for a trip to London, and if such things can happen in the Old Country they are just as likely to occur in connexion with the funds that are now being raised in Australia. I have no desire to stay the flow of benevolence and philanthropy in connexion with the war, but a few days ago a collection was being taken up for the wounded soldiers returning to Australia. It is my view that the Commonwealth Government should make full and complete provision for every wounded soldier returning to Australia by means of general taxation. If we called upon the people of the country to bear this cost, they would gladly respond. </para>

                            <para>- When we have so much weight of intellect - that of the honorable member and my own - brought to bear on the Government upon this matter, something should be done. I hope that the Postmaster- General, who is in the chamber, will bring the matter under the notice of the Government, following upon the questions put by the honorable members for Melbourne and Bendigo. These organizations for raising, by voluntary means, money for laudable objects, seem to be multiplying, and should be under complete Government control in order that the public may know that when they subscribe money it will go to the object for which they give it. </para>

                        <para>.- I regret that in the National Parliament of Australia the honorable member for Nepean did not first take that course which any honorable member not anxious to get into the limelight, but anxious to serve his country, would have taken. But there is some excuse for the honorable member. He is a juvenile; also, he is among a body of men who will stoop to anything for the purpose of belittling those who happen to be on the Ministerial side of the House. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw it. I shall say the same thing - not in the same words, but in parliamentary phraseology that will give the same result, is any one reading it will understand. The honorable member travels here from another State in company with a large number of honorable members on both sides of the chamber, and, prior to making <inline font-weight="bold">Ms speech</inline> on Thursday last, he travelled in the train in company with the Minister of Defence. Every honorable member, and every person in Australia, will admit that, at this particular juncture, the Minister of Defence has very heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, and I believe that the public, and even the honorable member, will admit that no one is more prepared to listen to grievances, or to remove anomalies, or tilings that should not exist, than the present Minister. I feel sure that the honorable member for Nepean will admit this; yet he travelled in that train, and, under the guise of friendship, sat alongside the Minister of Defence, yet did not have the courage to bring these matters under his attention in any way, or to intimate to him anything of the nature of the conditions that he is trying to make the public believe exist at Liverpool. The honorable member is, I know, a juvenile, and does hot understand the trickery and machinations that are directed towards damaging honorable members on this side of the House. But the fact remains that he did not say anything of these matters when in the company of the Minister in the train ; and when he got into his party room, he made up his statement in order that he might come on to the floor of the House in an endeavour to damage political reputations. If the result were only to damage the reputations of honorable members on the Ministerial side, I could suffer it, but the result was. to damage the interests of the people of Australia; and it makes my heart bleed to think that a man could get down so low in the human scale in order to gain political kudos. </para>

The trouble is that in that district the party which the honorable member represents is losing support, and the honorable member&#39;s friends tried to get &#34;him to do something so that he might not lose the vote he secured at the last election. Let the honorable member take the advice of a man who knows something about the political motives to which those on his own side will stoop, and he will never again allow himself to get into the mess into which he has now fallen. </para>

                            <para>- You can kill a cat by other means than by choking it with butter. Is there any honorable member in this House; is there any writer on the press, or reporter in this House, who believes that the action of the honorable member for Nepean will secure one recruit, or tend to the encouragement of recruiting? Does the honorable member believe that  Colonel Kirkland,  or  Colonel Irving,  or any of the high military officials, would for one moment allow men in the Liverpool Camp to be treated in the way that the honorable member indicated? Do honorable members believe that the doctor to whom the honorable member for Nepean referred was influenced in his actions by the fact that his father had been born in Germany, a circumstance over which the doctor himself had no control ? No member of the House will believe such a thing, yet that was the inference to be drawn from the honorable member&#39;s statements, which are not in accordance with fact. I would advise the honorable member not to rush into these allegations, but to treat those who hold Ministerial positions, no matter to which party they belong, with the respect that one man should be able to command from another. Does the honorable member ask us to believe that those in control of the Camp would tolerate the conditions which he has referred to, if they knew that such things existed? </para>

                            <para>- It is not true. The honorable member should deal with things he knows something about. He may understand how to wind up a watch, but he knows nothing about buildings. In his opening remarks the honorable member referred to the huts being built off the ground. If I were asked to prepare a plan of a hospital building, I should place the floors well above the ground, so that there would be a good circulation of air under and through the building. The buildings erected, at Liverpool are typical of hospital buildings throughout New South Wales. The only trouble is that, in the Liverpool area, frosts are experienced. Anybody connected with building knows that, at the present time, it is impossible to get seasoned timber, and though the flooring boards may be tongued and grooved, it is impossible to keep them draught-proof, no matter how they may be jammed together with the jack. They will shrink apart in places, especially when there is a good current of air underneath the structure. The flooring boards are cut to within an inch of the walls, so as to give an upward current of air; that is a sensible plan, because otherwise it would be necessary to provide air bricks. So far as the roof is concerned, there is a space of 3 inches i - the thickness  of  the ceiling joists - between the top plate of the wall and the roof. That is not too great a space to leave along the whole length of a building. In my opinion, the buildings are very suitable for hospital purposes, because doctors agree that a sick person cannot have too much pure air. </para>

So far as the medical attention is concerned, I went into the hospitals and asked the men to tell me candidly if they had any complaints. They said they had none. </para>

                            <para>- They may complain when they can pull the leg of a simpleton like the honorable member, but they would not make foolish statements to an intelligent person like myself. The procedure in regard to the issuing of uniforms was explained to us. A man enters camp in his own clothing, and particulars of his identification are taken. When his clothes are taken from him, he is given a docket, and his valuables are placed in the safe. The man is then given a suit of dungarees which he continues to wear while he is a recruit. He is not given a uniform until he becomes definitely a member of some unit. In only one place did we hear of any grumbling, and then I was shocked to find that men could sink so low as some of these men had sunk. Two deputations waited on us, and both made such requests that I felt bound to tell them, in unmistakable language, what I thought of them. I said that they ought to thank God that they were in such a camp, and receiving the best medical advice, and that they were not fit to be outside the barbed wires. The action of the military powers in keeping them under restraint was to their best interests. They complained that their pay had been stopped, although payment was being made to their wives, and that they were not allowed to purchase certain articles which were likely to be injurious to their health in the condition in which they were. Honorable members must understand that a man in camp is either fit for service or he is unfit. If a man has a boil about his body, he is of no military use, and is sent to hospital. The large number of men in the hospital is partly accounted for by minor ailments of that description. The doctor informed me that for days, and sometimes months, there was an almost complete absence of measles or other form of sickness, but that when the dry weather set in after the rains cases of those diseases seemed to increase. The honorable member for Nepean ought to have seen the plan of the new hospitals and huts which are already in course of construction. They are a very good type of building. We cannot expect the camp to be perfect, because the Government have owned the Liverpool area for only about two years. </para>

                            <para>- It was never intended that 12,000 men should be accommodated in that camp at one time. I consider it marvellous that so many men have been put through the camp with such success. Time is required to make preparations to provide the necessary accommodation for training between 30,000 and 40,000 men. I honestly believe the officers in charge of the camp are just as earnest and sympathetic as the honorable member for Nepean. When the men reach Egypt they will not be supplied with beds and  washstands </para>

I do not feel disposed to go so fully into this. matter as I otherwise should because of the announcement of the Prime Minister that a Commission of investigation would be appointed. Honorable members should give all the information they have to the Department, so as to assist the Minister all they can, and not seek to stab him in the back in an attempt to make political kudos. The period through which we are now passing is the most trying1 that has ever come upon  Australia, and if we can do anything at all to assist one another, we should do it, and not make unfounded statements, or statements based upon one side of a question. If the honorable member for Nepean had taken the trouble to investigate both sides of this question before he came to the House, we should have heard very little of it. Instead of doing that he rushed with his letter, desiring to move the adjournment, to the  Speaker- </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member can move too quickly in throwing mud and in slandering. Friends of the honorable member for Nepean have expressed the view to me that they did not think that a Britisher and an Australian could have so belittled men in Australia who were trying to do their best under very trying circumstances, for I am sure the people outside will admit that the Defence Department has done wonders during the war. It has shown grit and ability that historians of the future will deal with, and the sort of stuff served up by the honorable member for Nepean will not &#34; go down &#34; at all. Even if all he stated were true, he should have approached the Minister and placed the circumstances before him. No Minister in a democratic Government would have dared to refuse to go into  the matter, and would have given the honorable member what credit was due to him. What is dangling in front of honorable members is the proximity of the submission of the referenda questions. When I know what has been done, and when I know of the sacrifices that Australia has made, and is prepared to make, I wonder, when I hear statements like that made by the honorable member for Nepean, whether I am in the National Parliament at all. </para>

Here is a member of this National Parliament accusing this Government of neglecting the interests of Australian soldiers in preference to the interests of a few Germans. I have some sympathy for the honorable member. He has only occupied his position in this House for a short period, and prior to coming here his environment was not such as would teach him to look upon allegations of this kind as he should do. He has not yet had a sufficient education in political matters. </para>

                            <para>- He is an Australian, trained at the Sydney University, where he took the highest degrees that it is possible for a man to take. For seven years he was a member of the staff of Prince Alfred Hospital, and for three years was secretary of a body which had for its object the closest scientific research possible in medical science. That is what the doctor&#39;s career is. If there is one thing to be said about him, it is that he does not get sufficient pay. At present he is getting captain&#39;s pay, but he should be getting more. He has given up his consulting rooms, the rent for which was more than he is now receiving. </para>

                            <para>- He is there all the time, night and day, attending to his patients. The first parade is at 7 o&#39;clock in the morning, and there are four parades a day. He has to be at them all. He has assistants,  of course, but be has to supervise. As far as the field hospitals are concerned, the men in them receive more attention than could be given in the public hospitals, because the public hospitals could not afford the time devoted to these men in camp. But, as I said before, it must not be forgotten that this is a camp, and camp life must be lived there. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sorry that any heat should have been generated by the discussion of this subject. The Prime Minister has already declared that a judicial tribunal will bo appointed to investigate the charges made by the honorable member for Nepean, and I am sorry that a man who claims to be a Democrat, and who pretends to be bubbling over with the milk of human kindness, should make any attempt to prejudge the case. It will be time enough for any honorable member to say there is no truth in any of these charges when the Judge has made his inquiry. Until then, in justice to all concerned - the Department as well as the men - I think the best thing we can do is to be silent as to what the result is likely to be. I have been to the camp, and I was surprised at the spontaneity with which hundreds of men there said that every word that had appeared in the papers was true. I have a good deal of sympathy with these men. I am satisfied that most of them have enlisted from the very best motives .possible. They know what is in front of them, and they are ready to face it, and I do not think more evidence could be required than these men seem ready to give. </para>

The Prime Minister has promised that an inquiry shall be conducted, and I hope that it will be pushed along with the utmost despatch, as in all probability, hundreds of the men in camp to-day will have left Australia in a little while. If the inquiry is to be of any value, then the evidence of these men should be taken. There should be an opportunity for all to be heard or represented. I hope, therefore, that the&#39; inquiry will be commenced very speedily, so that all the facts may be brought out. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to make a few observations regarding the Liverpool Camp, but trust that in doing so I shall not be accused of endeavouring to prejudice the inquiry which the Prime Minister has told us to-day is to be made by a Justice of the High Court. I, in company with two honorable members of my party, visited the camp on Monday last; and, while it covers so wide an area that it would take several days to examine it in a thoroughly systematic manner, we examined it as far as we could do in one day. My experience of men leads me to the view that, if one desires to elicit the truth, it is useless to question a man concerning matters of mismanagement in the presence of his superior officers. I was. careful to be guided by that experience, so that, while we were received very courteously by the Commandant of the camp, and other officers, I availed myself of the earliest opportunity to go amongst the men unaccompanied by any officer. As the result of my inspection I am able to say that whilst there is room for improvement in the Liverpool Camp, there is nothing in connexion with it to which serious objection can be taken. I, at all events, failed to <inline font-style="italic">discover anything</inline> of a serious character, or any defect such as would not be found in any large business establishment. </para>

                            <para>- I have had experience of big business establishments, and can say that even in connexion with their management there are details which will sometimes go wrong. We found that the principle laid down is that when men are taken into camp certain clothing shall be issued to them. The Commandant told us that the arrangement was that each man on coming into camp should receive two singlets, two pairs of underpants, two cardigan jackets, two pairs of overalls, and a pair of boots. I examined the clothing very carefully, and am able to say that for quality it will compare with the best in the country. It is, in short, of the very best. Each man is supposed to receive this quantity of clothing as soon as he goes into camp, but, unfortunately, the system laid down in practice does not work out altogether in detail. Whilst I got this statement from the Commandant himself, I made it my business to ascertain from the men how the system actually worked. One man, who was wearing blue overalls, told me that he had been supplied with a suit of overalls, one singlet, and a pair of boots. Another said he had received only two singlets, and no other clothing whatever. Others, again, had received nothing but a pair of boots. The blame for this does not rest with the administration of the Defence Department, but relates to the failure to carry out the instructions issued by the Department. I made particular inquiry from the men themselves, in the absence of the officers, regarding the food supplies, and did not meet with one complaint. Every man to whom I spoke said that he was perfectly satisfied with the quantity and quality of the food supplied to him. We gave particular attention to the question of hospital accommodation in view of what had been said regarding the hospital arrangements at the camp being under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schlink.</inline> As the result of our investigations, I have come to the conclusion that the Department should consider itself fortunate in having the services of a man of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> Schlink&#39;s  capabilities.&#39; He is not only a capable surgeon, but possesses that sympathetic temperament which makes so much for the proper care of men in hospital. There was an officer in charge of each hospital tent, and I asked them to retire while I questioned the patients so that they might speak with the utmost freedom. Every one of the patients spoke in the very highest terms of the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schlink</inline> was attending to them, and as to the treatment they received in hospital. Each patient is provided with a spring stretcher with a mattress and blankets. In the matter of bedding accommodation, I think the men in hospital are very well treated, and they all told me that they were comfortable and .felt as happy as their illness would permit. These spring stretchers are far more  comfortable than are many beds in which I have had to sleep. Shearers and others working out back often sleep on stretchers consisting of a sack through which two saplings are run. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so; they are certainly better than sleeping on the floor. I repeat (hat the bedding accommodation at the camp hospital is all that could be expected, and that the patients appear to be thoroughly satisfied in respect of it: We saw a number of men who were not in uniform, and it  appeared to me at first sight that there must be something wrong in this respect. On making inquiries, I discovered that the rule is that when men come into camp, they shall be provided, with the articles of clothing I have already enumerated, but that no man shall be supplied with a uniform until he has been allocated to a particular unit. That is a fair and reasonable proceeding. As the Commandant very properly pointed out, until the authorities are sure of their man, it is not reasonable to fit him out. When they are, they provide him with the articles I have named, and also a uniform. This explanation of what, on the face of it, would appear to be a serious omission on the part of the Department is a very satisfactory one, and shows that an apparent omission is really a step in the interests of the Department. I should like to give a word of praise to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schlink</inline> for one arrangement he has made, and that is the provision of a detention camp for those suffering from venereal diseases. There are some most shocking cases in this detention camp, and from the men there several complaints were made to us. They asked, through their sergeant, that we should receive a deputation from them. We agreed to do so, and the men placed their grievances before us. Their most serious complaint was that they were kept in a compound surrounded with barbed wire, and were not allowed to mix with the men outside or with the people in the neighbouring town. The doctor and the military authorities, in enforcing such. a. regulation, are not only doing their duty to the camp, but are rendering a service to the community. Every credit should be given to the medical officer commanding for his action in this respect. If like methods were adopted in the case of all persons suffering from this terrible scourge, it would not be many years before it would be stamped out of the country. We were informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schlink</inline> is an Australian native, and that he is truly Australian in sentiment. In speaking to us, he advocated certain claims made on behalf of the unfortunate men in the compound, despite the opposition of other military officers in the camp. We ought to be proud to have the services of such a man to take charge of the medical arrangements of the camp. Another complaint made by the men in the detention compound related to the stoppage of pay. It appears that men placed in the detention camp on the ground that they are suffering from venereal disease have the whole of their pay stopped, although this rule is not followed in regard to men suffering from other diseases. I think it rather hard that these men should be absolutely deprived of the whole of their pay for the reason that they have contracted this terrible complaint. I hope that the Minister will give some attention to what, I -think, is a reasonable claim on the part of these unfortunate fellows. I do not say that these men should receive their full pay, but something should be given to them. To be perfectly fair to the Minister, I must explain that if a man has allotted part of his pay to his wife or other dependant, the Department gives to that dependant the amount allotted ; but, in the case of the man who has no dependant, nothing is paid. As to uniforms, these are not served out until men have been attached to a unit. I desire to direct the attention of the Minister to the need for giving more encouragement to drill instructors. I do not think that the Department is taking advantage of all the service that it could command in various States from the drill instructors that are available. I was amazed, on visiting the camp, not to see there many of the drill instructors that I knew a year or two ago, the big, strong men of commanding personality, whose word of command compels discipline. These men are missing. </para>

                        <para>- Some of them; hut there are others still available. I understand that some are considered &#34;too old; but I know of several men whose services could be obtained, and who would give to the camp the discipline that I believe it needs. I could, if necessary, supply the names of fine, active men, whose mere tone and bearing would force any squad to obey at once, and I feel sure that, now that attention has been drawn to the matter, the Minister will endeavour to get the services of these men. I understand that the pay offered is not a great inducement to drill instructors to give their services. One of the greatest needs in military training is the enforcement of discipline, and to obtain that we must have men of the proper type to give instruction. With an instructor who knows his business, and who has the proper tone and bearing, you can quickly get men to absorb the knowledge that is being imparted, and they have the confidence in the authorities that is necessary to enable them to do their  part  in the grand army of Australian soldiers. If attention is given to this matter, it will improve the camp. I am glad that the Prune Minister has decided to appoint a Judge to inquire into the complaints that have been made. The intention of both sides should be to see that the conditions at the camp are ideal. In many things Australia has led the world. We have done this by our social legislation - we have shown that social conditions better than any previously known are obtainable. If we get to work in this matter in the right spirit, we shall make a democratic army of which we shall be proud, and which will be an example to other countries. </para>

                        <para>. - Can the Assistant Minister tell me what are the principles upon which per-&#39; mission is given to individuals - photographers, barbers, and others - to carry on their businesses within camp areas? Is there competition, or are rights granted only to certain persons? The complaint has been made to me that at the Enoggera Camp certain persons seem to have acquired the right to carry on businesses, while others are refused. I can. understand that there must be some regulation governing the matter, because you must have discipline within a camp ; but where profitable trading concessions arc concerned, some definite principle should be laid down, so that there may he proper competition for the privileges concerned. </para>
