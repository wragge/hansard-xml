                    <para>- Although a draft of the Bill has been prepared, the Government have not had an opportunity of settling its terms. Until that is done and the Bill put before the House, it would certainly be most improper to publish it. The Bill ought to have been introduced long ago, but the excuse of the Government must be the extraordinary circumstances in which the country finds itself. It will be introduced at the earliest possible moment when we resume our sittings. </para>

                        <para>- The position in regard to &#34; Sanatogen &#34; and a number of other preparations of German origin which have a wide reputation, has been considered by my Department as well as by the Government. There can be no doubt whatever that &#34; Sanatogen&#34; and one or two other patent medicines or foods are of German origin, and that the profits derived from them go to Germany. The Government have decided that no newspaper publishing an advertisement relating to this preparation shall he permitted to pass through the post. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that the Minister of Trade and Customs has in the past prohibited the importation of certain quack medicines that claimed to do more than they could do. I wish to know whether the Minister has observed the claims which &#39;are set forth in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> as to the virtues of &#34; Sanatogen,&#34; informing the public that old people will be made healthier, happier, and more vigorous, and that it will produce a real and lasting improvement in one&#39;s bodily health, a definite increase in one&#39;s nerve energy, and a profoundly beneficial effect upon every organ and function in one&#39;s body? Is the Minister satisfied that this medicine can do all that it claims to do; have his analysts informed him that the advertisement is fraudulent in its claims, and will he therefore prohibit the importation of the medicine ? </para>

                            <para>- The sole control that the Customs Department has of this matter under the Commerce Act is the power to prohibit the importation of any article which does not comply with certain restrictions which are laid down. I am not sure whether &#34; Sanatogen&#34; is one of the articles which has been dealt with from an advertisement point of view, though I do not think that its importation would be allowed with the leaflets making these claims accompanying it; but once an article comes in there is no power to prevent leaflets being printed and wrapped round the bottles or tins. In the Customs Department there are advertisements from nearly all the newspapers of Australia advertising quack remedies which would not have been permitted had they accompanied the bottles on their importation. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly. But I assume that they will take this declaration of the policy of the Government as a warning. We do not propose to proceed against the newspapers without warning. In addition to &#34; Sanatogen,&#34; I propose to notify the other preparations which, in the opinion of the Department, fall within the same class, after which any newspaper publishing such advertisements will fall within the scope of the notification. </para>

                        <para>- The position of the Commonwealth in this matter is that of agent for the States. The expenses incurred by the States and the Commonwealth in chartering freights will have to be provided for out of the 3f per cent, to which the honorable member refers. The residue, whatever it is, will be handed to the various States, and they can either hand it over to the shippers or direct to the farmers. We do not propose to make any claim of any kind. Our only interest in the matter is that the expenses of the freight arrangement, whatever they are - and, compared with the tremendous magnitude of the transaction, they will be relatively small - must be borne by the transaction. Subject to that, the matter is at the disposal of the States. </para>

However, I think that we shall adjourn in time to enable us to pay our respects to the remains of the late Major-General Bridges. If there is work to do we should come back next week to do what we are paid to do. I propose that we should sit until the lunch adjournment, and then adjourn until another day. </para>

The state of business here and in another place renders it impossible to adjourn if Parliament is to protect the interests of the people. I regret it. I long for a short adjournment, but it is at present impossible. I appreciate the action of the right honorable gentleman in allowing three urgent Bills to be put through last night. </para>

                            <para>- As I have already stated, after a friendly consideration of the business sheet, as well as the sad duty we all have to perform to-day, it was agreed that certain Bills should be put through last evening. I may say that we on this side made a great sacrifice in consenting to put these Bills through without the consideration to which they were entitled; indeed, I think we strained our public duty in order to meet the Government in every possible way. In addition to other business, I allowed the right honorable gentleman to take the Income Tax Bill to the third reading; and further, allowed the Attorney-General to introduce yet another referendum proposal, in order that the second reading of it might be considered to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I very much regret to hear an interjection of that kind. Does the honorable member not see that if arrangements made between parties cannot be adhered to, parliamentary government becomes impossible. I am sure that this is realized by every honorable member opposite, except the honorable member for East Sydney. After making this sacrifice in order to assist in clearing up the business to-day, we are now coolly told by the Prime Minister - although we have fulfilled our part of the bargain generously, and in full measure - that the arrangement cannot be adhered to on his side. I wish it to be understood that I am making no personal reflection on the Prime Minister - I am far from doing that - but merely pointing out that if this kind of thing is to go on, it will be absolutely impossible to conduct the business of the House, or to make any sort of working arrangement as between parties. I do not wish the right honorable gentleman to definitely commit himself now, but I ask him to see if the arrangement made cannot be adhered to, and honorable members so informed before the business is concluded to-day. The position is very serious, and I have never encountered the like before. The Minister of Defence, who controls the business of the Senate, was present, as I say, at the consultation, and if there is any difficulty in another place, I can only express my sorrow. I ask the Prime Minister to seriously reconsider his reply to me just now, and see if it is not possible to carry out the arrangement made. </para>

I have received a letter informing me that one member of the Forces, who left here ou the 20th April last, has received only two letters out of three or four a week that have been written to him since. A peculiar phase of the matter is that his friends receive all the letters that &#39;he writes ; there must, therefore, be something radically wrong. </para>

                                <para>- The postal arrangements at the front are not in the hands of the postal authorities, but in the hands of the military authorities. The Defence Department is taking steps to&#39; organize a complete post office staff for the front, consisting of trained and experienced officers, who will be given military rank, and this, we hope, will result in great improvements. I remind the honorable member that a few days ago it was shown by the official correspondent at the front that on one occasion 250 bags of mails went to the bottom of the sea. Whether there have been other similar occurrences I do not know, but this would account for, at any rate, the loss of some letters. However, arrangements are now being made to do everything possible in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that at least they are very picturesque. Shall I say they would be distinctly improper in Collins-street? Whether it is necessary to include these photographs or not, may I suggest that in the final printing the type should be made larger and bolder, for an interesting document of this kind ought not to be printed in type that is scarcely readable. I suppose, however, that is one of the results of the new economy. If the papers now on the table comprise only the appendix, I should like to see the report. Has that been printed ? </para>

                    <para>. - In response to the challenge ot the Leader of the Opposition, as  Chairman  of the Commission, I desire to say that there is. nothing whatever in the report but what is of a very informative character. The papers which the right honorable gentlemen has been discussing only contain a <inline font-style="italic">pr&#233;cis</inline> of the correspondence which the Commission thought would be useful, because, so far as my experience of this House goes, very few members really know where the New Hebrides are. </para>

                        <para>- Then I will say that their geographical knowledge of the South Pacific is very scanty. Many of the photographs were taken from postcards, some of which are on sale in a photographic gallery in Melbourne, and some are identical with photographs we saw in the album of one of the medical missionaries in the New Hebrides. They are not reproductions of photographs taken by any member of the Commission or by any one instructed by the Commission, and I do not think there is anything in them calculated to bring a blush to the cheek of the most modest member. Honorable members will find much useful information in the report, which was obtained at much trouble at all hours of the day and night. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid the honorable member for Parramatta is somewhat super-sensitive in the matter of the photographic illustrations which appear in the appendices to this report. They are included because it was thought advisable to make the report as complete as possible, seeing that this was the first Royal Commission from the Commonwealth that has ever visited the New Hebrides, and having regard also to the importance of members knowing more about these islands and their native population. The Commission, therefore, decided to make the report as informative as possible, not only with respect to mail and shipping matters, but also in regard to the character of the islands, the various types of inhabitants, in view of possible developments resulting from territorial rearrangements after the settlement of the war. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the intention of the Government to adopt that suggestion. The intention of the Government is to adopt the proposal to leave out the words &#34; One hundred and twenty-six pounds per annum,&#34; and to also leave out the rest of the clause. That will leave the law exactly as it stands to-day. The other amendment is not important, and deals only with the date. The Government propose to accept that. </para>

                        <para>.- Owing to the late habits which this House has developed, I was unfortunately absent last night when this measure was advanced to its present stage. I had proposed in Committee to endeavour to secure the consent of the Government to an alteration in the schedule affecting, not the yield which it will give, as anticipated by the taxing authorities, but the method of its compilation; and to ask the Attorney-General to favorably consider a proposition to make the schedule plainer. Students of taxation, and particularly taxation on incomes that fluctuate, are agreed that what a taxpayer desires most of all is a plainly-marked schedule which will enable him to calculate for himself the taxation that he has to pay. It is idle to suggest that one taxpayer out of a thousand will know what he has to pay under this schedule until he receives his assessment notice from the Taxation Office. </para>

                            <para>- Let us consider for a moment some of the formulae that run through the schedule. We all know that it is impossible for the average man to work decimal fractions in pence, or anything else. He has no difficulty in dealing with the grades or steps in a schedule, but where he has to work out in decimals, a difference of so many pennies in respect of the rate of taxation on a given income, the task is one which the average man who has lost his knowledge of school detail feels incapable of attempting. If he wishes to ascertain whether or not the Commissioner&#39;s figures are correct, he will thus be driven to the accountancy profession, and will have to pay a member of that profession a substantial sum to check the assessment notices of  the Taxation Office. I am endeavouring to set out in a sympathetic way what I think are the obvious objections to this schedule ; and I repeat that I do not wish to substantially injure the yield from the tax. If the taxpayer does not attempt to check his assessment notice by any expert means, he will always be under the impression that he has been overcharged, and that irritation will continue throughout the period covered by this tax. </para>

                            <para>- There is a simple, means which the taxing Commissioner will suggest to the honorable gentleman. I do not say it is possible to remodel the schedule within the next twenty-four hours, but if, as I understand, we are to come back next week, then I think this House should consider whether we ought not to delay the third reading of the Bill in order to enable the taxing Commissioner to present us next Tuesday or Wednesday with a differently-framed schedule. The Commissioner should be told that incomes from &#163;156 up to the next stage should be treated as one step, and that all within that step, subject to the exemption, should pay a tax of 3d. in the &#163;1 ; that the next step should be equally definite, and that all within it should pay 4d. in the &#163;1 ; and so on, as the set of stairs is raised, each stair being marked in plain figures, with the rate of tax payable. That is the method followed in Australia in respect of income tax, as well as certain land taxation. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection may be clever, but it is entirely irrelevant. I am not suggesting that either the Government or the taxpayers should be sandbagged. All that I propose is that the taxpayer should have the wool taken off his eyes so that, having ascertained what his income is, he may be able to see and understand how much he will have to pay. That is the position that we in this House, proposing, as we do, to impose this direct taxation iu order to meet the needs of the nation, should desire to achieve. It will involve great thought and care on the part of the officer deputed to frame such a schedule as I suggest should be embodied in the Bill. The schedule would have to be drawn up with due regard to the fact that the desire of the Government is that the tax shall yield a revenue of &#163;4,000,000 per annum, and the grades would have to be so fixed as to yield that amount. I am not suggesting the lightening of the tax at either end, or in the middle; all that I propose is that an alteration be made by using figures that will make the schedule plain to all. Such a proposition must recommend itself to the Attorney-General, and, since it would only involve a delay until Tuesday or Wednesday next, surely it should be adopted ? It would remove a good deal of the irritation which this tax will otherwise create. </para>

                            <para>- No. The average taxpayer after he has reached thirty or forty years of age is not usually a first-class mathematician, and there can be no doubt that the average man who will &#39;have to pay this tax has long since lost his school knowledge of the elementary principles of the decimal system. I do not know whether even the Attorney-General would be able to correctly work out such a sum as I might throw at him. </para>

The Taxation Commissioner does not work out these details on his feet. He sits at a desk with a great staff about him checking definite figures. I say without hesitation that there will be irremovable irritation amongst the great bulk of the taxpayers if the Government push this schedule into operation, and that we should endeavour, even at the eleventh hour, to avoid it. </para>

                            <para>- A curve of the first degree is such as is worn on the waistcoat of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports; a curve of the second degree is such as is worn on the waistcoat of the Attorney-General. I do not think any complicated principle should be associated with this tax. What we want to achieve is a simplicity that is calculated to offer no disadvantage to the Treasury and to give greater satisfaction to the taxpayer. Surely this is well worthy of the consideration of the Government. If they can show that any real loss of revenue will result from the substitution of a carefully prepared schedule, such as I suggest, for  that now in the Bill, I will withdraw my proposition. I do not wish to reduce the amount which the Government have said it is necessary to secure from this tax in order to meet the needs of the nation. As one who watched the introduction of the Income Tax system in this State, I can say that quite enough irritation is aroused by proposing a fresh income tax without still further complicating the means by which taxpayers may determine whether they have been fairly treated in the assessment of their incomes. If the Attorney-General will do what I propose, he will remit the schedule again to the Taxation Office Staff, with a direction that they shall build a new schedule which, while yielding the same revenue and, as far as possible, preserving the yield for each grade, will be marked in plain figures, so that he who runs may read. There is another point to which I desire to refer. We were told by the Prime Minister that this is a war tax. The Bill does not show that it is. On the contrary, it indicates that it is to be a continuing tax. Clause 5 sets out that this rate is fixed for all the years it will run. The principle of income taxation as hitherto followed in Australia has been to establish, first of all by an Assessment Bill, the conditions on which incomes shall be annually taxed - the relationship between the Treasury and the direct taxpayer. That Bill has always been followed in every State, I think, by another measure annually fixing the rates. If the need of the Treasurer was great in one year, the rates were advanced; if the Treasurer felt that he could grant a reduction in his next annual fixation of the tax, the rates were reduced. The elasticity of such a system enables concessions to the taxpayers to be made when the nation can do with less, while the Treasurer holds out his hands for more money when he requires more revenue. That principle should be followed by the Commonwealth. There should be an annual fixation of rates. Clause 5 offends in two ways. It offends the principle of the annual fixation of the tax, and avoids the still more important fact that this is admittedly a war tax. No honorable member on this side of the chamber would have agreed to the tax under any condition other than that it was to endure only for the period during which the expenditure upon the war has to be met. If we were to talk of a rate of 5s. in the &#163;1 on the higher grades of in: come as a permanent or enduring tax, it would be, probably, the most crippling thing one could conceive of as regards the financial, commercial, and industrial interests of the Commonwealth, and it is only because the nation realizes that it is fighting for its very existence that we say, &#34; Very well, it is a case of your money or your life.&#34; Rather than forfeit our existence the people should be asked to pay even, if necessary, at the rate of 10s. in the &#163;1. In that sense a rate of 5s. in the &#163;1 has been accepted by honorable members - because the tax is to be collected for war purposes. </para>

Those who have noted the growth of wealth in Victoria and New South Wales know well that this rate will fall upon some persons - comparatively few I admit - and if it were not for the war this academic proposition, as it is termed by the Attorney-General - though it is not academic, it is real - would not have been introduced. Seeing, however, that it is essentially a levy for war purposes, honorable members on this side have assented to it. I doubt whether half the honorable members on the Ministerial side of the Chamber would admit the wisdom of this tax as a permanent tax. I credit honorable members with the possession of a certain amount of economic knowledge and desire to further the interests of this country. They must know that a permanent tax of 5s. in the &#163;1 on the top grades of income would do more to increase unemployment than anything else they could suggest. </para>

It is framed in the permanent phraseology of every measure imposing an income tax, however small, as if it were to endure for all time. If I were speaking of a rate of 2s. in the &#163;1 I could utter precisely the same thoughts, and feel that they were equally truthful. In Victoria there was a rate of ls. 4d. in ordinary times of peace on the higher grades of income, and the State Government took actual tests as to the effect of that rate, not only on capital in the State, but also on capital which was introduced from abroad, and the results showed a flight of capital, induced by the high rate, higher than that imposed in other States or in any sister Dominion. I do not hesitate to say that if a rate of ls. 6d. in the &#163;1 is imposed after the war it will drive capital out of the country to our disadvantage, and will give to the people who live in the country no advantage whatsoever. It is useless to say that high taxation equalizes wealth. The owners of wealth can say, &#34; We do not intend to pay what is equivalent to <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent, of incomes in Australia when we can invest our money in Canada and j&#62;ay <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent, only, or in the Argentine, and pay 5 per cent, only.&#34; All the operations and calculations of the investing public are governed by circumstances ascertained by and known to them. If we maintain an exceedingly high rate of taxation on incomes, Australia will become a poor country, we shall drive out the accumulations of wealth within our own borders and deter the introduction of capital. If the Attorney-General is quite sincere let him omit the words in the clause which prevent the annual fixation of this tax. At any rate, let him do it for this year. No one can see further ahead than July, 1916. No one knows how long the struggle will last, or what economic conditions will prevail in Australia during the continuance of the war or when hostilities have ceased. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but my argument has just the same force. We are asked to furnish the Treasurer with as much revenue as we can get for the financial purposes of this year. Next year our needs will be clearer to us. It may not be necessary to have the tax. In any event it is safer to say to the taxpayer that, although the Assessment Bill is to remain on the statute-book, the rates are fixed for one year only. This Bill does not do so. I am right, I think, in saying that the rates are fixed annually in all the States, though the State Assessment Acts are permanent measures. Will the Attorney-General consent to the elimination of the words &#34; and each financial year thereafter &#34; ? Their  omission  would proclaim to the taxpayer that we had fixed the tax for the present year only. There would be ample opportunity in the next financial year to fix the tax that will be receivable during that year. </para>

                            <para>- I am pleased that the Attorney-General has accepted the suggestion, though I still think that the elimination of the words would be the wisest course to follow. We should go to the people with a statement that we are putting certain rates on their incomes for this financial year only, and that, if the circumstances next year are as bad as they are this year, or even worse, they will be called upon to face the issue and pay according to the needs of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Attorney-General will also consider the question of an alteration to the schedule on the lines that I have suggested. It would give a considerable amount of satisfaction to taxpayers, large and small. </para>

                        <para>.- Last night, when we were dealing with clause 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Bill, and the Prime Minister intervened in order to bring forward some new business, I understood that the Bill was not to be dealt with any further; and, as I had already been thirteen hours in attendance, I left the precincts of the House. I was desirous of drawing the attention of the Attorney-General to clause 17 dealing with mining companies, but I find now that the Bill was passed&#39; through the Committee stage early this morning. Clause 17 says that &#34; the capital expended by a person carrying on mining operations- &#34; </para>

                        <para>.- I went home last night with the assurance of the Prime Minister that no business would be dealt with except. the Income Tax Assessment Bill, and yet this morning I find the Bill before us at the third-reading stage. I should not have spoken ou the motion for the third reading had I ar. opportunity to speak in Committee, and I only wish to support what has been said by the honorable member for Balaclava in regard to the schedule, which is expressed in terms that only those who understand higher mathematics can follow. I suggest to the Attorney-General that, if it must be expressed in a way that mathematicians only can understand, he should adopt the infinitely more simple form of the curve of the first degree, which is represented by a straight line drawn from point to point, each &#163;1 carrying its additional taxation. The actual difference in the amount of revenue that would be raised if this plan were adopted would be infinitesimal, an amount not more than a very few thousand pounds, while an enormous amount of trouble and dissatisfaction would be prevented. The only difference would be a very slight increase on certain portions of the actual incomes, and if honorable members saw the curve of the first degree reduced to a diagram they would understand what is meant. The honorable member for Balaclava suggested that the formula should be altered to definite steps, beginning at 3d. aud going on to 4d., 5d., and so on, and so arranged as to bring in the same amount of tax in the aggregate. I do not know that there is any reason why that should not be done ; but, at the same time, if the Government desire to adopt the same principle that they have adopted in regard to the land tax, with a gradual gradation by which each pound will carry its additional tax, that can be done, and still be expressed by the adoption of the curve of the first degree. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see any special virtue in the &#34;ramp,&#34; and the terms used are very difficult to follow. There is no necessity to rush this business through for the Senate, and I hope the Attorney-General will consider whether it is not possible to get the same, or practically the same, revenue without introducing the friction and dislocation that I believe this formula will cause. I am glad to hear from the Attorney-General that he proposes to adopt the suggestion made by the honorable member for Balaclava in regard to clause 5, calculating the tax only for this year, and allowing Parliament from year to year to say what the actual rate shall be. I am certain that if it were generally understood that this tax had to operate indefinitely - and that is what is expressed in the Bill- </para>

                            <para>- If we leave the impression that this tax is to be continued indefinitely, it will leave an effect on commercial and industrial life the reverse of beneficial. This tax is almost prohibitive in its incidence, and if the capitalist gets it into his head that, on money invested in Australia, he will, in addition to the State income tax, have to pay a Commonwealth tax that is almost penal, I venture to say that out of the very limited capital that will be available for developmental purposes after the war, Australia will get a still smaller share of the world&#39;s capital than she has been getting for a number of years. Of the capital sent from England into other countries for developmental purposes in recent years, a very small portion in comparison has come to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No one knows better than the Minister of Home Affairs that, in calculating the interest derivable from capital, the investor takes into account the taxation of the country as one of the charges, and if two countries offer the same rate of interest, and one has double the taxation of the other, he knows where to invest. At any rate, I hope that the actual rate at which this tax will be levied will be expressed in terms more easily understood by the general public. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to know from the Attorney-General whether a man with an income of over &#163;2,500 a year starts from the lowest rate and gradually works up, or whether he starts at what is laid down for incomes over &#163;2,000. Suppose a man has an income of &#163;2,500 does he commence to pay at 11.713 pence, or does he pay on the whole amount at the rate of 33.600 pence? In other words, does he commence to pay under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and finish paying under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> or does he start to pay at once under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> ? I have consulted several lawyers on this question and they cannot agree as to what is the effect of the schedule. The matter certainly requires elucidation. An income of &#163;6,500 is taxed at the rate of 5s. in the &#163;1, and according to the statement attached to the schedule the average rate works out at 41.7305 pence. I believe the Attorney-General has stated that there are few incomes in the Commonwealth of &#163;6,500 per annum, and, therefore, very few persons will be taxed at the highest rate. No figures in proof of that assertion are to be found inKnibbs, or in any other authority. Such a calculation is impossible, and I believe that this tax will realize a great deal more money from the higher taxpayers than is anticipated. The impost will affect, to a great extent, those people who are developing the country, and who have put money into more than one State. Let me quote my own case as an illustration. I have investments in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Under the State taxation laws I pay in each State on the income I derive in that State, but if the whole of my income earned in different parts of the Commonwealth is bulked, I shall pay at a very much higher rate than I pay under the State Acts. If a man enjoys an income of &#163;3,000 in Victoria he will pay on that income under the States rates. He may also have an income of &#163;3,000 from New South Wales, and a further &#163;3,000 from Queensland. It is impossible for the Attorney-General to trace whether the man who pays on an income of &#163;3,000 in Victoria has derived a similar income from New South Wales. Possibly a man will have a total income of &#163;9,000, and he will pay on that total a higher rate than he pays in the separate States on his three different incomes of &#163;3,000 each. It will be found that under a Federal tax a great many people will pay at a much higher rate than they pay under the State income taxes, and, therefore, the tax will realize a considerable amount of money in excess of what is estimated from the people who pay at the higher rate. I know of a great many people who have interests in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. Many companies are in the same position, and if the Attorney-General will enlighten me as to how the tax will operate in those cases I shall be very much obliged. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to the honorable member for Balaclava the Attorney-General stated that the 5s. rate was almost academic, and very few people would be required to pay it. The presumption is that otherwise he might consider the advisability of cutting down the rate. The honorable member for Corangamite having assured the Attorney-General that the 5s. rate is by no means academic, but will hit severely a number of people who have large incomes, I should like to know whether the Minister will now consider the advisability of reducing the rate. When the honorable member for Balaclava was speaking the inference was if he could show that there were a great many people seeking relief from the higher rates that would be the best of all reasons why the Attorney-General should reduce those rates, but now that the honorable gentleman has been assured by the honorable member for Corangamite that there are many people who will be required to pay the higher rates, I fancy that the Minister, buttressed by those facts and statements, will be all the bolder in imposing the tax. No matter which part of the compass the criticism comes from, the Attorney-General adroitly turns it to the advantage of his own Bill and the perpetuation of this tremendous tax. </para>

                            <para>- The point I wish to stress is that the 5s. rate does not stand by itself. I have had a statement prepared which shows that in New South Wales, at any rate, the taxation of some Imperial companies will amount to a total of 8s. lOd. in the &#163;1. They will be taxed by the States, by the Commonwealth, and by the Imperial Government. What companies will operate anywhere under such conditions? I do not know of any company, unless it be one that is extraordinarily situated, that could earn an income tax of that amount and pay dividends. Very few companies are making a profit of 8s. lOd. in the &#163;1, and this tax means that we shall take from them all incentive to enter into business and enterprises in some States at any rate. That is the serious aspect of this tax. I cannot for the life of me see anything in the war legislation as presented by the Prime Minister that should require taxation amounting in the aggregate to 8s. lOd. in the &#163;1. If taxation at this rate is necessary for war purposes, it must be paid. If the taxation for war purposes amounted to 10s. in the &#163;1, it would have to be paid. The whole wealth of the community must be placed under tribute to finance the war; but is it necessary to finance this year&#39;s operations in such a way that the requisite taxation in New South Wales will in the aggregate amount to 8s. lOd. in the &#163;1 ? There can only be one result to this. Capital will seek an outlet to some sphere where taxation is lighter, and I submit for the serious consideration of the Committee the question whether these higher rates ought to be imposed, particularly as the tax is a triplicate tax. Three taxes will actually be imposed upon many companies in New South Wales. Representations on the point have been made to the Treasurer, and I would again ask him to reflect whether it is not possible to lighten the burden somewhat. Otherwise capital will be stampeded out of the country, and if it is, honorable members may bid &#34;good-bye&#34; to the staying power of the country and to its resourcefulness for war or any other purposes. During recent years capital has not been pouring into Australia. Happily, the country has been able to do without it to a great extent, though had more capital been invested here, our industrial concerns would have been much more prosperous even than they have been, their ramifications would have been extended, and the volume of trade infinitely greater. But the fact remains that very little foreign capital has been coining in during recent years, and not much more may be expected if a triplicate tax is to be imposed upon it. I should like the right honorable gentleman to make it perfectly clear that the revision of these rates will be considered. In my view a lower maximum rate, if the tax were properly levied, would give a bigger aggregate return, for I do not think the tax has been so fixed as to get the most out of it. It seems almost to have been imposed to give people an invitation to avoid it by taking their capital elsewhere. The war taxation in Great Britain has been definitely allocated for war purposes, and it will be taken off when the war is over. There is no guarantee that this tax will come off at the conclusion of the war. </para>

                            <para>- There is that suggestion. Another aspect of the situation has also to be borne in mind. Those who will be called upon to bear the tax directly, will endeavour to secure relief, and if they are manufacturing concerns, the only way they will be able to secure it will be by passing the tax on in the increased price of their goods. My honorable friends in their attempt to hit the big man will be simply hitting themselves in the long run. Many firms will not be able to continue their operations unless they do pass the tax on, and in consequence prices will be re-adjusted, and the consumer will be called upon to bear a big share of the higher penal rates. The object of the Bill ought to be to secure that the tax shall operate equitably over the entire population.I can find no evidence that that will be the case, and I would again suggest to honorable members opposite that they would do much better if they limited the taxation rate and spread it over a wider area. Such a course, in the long run, would be to their advantage, and particularly to the advantage of the working men of the community. If a man is rich he ought to pay the tax, but there is no provision in the Bill for seeing that the rich man will pay. If he is engaged in business, he will be only the agent for the payment of the tax. He will pay it out, but he will take it in again, and so the tax will not hurt him nearly as much as may be supposed. I am not going to stress this point any further. I have already indicated where I think much more money could be gathered at a less cost and with a great deal more fairness and equity than under this proposal. In peace times it is the easiest thing in the world to pass on income tax. It is not quite so easy now, I admit; but, at the same time, the tax must be passed on in many cases if the people concerned are to live, or if they are not to go out of business altogether. They must readjust their affairs. The rate of this income tax, particularly as it becomes a triplicate tax, will, in many instances, have the effect of absorbing the whole of the existing profits. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> laid it down as a cardinal principle of economics that a tax of1s. in the &#163;1 on incomes in times of peace must eventually fall upon both profits and wages. That was the theory of all the financiers who preceded him. It was the doctrine of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> as honorable members will see if they read his financial speeches. My recollection is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone&#39;s</inline> view was that, unless the tax were levied moderately and equitably, it would be the poor people and consumers of the country who would eventually have to bear it. Let it not be imagined that in making these remarks I am trying to shield a few rich people in the community. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, all have gone, and Gladstone is in his grave, with wiser, bigger, and abler economists in their places, but I doubt if the lot of the poor is very much better having regard to the tremendous strides that have taken place in scientific production. However that may be, there is no sign of economy in Australia. This Government does not believe in economy. It believes in extravagance, in lavish spending, thinking that by throwing money around it is serving the best interests of the country. I am glad to hear that there is a possibility of the clause which refers to taxation in succeeding years being modified. I would like to point out, further, that while the British tax is very high, the British war obligations are in some respects greater than our own. But do honorable members know that, whereas the deduction that we propose for each child is &#163;13, in Great Britain the amount is &#163;20 ? It has been argued that it would be illogical to make a greater deduction than &#163;13, inasmuch as that sum is the pension that will be granted for the child of any soldier who falls in battle. </para>

The right honorable gentleman told us yesterday that, while this loan was practically for war purposes, he would not separate the income from this tax from any other portion of the revenue.

                            <para>- The honorable member knows that additional probate duties and land taxation were imposed last year; but a better way of getting revenue at this period would be to establish economies in the ordinary Government services. That simple recipe is long overdue. Its operation may be postponed, but it will have to be faced sooner or later. In both State and Federal establishments expenditure is swollen and extravagant, and is rapidly becoming a tremendous burden upon the people of the country. </para>

                            <para>- I make no such suggestion. The point that I wish to emphasize is that it is always much easier to re-enact a measure than to repeal it. It is open to us to re-enact this Bill from year to year, and to fix the rate of income tax that shall be paid in respect of every year during which the war continues. We all hope that the war will be over before the end of the next twelve months. </para>

                            <para>- We did; and the people made a mistake in returning the Labour party to office. They have two years in which to realize the error they committed, and I have no doubt that, at the end of that time, they will give an emphatic demonstration of how fully they do realize it. The Attorney-General, in discussing this Bill, said that there were in Australia few incomes of more than &#163;6,500 a year, so that the higher rate for which it provides was more or less merely a matter of academic interest. I have good reason for believing that quite a number of incomes earned in Australia exceed &#163;6,500 a year and while those who enjoy them are for the most part anxious to pay their share of any just taxation rendered necessary by the war, it is hardly fair to hit them as heavily as they will be hit under this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- By all means let the Government tax his income. I know of the man to whom the honorable member refers, and believe that he has given very little to the war funds There rests upon every man of wealth the responsibility of giving as freely as he can in the present crisis. With some rare exceptions, wealthy men in Australia are realizing to the full their responsibilities in this respect, and are observing the very best traditions of the Empire. These men have made their financial arrangements for the year; and although those who were not afraid of what taxation might be imposed gave as freely as they could to the various funds, some of them have restricted their giving because of the fear of taxation of this kind being imposed, and the necessity of making provision to meet it. I am afraid that if we impose these extortionate rates upon big incomes, the effect will be very prejudicial to the further issues of the war loan. The Treasurer spoke yesterday of the magnificent) subscription to that loan. We are all proud that Australia has done so well; but there is a very real danger that, if too heavy a tax be placed upon these higher incomes, there will not be anything like so good a response to the future issues of the loan. The Treasurer quoted certain figures showing the subscriptions made by private companies, and, in one or two instances, by private individuals. He said that quite a number of private persons had subscribed more than the smallest of the sums which he read out; but that he thought it inadvisable to mention their names. If this super-tax be imposed at the rate set forth in the Bill, I am afraid that very little will be received on the next flotation from those who subscribed so well to the first issue. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has mistaken the object of the third reading of a Bill. I called the honorable member for Robertson to order when he was referring to the Loan Bill. That measure was discussed at considerable length when it was before the House recently. Honorable members were then afforded ample opportunity to say all that they desired in respect of it; and that Bill having been dealt with, it is not now in order to refer to it. I did not object to the honorable member for Robertson making a passing reference to it, but he would not be in order in discussing it On a motion for leave to introduce a Bill of this character, every honorable member has an opportunity to discuss, to the fullest extent, the whole financial position. Extensive references may also be made to the financial position on the motion for its second reading, since it is a measure relating to finance; but once such a Bill has been dealt with in Committee and reported to the House, then, on the motion for the third reading, the debate must be confined to the provisions of the Bill itself. The Bill cannot be discussed in a general way. I lay it down clearly and distinctly that, on the motion for the third reading, honorable members must confine themselves practically to the contents of the Bill as it comes from the Committee. I have always followed that rule, and it is followed in all Parliaments. </para>

This is a question which concerns both sides of the House, and, unless you are following some very definite authority of which I am entirely ignorant, I venture to ask you to consider whether we should not be entitled, on a motion for the third reading of a Bill, to give any reasons, relevant to the Bill., as to why it should not pass. A motion for the third reading of a Bill is not different, so far as the limits of debate are concerned, from a motion for the second reading. I do not wish at this stage of the session to create any difficulty, but I should like to know, sir, whether this question has received as yet your full consideration. I feel convinced that your ruling, as just given, would immensely limit a privilege which the House has hitherto exercised. </para>

                            <para>- The method of arriving at the tax employed in the Bill may be simple enough, but, in my opinion, country people will be considerably confused by it. There is no need for altering the methods to which they have been accustomed in the States. Artists delight in curves, but who would describe the Attorney-General as being artistic? If this graduated income tax is imposed to such a heavy extent as to drive the people with higher incomes out of the Commonwealth, or to give our citizens no encouragement to earn large incomes, we shall damage our future and we shall aggravate an evil which has been growing at a rapid rate during recent years, owing to the feeling of insecurity that men with capital are experiencing in regard to Australia. The flow of capital from the seat of the Empire to Australia has been decreasing to a most alarming extent. We used to be told that trade followed the flag, but, as a matter of fact, in these days of commercialism, we know that sentiment is laid aside, and that trade follows investment. The commercial activity and the growth of Australia have depended to a very large extent on the investments made here by the people of the Mother Country. We are told by the Minister of Home Affairs, in an interjection, that all investments depend on the rate of interest offered, but the influences governing the investment of capital are extremely complex, and the rate of interest is only one aspect. Great Britain last year invested &#163;25,000,000 in Argentine, &#163;14,000,000 in the United States. &#163;13,000,000 in Mexico, notwithstanding all its internal disturbances, &#163;12,000,005 in Brazil, and &#163;12,000,000 in Australia. Here we have a country which is guaranteed by the Union Jack, which is filled with white people, and which exists under a British Constitution, yet money is going just as fast into Brazil, which is peopled to a large extent by a dark-skinned race of half-castes, and which has nothing like the possibilities of raising people that Australia has, and labours under the disadvantages always appertaining to tropical climates. It would seem to indicate that there is something extremely and radically wrong in the management of our financial affairs. If we make it impossible for men with capital to turn their eyes to Australia we shall divert the stream of invigorating money which formerly flowed here.&#34; If we continue to impose a graduated tax to the enormous extent provided in the Bill, we shall drive away quite a number of men with capital who are now here - more than have been driven away by existing taxation. I know of my own knowledge that quite a number of men with capital are leaving Australia because the tax of big incomes is so great that it does not pay them to stay here when they wish to retire from business. </para>

                            <para>- If a rich man dies in Australia his heirs are called upon to pay over a third of the estate in probate duties. Some people are turning their eyes to New Zealand. I do not know what the probate duties may be there, but I know that in the case of the Argentine Republic taxes are greater than those imposed in Australia, though not much greater than will be imposed here when this Bill becomes law, coupled with the recently-imposed probate duties. When men consider that they have made sufficient money to keep them for the rest of their lives, they leave the Argentine. They say that they would go anywhere rather than give up to the State half the money that they have provided for their children. The probate duties there are nearly half the value of large estates. The result of this heavy taxation has been that, in all parte of the British Empire, men can be met who have made money in the Argentine, and taken it elsewhere to spend it. The time is coming when we should realize our responsibilities to the men who have made their money in Australia. In nineteen cases out of twenty these individuals are prepared to meet their responsibilities to the State, and we should treat them in such a way that, they will continue to pay their rightful share of the taxation of the State and not overtax them to such an extent that they will find it necessary to go anywhere else in order to escape it. It is quite possible to impose such heavy taxation as will defeat the object of the tax. It may be too heavy for the people to bear, and it may also prevent people from making the incomes which otherwise would be made. The effect of the taxes we are imposing on big incomes will be to drive people out of the country, and in consequence Australia will be so much the poorer. </para>

                            <para>- There are many good things we have heard long ago, but, unfortunately, some of the supporters of the Government hear good things all their lives, and do not realize the application of them. The time will come in Australia when we will drive out all the solid people. No matter from what stratum of society a man may spring, if he settles in this country, prospers, and leaves his money to his children, the community reaps a real advantage, and it would prove a grave and growing danger if we were not to encourage such men by giving them what, after all, is only fair play. </para>

                        <para>.- I must express surprise that the Attorney-General has given us no information as to the precise nature of the amendment he has promised to insert for the purpose of limiting the operation of this tax to one year. The honorable gentleman could not accept the suggestion made by the honorable member for Balaclava, but was prepared <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> draft an amendment which would have the effect desired ; and as ample time has now been given for consideration, it would save much discussion if he were to reveal the way in which he proposes to redeem the promise he made this morning. We have a right to know exactly where we stand. There is an obvious necessity for limiting the operation of the Bill to twelve months. This would save a great deal of unrest, and satisfy the public that the Bill is meant to be what it purports to be, namely, a war measure. In view of the circumstances under which we meet this afternoon, I should like permission to continue my speech on a future occasion. </para>

                            <para>- If we pass the third reading now, I understand that no amendment can be made until the Bill goes to another place, and as it was introduced in this House, we have a right to see that it leaves us in perfect form. When a promise such as that of the Attorney-General has been made it ought to be fulfilled. We all know that this taxation is going to be very heavy, and that its disadvantages to the taxpayer will prove numerous. A measure of the kind ought to be enacted from time to time, according to varying circumstances, and if it were limited to twelve months I presume it would meet the requirements of the Government. Next year the exigencies of the situation may be greater, or not so great as they are now, and the amendment suggested would enable us to then amend the Act accordingly. I do not think that there is an honorable member on this side prepared to allow the Bill to leave this Chamber until the Attorney-General has inserted the promised amendment. </para>

In my opinion, the proper way is to have the amendment made here, and I can see no reason why it should not be. The method suggested by the Attorney-General is somewhat doubtful, inasmuch as this House has no control over another place, and we have the right to safeguard ourselves. However, now that the Attorney-General has given an assurance, I am satisfied for the time being. </para>

                        <para>. - There are three points to which I shall very briefly address my remarks. The first is the statement made by several honorable members that the method of the schedule is complex, leaving the taxpayer in an atmosphere of doubt as to how much he has to pay. We are asked to adopt in place of it the system of gradations operating in the States. Several honorable members have urged that course upon me with very great force. I admit that, on the face of it, the system adopted in the States is more simple, but it is illogical and unjust. It makes a man who is at the beginning of his particular class pay much more than the man who is at the end of the preceding class, so that a man who receives &#163;999 pays, say, 4d. in the &#163;1, while the man receiving &#163;1,000 pays 5d. or 6d. in the &#163;1. That is a strong inducement to men to understate their income. In any case, it is grossly unfair, and the only argument in its favour is that it is easy to understand. The system adopted in this Bill is scientifically regulated and absolutely just. A man pays exactly on the amount of income he receives; he has no inducement to understate that income. The incidence of taxation proceeds on an even curve of increases, the rate of tax increasing with each additional &#163;1 of income. I much prefer the system we have adopted. It is scientific, logical, and fair. I cannot believe that there can be any confusion in the minds of the public, in  view  of the very plain statement of the effects of the Bill set out in the schedule. I desire to make perfectly clear to the taxpayers, who are very seriously concerned in this matter, exactly what their position is. This brings me to the point raised by the honorable member for Corangamite, who desired to know the position of a taxpayer who was in receipt of an income of &#163;2,500. I ask the honorable member to look at the schedule, which is to be distinguished from the footnote. The latter is published longitudinally, and is not part of the schedule, but merely an illustration of its effect. In the footnote is set out the actual amount of tax paid per &#163;1 on every &#163;1 of income, whereas in the schedule itself there is set out the rate of tax levied on the last &#163;1 of income. The difference is fundamental. The third point I desire to touch upon is the suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava, and other honorable members, that this rate of tax should operate for one year. I understand that in the United Kingdom the practice is to reimpose the income tax every year, readjusting the rates as the circumstances from time to time demand. An income tax has long been regarded as the most flexible and convenient form of meeting fluctuations of revenue. It can be made light when the revenue is coming to hand freely from other sources, and heavier when the revenue declines or the expenditure increases. There is considerable doubt as to the amount of revenue we shall derive from this tax, owing, as I pointed out in Committee, to the absence of data. I think it fair and proper that we should have an opportunity, in the light of one year&#39;s experience of the tax, to adjust it to the circumstances obtaining at that time. That proposition is fair and reasonable, and I am perfectly content to adopt it, but the question arises as to how that may be done. I submit that, with the consent of the House, an amendment can be made by striking out the words &#34; and each financial year thereafter.&#34; That amendment will meet the circumstances of the present occasion. I wish to make that amendment, if I may be permitted to do so. </para>

If the House is going to continue this irregular course of procedure, I do not see that the Standing Orders will be of much use to me. If it is the desire of the House that the Attorney-General shall have leave to withdraw the motion that has been under discussion for the last four hours, I am entirely in its hands; but I would suggest that on an occasion like this the House should take the course of suspending the Standing Orders, so that its business can be conducted properly. I ask the House to help me in maintaining order and the proper conduct of business, for if irregular methods are adopted, my efforts to keep order or to interpret the Standing Orders, so as to secure the proper conduct of debate, will not be of much avail.
