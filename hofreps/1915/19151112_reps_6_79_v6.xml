            <para>. - The amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act now proposed are, no doubt, for the most part such as the experience of the Commissioner of Taxes has shown to be necessary, and are more or less unobjectionable ; but to one at least considerable exception must be taken. The condition of affairs under the existing law is somewhat anomalous. It was recently held in, I think, a New South Wales case that the income of a company registered in London, whose dividends were declared in London, was immune from taxation, although its main sphere of operations was Australia, and most of its revenue came from this country. The Bill seeks to rectify that anomaly by providing that revenue directly derived from Australia shall he subject to income tax, which is fair and  reasonable. But there is another amendment to which I ask the particular consideration of the Prime Minister, because I think that its far-reaching effect and injustice are not realized. I should like to see the provisions of section 15 recast. That section now enacts that, in the case of a person not resident in or of a company not registered in Australia, selling goods here, the principal shall be deemed to have derived from their sale, taxable income equal to 5 per cent, on the price at which the goods were sold. This rigid, cast-iron assessment is unfair. In innumerable cases, some of which have been brought under my own notice, firms have been engaged for long periods, and in one case present in my mind for upwards of seven years, in endeavouring to establish branches in Australia, and, during the whole time, have consistently incurred losses on their Australian business. Section 15, however, requires that they shall be assessed on a profit of 5 per cent, on the price of their goods sold here, even though no profit at all has been earned. My suggestion is that in these cases the assessments should be on the actual profits, as shown by the balance-sheet and statement of the actual dealings and transactions in Australia. The Commissioner should at least have some discretion in this matter. -If he felt  it practically  impossible to assess the actual profits, it would be perfectly&#39; legitimate to allow him to assess them at 5 per cent, on the price of the goods sold, but where he was satisfied as to the actual results of the transactions, he should be able to assess accordingly. The section makes liable for the payment of income tax the person selling the goods, that is, the agent. He is personally liable for the payment of the income tax in respect of them. That seems harsh and unreasonable, but there is this feature about it that the agent is made liable only in respect of contracts and dealings to which he himself has been a party. An amendment is proposed, however, which goes much further. It makes the agent or representative in Australia liable, not only for the transactions to which he has been a party, but also in regard to the transactions of his principals entered into abroad. The amendment declares that goods shall be deemed to be sold in Australia on account of a person not resident here, or of a company, if any person in Australia receives a commission in respect of the sale of them, or is paid a salary for obtaining orders or for influencing their sale. In many cases which have been brought under my notice by merchants, 90 per cent, of the transactions which would be affected by this provision have been the result of contracts entered into abroad without the knowledge of the agent here. Yet the agent here is to be made personally liable in respect of them. The harshness and unfairness of the amendment will be understood when I again emphasize the large percentage of business done by principals without the knowledge of their agents, particularly in those cases where no money passes through the agent&#39;s hands, and he has no means of recouping himself. I am sure that that cannot be intended. It leaves agents with this alternative, to give up their agencies, or to accept an unjust liability. In many cases the principals will repudiate their liability for the tax, and the agents will have to pay it. Principals abroad cannot be made liable for the tax, because we have no jurisdiction over them; but it is going too far to make agents here directly responsible in respect of transactions to which they have not been a party. I&#39; ask honorable members what would be their feelings if such a law were enacted by the British Parliament, making agents residing in the United Kingdom liable for ali contracts entered into by principals in Australia? Such a law would be the cause of much annoyance and irritation. A section of the community will be harshly and unjustly dealt with by the amendment. Its effect will be more far-reaching than was contemplated by the Attorney-General in another direction also. It will have the objectionable result of discriminating and differentiating in its treatment of merchants, it will bring about a process of unequal competition, and it will be a source of irritation to the British merchant who is already experiencing the utmost difficulties because of the amount of labour that has been drawn by the war from the ordinary avocations of life, and because of the serious competition of America. The differentiation will lie in the fact that the merchant who has an agency in Australia will be taxed very much more than the merchant who has no agent, and sends his goods direct to his customers. The goods of the firm that is sufficiently enterprising to establish an agency in Australia are made liable for the Customs duties as they come in, and, in addition to the agent&#39;s personal income tax, he has to pay taxation on the basis of 5 per cent, of the selling price of the goods disposed of. This is a levy on the British merchant who has sufficient enterprise to establish an agency here, whereas there is no such imposition  where  the Australian merchant is content to send a buyer to England, and have his goods sent out direct from the British merchant. </para>

              <para>- It can only be done through Customs taxation, but I am not dealing with this matter from a fiscal stand-point. Speaking purely from the stand-point of the taxation of incomes, it is eminently desirable that British merchants should be encouraged to establish their agencies in Australia, because it means additional families spending  their  money here - it means that these agents will spend their money in Australia on travelling, office rent, and postage, and all the other matters associated with. trade, in addition to their domestic expenditure - it means that we shall have additional taxpayers whom we can tax; and often the business is the forerunner of the ultimate establishment of industries in Australia. All this is lost to us if these firms do not establish their agencies in the Commonwealth. I appeal to the Attorney-General to reconsider this amendment. The section is already harsh enough, and the amendment will intensify that harshness, do injustice to a section of the community, and create an undesirable discrimination. I emphasize the desirability of coming to some reciprocal arrangement as between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to the taxation of State instrumentalities, as strongly urged by the learned honorable members for Angas and Darling Downs. Of course, the fundamental principle of the Federal Constitution is that each State is sovereign within its own power and jurisdiction. </para>

              <para>- It has been laid down that there is no power on the part of the States to tax Federal instrumentalities, but there does not seem to have been any direct case bearing upon the taxation of Commonwealth instrumentalities by the State. I do not think that the power actually exists, but, seeing that there is doubt on the point, we should have an authoritative decision by the High Court upon it. There should be a reciprocal arrangement, but, at the same time, an effort should be made to ascertain exactly what the law is in this connexion. I approve of the amendment provided for in clause 8. There were other matters on which I wished to speak, but as it is desirable to shorten one&#39;s remarks, I shall not deal further with the Bill. I urge the Attorney-General to reconsider the amendment to section 15 proposed in clause 3. </para>

            <para>. - I also desire to refer to the provision in clause 3, which has been elaborated at some length by the learned honorable member for Kooyong, because it seems to me the effect of the Bill will be to eliminate agents who are resident in Australia, and substitute for them  agents who  do not reside here. That has already been the result of similar legislation in other countries. The proposal in the Bill is the same in principle as the poll-tax imposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> in New Zealand some years ago, and which he decided to remove at the instance of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain. The result of that poll-tax was to drive nearly all the agencies out of New Zealand. Many of the agents came to Australia. I have been informed by one who was driven out that he does his business from Australia just as well. He simply goes over to New Zealand for a month now and again. The result of the legislation was that the country lost agencies, citizens, and taxpayers, without gaining the slightest good. It will be the same in the Commonwealth. The proposal will drive our Australian trade into the channels in which the Japanese and American merchants are already working. </para>

          <para class="block">Commonwealth, now and then to introduce their goods. All the transactions take place over the seas. There are very few Japanese or American agencies run by agents resident in Australia. On the other hand, many British manufacturers have resident agents, and some of them have been in the Commonwealth all their lives, but this taxation will tend to drive them away, though it will not stop the trade. It will stop nothing except the taxation which is now derived from the business transacted by the resident agents and it will drive citizens from the Commonwealth. This legislation has been tried in many places. There are all sorts of means of evading it. South Africa tried it, but as the result of experience it was repealed and a licence substituted. That also proved of no value, and had to be abandoned. From time to time subterfuges have been put up to evade legislation and taxation of this kind. Is it wise to try to tempt our ordinary agents, who are reputable men, and have lived all their lives in Australia, to do this kind of thing, or to drive them out of Australia altogether ? They do a great part of their business on the indenting principle through London agencies, and the London houses of those who purchase the goods. All the transactions are completed in London, and they will still be completed in London. The only effect of this legislation will be to eliminate the local agent and his local establishment, thus throwing a lot of men out of work, and to substitute the peripatetic agent, who passes through, does his business, gets out, and leaves Australia the poorer for it all. If there was some object of a protective character in view, I could understand this proposal. There might be some sense in it if it would lead to the establishment of permanent sections of business in Australia, but that will not be the result. These firms will continue to do their business in London. Many of the old-established businesses dealing in commodities required here hardly need such agencies as are referred to in the Bill. </para>

            <para>.- May I bring before the Minister in charge of this Bill a circumstance affecting a number of Red Cross workers who are going away from Australia to assist in alleviating the difficulties of wounded Australian soldiers. These people have doubts as to whether under the provisions of this Bill they will be regarded as absentees. Their view is that they should be granted privileges similar to those given to the men on active service. They are going out in a voluntary capacity, and I ask the Minister to give an assurance that they will not be treated as though they were absentees. I should like the assurance to be definitely given, because it would be unfortunate should the matter be subsequently looked into, and there be found no provision in the Statute whereby Red Cross workers away from Australia could be regarded by the administrators of the Act as other than absentees. </para>

            <para>. - In his advocacy of preferential trade, the Minister of Trade and Customs has from time to time been in communication with representatives of the British Board of Trade, and this particular clause relating to agencies does, on the face of it, seem to go quite contrary to the policy that has been advocated of encouraging trade between Australia and the Old Country. It is by having his agent here that the British manufacturer can best compete with the foreign manufacturer whose goods are on the Australian market. I do not know whether the Minister has considered this aspect of the proposal, but the section is calculated to act directly contrary to the policy that has been advocated. </para>

            <para>. - I desire to bring before the notice of the Attorney-General another amendment that might be made to this section. I have no intention of pressing it to a division, but wish to explain the position as it occurs to me. In the first place I would point out how onerous is paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of the principal Act with which my suggested amendment deals. It is very unusual, but in order to be perfectly straightforward I cannot do better than quote a case with which I am altogether familiar. A friend of mine has a home, which, in former days, was not very valuable, but the value of which has since increased very much. He does not wish to leave it, and prefers to forego a considerable amount rather than do so. Last year, for the privilege of living in his own house he had to pay, by way of Federal and State land taxation and municipal taxes of all sorts, no less than &#163;688. The fact that he elected to pay those charges is an evidence of his <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226; fide</inline> desire to remain in his own home. If he chose to sell the old home, he could avoid that outlay, and obtain interest on the capital. He has no desire, however, to do so, and under this amending clause his taxation will be increased by &#163;200 a year. In other words, he will have to pay about &#163;888 a year by way of taxation on the house in which ho lives. It would do the country no good to dispossess him of his home, and it seems to me that some limit should be placed on the amount chargeable under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of section 14 of the principal Act. I have, therefore, given notice of an amendment fixing a limit of &#163;300, but I do not wish to press it. If the Attorney-General is prepared to meet such a case I shall be glad; if he cannot I shall say no more. </para>

            <para>. - The amendment of which the right honorable gentleman has given notice differs very widely from the amendment of the principal Act before the House, and relates to a different sub-section. The point raised by him was discussed at some length when the original Bill was before the House. The principle was then adopted that in order that the incidence of the tax might fall fairly, it was necessary to treat as income the amount of rent that would be received from a house owned and occupied by the taxpayer if it were let to another person. The right honorable gentleman has put his case very fairly, but with very great regret I am unable to accept the amendment suggested. </para>

It would be most undesirable that a man with a house worth &#163;600 a year should escape taxation while the great mass of the people whose houses are not equal to a rental value of &#163;300 a year should pay taxation upon them.

            <para>. - I intended on the second reading, of this measure to deal as clearly as 1 could with some misapprehensions that I think arise regarding the purpose and effect of the clause now before us. The Attorney-General, however, was unable to be present, so that he will pardon me if I deal with the clause a little more fully than I should do in ordinary circumstances. A good deal of doubt and difficulty is likely to arise from the reading of section 15 as proposed to be amended, or even as unamended, in connexion with section 52 of the Act. I am entirely in sympathy with the object which I think the Attorney-General desires to attain.  His  object I understand to be that, foreign companies and foreign individuals, who directly or indirectly derive a profit from business done in Australia, shall pay income tax upon the profits of that business. That is the broad principle. </para>

              <para>- I agree entirely with it. It is in accordance with the principle adopted, not only here, but in other countries. The main provision for giving effect to it under the Income Tax Act is based on profits. The income has to be ascertained in the ordinary way, and the person who is made responsible for that is the agent who is carrying on the business here. The agent carrying on the business here is the man who receives the money for transmission to the principal. I think we shall all agree that any branch of a house, or any agent carrying on the business of a foreign principal here, should be obliged, as required by section 52, to make returns, and that the agent should be made responsible for the payment, out of the moneys he received on behalf of his principal, of the income tax payable on that man&#39;s income. The trouble arises, I think, not in this amendment of section 15, but under section 15 itself. I wish to help the Attorney-General to avoid the trouble and, in some cases, hardship that may arise in giving effect to what is really the principle of this provision. The main principle that governs all is that embodied in section 52, under which the agent has to ascertain the profits and to pay the income tax, and is entitled to reimburse himself out of the moneys received for his principal. Section 15 is intended to deal with the same principle; but is applied to a somewhat different class of cases. Where you have not an agent who is, in the ordinary sense, carrying on the business of a principal here, but an agent who is simply effecting sales for principals - acting, perhaps, for a number of firms in a number of isolated  cases of sales, but not a representative in the wide sense of the word - then you say with regard to such contracts, &#34; Where there is no foreign business carried on here, we will arrive at a rough and ready means of estimating the profits by assuming that the profits on the actual sales and contracts amount to 5 per cent.&#34; I agree again with that principle, for it is a fair way of dealing with a practical difficulty. But section 15, unfortunately, I think, makes the individual agent who has made the contract personally responsible to pay out of his own money the income tax on that 5 per cent. That is where the first trouble arises. It is perfectly right that he should pay the income tax out of any moneys in hand, or that he should retain moneys after the Act comes into operation, and he knows what he has to do, to pay income tax due by his principal. But to say that, in respect of the year ending 30th June, 1915, agents who simply effect sales - who are simply the agents for entering into these contracts, while other persons have the handling of the money, shall be personally responsible for the income tax, is manifestly unjust. Such a provision cannot be carried out. I am satisfied that if it remains the Attorney-General, when we meet next year, will find it necessary to propose an amendment to do away with the manifest injustice. On the other hand, if the selling agent be, as in some cases, the man who receives the money for the sale, then he ought to be, and would be, responsible under section 52. That is the whole position. </para>

              <para>- I am not going to propose any amendment, but I wish to make a suggestion. The difficulty to which I have referred as existing under section 15 will be immensely accentuated by this amending clause. The amending clause would extend this personal liability, not merely to the man who effects the sale, but to any man who receives a commission in respect of the sale of goods, or is paid salary for obtaining orders or for influencing the sale of goods. That includes a very wide class of advertising agents, who may have nothing to do with the receipt of the money, and may not be immediately connected with the actual sale which gives rise to the receipt of the money. I suggest that the Attorney-General should strengthen section 52 which applies to every agent. The interpretation clause includes as an agent every person who receives any money, and section 52 makes every person who receives the money of his principal liable to pay income tax. If he is a person carrying on a business, he is supposed to make a return iri the ordinary way, and to pay taxation on his income. But if he is an agent who receives money sporadically or occasionally for sales effected by himself or somebody else, he would accept the benefits of section 15, because he would, say, &#34; I cannot make out a profit on these sales, but I will pay taxation on 5 per cent.&#34; The man who receives the money is the person who ought to be made responsible for paying the whole of the income tax, whether it is measured in the ordinary way upon a statement of profits, or under section 15 as 5 per cent, on the sales effected. I suggest for the consideration of the Prime Minister that an investigation will disclose that section 52 does cover, not only the man who conducts a business and presents a return in the ordinary way, but also the man who receives money on sales effected by himself or anybody else. If he is liable to pay income tax on that money, it is unnecessary to make liable the person who effects the sale, but does not receive the money. At the same time, it is necessary that the person who effects the sale should supply the Department with a full return. If he also receives the money, he pays taxation, but if he does not he fortifies the Department with the whole of the information on which the person who does receive the money is made liable. If the Act is amended as I suggest, I see no objection to increasing the liability to make returns, so as to include persons employed on salary or commission, or as advertising agents. But the amendment as applied to section 15, creating a direct personal liability on the part of the agent to pay out of his own money taxation on money received by another person, who is liable to taxation, would lead to difficulties which the Attorney- General would do well to consider. </para>

Whilst I do not say for one moment that there is not force in the arguments put forward, yet the revenue must be protected, and the Government must have from one source or another taxation to carry on the business of the country during this trying period.

            <para>. - Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of this clause provides that deductions shall not be made for the losses and outgoings of capital. A merchant who loses his building or stock by fire or other causes is, or ought to be, covered by insurance; but insurance is not possible in regard to the live stock of a farmer and grazier. If he loses his stock, he loses his entire capital and working plant, and then he is to be asked to find money to pay taxation on the income which he had last year. I believe that under the Queensland Act deductions of losses of capital, even stock, are not allowed, but it must be remembered that the Federal tax is a duplication of existing taxation. There are farmers throughout portions of New South Wales and Queensland, apart from the graziers, who will lose practically everything they possess except their land if rain does not fall shortly, and now we ask them, after they have lost all their working capital, to pay taxation on an income which existed last year. Live stock cannot be insured against drought, and I ask the Attorney-General to consider the possibility of allowing deductions for loss of capital invested in live stock. There are men in the electorate of Richmond whose whole capital will disappear unless rain comes soon. If a farmer is a tenant, perhaps his live stock is his only possession. He may have &#163;1,000 worth of stock on the farm, and if the drought continues his whole capital will disappear, and then he will be asked to pay income tax on income derived last year. </para>

As I had not an opportunity on the last occasion, I wish to bring the matter up now. Under the principal Act, the payments of Federal land tax and State land tax are allowed to be deducted in arriving at the taxable income. Further, State income tax and municipal taxes may be deducted, but, for some reason or other which I cannot ascertain, the Federal income tax is not deductible. I have consulted lawyers and others, and I cannot ascertain why. The assessment is made on the previous year&#39;s income, and, if the deductions I have mentioned are proper, I see no reason why an exception should be made of the Federal income tax. </para>

            <para>. - The point raised by the right honorable gentleman has no doubt occurred to many, and it is a standing mystery even to the most intelligent people. However, having been permitted access to the inmost secrets of the Commissioner&#39;s office, I have been able to learn the reason for this exception from the general rule. The object of this taxation is, of course, to obtain revenue, and, technically, there is no doubt that our power to impose taxation includes the power to tax the whole income; that is to say, wo could impose a tax of 20s. in the &#163;1. If taxpayers were allowed to deduct the amount of income tax paid, and a tax of 20s. in the &#163;1 were imposed, a taxpayer would have the right to deduct the whole, and would, therefore, pay no tax. at all. That is the explanation of the position, and when stated in these terms it is perfectly obvious. We do not tax the amount paid in State income tax because that taxation has nothing to do with us; but to make the exemption now suggested would be to exempt the very income that we are taxing, and render the instrument of taxation a piece of worthless paper. </para>

            <para>. - I am much obliged to the Attorney-General, but I do not think there is much in his argument. If the only object of this taxation is to raise revenue, why have any deductions at all ? When, however, there are deductions, why should an exception be made in a case which is clearly one in the same category as the others. I submit that the explanation is not very edifying, at any rate to me. </para>

            <para>.- The same principle as that laid down by the Attorney General is in operation in the case of the Income Tax Act, Victoria. That Act forbids the deduction of the amount paid in the previous year, but allows the deduction of Federal taxes and all other State taxes. We may look at the matter from a different point of view. Let us take the case of a man with an income of &#163;1,000 a year, when it is decided to impose a tax of 10 per cent., representing &#163;100. If the next year this man was allowed to deduct the &#163;100 paid in the previous year, the country would not get 10 per cent. on &#163;1,000. The principle is thoroughly sound, and I agree with the view of the Commissioner. </para>

            <para>.- I desire to call the attention of the Attorney-General to what appears to me to be an omission in the amendment of section 19. That section provides for an exemption, in a certain manner, of &#163;156 on incomes from property and from personal exertion; but the new clause provides for an equal division. In the case of a man who had a much greater income from personal exertion than from property, there might not be, with an equal division, a sufficient amount of property to cover the exemption. As I read the clause, such a man would be unable to get the full benefit of the extra exemption on the income derived from personal exertion. All I ask is that the Attorney-General shall look into the matter, and to aid him I shall have pleasure in placing before him two concrete cases for his consideration. </para>

          <para>This new clause is proposed in order to limit the effect of a previous amendment made in the incidence of taxation on partners, to partnerships entered into before the coming into operation of the Bill. The honorable member for Maribyrnong, in a letter that he sent to the Department, cited a case of gross unfairness arising through the operation of the clause as it stands. The amendment was intended to make the incidence fall more equitably on partners. It has been pointed out, however, that bogus partnerships might be created in order to get the benefit of the section; and the present amendment is intended to confine that benefit to partnerships made before the commencement of the Act. </para>

            <para>.- This clause also affects trustees and beneficiaries, and is, I believe, due to the suggestions of a Trustee Company. It is not quite clear to me, however, that the Bill as amended will touch the case of an ordinary beneficiary, who is neither a minor nor has had sums kept back for repairs and maintenance. For instance, in the case of an estate distributed on 2nd July, a whole quarterly instalment of income would, on the 30th June, he held over technically. I am informed that this is safeguarded by section 28, sub-section 3, of the original Act - </para>

            <para>. - Some of the objections that have been urged against the construction of the proposed railway were caused by want of information which should have been placed before us. The Minister was kind enough to let me see last night the Estimate for the proposed bridge across the Katherine. I understand that a temporary bridge is to be provided, at a cost of &#163;11,000, and paid for out of the vote for the not yet completed section between Pine Creek and the Katherine River. I regret that we have not fuller information regarding this bridge, because &#163;11,000 is a large sum to spend on a temporary structure, which is to be pulled down again as soon as the proposed extension of 60 miles has been made. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Primarily this work will form part of a defence line, but as it will traverse country some of which is inferior, some good, and some excellent pastoral land, and possibly mining country, but not agricultural, it is not likely to carry a large - population for a generation or more, and, therefore, in its construction economy should be studied from start to finish. A sound road should be made, but there should be no extravagance in building orin other directions. </para>

              <para>- Thirty years ago South Australian engineers laid down steel sleepers on the section of the railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek, and I am told by men who undertook that construction, and who afterwards dealt with the maintenance of the line, that, generally speaking, they are about as good to-day as they were when they were first put in the ground. On this point the Public Works Committee should obtain the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrews,</inline> the principal construction engineer in South Australia, who spent twenty years in the Northern Territory as Resident Engineer, and knows as much about the country as any man in the Public Service of his State. He is my informant in this regard. From what he has told me, I advise the use of steel sleepers on the section of the line from Katherine River to Bitter Springs. </para>

              <para>- If we use timber sleepers it will be throwing: away money. All along South Australian railway engineers have condemned the use of timber sleepers in the Northern Territory. It is claimed that powellised sleepers might be used. The South Australian engineers have experimented for many years on the treatment of sleepers by creosote and other preserving methods. I am sure that the Public Works Committee will gather from them that the results have not proved sufficiently satisfactory to justify them in recommending the use of powellised sleepers. </para>

              <para>- They cost about11s. each, but, as their life is everlasting, if they should prove satisfactory, they would be cheaper than jarrah sleepers in the long run. For ballasting this line &#163;1,000 a mile has been provided. We cannot expect work to be done in the Northern Territory at within 20 or 25 per cent, of the cost of similar work in a temperate climate, but it seems to me that if ballast can be obtained all along the line, or even anywhere on the 60-miles section, the estimate of &#163;1,000 is an enormous figure. </para>

              <para>- One requirement on a transcontinental railway is speed. Furthermore, it is necessary on a railway running into cattle country, otherwise the stock in transit to markets will eat all the profits. This railway ought to be ballasted, and it should be a strong road, but &#163;1,000 per mile is a very big sum indeed. I know that ballast has to be taken 400 miles along the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway at the Port Augusta end, and even in that case the estimate for ballasting did not exceed &#163;800. We should not adhere rigidly to the principle of day labour in the construction of this railway. For year after year we have had dinned into our ears the success of railway construction in Queensland by day labour, but the very first report that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> submitted in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief of the Commonwealth Railways, showed that as a rule railways were built in Queensland, not by day labour, but by the petty contract or butty-gang system. Day labour was only resorted to where conditions were not satisfactory for the application of the small contract system. </para>

It is about time this National Parliament determined that if the day labour system is to be continued in carrying out our public works it must be prepared to submit to the test of public competition. All our public works should be submitted to public tender, and if the Government Department can beat the middleman - as my honorable friend calls him - or outside tenderer, let it have the work, and if the public Department cannot beat the outside tenderer, let the outside tenderer have the work in the interests of the taxpayer. If there is an advantage on either side it should be on the side of the taxpayer. </para>

              <para>- In favour of the public tenderer. Fifteen or twenty years ago contractors were doing remarkably well. They were paid handsome prices for the work, and in consequence the Engineer-in-Chief of the Public Works Department was for several years able to compete successfully with them. But those were the days when the Engineer-in-Chief, and not outside influence, built the railways. Gradually outside influence crept in, and with it returned the day of the contractors. Nevertheless, I could quote tender after tender to show the difference between the public tender and the cost of the work when it was constructed by the Department. If honorable members opposite have such faith in the ability of the Government to do work more cheaply than it can be done otherwise, why do they object to competition by public tender? Competition offers the only possible protection the taxpayers have. </para>

I know honorable members say that certain works have been constructed by day labour below the estimate, but we have not been fully informed what the estimate was for. If the Engineer-in-Chief and his officers had full control, they would know how to estimate for any particular work, but if present-day conditions apply, and control is from the bottom and not from the top, where can the officials have any authority 1 I want to repeat, and I shall repeat it over and over again, that this country is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds - I am not sure that it is not losing millions - owing to the slipshod manner in which work is done, and the absence of official authority. The only remedy is a return to the public tender. If the Government can then beat the outside contractor, let the Government do the work, but if the Engineer submits his specifications and estimates, and obtains the contract, and at the conclusion of the work it is found that his estimate has been largely exceeded, every detail of the extra cost should be submitted to Parliament. </para>

This Bill is before the House, and yet the actual, work of constructing the railway is now in progress. If the action that has been taken is agreed to, then the Public Works Committee Act will be rendered a complete farce. This is the first occasion upon which the Public Works Committee Act has been really needed. It was to meet a situation like this that the Act was introduced. It was the deliberate intention of Parliament that no such work as this should be proceeded with until the Committee had obtained evidence upon it, and the proposal had been discussed by Parliament in the light of full information.

              <para>- The point raised by the honorable member for Franklin is purely a question of law. A very heavy tax would be imposed upon the  Speaker  if, as soon as any motion or Bill were introduced, he were expected to put the whole of the Crown Law Offices into operation in order to see whether what was proposed to be done was in accordance with the law. That would not be possible; so that the only duty devolving upon the  Speaker  is to see that what is done is done in accordance with parliamentary practice and the practice of this House. So far as I have been able to gather, nothing has been done in the introduction of this Bill that is contrary to the practice of this House. If the Government desire to take any course, it is not for me to say whether that course is legal or illegal. That is a matter for other authorities to decide. So far as the procedure is concerned, the Bill is quite in order. </para>

              <para>- If &#39;the attitude that, notwithstanding the existence of the Public Works Committee Act, the Government can introduce and carry out any work without reference to the Public .Works Committee is to be accepted as correct, then the Public Works Committee is nothing better than a farce, and the Act a sham. Parliament has deliberately passed over this scheme to the Public Works Committee for examination. The Committee have already commenced to take evidence. Simultaneously with the taking of that evidence, work on the railway has begun, and when the report of the Committee comes along the railway will have been almost completed. </para>

This is by far the most important work that has been referred to the Committee, and, with the exception of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, is the most important with which the House has had to deal. It will cost the country &#163;10,000,000 to complete the north-south railway. </para>

In the first instance, we are asked to be parties to a breach&#39; of the law. There is no doubt that this House has the inherent power to repeal legislation; but it is useless to disregard legislation on the statute-book in a matter of vital importance, while pretending to observe the law. If the repeal of the Public Works Committee Act is required, it should be faced and undertaken in a straightforward, direct, and honorable manner. </para>

              <para>- Every one reads the reports, but no one reads the evidence, with the result that the special knowledge of the experts can be obscured - I do not suggest that it is deliberately done - by the method in which it is presented. I have no desire to enter into a wrangle with the members of the Public Works Committee as to the usefulness of their labours. I merely express a doubt as to the wisdom of referring to them these purely policy works, which the Government intend to proceed with regardless of whether or not they are going to be paying propositions. The next point is as to whether, in the circumstances, we should proceed with this line at the present time. The late Liberal Administration decided to build the Pine Creek to Katherine River line upon a 4-ft. 8J-in. extension basis. That is to say, we decided that the line should be built on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, so as to link up with the Northern Territory line ; but the sleepers, culverts, and cuttings and curves were to be such as would enable the immediate conversion of the line to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. That was decided in anticipation of the almost immediate unification of the Australian gauges. </para>

              <para>- An excellent policy. The difficulty, however, is that, if we arc to accept the ex-Prime Minister as the mouthpiece of events, the unification of the Australian railway gauges is indefinitely postponed. If it is, then this line should be built on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. It is a mere waste of money, if we are to  have  no unification of gauges, to build a 3-ft. 6-in. line on 4-ft. 8|-in. sleepers. The cost of ballasting a 4-ft. 8^-in. line is infinitely greater than that of ballasting a 3-ft. 6-in. line. There is also great doubt as to whether this railway ought not to be earth-packed throughout. Honorable members may talk of the necessity for the quick passage of live stock. The Cloncurry line, however, is an earth-packed railway, with a maximum speed of 15 miles an hour, and it is carrying in the neighbourhood of 300,000 stock per annum to the meat works - an infinitely greater traffic than we shall have on this Une. </para>

              <para>- That is not the point now under consideration. We have to consider economy; yet we are deliberately proposing to build a line upon specifications to connect up with the uniform gauge system, although, judging by the ex-Prime Minister&#39;s utterances, there is no possibility of a uniform railway system in Australia for many years to come. We ought not to proceed with this line until we know exactly what is to be done with respect to a uniform gauge, and generally in regard to the Northern Territory railway system connecting both South Australia and Queensland. In these circumstances I shall feel it my duty - although a friend of the north-south line, and of the south-east and north-west extensions - to vote against this Bill. </para>

            <para>.- I regret, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that the point raised by the honorable member for Franklin was not upheld by you. If this motion goes to a division I shall feel compelled to vote against it. I would not be doing my duty to my constituents and the country if I were to vote for an expenditure of &#163;320,000 on such meagre information as was given us by the Minister in introducing this measure. It has never been my lot to hear a Bill introduced in, I might almost say, such a careless manner, and with such little information and so much levity as marked the introduction of this measure. I am not reflecting on the Minister of Home Affairs in making this statement, for he has only recently come into office. But it will be my duty always to vote against proposals of this kind when they are not backed up by .information which the House should possess. We have a Public Works Committee in which we have confidence, and which was appointed to report on all works estimated to cost &#163;25,000 or more. In this case, where we have an estimated expenditure of &#163;320,000, they are to be ignored, although we are passing through&#39; times when every Government is crying out for economy. I am not prepared to do this, and shall never be while I remain a member of this Parliament. </para>

              <para>- Approximately 100 per cent. This is typical of the increases in the prices of many other materials that will have to be used. At a time like this, when the greatest possible economy is necessary, we should not pledge the country to go on with a proposal of this kind while we shall have to pay these greatly enhanced prices. The only point urged in favour of the course proposed by the Minister is that, unless we proceed at once with the construction of this line, 500 men already in the Territory will be thrown out of employment. I do not believe that. There are sections of the line from Pine Creek to Katherine River yet to be completed, and I believe it would pay the Government to find employment for these men elsewhere in the Commonwealth rather than to proceed with this work at a time when a hugely increased expenditure must be involved. In making his appeal for economy, the honorable member for Wakefield suggested that too much reliance should not be placed on the day-labour system. As one who is as anxious as he is for economy, I would remind him that in Victoria, where we have in power the only Liberal Administration in Australia, the day-labour system has been in force for many years, and that, according to the Minister of Public Works, the State railways are constructed for far less than would be possible under the contract system. </para>

            <para>.- The proposed extension of the Pine Creek-Katherine River railway to Bitter Springs is certainly a very important proposal, and the Government are to be commended for having taken action to continue the present line, which is part of the railway which the Commonwealth promised to construct when it took over the Territory. The question for the House to consider is whether this is the most opportune time to build the railway. The Minister of Home Affairs has told us that one of the principal reasons for undertaking the work at the present time is to provide employment for a number of the men at present engaged in the construction of the section previously sanctioned by Parliament. It is said that there are about 500 men employed on that railway, and that unless the proposed extension is proceeded with a number of the men will be thrown out of employment, and the authorities will be faced later with the necessity of reorganizing the whole gang. When we realize the difficulty and expense of taking men to the Territory, we can quite understand the anxiety of the Minister to have the work put in hand, in order to retain the men who are already there. The Minister of External Affairs has given a guarantee that the laying of the line will not be proceeded with until the project has been inquired into and reported upon by the Public Works Committee. That assurance has considerably relieved the situation. I would point out to the House the difficult position in which the Committee would be placed if asked to report on a railway, the construction of which had already been decided upon by the House. If this Bill is passed, the Department will probably proceed to order material, and make other preparations for the building of the line. At this stage I do not think it would be wise for the Government to purchase timber sleepers for the line. </para>

I understand that there will not be much trouble with the ballasting, because ballast can be obtained close to the route of the line. Therefore, I cannot see why the railway should cost &#163;5,000 per mile, when there are no engineering difficulties. I understand that estimate is based on the cost of the section at present being constructed. </para>

            <para>.- For years I have advocated that a Board should be appointed to carry out a continuous policy of development in the Northern Territory. Had there been one authority in charge of the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek there would not have been the present trouble. The construction of railways for the development of the Northern Territory is essential. A man told me recently that he has on his station plenty of fat cattle, but he cannot get them to market owing to the lack of railway facilities. About the Macdonnell Ranges there exists one of the finest stretches of country on the face of the earth, but it requires a railway for its development. There are 18,000,000 acres of land with a 16-inch rainfall, and capable of growing wheat or anything else. I understood that we were to have a continuous policy for the opening up of the Territory by railway construction, but to build this line simply in order to keep 100 men employed would be ridiculous. It might be better to bring those men south for the summer and find employment for them here. In my opinion, a great blunder would be made if this work were taken out of the hands of the Public Works Committee. That body was created for a specific purpose, and I am sure that the Minister would be pleased to have from the Committee an opinion based on reliable evidence. I hope that the Minister will not proceed with the railway at the present time. This seems to be just another evidence of the wire-pulling that is taking place throughout the Commonwealth. We know that the proper policy to adopt is to build a railway from north to south in the  straightest  practicable line, and that by so doing we should avoid all engineering difficulties. Directly the line deviates to the east, it enters broken river country extending for 150 miles, and presenting many difficulties for railway construction. By such a deviation the line is being taken further away from the valuable land on the eastern boundary of Western Australia, the development of which, in conjunction with the Territory, would be adding a new province to the Commonwealth. Instead of that definite policy, there is continual tinkering with the railway proposals, and the line is being gradually edged eastward until some day it will strike the coast of Queensland or the Gulf of Carpentaria. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton expressed the pride he felt when he understood that the Commonwealth intended to build a railway from north to south for defence purposes, and he said that when the line was constructed he would be glad to come to Australia to be present at the opening ceremony. If the Government are anxious to find homes for soldiers at the conclusion of the war, they can find abundant suitable land in the Macdonnell Ranges. Let the Government proceed with the construction&#39; of the through railway, create a big military station in the north, and say to the soldiers who come to Australia from other parts of the world, &#34; Make a home for yourselves in the freest country on the face of the earth.&#34; </para>

            <para>.- Whilst regretting the irregularities which have occurred in connexion with the introduction of this measure I am bound to support it, because I believe it to be one section of that national line, the construction of which is so essential in the interests of the independence and security of Australia. If we have an assurance from the Ministry that the line will not wander away to the east, but that it will be treated as part and parcel of a great scheme which the majority of the people of Australia will support, I see no reason, having regard to the national danger, why we should hesitate, notwithstanding our great responsibilities at the present moment. I feel that we should have a comprehensive policy of railway construction embodying this great ideal of national security, and it should advance side by side with a big scheme of land settlement, by which we could gradually provide a much better, more effective, and certainly cheaper system of closer settlement for the whole of the States than they are able to provide under their present imperfect and ruinous systems. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">We can assist in realizing the ideal of all true Australians by giving effect to such a system. I shall not say anything further on this question beyond that I intend to cast my vote for the proposal, notwithstanding that I believe that we are beginning at the wrong end - that we should build from the south to the north. I only wish now to refer to some criticism by the honorable member for Wakefield in regard to the relative merits of day labour and the contract system. I worked for many years as a small contractor, and shifted tens of thousands of tons of earthwork; and I can honestly say that I have studied the question from the point of view of both the contractor and the worker. Incidentally, I may mention, without being guilty of an idle boast, that I should be willing to meet any member of the Opposition with a pick and shovel in a ten-hour day. Every principle of political economy will be outraged if we assume that, conditions being equal, the State cannot undertake huge enterprises of this character, and carry them out as cheaply and economically as they could be carried out under private enterprise. Even a contractor, whose operations are of a moderate character, must carry out his work under the day-labour system, and the whole matter is one of supervision. If a State has made adequate provision in the form of a proper and permanent railway building plant, there has not to be met the expense that has had to be faced over and over again in the various States, when contractors have to shift their huge plant from one part of the country to another. Further, in any State so organized, there, is no necessity to maintain two staffs of efficient engineers. We can quite understand that contractors endeavour to get the best possible specifications, and to &#34; shave the wind &#34; without absolutely bringing their work into what may be called the realm of condemnation. That is the line of least resistance a contractor invariably pursues, even though, in railway construction, it may mean the endangerment of many lives in the future and heavy expense in maintaining a jerry-built work that has passed the supervising engineers. In railway construction the contractor must maintain a staff of good engineers, and the State must also have a staff to see that the work i3 properly clone by the contractor. We have here a duplication of functions which would not be tolerated in any other walk of life. After all, this is only another avenue of socialistic enterprise. No one would suggest that the maintenance of the Army and so forth in the present great war should be conducted by private enterprise; on the contrary, it is recognised that the organization, to be effective, must proceed from the centre. If inefficiency creeps into the day-labour system in railway construction, we may take it that there is something seriously wrong with the supervision. If it is possible for political influence to be brought to bear, the fact only emphasizes the necessity for a permanent Board of able men, to whom a huge plant and the whole work of railway construction could be intrusted. We ought to have continuous railway administration in this regard, for we should not then see overwhelming work for two or three years succeeded by a complete dearth. This latter, of course, means extravagance and ultimate ruin. Under the day-labour system it is possible for politicians to interpose, and it is also possible, owing to lack of proper supervision, for men to give an inadequate return. I have always found that, in order to get good and permanent work, the responsible man should have the whole direction of affairs, and all those engaged ought to know that the length of their employment is governed only by their capacity for work, utterly independent of the good-will or favour of other persons. </para>

            <para>.-I support the motion for the second reading because it is in accord, not only with the letter, but with the whole spirit of the agreement by which we undertook the control of the Northern Territory. The agreement and the Act clearly show that this railway had to be constructed from Port Darwin southward to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. The Territory was taken over because it was recognised that to leave it unsettled would prove a menace to Australia, and that, unless a railway were built, it could not be developed as pastoral country. My own opinion is that pastoral pursuits must come first and closer settlement afterwards. The section of the line it is proposed- to build will be common to a line from Oodnadatta; whatever route may subsequently be followed, the line from Katherine River to Bitter Spring3 must be .continued. That being so, I hold that we are in honour bound not to delay or interfere with the construction of the line. I admit at once that the proposal has been brought before us in a very irregular way; indeed, for the last twelve months the whole business of the Parliament has been conducted in a peculiar way. We have had a Tariff before us for twelve months, and yet it has not received legislative sanction. When we finished discussing the last Estimates, the financial year had nearly expired, and apparently we are going to have that experience again. However, I hold that we are justified in overlooking the irregularity, in the hope that the Public Works Committee will obtain for us the necessary information ; and I have sufficient confidence in the Committee to believe that that will be the case. For example, a good deal has been said about a low-level bridge. I think the Committee will find that, for all practical purposes, such a bridge will answer the traffic requirements of the Territory for a good many years. At all events, I am satisfied that if the Chief Engineer recommends a low-level bridge, we ought to be guided by his opinion, because no man in Australia has had more experience of such bridges for railway purposes over rivers where the current in flood time is much stronger and swifter than we have reason to believe it is in the Katherine. From what we have heard about the Macdonnell Ranges inside this Parliament, we might be inclined to think that they must have been the original land of Goshen. 1 shall have to wait for proof before I can believe that this is good wheat country; at any rate, in no part of Australia within the tropic of Capricorn has wheat been grown profitably. In Queensland there are some magnificent pastoral areas in the tropics, and I only hone that the Ranges will prove the wonderful country that they are represented to be. If so, the railway proposed will be eventually a means of profitably opening it up. The next section will also be common to the main route, and we might then fairly consider whether we should make a detour to the south-east, in the way at one time suggested by the honorable member for Swan. Further, when this has been settled, the railway could be carried direct south, to junction with the main line from Port Augusta. </para>

              <para>- But I was in Australia before the honorable member was born. If it is absolutely necessary that we should bind the Government not to undertake the construction of this railway until the report of the Committee has been received, it would be very easy to so provide in a few words in the Bill. That is the course I personally favour, because then the whole responsibility of proceeding with the work would rest with the Government. This railway must be constructed in order to settle the country, and in order that we may get some return from the 200 miles of railway already in existence. The sooner we discard foolish settlement experiments and develop the Territory as cattle and stock country, the better it will be for all concerned. Large meat works are on the eve of completion at Port Darwin, which is the natural -port for the Northern Territory, and every mile of railway constructed south or south-east must assist in the development of the Territory&#39;s natural resources. </para>

The right honorable member for Swan, who has had great experience in the construction of large works, will, I think, agree with me that to stop the construction of this line at the present time would mean a considerable loss to the Commonwealth. The Minister will not commence the proposed work immediately the Bill is passed. I doubt whether any large sum could be spent on the work within six months, even were parliamentary sanction given to it now. I have been informed that it is important to secure continuity of employment for the men now engaged on railway construction work in the Northern Territory. I have been told that most of the men paid the cost of travelling to the Northern Territory, and that they are a first class body. Without the prospect of continuous employment, however, they are likely to accept the first job that is offered to them, and may even leave their present work before the construction of the line to the Katherine is finished. </para>

Honorable members seem to forget that the proposal under consideration is an extension which will form part of the main transcontinental line. There will be no controversy as to route until the line has been continued southwards as far as Daly Waters. Then the representatives of Queensland will clamour for a branch connecting with the Queensland railway system, and the representatives of South Australia will urge the continuation of the line straight down. </para>

              <para>- South Australia desires that the agreement shall be carried out. The extension from the Katherine River to Bitter Springs will go within 12 miles of a good tin field. I am personally much indebted to the Secretary for External Affairs for the information which he has given me on this subject. He says that the tin mines are about 12 miles from the route of the proposed line, and that a light tramway could be made to connect them with it, or the ore could be carted to the railway. As in any case the main trunk line must run parallel with the overland telegraph line, as far south as Daly Waters, I see no good ground for the objection that has been raised to the Bill, and for the reasons that I have given I shall support the measure. </para>

            <para>. - I am in favour of continuing the railway, following the telegraph line, to a point a long way south of Bitter Springs, whence, I think, a branch should go through the Barclay Tableland to join the Queensland railway system, and another branch should be taken southwards to Alroy Station, and from there to Oodnadatta, by way of the Macdonnell Ranges. I am sorry that this discussion has arisen, not on the merits of the Bill, but on the procedure that is being followed. No doubt, the Public Works Committee Act requires the reference to the Committee of all works of this kind. The Committee must investigate these proposals, and report on them to Parliament, when it is for the House to decide whether a work referred to the Committee shall be carried out. The assurance having been given that this work will not be commenced until a favorable report has been received from the Committee, I shall not oppose the taking of action by the Government on that report, though it would be a different matter if the report were adverse. The reference of the work to the Committee is <inline font-style="italic">prim&#226;</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> evidence of the approval of the House. I understand that the Minister will not do anything until a &#39;favorable report has been received from the Committee, and, that assurance having been given, I shall support the Bill. This is not, in my opinion, an opportune time for the construction of large public works; but I am so anxious that something should be done for the development of the Northern Territory that I am in favour of the continuation of the railway. I am, of course, desirous that work shall be found for the 500 or 600 men now&#39; engaged in railway construction in the Territory, though I would not consider it justifiable to expend &#163;320,000 on an extension of the railway merely to find them employment. However, I certainly approve of this work on its merits. As to the crossing of the Katherine, I think that a low-level bridge will do for the present. I understand that the rainfall in that part of the country is about 17 inches, and, although a good deal of it comes at one time, I do not think a low-level bridge would be washed away. Certainly, I would not favour the expending of &#163;170,000 at the present time on a high-level bridge. The primary object in view is the development of the Northern Territory by giving railway communication. The Territory must be connected with the Queensland railway system, and the Commonwealth must also connect it with the South Australian railway system to keep its .bargain with that State. Of the two connexions, I think that that with the Queensland railway system should be made first. </para>

              <para>- There is no better friend to that line than I am. I was Treasurer in the Government which made the contract between the Commonwealth and South Australia, of which I approved. But one or two of the representatives of the States seem intent upon driving its friends into the camp of the enemy. The only really good country near to Port Darwin is that on the Barclay Tableland,&#34; and I would bring the line first southwards through Bitter Springs, Newcastle Waters, Anthony&#39;s Lagoon, and Alroy Station to Camooweal.

          <para class="block">Northern Territory. The building of this line will not interfere with the connexion with Oodnadatta, because, except for a distance of about 150 miles, it will be on the road to South Australia. If honorable members representing South Australian electorates expect the Commonwealth to build a railway without any regard to the poorness of the country through which it passes, they will not get my support; but I should be sorry to see anything done to prevent this railway being built, as it is part of the policy of developing the Northern Territory to open up the Barclay Tableland. The Minister can get over all the objections to the passage of this Bill by informing the House that he will not proceed with the work of construction until a favorable report is received from the Public Works Committee, and that he will consult Parliament if the report is unfavorable. </para>

			<para>- By leave. The announcement of the Prime Minister indicates what, to an outsider, seems an extraordinary state of things. He has read to us a mechanical statement of the bare facts concerning &#34;the torpedoing of a vessel when, unofficially, even the details of the occurrence have been perfectly well known for weeks past. There may have been Imperial reasons for withholding the official publication of the news, but they are beyond comprehension. If the unofficial reports be true, any proper relation of what occurred would be warmed by some of the most heroic stories of the war, and it is a pity that these stories cannot be told to the public. I am glad that the Government is taking steps to ascertain whether the details cannot be made public. In my opinion the publication of this tale of undaunted heroism, and wonderful endurance and fortitude, would make a fine and stirring recruiting appeal. I do not know why it should not be made known officially. Is the Prime Minister ;able to say why this bare official statement of the occurrence has been held back for two months? What every one has been aware of for weeks past, down to the very details, is now, in bare outline, being made known officially for the first time? </para>

        <para class="block">The effect of this amendment is to modify the amendment of the principal Act, contained in the clause as it left this Chamber, in such a way as to limit the responsibility of an agent, so far as the payment of the tax this year is concerned, by freeing him from personal liability for payment. Without committing myself as to what is to be done in subsequent years, I have to point out that since this matter must necessarily come up for review at the close of the current financial year, we shall have an opportunity, in the light of further experience, of considering whether it is advisable to insist upon the clause even in its present form. The amendment meets most, if not all, the objections to the clause that were raised in this House. </para>

          <para>. - I regret that the Prime Minister has not seen fit to further re-cast this clause, since it still contains some very objectionable features. The amendment made by the Senate will certainly limit the liability of an agent by making him responsible only in respect of those contracts into which he himself enters. It is possible, but by no means certain, that in respect of such contracts he would have some means of indemnifying himself; where he is a party to a contract, there is a greater possibility of his having money belonging to a principal out of which he may indemnify himself than there would be if he were made liable to pay income tax in respect of a contract to which he was not a party. If he has moneys within his own control belonging to the principal the clause, as amended, will enable him to protect himself. But, as I have told the Committee, 90 per cent, of the transactions in respect of particular lines and goods are the subject of contracts entered into abroad, and, under the clause as passed by us, an agent would have been liable in such cases for the payment of income tax on profits so derived. I admit that that provision has been so modified that an agent will now be liable for only those contracts which he enters into himself, unless he happens to have moneys belonging to a principal, out of which he is authorized by section 52 to make the necessary deductions in regard to contracts entered into by the principal abroad. That, of course, is subject always to the condition that he is the agent of the principal. According to section 52, moneys in the hands of an agent here are subject to certain deductions for income tax. That is quite right. But this modification by no means meets the case. Even the new clause which we are now asked to accept has the objectionable feature that it discriminates between merchants. Sixty-five per cent, of our imports are from Great Britain, and it will be a source of the gravest irritation to British merchants. It discriminates in this way : that merchants who have agents here are penalized, whereas those who have no agents here are free of the liability to which I have referred. That is very objectionable. It should be our policy to encourage importers to establish direct agencies here. Many agencies established here have been struggling for years, more particularly against American and foreign importers, so that by passing such a provision as this we shall make a serious mistake. The establishment of agencies here is frequently the forerunner of the establishment of factories in our midst. That has occurred in a number of instances which have come under my own notice. It is a great mistake, therefore, to discourage the establishment of agencies in this way. Those who have not agencies here will not be liable to the same penalties as those who have. The Prime Minister&#39;s argument is not a substantial one. He fears that if the clause were omitted altogether the revenue would suffer. As the result of inquiries from members of the mercantile community, I am convinced that the revenue will suffer whether the clause remains or not. Those who will be  subject  to the liabilities of this Bill will do away with their direct agencies here, and substitute for them peripatetic travellers, having no particular location, who will do the same class of business for them, but will not be subject to the provisions of this clause. Thus, even if the clause be passed, the evasion of taxation will be easy, while the operation of such a provision will be to our detriment, because it will mean the removal of agencies already established in Australia. </para>

				<para>.=-While I agree with the first part of this amendment of section .15 of the principal Act, relieving agents from the payment of income tax, in certain cases, I do not agree with paragraph 6. The Prime Minister is trying to tax merchants carrying on business abroad, who are earning revenue in Australia. An agent who is carrying on business for an English company is earning his money here, and paying taxation in Australia. The representative of an English firm who is only drawing a salary is also living here, and is being taxed upon his salary. In what respect is a merchant so represented here differently situated from the merchant abroad who sells his goods to a big firm in Australia ? There is no difference in the position of the two. </para>

					<para>A man who sends an agent here to sell goods for him is in exactly the same position as every other merchant abroad. What is the difference between a merchant here who imports goods from England and a representative who imports them from his manufacturer in the same country ? The agent, the representative of the manufacturer who receives a salary, and the importer, all live here and pay income tax. Why do the Government wish to tax the merchant who is not living here but who sells his goods on a margin ? The striking out of paragraph 6 would do no harm, and would meet all the difficulties that have arisen.</para>

				<para>If course it will. I would remind honorable members that this question has nothing to do with fiscalism. It is a simple question of whether we are going to have these transactions wholly concluded in London or whether they are to be concluded in Australia, through an Australian agent. Are we going to drive the agent out of business? Is the agent to reside here, to be an Australian citizen, to pay Australian taxes, and to develop an establishment of his own, or is the business to be done by a travelling agent who is not an Australian citizen, and who recognises no Australian obligations? That is the position. I. would not argue the matter if , under this proposal, only the merchant in London would be hit. But the amendment will not accomplish that. If i t be adopted the merchant in London will say, " I have no further use for my establishment in Australia, and I will close i t up."</para>

However, I have done my duty in making my position clear, and I very much regret that so little attention seems to be paid to these matters in this Chamber. What is now proposed is an unjust and senseless thing in the interests of this country. Similar legislation has been tried in other lands, and i t has always failed and been abrogated. It has been tried in New Zealand and failed; i t has been tried in South Africa and failed. In each of those countries i t has been repealed.

				<para>. - I wish to remind the Leader of the Opposition of what I have already suggested to the Committee. I pointed out that this question will have to be reconsidered when we come to impose the duty for the new year, and that, in the light of the experience we shall then have had or&#39; the operation of the amendment, we may be able to agree to a considerable modification of it. But as it now stands it can hardly be said to be objectionable, so far as agents are concerned. It has been in force in the various States for a long time, and has not produced any of the results which honorable members opposite have predicted. A similar provision is embodied in the Victorian Income Tax Act and in the New South Wales Income Tax Act. I know that commercial travellers and agents are imbued with the idea that it is something new, and that it is a provision which menaces them. As a matter of fact, it is an old provision. </para>

				<para>. - Not one word that has fallen from the Prime Minister deals with the objection raised by this side. I admitted from the beginning that so far as the immediate liability of the agent is concerned, it will be modified by the first portion of the Senate&#39;s amendment. What I took exception to, and what the honorable gentleman carefully avoided, is that part of the amendment which discriminates as between merchants. I have pointed out that the second part of the amendment will penalize merchants who have established agencies here, and those who have not been enterprising enough to do that will not be affected. The clause as proposed to be amended will unfairly tax the more enterprising man who establishes an agency in Australia. We should be anxious to encourage the establishment of agencies here, because that introduces people who must be subject to our taxation. It is said that if the provision be not agreed to the revenue will suffer ; but the tax can be evaded successfully under this provision, whilst we shall in the meantime suffer the disadvantage of the withdrawal of agencies. </para>

					<para>No , because in the meantime agencies will have been withdrawn, and the whole course of business will have been disturbed. I have no doubt that experience of the working of the provision will show the necessity for an alteration, but the damage will have been done in the meantime, and tb no purpose. I am reluctant to take up a moment's further time in discussing the matter, but when the Attorney-General, in replying to arguments from this side, deals with an entirely different question, it is very exasperating. I presume that the honorable gentleman did not hear what was said. He has said that I was consulted by him about the amendment. It is true that Mr. Garran came to see me about the amendment, and I said that the first part of i t met one of the objections raised, but as regards the other and  the more important objection—the discrimination between merchants—tha t if not met by the amendment now submitted.</para>

				<para>. - I agree that the amendment will create a discrimination which should not exist. Our business now is to provide money for the services of the State. We must obtain it from those who are; able to pay it. An income tax is the-, fairest method of obtaining money, but there should be no discrimination, and only a small exemption, if any I fear that the amendment will involve a discrimination, and that if it is interpreted strictly the result will be that those who have agents here will be compelled to pay the tax, whilst those who only send travellers here will escape it. I want both to pay. In my view the provision should be made as wide as the Tasmanian Act, under which the taxation is imposed on the business done in Tasmania without respect to who does the business. &#39;I should like the Prime Minister to redraft the whole clause on the basis of the Tasmanian provision, under which the taxation depends entirely on the income earned. </para>

					<para>No . The point is that they will not be here to pay this tax. The business will be done as usual, but the agencies themselves will have been given up. What sense • is there in hunting citizens out of the country ? The effect of this clause will be to cause firms to do away with agencies here and to have agents, residing in London, who will make periodical visits to Australia. That is what followed the passing of the New Zealand law in this respect. That law caused Australian firms doing business in New Zealand to abolish their agencies and to send from time to time travellers to the Dominion. The local agencies have been wiped out. It will thus be seen that this provision will not prevent business being done here by foreign firms, but will drive out of the country agents for such firms who are now residing here. If we could induce the Attorney-General to recognise the injustice of this provision he would quickly remedy i t , but he will not bother about the matter.</para>

					<para>Apparently the honorable member is not open to reason, he has closed his mind. I hope that this provision will be dropped. There is no sense in the Attorney-General's proposal.. It will not produce any revenue. If i t had not been tried elsewhere i t might be adopted as an experiment, but we know what has happened in South Africa and New Zealand, where the experiment has been tried and abandoned. I should not speak as I do but that I believe that a great injustice will be done under this provision to some of the best citizens of Australia, whose only crime is that they are business men and taxpayers of the Commonwealth.</para>

That object, I take it, is to enable the Government to obtain all the revenue it requires without any undue dislocation of business. I have nothing of which to complain. The objection which I raised yesterday to the clause has been fully met by the Government, and although <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> share some of the apprehensions of the right honorable member for Parramatta, I do not know that I can go to the length that he does. I do not think the Attorney-General is quite right in saying that this provision is to be found in the Victorian Act. &#39; The provision in the Victorian Act imposing income tax upon b&#34; per cent, profits is limited to goods actually sold in Victoria, whereas this clause incorporates, as being sold in Australia, goods that are not, in fact, sold here, provided their sale was brought about by an agent advertising in Australia, or through his efforts. </para>

					<para>I am not taking up an antagonistic attitude, and I claim the Attorney-General's attention. It is quite clear that under section 15 of the original Act the only thing touched is the 5 per cent.—a n artificial basis - profit upon sales actually effected in Australia. The agent is made personally responsible for the payment of income tax. I pointed out that the real objection to the section was that i t imposed on these agents for the year of assessment, which ended on the 30th June last, the obligation to pay out of their own moneys the tax upon the profits of their principals, although they might have received no money whatever from those principals. That has been rectified, and I appreciate the courtesy of the Government in attending to my objections!. But the objection now raised is of a totally different character. The amendment extends the operation of section 15. It does not impose any obligation upon the agent at all, but i t does impose an obligation upon a man who sells goods, not here, but in London. Such a man will have to pay income tax upon the sale of such goods if any advertising agent for those goods was employed by him, either on salary or commission, in Australia. That is the point. It has been argued that that would have a detrimental effect on the employment of such agents in Australia.</para>

					<para>robabl y i t would, because the agent would be paid a salary or a commission. Still that circumstance does not deprive my honorable friend's objection of much weight. This is a technical matter, and I appreciate the desire of the Prime Minister in the existing circumstances not to lose control of anything which 'he considers will be a substantial source of revenue. I should like him to have power—afte r representations have been made by people outside who may be affected by this provisions - t o make any modifications in i t that he may deem to be essential. If, however, we allow the amendment to pass in its present form he will not be vested with that power. In order that he may be clothed with i t , and that the Commissioner may be endowed with the discretion which the Prime Minister doubtless desires him to exercise, I suggest that the proposed new sub-section should be altered to read: — " Goods shall be deemed — subject to regulations made hereunder - t o be sold in Australia," That would afford the Prime Minister power, after he had heard at leisure any representations that may be made to him or to the Commissioner in the course of administering the Act, to make any desirable alterations.</para>

					<para>That would necessitate the remodelling of the entire section. But under proposed sub-section 3 goods are deemed to be sold in Australia, which, as a matter of fact, are not sold here. In this connexion, may I be permitted to point to the form in which business is frequently transacted in Australia ? In any number of cases circulars are sent round to merchants on behalf of manufacturing firms abroad. These circulars, of course, are sent out by agents in Australia. The result is that the merchant here who wishes to purchase goods which form the subject-matter of any such' circular, often cables his order direct to the principal house abroad. That order is fulfilled, the goods are sent out with the ordinary shipping documents, and the manufacturer is paid by drawing a bill on the purchaser out here and discounting that bill at his London bank. Thus we cannot get at the manufacturer at all for the reason that we never get hold of the money.</para>

					<para>u t that has nothing to do with' this transaction. The Australian merchant cables his order Home, the British manufacturer accepts i t , and sends out the goods accompanied by the invoice, bill of lading, and the ordinary shipping documents. The merchant pays for the goods by accepting a bill wliich the manufacturer discounts at his London bank. That is the way in which a vast amount of business is done here. How would the amendment operate in such circumstances? As the sale is not effected in Australia it would not come within the scope of section 15 of the Act, but i t would come under1 the proposed new sub-section, because it would be deemed to have been effected in Australia. The agent would not be under any responsibility, because he would not have received ths money, and the Government could not collect income tax for the reason that there would be nobody here to collect i t from. There may be other in stances in which an agent is employed who collects the money here, but my own opinion is that such cases are much rarer., I do not think that the Government will obtain a large amount of 'revenue from this source. At the same time, I do not wish to prevent the Prime Minister from putting this machinery in motion. I recognise that the object he has in view is to make a man who is deriving profits from his Australian trade ^ay income tax on those profits. But if the honorable gentleman is given the power which I have suggested—the newer to modify this provision by regulations - n o harm can be done.</para>

				<para>. - No doubt the insertion of the words suggested by the honorable member would make the clause more flexible. I agree with his statement that the provision in its present form might have the effect of penalizing trade carried on here by firms who have established agencies here, and of allowing other firms who conduct their business through &#34; the medium of peripatetic travellers to more or less escape taxation. There is that danger. Our object is to levy income tax on the profits on all goods sold in Australia. </para>

					<para>Quit e so. The amendment suggested by the honorable member will give the proposed new section a  flexibility which otherwise i t would not possess. I believe that the discretionary power vested in the Commissioner is in itself sufficient to give the necessary degree of flexibility without the addition of the words suggested. But I am not going to press that view, because, after all, i t will be the Commissioner who will suggest regulations, seeing that he has to administer the Act, and we must assume that he will use his powers for the purpose which the Government have in view— namely, that of obtaining revenue legitimately and without crushing industry. If the insertion of the words suggested by the honorable member will be regarded as sufficient, I shall be glad to accept them. But I say again that when we are dealing with the rate of tax for the next year I promise honorable members that they shall have an opportunity—shoul d this provision prove to be ineffective - t o review it, and to make such suggestions as the circumstances may demand. I only wish to emphasize once more that for the current year the proposed new sub-section cannot operate harshly. But in order to remove all doubts on the subject) if the power to make regulations to modify the danger to which reference has been made, will be regarded as sufficient, I am willing to accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders.

				<para>. - Whether the proposal now made will give relief or not will depend on the discretion of the Commission, which, from experience, we know is exercised for the protection of the revenue. How , the Commissioner is to discriminate between one agent and another and one class of goods and another I do not pretend to say. I am afraid that he will not do so, and that, while the suggestion now made may appear to afford relief, there will not be very much relief given under it. Perhaps it is better than nothing. The honorable member for Flinders has explained what actually takes place. The transaction is completed overseas and not here, and the proposal made may eliminate the agents of firms doing business in Australia. </para>

					<para>u t the sale is in London, and not here. The Victorian Act says there must be a sale here, and that is precisely what the Prime Minister does not propose to say. If the honorable gentleman believes that what he is proposing is merely the provision of the Victorian Act, why does he not adopt the phraseology of the Victorian section The persons chiefly concerned would be willing to accept that. They know what happens in Victoria better than does the Prime Minister or myself. The honorable member for Kooyong knows all about this matter, and says that what we propose is totally different from the Victorian Act. The fact is that this taxation is not paid in Victoria or in the other States.</para>

I repeat that this is a grossly unjust and foolish thing to do, and I cannot conceive how the honorable gentleman can entertain the proposal for a moment. Suppose income tax is payable on business transacted in London which will cost the proprietors £2,000 or £3,000. They have an agent here costing them £500. Are they going to pay this £2,000 or £3,000 in taxation for the purpose of keeping up an agency here at a cost of £500? They will not do it. They will withdraw their agent, and do their business by a traveller.</para>

				<para>.- The honorable member for Parramatta has said that honorable members of this Parliament are not giving attention to the work. They do give attention to the work, but the honorable gentleman repeats himself so often that he becomes tiresome, and honorable members cannot stay here to listen to him. I do not understand the suggestion that firms maintain agents here in order to benefit Australia. They do so because it pays them to do so, and the expenses of their agencies have to be borne by the Australian consumers of their goods. Many imported articles would be cheaper than they are but for the expenses connected with keeping up the Australian agencies for their sale. I know of one English firm that for the last thirty-five years has been represented by a paid agent in Australia who draws a very fair salary. The establishment of this agency has, in my opinion, been detrimental to Australia, because the agent acts in concert with the officials of certain State Departments with whom he is on very friendly terms, with the result that departmental supplies are kept so short that when tenders are called for fresh supplies the time allowed is so brief that only the English firms that have the goods already prepared can comply  with  the conditions. One result is to defer the manufacture in Australia of these goods. The interest shown by the honorable member for Parramatta in these agencies is remarkable, but I am afraid it is not due to the reasons he has advanced. In my opinion, all the difficulty in connexion with this matter can be met by the exercise of the ordinary discretionary power of the Income Tax Commissioner. The honorable member for Kooyong has been referred to as a good Protectionist, who is still opposed to the proposal made by the Government. I do not forget that he is also a lawyer, and must have regard for the interests of the firms of whom he is the legal representative. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to impress upon the Minister of Trade and Customs the necessity for fostering in every way our local industries. We have in Australia to-day paint manufacturers who have to compete with the imported article which is retailed to the public in tins of handy sizes. On such paint there is a duty of about ?5 per ton, but owing to certain disabilities suffered by the local manufacturers that protection is very largely removed. One of the principal constituents of mixed paint, as sold to the public, is Soya bean oil, which, being an edible oil likely to come into competition with olive oil, is subject to a duty of 2s. 6d. per gallon. The Department of Trade and Customs, with the laudable desire of encouraging the paint industry here, agreed that the duty on Soya bean oil used in the manufacture of paint should be reduced to 3d. per gallon, subject to the oil being denatured. It was found that fish oil could not be used in denaturing the Soya bean oil, since it has an offensive aroma, so that resort had to be had to linseed oil, on which there is a duty of 6d. per gallon. The Customs Department demand that the manufacturers shall pay not only a duty of 3d. per gallon on the. Soya bean oil, but the extra duty of 3d. per gallon on linseed oil used in the mixing of paint, so that there is a total duty of 9d. .per gallon to be paid on the linseed oil, which is equal to a duty of  4?d.  per gallon all round. The effect of this is that the protection of ?5 per ton enjoyed by paint manufacturers is reduced to something like 15s. per ton, so that it is impossible for local manufacturers to compete with the imported article. By way of illustration, I would point out that the Minister lately imposed a duty on the frames used in the manufacture of portmanteaux, because such frames are now being made here. That was a wise course to adopt, but it has resulted in reducing the Protection enjoyed by local leather bag-makers, so that they are entitled to receive some further consideration. The Department has considered this question of the duty on paint, and on the oils used in its manufacture; but it is, after all, the first duty of Customs officials to see that the revenue is protected, and they impose conditions - for which, of course, the Minister must be held responsible - which bear rather harshly on the local manufacturers. To those who are not deeply interested in the success of Australian industries, this may seem a small matter to bring up at the close of the session; but I would point out that the manufacture of paint is fraught with big possibilities to Australia, and that a very good article is being produced here. I ask the Minister to consider this case, and to make an effort to grant some further consideration to those engaged in the industry. </para>

				<para>.- - I suggested yesterday that the Government should make use of honorable members who are prepared to assist practically in the defence of Australia. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister who, we all know, is the present driving force of the Government, is about to visit the Old Country, I wish to emphasize this point. It seems to me that, so far, the Government have not made anything like the full use of the &#34;many in the Commonwealth who are prepared to give of their best to the country&#39;s cause. No doubt there are a number who believe of the war, as did the sports of Gordon&#39;s poem, that it is all over bar shouting, but it is not. The Government should encourage every person who is prepared to give his services to the Empire to come forward and do so, but so far there has been no such attempt; on the contrary, decided discouragement has been shown. In this morning&#39;s press we were told that the Postal Department is still going to great expense in distributing the referenda pamphlets, suggesting one of two things - that the Government have overlooked this wasteful expenditure - if so, it is time it waa stopped - or that they are not in earnest in regard to withdrawing the referenda. Possibly they are under the impression that the Legislative Councils of the States will reject the agreement, and that it will in that case be necessary to go on with, the referenda. We are told that there are tons of these pamphlets still to be sent out, and that special delivery men have been engaged for the purpose. </para>

					<para>Although I have said some severe things about the Prime Minister, I am convinced that he is as patriotic and as much an Imperialist as any man amongst us; but I am afraid when he goes to the Old Country to fulfil l f i l his mission, if he does not beforehand put in train the matter of utilizing the services of the thousands of people who are offering themselves, our war arrangements will not be carried out with all the vigour that should be put into them. I believe that the Prime Minister has a broad outlook, and that he has as loyal beliefs as any man in the Commonwealth, and that he is thorough in his Imperialism. From my point of view, and that of many thousands of citizens of Australia, we should make use of the services of every one who is prepared to offer their services to the Empire, and we should, at the same time, stop all useless expenditure.</para>

				<para>.- - I hope that the Prime Minister will have a safe trip to England and back. There is probably no one in the Commonwealth who would be able to represent us in any Imperial Council better than he will be able to do. A little while ago I raised the matter of the torpedoing of the transport <inline font-style="italic">Southland,</inline> as to which a statement has appeared in this morning&#39;s press. My complaint is that in connexion with that statement there is no account of what every one knows happened at the time. We ought to be told of the heroism that was shown by  Australians.  Every young man on that boat showed courage and discipline equal to that which would be displayed by veterans. Why cannot that fact be published ? Why is it necessary for the Government to send to Great Britain to ask if a statement which has been received here, and is creditable to the  people  of Australia, can be published ? It is unfortunate that the two statements could not have been published at the same time. What harm could there be in let ting people know that Australians volunteered to return to that boat and remained on it for forty minutes when every one thought that it was sinking, and eventually beached it? When an officer asked for volunteers, it was Australians who volunteered; it was young Australians who lined up and stood to their posts like veterans. It was a display of heroism that has never been surpassed. A little while ago there appeared in the Australian newspapers a cabled account of the British Fleet, and in the* middle of the account there was a line to the effect that some matter had been excised by order of the censors. I asked in the House whether this excision was done on the order of British or Australian censors, and the Minister for the Navy told me that he v/ould make inquiries. Next day, however, apparently as the result of my  question,  the censor allowed the deleted matter to be published, showing that it was an Australian censor who had given the order. The words censored spoke very highly of Australia and the Australians. It seems to me that a little common sense should be exercised in this matter. The other day I raised a question in regard to pensions, and the Treasurer had not the courtesy to reply. What I desired to know was this : If a mother has no means other than an old-age pension, is that pension to be deducted from the pension to which she is entitled if her son is killed at the front ? </para>

				<para>.- I regret having to occupy the time of honorable members at this hour of the session, but I am justified in doing so by reason of the non-fulfilment of certain promises made to me by the Prime Minister, and because of the unsatisfactory nature of his replies to some questions put by me. The honorable gentleman distinctly promised that certain papers would be laid on the table of the Library, more than a fortnight ago. They have not been placed there yet. He also gave replies to certain questions which I put to him, and, in view of information with which I have been furnished, I have every reason to doubt the veracity of those replies. We have had several strong Socialistic schemes initiated by him- </para>

					<para>It is all very well for honorable members representing city constituencies to say " Hear, hear." I represent the producer, and - I intend to look after his interests. I wish to show honorable members how the producer is being treated under the arrangements which have been made by the Attorney-General in regard to metals and for the transport of our wheat which the Government has at present under consideration. I quite recognise that it was necessary that something should be done in that direction. But I am very doubtful of what is going to happen in the future, and I am not too pleased when I find that all those persons who have hitherto been interested in wheat buying are offering no objections to the Prime Minister's scheme.</para>

					<para>The honorable member may not be interested in this matter, but the producer in the back country is vitally interested in i t . I desire to know the nature of the complete arrangement which has been made by the Prime Minister for the transport of our wheat. We have all seen telegrams in regard to the commissions which are to be paid, and, on account of the nature of the information with which I have been supplied in respect of other matters, I am rather dubious as to the accuracy of the statements contained in those telegrams. Then, the other night, I spoke of the export o certain alloy metals. I dealt with molybdenite, wolfram, and scheelite. I desired to see the papers which induced the Attorney-General to frame regulations prohibiting certain molybdenite from being sent out of this country.</para>

					<para>Will the honorable member mind his own business a little while? The regulations framed by the Prime Minister provided that no molybdenite should be exported from this country unless i t was of 90 per cent, grade. The honorable gentleman, when questioned on the matter, said he had no knowledge that a large quantity of molybdenite had been placed on a certain vessel, and had been taken off again, either under his own instructions or under instructions issued by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Yet I saw in the Sydney Morning Herald a letter from the Prime Minister, in reply to a letter by Mr. Scantlebury, in which he threatened what would happen if any of these minerals were held back. Mr. Scantlebury, in subsequently writing to the Sydney Morning Herald, said—</para>

				<para>The Prime Minister told the House that he was not aware of the fact that 40 or 50 tons of molybdenite, which was badly wanted in the Old Country, had been held back. It must be remembered that we are producing about two-thirds of the world's output of molybdenite.</para>

					<para>The statements were made in public, and the Prime Minister rushed into print. I read his letter in the Sydney newspapers myself, and i t is strange that he did not follow i t up with a further statement in the press of that city. There is a big demand for molybdenite, which is urgently required in the manufacture of munitions. England, France, Germany, and Belgium have been purchasing molybdenite of 80 per cent, grade. They were not concerned with whether it contained more than 21 per cent, of bismuth or tin.. Is i t not strange that the Imperial authorities cannot accept now what they were only too eager to purchase prior to the outbreak of the war ?</para>

					<para>Messrs . Dalgety and Company have been appointed sole agents for the purchase of molybdenite, wolfram, and scheelite in Australia. I contend that we ought to do all in our power to encourage the production of these metals, especially as they are so useful, not only to ourselves, but to the people of the Old Country. I have written to the Department and asked for information regarding this matter, but I cannot get it. I. pointed out the other day that the price of molybdenite in the Old Country is 120s. per unit. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Imperial authorities, has fixed its price here at 105s. per unit, or 15s. per unit less. I have no objection to that.</para>

He fixed the price in Melbourne and Sydney at 93s. lOd. a unit, which is £55 16s. 8d. per ton less than the price fixed by the Imperial authorities, which is 105s. per unit.</para>

					<para>The honorable Minister knows nothing about the subject at all, and i t is impertinent on his part tb say that in view of the experience I have had in connexion with this matter. The Minister is only displaying his own ignorance on this subject. In view of this fact am I not justified in being anxious in regard to the arrangements for handling the farmers' wheat? The producer at Wolfram Camp gets 90s. lOd. per unit under the regulations issued by the Attorney- General, and this allows Messrs. Dalgety and Company £70 16s. 8d. per ton for handling i t . The other day when I asked the Attorney-General a question on this matter he said he was quite satisfied. But he has been badly advised, and I am not satisfied that the interests of the producer are protected, nor am I satisfied with regard to the metal exchange scheme. The Minister was good enough, in connexion with an application I made in regard to Whim Creek copper, to say that it could be sent direct to the Old Country, but I know there are many others in this country who are not so fortunately situated. The Government are now establishing a monopoly here for the handling of metals, with the result that any persons producing base metals in the West cannot send them away for treatment unless they get a permit from the Attorney-General.</para>

					<para>—We have no objection to the Minister of Trade and Customs exercising complete control in regard to where the metals are sent, because we want to be sure they will go only to our people or our Allies, so that they may be used for the manufacture of our munitions. I object, however, to a monopoly being created in Melbourne and another in Sydney. The Prime Minister promised that the papers would be laid on the table of the Library, but here we are at the adjournment and we have not had an opportunity of seeing them. I resent this action very much indeed, and I hope that the Attorney-General will see that the papers are made available, so that we may ascertain whether some of the startling statements that have been made are justified or not.</para>

				<para>.- The honorable member for Melbourne Ports referred to the duty charged on oil for paint making, and has suggested that the Department is not administering the Tariff in this respect as it might be administered in the interests of Australian industries. As honorable members are aware, there are some items which have been specially placed in the Tariff for the purpose of allowing departmental by-laws to be framed to assist Australian industries, and amongst them is oil when denatured, so that it cannot be used as edible oil. I have always done the best I could to administer the Tariff in the interests of Australian industries. I shall go into the matter again, and if, while protecting the revenue I find it is possible by any amendment of the regulations to do more in this direction, I will see that it is done. The honorable member for Maribyrnong dealt the other day with the question of the admission of machine tools for assisting Australian industries. There is at the present time a very lengthy list of such tools specially provided for in the Tariff, and I will see whether it can be added to. I agree that, especially at the present juncture, we should do all that is possible to keep our industries forging ahead. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has complained that bag frames have been taken off the free list, and the explanation for that is that these frames are now being manufactured here. Honorable members may rest assured that the Tariff will be administered as far as possible in the interests of Australian industries. </para>

				<para>. - I shall bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence and the Minister for the Navy the matters connected with the Defence Department which have been referred to by the honorable members for Barrier and Maribyrnong. With regard to the pensions matter, I can assure honorable members that the questions they have raised will receive my serious consideration. Though my knowledge of human nature is somewhat extensive, I can see that it is likely to be greatly added to by the administration of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act, the Maternity Allowance Act, and the War Pensions Act. </para>

					<para>No , all wheat. Wheat for local consumption in the form of flour has to pass through the scheme. The millers and the agents have accepted the scheme, and agreed to co-operate. It is proposed to use the existing machinery of the agents, who are to be the servants of the Commonwealth . and the States. We are to have the advantage of their selling, buying, carrying, weighing and testing machinery. They are, in short, co-operating with us in every way. I am not going to say that every agent will be employed, but the intention and policy is to use every man who would have been used if the Government scheme had not been brought in.</para>

					<para>The Commonwealth and the States have no machinery for this purpose, and they must use that which already exists. There is to be a further conference on Tuesday to complete the details, and at that conference the question of the commission charges, and the agencies and extent to which they should be availed of, will be determined. The result will be published immediately. Coming to the remarks made by the honorable member for Robertson, I desire to supplement the statement which I made a day or two ago that the Government would consider the whole question of recruiting in the light of the data supplied by the war census. The War Committee, of course, use that data for the purpose of arriving at a recommendation as to what plan will be best likely to secure the maximum number of troops. As to the utilization of my honorable friend and others who are desirous of giving their services to the Empire in any capacity— I take i t he means in Australia</para>

				<para>The honorable member for Barrier raised the question of the censorship. He will not expect me to express any opinion as to the policy of the British Government in regard to it, nor can he expect me to say anything at all about the  ensorship here. I am not to be understood as supporting his strictures upon the intelligence of the censors in this country. That is a question upon which every man may exercise his own judgment. In the particular case referred to, no blame whatever can attach to the censors here. We have requested the Imperial Government to permit us to publish further details relating to the torpedoeing of the Southland. As soon as we get that permission they will be published, but not before. I come now to the remarks of the honorable member for Dampier. The honorable member, whether wittingly or not I am unable to say, put before the House a distorted and quite untrue statement of the position regarding molybdenite and scheelite.</para>

					<para>I say deliberately that not one ton - no t one hundredweight —o f molybdenite, wolfram, or scheelite has been taken off any ship by my orders. The agents, Messrs. Dalgety and Company, have under their own band stated that they have not taken off any. If they have done so without my authority they will have to put up with the consequences. I am unable to follow in detail what the honorable member says with regard to the charges, but I may state that the scale he gave is not in accordance with the charges imposed. Further, it is not true that Dalgety's have a monopoly of the buying. There is not one local agent who bought wolfram and molybdenite before the order, who cannot buy i t now. As a matter of fact, all the local buyers are now purchasing, and the schedule provides what the local agents' allowance shall be on the various fields. The scale at the Wolfram Camp in North Queensland provides for a commission to the local agent of £2 per ton. In the face of that, it is obvious that Dalgety's have not a monopoly of .buying. It is not true either that ores are restricted, as stated by the honorable member. The original standard imposed by the British Government was, with molybdenite and wolfram, as set forth in the schedule:—9 0 per cent, molybdenite, 65 per cent, wolfram, and only J per cent, bismuth. But this has now been amended. On the 29th October last I addressed a letter to Mr. Speaker, who represents the most important mining field so far as molybdenite and wolfram are concerned, in which I gave him the following information:—</para>
				</talk.start>
				<quote>
					<para>In reply to your letter of the 22nd inst. in relation to the purchase of wolfram and bismuth ore, the Attorney-General asks me to enclose a copy of a Gazette notice on the subject.</para>
					<para>Since thp date of that notice, arrangements have been made for the purchase in the same way of wolfram and molybdenite ores of a lower grade than those specified.</para>
					<para>Ores containing a greater percentage of bismuth than that specified will also be taken, and payment made for the value of the bismuth, less the cost of extraction.</para>
					<para>Mixed ores containing less than 50 per cent, of wolfram or molybdenite are not dealt with under this arrangement, and may be exported through other channels, Subject to the usual permits from the Minister of Customs. Ore which contains a larger percentage of bismuth than of wolfram would, of course, come under this head.</para>
					<para>As regards the complaint that Dalgety and Company Limited arc offering less than the local agents, you will see from the Gazette notice that there is nothing to prevent the producers from Belling to the local agents</para>
					<para>As regards the ore mentioned in Mr. Ure's letter, the analysis shows that i t may continue to be dealt with independently of the arrangement with the Imperial Government, as its percentage of- molybdenite is so low. No objection will be made to its being disposed of in the English market; but permission cannot be given for its export to America.</para>

					<para>It was done during my visit to Sydney about a month ago. I will ascertain the date and let the honorable member know presently.. As soon as the British Government requested us to requisition supplies and make arrangements for future output, we did so. But, as a result of representations made to us, we pointed out that certain of the ores produced in Australia could not be treated effectively to come under that standard. Permission has now been granted to send ores of a lower grade, to be paid for on the same basis. Ores containing a higher percentage of bismuth will also be taken, and the bismuth paid for, less the cost of its extraction. I learn that the date asked for by thc honorable member was the first week in October. There was no regulation, and there has been none, but every person has been invited by me in the press in the most public way.</para>

					<para>These pnces are fixed by the British Government. The position is as I have stated. I wish to say, for the benefit of the producers of these low-grade ores, that we are now in a position to take any ore. If it is under 60 per cent, they can find' markets in England for themselves; if it is over SO per cent, we will take it, and whether it has a higher percentage of bismuth or not now does not matter.</para>
