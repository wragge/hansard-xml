Is the newspaper statement correct, and, if so, will the Acting Prime Minister tell the House why the men are to be released, and lay on the table the papers connected with the case? </para>

If such a request was made will not the Defence Department raise an indignant protest against anything of the kind being done? </para>

                            <para>- It has been stated in the press that in the case of casualties affecting officers the news would be conveyed to relatives through some suitable channel, preferably through a clergyman, but that in the case of the rank and file it would be conveyed direct by telegraph or by special messenger. Is it intended to make an invidious distinction between officers and men in the sending of news of casualties to their relatives? If so, will the Assistant Minister Bay what is the reason for the making of such a distinction? </para>

In the case of wounded men the news is telegraphed direct to the nearest relative. </para>

                                <para>- There has just been handed to honorable members a printed newspaper slip detailing a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> in the House of Commons, I presume yesterday, concerning the operations of the Australian and other troops, particularly in the Dardanelles. Would it be possible to obtain similar information for presentation to this House a little earlier than is now the case ? Twelve days have elapsed since the incidents referred to occurred ; and we now learn of them for the first time from the mouth of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons yesterday. I am making no sort of complaint, nor do I desire to do anything to interfere with the successful carrying out of strategical operations in that part of the world. It occurs to me, however, that during the twelve days the Minister of Defence might have obtained a similar statement for communication to the House, at least as early as that made in the House of Commons by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith.</inline> I suggest that that might be done in the future, so that we may receive earlier information as to what is actually taking place. </para>

                                <para>- I think I ought to inform the House that yesterday I despatched a cable on behalf of the Government, pointing out how very keenly interested the Australian public is in the campaign, particularly that part in which the Australians are engaged. I urged, practically in the terms, and for the reasons used by the Leader of the Opposition, that efforts should be made to have such news sent to us at the earliest possible moment. I pressed the matter very strongly, and I have no doubt the Imperial Government will permit the news to come through with more expedition. </para>

Ex-President Roosevelt and other American public men have made conflicting statements on the subject, which leave us, in Australia, in considerable doubt as to the true position of America in the matter. A statement from the honorable gentleman would have the effect of clearing away any misunderstanding. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday I communicated with the Prime Minister on the subject, and have now before me the original memorandum of agreement which was entered into on the 5th November, 1914, between the Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania on behalf of their respective States. By that instrument the Commonwealth agreed to lend to the States a sum aggregating &#163;18,000,000, and the States engaged not to borrow otherwise during a period of twelve months from the date of the agreement except for renewals of existing loans falling due. It was arranged, however, that the States might sell Treasury bonds over the counter to an amount not exceeding the sales in a normal year. I cannot allow the document to go out of the possession of the Department, but any honorable member may have access to it. </para>

                        <para>- I did notice the paragraph, and I apprehend that it has reference to the general prohibition issued some time ago in regard to new flotations. No doubt there is a very excellent reason why there should be some generalized control over new- flotations at the present time. It would hardly, I think, be proper for us to protest in. this matter. The question, no doubt, was raised by the measure introduced last evening, but the manner in which capital is to be obtained is a matter with which we are not concerned. In the circumstances, I can hardly think it necessary, or even proper, to take any steps towards communicating  with  the British Government. </para>

                            <para>- There is some little difficulty about the filing of Bills and other documents at the present time. A file of Bills is provided for each honorable member ; but I notice that, as a rule, honorable members content themselves with the Bills that are laid upon the table, and scarcely use their files. My own opinion is that it would be better to do away with these Bill files altogether, and rely upon the Bills placed on the table. This would have the advantage, at any rate, of saving considerable trouble and cost in printing. As to the reports of the Inter-State Commission, I shall see whether some arrangement can be made for their filing. Yesterday the honorable member for Cook asked me a question concerning the reports laid on the table by the Public Works Committee, and suggested that there were certain plans and other documents that should have been attached to the reports; but even if that be so, we here officially know nothing about them. It is for the Public Works Committee to take the necessary steps to have such maps and documents made available. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have nothing whatever to do with the matter. The Public Works Committee were appointed by this House to inquire into certain matters referred to them by the House, and when they present a report, and the motion is made that it be printed, I merely put the question. The matter is then open for debate. </para>

                            <para>At present no men have been discharged as result of medical inspection at Broadmeadows on Saturday, 1st May, 1915. The examination was a very strict preliminary inspection, and 667 men were referred, as a result of the inspection, to a Medical Board. They found that in many cases - about 350 - the defects were very slight, and such men have been allowed to rejoin their regiments. </para>

                    <para>Of the remainder, many were found who appeared to have never been medically examined; for instance, several who were supposed to have been measured by members of the Permanent Staff were 2 inches under height, and when questioned as to where they were passed mentioned the dep&#233;t where no medical examination had taken place. Others had very marked and gross conditions, such as large hernia, bad varicose veins, and deformed feet. In addition to such cases, a considerable number of young recruits showed evidence of fatigue, and it was not considered likely they would stand the strain of active service. </para>

                <para>Mr.GLYNN (Angas) |11.19&#93;.- While fully sensible that the Attorney-General has introduced this measure purely with a view of furthering the public interest, I think that, considering that Imperial interests of great magnitude are very materially involved, and that local interests are likewise concerned, we must be excused if we carefully look into what appears to be its effect. One would naturally wish that there was more time to devote to its consideration than the circumstances of the session so far have permitted. Some two months ago a deputation attended on the Secretary of State for the Colonies, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harcourt,</inline> to remonstrate against the suggested policy of interfering with these international, or, from our point of view, external, contracts, and the answer given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harcourt</inline> indicated that it was not the desire of the Imperial Government that the risk of interfering with such contracts should be taken. One can understand this attitude when one remembers that the external trade of the United Kingdom in 1913 - and happily it has been affected, comparatively speaking, to only a small extent by the war - totalled &#163;1,404,151,000; that the trade between Austria and Germany and the Allies and America totalled about &#163;423,000,000,and that a very large part of that trade was practically commanded by the United Kingdom. The British Empire has about 26 per cent. of the world&#39;s trade. These figures should suggest to us the desirableness of not hurriedly or, if I may so put it, blindly interfering with contracts that are so directly related to our trade that we cannot clearly apprehend all the consequences that must ensue. Let us take another view of the Imperial position. The investors of the United Kingdom receive every year about &#163;200,000,000 from investments abroad of a public or a semi-public character. War, of course, does not interfere with them. </para>

                        <para>- I have an idea, but I want to be accurate. I examined the statistics some four or five months ago, and the impression of the larger figures still remains with mc. The Minister of Home Affairs knows that the largest proportion of the export trade to the continent was with Germany. As a matter of fact, before the war, Germany, I think, was one of the best consumers, if not the best consumer, of the manufactured products of the United Kingdom. These figures must give us some idea of the contractual relations which existed at the time of the war, and which would be affected if the Imperial Government and Germany were to adopt the policy that is embodied in this Bill. When interrupted, I was about to point out that, apart from this rich return from investments abroad of a public or semi -public character, and 96 per cent, of which is uninterrupted by the war, which shows what our Fleet is able to do, the United Kingdom has large investments of a business character abroad. The figures are really colossal, but for the moment I cannot recall them. All this trade largely depends on contracts and agencies, as well as on our system of international clear.ances Then again, the value of  imports  of British possessions from Germany and Austria before the war was about &#163;108,000,000. This trade, reciprocally speaking, is a beneficial trade on both sides. The figures show that it has been a very beneficial trade. I may mention that the Commonwealth trade with Germany, which, roughly speaking, probably reached the volume of &#163;15,000,000, suggested last night  by the Attorney-General, is one which, on the figures alone, indicates that we reap large benefits from it or did before the&#39; war, since the volume of. our exports to is actually greater than the volume of our imports from, Germany. That difference may be explained to some extent by the fact that there is a difference in the method of estimating values and that the final adjustments of this trade are balanced up in the United Kingdom. But, in the light of all these facts, we ought not to act too hurriedly or without a full sense of what will be the Imperial effect of the legislation we are asked to pass. Let us look for a moment at the particular industry that is touched by this measure, and which, as the Attorney-General has said, is the mineral industry. The total volume of mineral production in 1913 was &#163;25,810,000. The whole of this, of course, is not exported. If we take silver and lead, copper, tin and zinc, we find that the value of these products is &#163;10,734,000, of which tin represents &#163;1,402,000. The export proportion of these values is not all with belligerent countries. Our mineral exports, no matter to what countries the export may be, represent but a small proportion of our total exports, or, to put it more strongly, of our total production. All these exports are not affected by contracts. I wish that I were able to put the actual figures before the House, but it has been impossible to collate and check them in the time at our disposal. Broadly speaking, I think it will be found that those which I have given are correct. As a matter of law and fact, I think that the real evil to which the Attorney-General directed his statements is in relation only to contracts entered into before the war, and the operation of which by common law as well as by Statute is suspended during the war. Some local parties to these contracts may have a doubt - I do not say it is more than a doubt, even if it. is a doubt, of any importance - as to whether, if they carried on trade, or exported without regard to these contracts,, they would find themselves in a position of difficulty, because of those contracts, at the expiration of the war. It may be also that they wish to be able to enter into new contracts, and these in turn may be a source of other evils. They wish to know whether they may, as a matter of law, disregard any conditions of a contract that would prevent them exporting or selling to other than the parties to the contract. I believe they may disregard them now, but they may wish . to know whether, at the end of the war, the suspension of the contract being at an end, they would not be bound, to the parties to the existing- contract, and the fear of anything of the kind may be hampering their present operations. I think I may say that, so far as we can assist to free the hands of local contractors in cases of this character, the Opposition will be prepared to help the Attorney-General. But I think that we can show that the Bill goes far beyond that assumed necessity. It is more than a War Bill. It goes beyond the war, because it also interferes for all time with these huge contracts of the metal and other companies, seeing that it does not abrogate them merely for the purpose of freeing the minds of the contracting parties from all doubt as to their position. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I think that such an effect can be shown; but what I more particularly urge is the need to be cautious in not going beyond the limits of what clearly is necessary, until our minds are allayed by any facts the Attorney-General can bring forward as showing that &#39;necessity. It is not my place to go into the question of the contracts referred to by the Attorney-General, because I do not know sufficient of them, though the fact that the companies &#39;do not seem to have directed the attention of honorable members to their position is significant. Possibly, and very properly, they have gone to the Attorney-General  direct, seeing that he was the Minister who could give them aid by legislation, but, &#39;as a general rule, where grievances are very deep-seated, honorable members hear of them directly. 1 cannot say much upon the question ot contracts, because we cannot have the opportunity of judging whether the surmises of the Attorney-General, based oh official knowledge, are correct, though there is evidence that many of these interests are somewhat afraid of the result df this legislation ; but honorable members, such as the honorable member for Balaclava, -who has a m ore intimate knowledge of the matter, and who has a better opportunity of acquiring it than I have, will throw light upon it during the course of the debate. Nevertheless, I may be excused from showing what, apart from the Bill before us, is the position of these contracts. The question of enemy contracts is already part of the law relating to trading with the enemy, a contract being merely one instrumentality of trading; and the law books generally deal with enemy contracts under the heading of Enemy Trading. We have already legislated upon the subject of enemy trading. Our Trading with the Enemy Acts provide that imprisonment for seven years may follow conviction on an indictment for trading with the enemy, which is a very effective deterrent to such trading. Trading with the enemy has an exceedingly wide scope. It may include acts so innocuous, as a matter of fact, that one authority has described the legislation, owing to the penalties that may be imposed, as being to a large extent vindictive, which was never intended to be the case. I do not believe that there are in the law books four or five cases of prosecutions for trading with the enemy before this war broke out. In fact, I do not know that there are more than two cases. Certainly there have been very few, if any, cases of trading with the enemy of the class defined by our proclamations and Acts, because it was often found very beneficial by both nations at war to wink at what was going on, and licences to trade with the enemy were freely granted during the Crimean War and the Napoleonic wars-. We already have proclamations supported by our Trading with the Enemy Acts which cover a very wide sphere. I do not intend to go through the matters dealt with, in those proclamations, because honorable members can see them for themselves, but I wish to refer to a proclamation published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette on</inline> the 12th September, 1914, and covering part of the field embraced by the measure before us, seeing that it declares that it is against the proclamation &#34; to enter into any commercial, financial, or other contract or obligation with or for the benefit of an enemy.&#34; As I have said, part of the Bill before us is covered by an existing proclamation. There is also power given under the Trading with the Enemy Acts to the Executive, by Order in Council, to prohibit trade of  any  other class than that dealt with in the paragraph which I have just cited, although that trading might be otherwise lawful. Therefore, very wide powers are capable of being exercised under our Trading with the Enemy Acts and proclamations. Let me now deal with the definitions clause. I refer to this matter in order to show the need for caution in drafting-. In our definition of &#34; enemy subject&#34; we have defined an enemy company in terms of the Trading with the Enemy Acts, but not, unless they have been modified, in the terms of the earlier proclamations issued under those Acts. For instance, the proclamation of the 12th September, 1914, declares that in the case of incorporated bodies enemy character attaches only to those incorporated in an enemy country, which differs from the definition in the Bill before us. Apparently the draftsman has departed from the English law as laid down in a decision given in January last, and taken the definition given by the dissentient Judge, Lord Justice Buckley. According to a report of an interpretation case appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> of 23rd January last, and covering a good many matters, one answer was given by the Court as to companies. The question was: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The answer, in effect, was - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>This is a difficult question, and the Court were not unanimous. The majority decided that as a company or corporation has a legal existence apart from its shareholders or corporators, if it carries on business from a registered address here and is nominally British it is not an alien enemy. Once a corporation has been created in accordance with the requirements of British law, it is British. It was contended that to pay debts to such a company, if it consisted chiefly of alien enemy shareholders, would be to pay money for the benefit of an enemy, because the shareholders could make use of the credit thus obtained. The Court decided that this was too farfetched an argument, and as the proclamations and Acts forbidding trade with the enemy did not recognise such a company as an enemy, it must be considered according to common law a British company. Lord Justice Buckley dissented, being of opinion that such a company was so impressed with the alien enemy&#39;s stamp that the Court ought to look behind the abstract legal person of the company to see who composed it, and that the test was not, &#34; What is the company?&#34; but &#34; Of whom does it consist?&#34; </para>
                        <para class="block">It  is the test considered necessary by the dissentient Judge that we are applying;  to  our special legislation. Now, in order  to  show what the position is, let me refer to the interpretation of these Acts published some months ago by the Imperial Government for the guidance of traders, and touching on the question of contracts. On the 22nd August last the Imperial Government officially made the following announcement through the Treasury for the guidance of the public: - </para>

                    <para class="block">Of course that is subject to the qualification that it must not be a blind to communication with the enemy. </para>
                    <para>What is prohibited is trade with any firms established in hostile territory. </para>
                    <para>If a firm with head-quarters in hostile territory has a branch in neutral or British territory, trade with the branch is (apart from prohibitions in special cases) permissible, as long as the trade is <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226; fide</inline> with the branch, and no transaction with the head office is involved. </para>
                    <para>Commercial contracts entered into before war broke out with firms established in hostile territory cannot bo performed during the war, and payments under them ought not to be made to such firms during the war. Where, however, nothing remains to be done save to pay for goods already delivered or for services already rendered, there is no objection to making the payments. Whether contracts entered into before the war are suspended or terminated is a question of law which may depend on circumstances, and in cases of doubt British firms must consult their own legal advisers. </para>

The common law at Home and the Statutes go to nothing like the extent we are attempting to go here. What is the law ? I shall endeavour to sum it up in some propositions based on an article dealing with the subject of Enemy Contracts, and written by Leslie Scott in the <inline font-style="italic">Law Quarterly Review</inline> for January of last year. </para>

                    <para>The exceptions are where the contracts come to an enemy&#39;s aid and involve dealings with him and contracts that, from their character, are incapable of suspension. Such, for instance, as a partnership, which would involve continued dealings. These would generally violate the common law as well as the Statute. I would like to give one more quotation from Professor Morgan on this question of pre-war contracts, because it suggests what I have mentioned - that it is probable that there is nothing to prevent the parties to these contracts here having outside dealings or disregarding any provisions that might prevent them, during the war period, from selling or exporting to companies or persons other than the parties to the contract. In other words, the provisions with regard to exclusive dealings will be regarded as nugatory during the war. I think, of course, we must help to remove any doubts there may be in the law, and the reason I say that I believe that these contracts are no longer binding during the war, and that no action can be taken in respect to them after the war, is that to impose limits on production here would be against the principle on which trading with the enemy is prevented. It would be really strengthening the enemy by weakening ourselves, and no contract that would weaken our position could be binding for the same reason that trading with the enemy is prohibited.

                        <para>If a contract has been made prior to the outbreak of war the hostile alien is none the less an alien and unable to sue. The remedy is therefore suspended in principal until he can do so. If a contract has been completely performed, or if a <inline font-style="italic">quantum meruit</inline> is due upon it, there is no difficulty about this except for a doubt as to whether the Statute of Limitations runs against the hostile creditor. But in other cases where there still remains something more complicated than payment to be done under the contract, it would be going too far to assert broadly that all further extension is suspended. All performance which involves &#34; intercourse with enemy territory certainly is so, and since it would usually be unfair to postpone performance indefinitely, such contracts are necessarily cancelled. But there seems to be no reason to suppose that in other cases the outbreak of war of itself interposes an absolute release. In the great majority it does, but for a further reason. In that majority of cases, performance is not only suspended, but the contract is again cancelled. </para>

                    <para class="block">Dealing now with the Bill itself, I think I have endeavoured to show that it goes beyond what is necessary, because, in the first place, the common law now covers many of the matters dealt with in its clauses; and, in the second place, because its definitions are so wide that, in many cases, it must hit Imperial trading  interests  as well as our own local trading interests very severely. Let us look, for instance, at clause 3. Here it is declared that an enemy contract means any contract to which an enemy subject is a party. It does not imply that the only contracting party on one side must be an enemy subject. It may refer to one of perhaps a dozen parties on one side who is an enemy subject, and according to this clause that would be sufficient to invalidate the whole contract. That seems to be the clear effect of this particular clause. I emphasize that it does not mean necessarily that a contract should be between two persons, one of whom is an enemy person. It means that if a most diluted interest exists either by the fact&#39; that an enemy subject isa party by signature, or by having an interest in the contract, the contract is annulled. </para>

                            <para>- The question is a very pertinent one in its relation to companies, and I am inclined to think that the honorable member for Parkes is quite right. Clause 3 of the Bill declares that an enemy contract means any contract which an enemy subject is a party to, or in which an enemy subject has an interest. That, apparently, may include a company in which  an  enemy subject has an interest, as referred to by the honorable member for Parkes. So that it is not merely necessary to be  a  party, or one of several parties on one side. The mere fact that a person has any interest at all,  in  the opinion of the Attorney-General - because he has to decide a point to which I will refer later on - makes the contract an enemy contract. Clause 3 also provides that an enemy contract may mean &#34; any contract which is, or is likely to be, for the benefit of enemy subjects or of enemy trade.&#34; It is clear, then, that the matter may require very close investigation. I will now deal with the administration of the Act. The Bill provides, in effect, that an application may be made to the Attorney-General for a declaration that a contract is or is not an enemy contract within the meaning of the section, and under the Bill it is for the Attorney-General himself to decide. Is it right or expedient to leave the decision in such a complex matter as this to the unchallengeable judgment, the decision beyond appeal, of the Attorney-General ? </para>

                            <para>-  Then the interjection is irrelevant, if it does not qualify what I am stating; but may I point out, as regards the Trust Act, that the Courts have to decide ? The Attorney-General issues a fiat after the examination of certain submitted contracts. Prosecutions under that Act have to be sanctioned by the certificate of the Attorney-General. But here the whole matter, without appeal, rests with the Attorney-General. Take, for  instance,  the Snow case. I do not want to pre-judge it in any way, but it has been going on for a long time, and it must, therefore, have involved very close  inquiry  as to whether the facts justify the declaration that the parties concerned are enemy subjects, or that there has been trading with the enemy. What would be the position if the Attorney-General himself had to decide the merits of this case? The whole of the relevant facts would have to be brought before him. There might not be one-fifth of the facts that have been brought before the Court, but still even such an inquiry would take up a very large proportion of the Attorney-General&#39;s time. Apart altogether from  the wisdom of making the Attorney-General a judge in these matters- I say this without any personal reference - the proceeding is open to objection from many points of view- </para>

                            <para>- I think it should be; but I will deal with that later on. I will  now  refer to the sub-clauses themselves. These <inline font-style="italic">declare,</inline> as the common law at present provides, that contracts made during the war are void. Contracts made during the war are invalid and void, but the Bill declares that every enemy contract made before the commencement of the war is to be and to have been null and void as from the commencement of the war, as regards rights and obligations under it, except in relation to goods which have been already delivered, or acts which have been already performed. Why should we depart from the existing law and the existing, practice and policy of the United Kingdom, which is far more concerned than we are? Could we not pass a provision covering such cases as it may be necessary to cover to- remove doubt? Why should we declare contracts covering all the contractual relations affecting our external trade, and entered into before the war, to be actually void if in the opinion of the Attorney-General they are enemy contracts? That is going too far. Clause 4 is not directed expressly against enemy contracts, although it may include them; it deals with any contract. Either party to a contract to which it applies may by notice in writing to the other party terminate the contract as regards all rights and obligations relating to any future supply or delivery under the contract. The clause declares that a contract to which it applies is a contract for the sale and delivery of goods, the performance of which is by operation of law or by the terms of the contract suspended during or on account of the present war. We have already declared in sub-clause 5 of clause 3 that all such contracts are void as from the commencement of the war. Therefore, clause 4 seems to be nugatory. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has anticipated me. I was going to suggest that the clause should be made auxiliary to clause 3. There may be something to be said for it, and I am not going to suggest amendments, but I think that the Bill should be drafted to deal only with contracts in regard to which people are in doubt as to what their position will be after the war is over. This Parliament has not power to pass a measure which will cover the whole field. The greater part of the field is probably within the jurisdiction of the States, and the Attorney-General has told us that he is asking the States to pass legislation to help us in the matter. All contracts are not of Federal concern. A doubt has been thrown on some of the provisions of our Patent Acts, which give power to suspend or abrogate contracts, as not being matters of patent law. Certain contracts are within our jurisdiction: contracts relating to defence or to our specific powers, and a great many contracts relating to foreign, or, subject to section 92&#39; of the Constitution, to Inter-State trade. But in this instance it is desired to cover a field of jurisdiction of which a great part is under the control of the States, and with which we therefore can. deal only in concert with the States. I think that the Bill should be confined to enemy contracts made before the war, the suspension of which affects production or export, that is,  unduly  ties the hands of contractors here who may be in doubt as to their position. The provisions of clause 2 and sub-clause 1 of clause 3 go far  beyond  what is necessary, and should be redrafted. An application might be made to a Judge or to a Judge in chambers. The question arises whether we should not give to the agents of parties who are affected by the contracts the right to appear and to put their case. It has been decided by the British Courts that when the interest of an enemy subject is affected by an action, he has a right to defend it, a right to be heard. It is open to question that we should allow enemy contracts covering very wide areas to be annulled by the Court or by the Attorney-General without giving the parties other than the applicants the right to be heard; but the effect of the definition of such contracts as enemy contracts would be their annulment. Clause 4 should be altered to make it mainly, or more clearly if so intended, auxiliary to clause 3. I urge, too, that we should wait in this matter for the advice of the Imperial Government. We were told last night that the provisions of the measure had been telegraphed to England; but, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harcourt</inline> appears to disapprove of such legislation, and two months ago declined to give assistance by means of Imperial legislation, it behoves us, considering the tremendous Imperial interests involved, to await the opinion of the Imperial Government regarding the measure. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that people here, many thousands of miles away from the seat of war, have nearly gone mad about chasing the enemies of the country. I have read the Bill with fear and trembling. After careful study, it appears that if your wife has an uncle who is the grandson of a German born before the Flood, you are trading with the enemy. Every man who wants to be fair and square with the world, and to do justice to all, gets to be thought disloyal when struggles like the present are taking place. Even though the Attorney-General is a Labour man, I cannot regard him as an Egyptian emperor. </para>

                            <para>- Pretty nearly. It deals with matters in which you can get&#39; yourself fastened up before you know it. I was very pleased to hear the speech of the honorable member for Angas. To every question that he touches in this House, he lends a spiritual and moral dignity that exalts it. I have not been well of late, and feel hardly able to tackle such a mighty question as this, but I take the opportunity to make my protest against what is proposed. It seems to me that the Attorney-General has become so saturated with feeling against Germany and the Germans that when he takes a pinch of snuff in Melbourne the Emperor of Germany sneezes in Berlin. Par removed from the field of operations, he is making tremendous efforts to destroy the Germans. On a hundred bloodless fields like this he is trying to win his golden spurs. I wonder if a landlord who has German tenants is to be regarded as trading with the enemy. I suppose that before I know it I. shall be in gaol. Yet we have not heard a word against the capitalists who have nearly destroyed Great Britain. Why is it that Lord Kitchener is not able to send men to the front as rapidly as he ought to? It is not of men, but of ammunition that the Allies are short.&#39; I have a relative who went from the United States to Canada to enlist, and he writes to say that he has been marching up and down England until he is like a prizefighter, but they have not the ammunition to send him to the front. Why ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes; boodle. In days gone by you allowed the capitalists of Great Britain and the capitalists of Prance to organize great trusts for the building of factories in Germany. I propose to prove this statement. Contracts of this kind exist for fifty years, yet not a word has been said in the House of Commons about breaking them. Why have the Allies to depend on Canada and the United States for the supply of ammunition ? Because the banks of the British Empire have lent money, and organizing trusts have spent it in erecting ammunition factories in Germany. Time after time I have told the House that Australian gold was being used to build German <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> but I have been laughed at. I have here a  copy  of the <inline font-style="italic">New York American,</inline> of the 17th March last, an American newspaper, neither pro-British nor pro-German, though friendly to us. It has an article headed &#34; German Trusts turn Allies to United! States powder. Companies in great combination, financed partly by French and British money, now working solely to supply Kaiser&#39;s army.&#34; Why does not the Attorney-General bring in a Bill to get at the Kaiser directly, and not at a few of his subjects who do not know what to do ? I met a German the other day who said, &#34;I come here, and I make a  leetle  home, and now I amstarving.&#34; We do not wish to persecute the Germans who are here. That policy would be contrary to the history of the British Empire, which for the last 100 years has been civilized, and has been the great teacher and guide of the whole world. This is what the <inline font-style="italic">New York American</inline> has to say about the German trusts - </para>

                            <para>- I know it is not, but all these companies are in the one organization, and the trouble with the Yankees was that the. other nations would not give them a big enough &#34; cut,&#34; and, in consequence, they stood out, and to-day are saving England. My idea is that it will be better to introduce laws to provide that in future these great organizations shall be in the hands of the State for the benefit of the nation, rather than that we shall shut up some poor German because he happens to come out here and cannot make a living. </para>

                            <para>- That was stated in one newspaper, but not in a Hearst newspaper, which is always reliable. What we ought to do now is to be merciful. If we are in a great and powerful position, with, only 30,000 or 40,000 Germans, or people of German descent, in a population of 5,000,000 or 6,000,000, surely we have no cause for fear. As a rule, .Germans are not good shots, speaking from my experience of them in western America. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so, as any history of the war will show us; and we ought to be very careful that we do not now do anything that we shall regret afterwards. Let us be able to look every German in the face and say. &#34; Well, old man, I treated you like a man.&#34; We are not able, and never will be able, to make laws that will destroy efficiency. If Germany proves to be the efficient industrial producer after the war that she proved herself to be in the past, and we do not wake up and copy her, she will beat us. We cannot be rubber stamps and business men at the same time - we must be one or the other - and I hope that we will not place the proposed enormous power in the hands of the Attorney-General. Let us leave a matter of this kind to a Judge, and I am always ready to trust a British Judge, who ever tries to help the downtrodden. </para>

                        <para>. - This Bill involves a very important principle. International law provides that  certain  executory contracts, or rights under them, are suspended during war; but the Bill lays down the principle that that rule may be annulled by a Dominion of any one of the countries that may be at war. From that point the question before us is very serious. Internationally speaking,  the  Empire is the only legal personality that is known; and we are a portion of one of the large sovereign States or entities known to international law. We are asked by this Bill to claim as a Dominion, or part of the Empire, the right to pass an Act of Parliament which will abrogate a well-known and settled principle of international law. This, of course, is stripping the question of all merit and personal considerations, and strictly stating it as a matter of principle. I am not for a .moment saying that the circumstances are not such as would command sympathy, and probably justify the Ministry in their actions. The whole of the facts are known to the Ministry, and, with the complete knowledge ire their possession, they feel that, under the circumstances, the position, in regard to industries and employment in Australia r is so serious as to justify them- in departing from the well-known principles of international law, and in annulling the contract which has been suspended for the time being. We have the remarkable fact that during the progress of this great war, at least one of our enemies has practically abrogated all the rules of international law, where these rules have conflicted with his personal interests. Some of those rules were framed in councils of nations meeting together at The Hague Convention, for&#34; the special purpose of placing a &#39;more humanitarian aspect on the cruel operations of war. At the same time, although one of the enemy may be violating the rules of international law, the British Government have never taken up the attitude that this relieved Great Britain from the obligations imposed by the well-known principles of that international law. </para>

Although the British Government may have had to strain its action in various regards, the general attitude of the British nation, even in the face of violations by the enemy, has been to preserve, as far as possible, the high standard previously observed. </para>

                            <para>- And I think it is the attitude of the Australian people. After all, war is only an incident in the development of international relationships, taking the history of the world as a whole. More and more the general tendency of nations has been to lay down rules and principles for their guidance in such relationships; and though those rules, in the absence of sanction and power to enforce them, are not, strictly speaking, rules of law, the influence of The Hague Convention, and of treaties, and alliances has given them an honorable force almost equal to legality. </para>

                            <para>- Allow me first to deal with general principles. We are now asked to annul one of those principles of international law, on the ground, as implied in the Minister&#39;s statement, that the suspension of contracts is having a most serious effect on production, industries, and employment in Australia. Further, the honorable gentleman told us, by implication, that the Imperial authorities are being consulted and notified of our proposed action, and are practically acquiescing. It would appear, therefore, that from an Imperial stand-point this measure is not likely to lead to serious complications. If any action of ours did involve the Empire in serious complications, we should have to give way to Imperial considerations. But the mere fact that no protest has been made implies that our action is not likely to embarrass the Imperial authorities either now or after the war has closed. The self-governing Dominions cannot each go its own way and take conflicting action in respect of enemies of the Empire. As an integral part of the Empire our action should be uniform with that of all other portions of it.

                            <para>- Yes, to all private contracts. That is a general statement of th&#171; law as laid down by these authors. The Bill now before us is, in its scope, exceedingly wide. As a Commonwealth we are purporting to exercise our legislative powers, and consequently the first question which we must ask ourselves is, &#34; What are the powers that we profess to exercise in connexion with this Bill ?&#34; I presume that the Attorney-General has considered the fact that under section 51 of our Constitution we may enact laws dealing with trade and commerce between the different States, with external affairs, and also with defence. But in this measure we purport to take to ourselves power to annul contracts which fall into four classes. There are four classes of contracts which the Bill purports to affect, looking at it from the point of view of the parties to a contract. First, it professes to deal with all contracts made between Australian subjects and alien enemies or foreigners generally - that is to say, with people outside British Dominions. Secondly, it seeks to deal with contracts made with Australians and people residing in the British Empire chiefly in the United Kingdom, I suppose. Thirdly, it purports to affect con tracts made between persons and companies residing in the different States - that is to say, Inter-State contracts. And finally it seeks to deal with contracts made between persons or companies within a State. Now it seems to me clear that in regard to contracts falling into the first three of these classes the Commonwealth has jurisdiction. In regard to contracts in the fourth class it is possible that the position may be covered by some power of defence or some reserve power relating to the preservation of the nation in time of war. But, on the face of it, it seems to me that the Attorney-General will be well advised if he limits the  ap.plication of  the Bill to those matters which clearly fall within our legislative powers, especially as he proposes to ask the States to rely on the powers which they possess in dealing with contracts made within the States in the same way as it is proposed in this measure to deal with other contracts. </para>

It appears that one of these contracts has already been before the Court for its consideration. Consequently the matter is nbw public property, so that we can with perfect propriety discuss it here.

The policy which the Government have had to determine, and with which they now ask us to deal, is whether the serious position in which the industry in Australia finds itself is sufficient to justify us i3 abrogating the well-known principle  of  international law in regard to the suspension of contracts. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite another matter. Those who are engaged in large industries in which much capital is invested, and which give employment to a great many men, like to be assured of a continuity of operations, and consequently wish to secure a market for many year3 ahead. Without such an assurance large sums of money would not be invested in such enterprises. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, I think, was perfectly justified in looking ahead and making a contract covering an extended period. </para>

                            <para>- That clause applies to contracts entered into with an enemy. The clause before us applies to those entered into between British subjects. The Attorney-General of England referred to the possibility of further inquiries being made, and it is quite possible that since then the Board of Trade have made inquiries, and the British Government may have to come to the view that such action as we are taking here is justifiable. In conclusion, I wish to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to one defect. Clause 3 deals with executory contracts which are suspended, not with goods which have been delivered, or acts which have been performed, and are not covered by this measure, but with contracts which are to continue and be fulfilled in the future, and if a person applies to the Attorney-General to declare that any contract is an enemy contract, the Attorney-General may make the declaration. If a contract is one &#34; to which an enemy subject is a party, or in which an enemy subject has an interest, or which is or is likely to be for the benefit of enemy subjects, or of enemy trade,&#34; it is an enemy contract. </para>

                            <para>- Only contracts which are in doubt will be declared void, because no one will bother the Attorney-General about those which the statute shows are null and void; but it is in regard to those which are in doubt that argument should be heard. A settled principle of British law is that no person shall be condemned unheard, and we should even apply that principle to an enemy subject, seeing that the British law is no respecter of persons. But this Bill does not constitute the Attorney-General in these matters a Court with power to call witnesses, and swear them on oath, and conduct proceedings as a Court would. An application may be heard before him in camera in. his own chambers without reporters, or any person present other than those who make the application. One of these contracts came before a Court of primary jurisdiction in Great Britain for the purpose of getting an interpretation. It went from the single Judge in the first instance to the Court of Appeal, and the latter itself took the point that no order could properly be made in the action because the interests of German buyers were vitally affected, and they were not joined as defendants in the proceedings. This decision seemed rather extraordinary at the time, because there was doubt as to whether the defendants could be served, but no importance attaches to that point now, because it appears that the matter has been raised, and it has been shown in England that an enemy defendant can be served, not necessarily in person, but by the plaintiff taking reasonable steps to notify him that the case is to be heard. </para>

The Attorney-General will be following the lines of British justice if he makes provision, so that before taking the action of declaring a contract null and void he enables the other party to the action to be heard. </para>

                            <para>- The contract tells what the terms are, namely, that &#34;in consideration of the payment of so-and-so I agree to sell you so-and-so.&#34; But the Bill before us declares contracts void, not on their terms, but on the question of the nationality of the parties to them, and I claim that where a contract is to be declared void on the ground that a party to it is an enemy subject, the latter should be served with notice, and have the opportunity of being heard before the declaration is made. I ask the Attorney-General to keep this matter in view in the Committee stage. Let us see what are those contracts which may be avoided. One is a contract to which enemy subjects were a party. It might be a most innocent contract, for while an enemy subject is living in Australia another person may make contracts with him. There would be nothing illegal in doing that. For instance, a landlord could make a contract with a tenant for a house; a grocer could agree to supply provisions to an enemy subject resident in Australia. The terms are exceedingly wide; but, possibly, domicile would be the test of &#34; enemy subject.&#34; No matter how small might be the interest in a contract, if it is likely to benefit an enemy subject, it is to be absolutely annulled. I think the Attorney-General might look into this? matter more closely. If it turns out that there is a substantial contract between an Australian company and a German company, the suspension of which would lead to serious effects upon our industries and our production, there would be justification for what the Attorney- General is contending; but I think the clause ought to be more closely looked into, and the Bill confined to the substantial injuries which are being alleged. Clause 4 will undoubtedly want amending to show its relation to the preceding parts of the Bill. It seems to me, on the face of it, almost to merit the sweeping condemnation of the English Attorney- General. It states : - </para>

                            <para>-Yes; I find that is so. The Attorney-General is right. The notice under sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> is to terminate, on the ground that the person served has claimed suspension of the contract. Considering that the parties may be outside Australia, what provision is there for properly safeguarding the interests of persons affected? It seems tome that the section is defective in that respect. The terms are very vague, and I hope the Attorney-General will look into it with a view of giving some opportunity to these people to safeguard their interests. </para>

But, of course, some of these questions could only arise after the close of the war, and I recognise that the Bill is intended to give protection during the actual period of the war. In the circumstances, I hope that the Attorney-General will look carefully into the points that have been raised, and see if the Bill cannot he made to conform in every respect to the ordinary procedure under the tribunals that regulate the country. </para>

                        <para>.- We have heard a number of speeches from the members of the legal profession in regard to this Bill, and I think the Attorney-General is to be congratulated upon the speech he made last -night. As a nonlegal member of this House, I was deeply impressed with the position he put before us. I think, in fact, that all members who have had this matter under consideration more or less ever since the outbreak of the war must have realized that some of our industries are now in a very parlous condition, owing to the fact that Germany has for a number of years been largely dealing with our products, which we have exported to her in their raw form. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the Bill proposes to do, hut I would have been better satisfied to vote for this measure in exactly the form in which the Attorney-General has brought it down, if he had been in a position to give us the definite assurance that this legislation would meet with the full approval of the Imperial authorities. The Attorney-General last night did say that he had sent the text of the measure to England - I imagine the actual text went quite recently - that he had had considerable correspondence with the Home authorities, and that they knew exactly what we intended to do. But what the Attorney-General did not tell us was what their opinion was upon what we intended to do. I think, at a time like this, the House should be entitled to receive from the Attorney-General, without any qualification, the actual opinion which the Imperial authorities have expressed in  rega: d  to this legislation, because everybody must- admit at once that the contracts wo are now dealing with do not affect us only. They have essentially an Imperial aspect, and this legislation may be much move far-reaching in its effect than any honorable member has any idea of. The great trouble which I find in regard to the whole of this legislation is that it is general legislation intended to deal with particular cases. It would have been infinitely better if, instead of bringing down a Bill in general terms like this, the Attorney-General had satisfied himself as to the necessity for the cancellation of the contracts which, no doubt, all honorable members have in their minds, and if he had then introduced a Bill to deal with these contracts in particular. We would then have known exactly where we are, but we are now legislating in a general way about a great many things of which we have no knowledge whatever. We do not know what classes of contract - other than those which are in the mind of the Attorney-General, as shown by the specific instances he gave in his speech last night - this particular legislation may affect. My point is this : We are dealing with very extraordinary circumstances. We are bringing in what everybody will admit ,is very _ extraordinary legislation. If we brought in legislation such as this in times of peace we should be  rightly  charged with being a nation absolutely devoid of all moral sense of honour. We are now introducing general legislation to apply to all contracts, whatever their nature, existing between ourselves and enemy subjects. &#34;We all recognise the seriousness of the position from the Australian stand-point. We all recognise that it would be infinitely better if we could set the wheels of industry going once more at Broken Hill to the same extent that they were before. We all recognise that if it were possible .to cancel these contracts, and set up a new industry in Australia to deal with the raw material from Broken Hill, it would be to the national advantage. But, nevertheless, even with these particular contracts in mind, I think it would have been advisable if the Attorney-General had come down to the House with legislation dealing exclusively with them, so that we could- have argued them on their merits, rather than that he &#34;should have brought down this general legislation, which, as I say, may apply to contracts of every description. I was very much interested, in looking into the discussion which arose in the House of Commons, and to which the honorable member for Darling Downs has already referred, to observe that a case which is almost on all-fours with those with which we desire to deal waa mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hume</inline> Williams. It will be found on page 1236 of the English <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that this honorable gentleman said - </para>

                    <para>We have an almost identical condition of affairs in connexion with the operations of the Broken Hill Company, who have been asking the Imperial authorities for permission to raise the necessary capital to treat in Australia the raw product which they derive from their mines. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams</inline> went on to say - </para>

                        <para>Thereby they will give a great deal of employment to English people, both in the erection of the factory and the ultimate treatment of the product. Very rightly, however, they want -to be told that if they do that - that if they treat the contract as broken, and make these extensive arrangements to deal with their product themselves in future -  -they  will be doing the right thing. All I suggest to the House is that any contract for the future supply of goods to enemies that was in existence on the 4th August, or which may be entered into during the currency of the war, is hereby declared to bc null and void. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is what we propose to do by this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams</inline> went on to say that he could not possibly give his adherence to the proposal made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson,</inline> who desired to incorporate in the Trading with the Enemy Bill practically the very legislation which the Attorney-General now asks us to adopt. The honorable gentleman claims that there is some legal difference, at all events, between the proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> in the House of Commons and the legislation which he is submitting here. No doubt this legislation goes a very great deal further than what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> proposed. The Attorney-General proposes something more than the cancellation of all contracts which exist between Australians and enemy subjects. As I understand the matter, the word &#34; contract &#34; has in law a very wide meaning, and possibly covers a great many matters other than those which honorable members generally have&#39; in their minds in considering this kind of legislation. I see that the Attorney-General, of England, in discussing this subject, pointed out that the legislation suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> would probably apply, amongst other things, to a contract of marriage between a British subject and an enemy subject, and would render it null and void. For aught I know, the proposal now before this House might go as far as that. The Attorney-General proposes to cancel contracts existing between British subjects which have been suspended by the war. Is the honorable gentleman fully satisfied that, if that is done, all the parties to a contract which has been suspended by the war will be willing that the contract should be cancelled? </para>

                            <para>-ThatisnotwhatI was endeavouring to put to the honorable gentleman. Under clause 4, certain contracts will have been suspended during the war. I do not know what these con-&#39; tracts may be. They may include contracts, for instance, for the supply of meat during the war. These contracts may be between British subjects. One of the parties to one of these contracts may ask for the cancellation of the contract because it would be to his interest to have it cancelled, though it might, at the same time, be a most inequitable thing to do. The Attorney-General has introduced a Bill to deal with specific cases that he has in mind, and most honorable members are in accord with him up to a certain point in their desire that the wheels of our great mining industries shall continue to go round. We do not know whether this proposal will accomplish that purpose ; but I do suggest that it would be unwise to pass general legislation in this way when the object is to deal with specific cases. This might lead to the cancellation of many contracts simply because it might suit some of the parties to such contracts to have them cancelled. Our people have entered into many contracts for the supply of all sorts of perishable products from Australia, such as meat, butter, and other things. </para>

                            <para>-Iamnottalking now about contracts with Germany. I thought I had made that sufficiently plain to the honorable gentleman. I am talking of contracts between British subjects, and from the highest moral stand-point there may be every reason why such contracts should be kept alive. Scores of contracts have been made between citizens of Australia and citizens of British Possessions in other parts of the world, and those contracts have been suspended owing to the war. The Attorney-General has introduced legislation which will leave it optional with one of the parties to such a contract, because it has been suspended by the war, to come along and claim the protection of this legislation, and say that he will have nothing further to do with the contract. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I can. I cannot give the Attorney-General precise information regarding an actual contract, but there are such contracts. A man in Australia may have entered into a contract with a man in Hong Kong, five years ago, to supply meat for a term of ten years at a certain price. Now, as every one knows, the price of meat has gone up in Australia by leaps and bounds, and it would suit an Australian contractor in the position of which. I speak to claim the protection of the law and cancel the contract. But that would be a commercially dishonest thing to do. The contract has undoubtedly been suspended owing to the war, but directly the war ceases, if there is not legislation such as this, which is general in its application, it will again have full effect. </para>

It says that either party to a contract to which it applies may, by notice in writing to the other party, terminate the contract as regards all rights and obligations relating to any future supply or delivery under it; and, further, that the clause applies to any contract for the sale or delivery of goods the performance of which is, by the operation of law or by the terms of the contract, suspended, or is, or may be, by act of a party, suspended during or on account of the present war. </para>

They will say, &#34; You opened the door for this to be done.&#34; Contracts vary in a thousand different ways, and apply to every kind of buying and selling, and to other obligations, and we are asked to pass legislation in general terms which will enable contractors to do what is commercially immoral. </para>

                            <para>- Clause 3 deals with enemy contracts, which are declared null and void. About that I do not propose to express any definite and determined opinion this afternoon. Without knowing that we have the full co-operation of the Imperial Government, or that Germany has taken similar action, the wisdom of what is proposed is doubtful. I doubt whether, in the circumstances in which we stand, what is proposed is commercially moral. I wish to read a further extract from the speech of the Attorney-General of Great Britain. He is speaking of the enormous difficulties of the situation, of the wide scope of the proposal, and of the vast diversity of the contracts to which legislation might be applied, and he says - </para>

                        <para>There, again, I believe it would be possible to have useful conference and discussion, but unless I was satisfied that there was a simple rule to be laid down by an Act, which was not only fair and right, but a thing which those concerned universally accepted and regarded as what they wish, I do not see what the good would be. The real truth is that there are some people at the moment in this country who believe that their contract will not be terminated at the outbreak of war, and there are others that think the opposite. Therefore, if you have to have a rule at all, it must be one that will do justice between those two sets of people. </para>

                    <para class="block">There are two classes of contracts, and two classes of contractors. There are those, like the Broken Hill people, who desire to have their contracts terminated, and there are others who, having contracted for a long term of years, desire the opposite. What makes the real difference between them ? The class that wants to have its contracts terminated does so because of some commercial advantage which it thinks will follow, and the other class, that wishes to have its contracts continue, thinks that by their continuation after the war it will get some advantage. There are those who wish to have their contracts terminated, and those who wish their contracts to continue. The Attorney-General of England continues: - </para>

That is the position which the Attorney-General of England is putting to the House of Commons, and I have not the slightest doubt that here there is  a groat number of subsidiary contracts which hinge on the main contract. Supposing that a main contract is broken under this measure; what, I ask the Attorney-General, will become of the subsidiary contracts? </para>

What I do say is that it is quite impossible to legislate on this problem by putting new clauses into this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly there are specific cases of enemy contracts which should claim the attention of this chamber. I believe that the best thing for this Parliament to do will be to deal with these specific cases, but the view I am expressing this afternoon is that Ido not think it is a wise thing for this Parliament to introduce general legislation to meet specific cases. That is always a very dangerous thing to do. </para>

It would be infinitely better to deal with those specific cases which we really do desire to deal with, than to pass general legislation of this character, which makes it possible for contracts to be cancelled, which no honorable member has in mind, but the cancellation of which may be found advantageous to certain individuals in the community. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure the Opposition has shown every desire to assist the Government in every possible way. I have not discussed this Bill with anybody in the chamber or out of it. I simply rose to state the view that by passing clause 4 in its present form we shall be opening the door for the cancellation of scores of commercial contracts, which, perhaps, are unprofitable to carry on. We should not do that. Such a course would be commercially immoral; only commercially immoral people would take that action, and we have no right to give them legislative sanction to do it. </para>

                        <para>. - The House is indebted to the legal talent on the opposite side for the illumination which has been shed on this measure. There is, of course, the one objection which always attends an increase of illumination, and that is a widening circle of darkness. The only portion of the Bill about which I have any doubt is clause 4, which we have been told stands alone. I do not know whether the clause does stand alone, but if the Attorney-General says that it does, I think the Bill should be amended and the clause linked up with the other provisions in the measure so that it will not be competent for any one to take advantage of it in order to escape from an unprofitable contract. I hope that is not the effect of the clause; indeed it is news to me that a clause like  that can stand alone. I admit that the clause reads that way, but there is so much in legal documents that reads one way and means the reverse that I would like to have the assurance of the Attorney-General on this point. As to the general tenor of these provisions, any one who is a patriotic subject cannot be opposed to them.. We know very well the extent of German perfidy; I use the word advisedly, because if it were not for the actions of the German people there would be no need for a Bill of this character. They have so spread their tentacles throughout the world that they have control- of all forms of trade and commerce, particularly of many articles of modern manufacture. Apparently they have been able to induce leading commercial men in all parts of the world to come into their power ; they have induced them by the attractiveness of commercial combination, and its enhanced profits, to allow Germans a monopoly of trade of one form or another, until now we find that the production of many essentials, particularly in time of war, are concentrated in Germany, and that contracts throughout the world, which are factors contributing to her strength at this juncture, are to be allowed to stand. That condition ought not to obtain ; something ought to be done to sever those contracts. It is a difficult task, but this Bill seems to be one means of accomplishing it. Another vital point is as to who should be the judge of these matters. It has been said that it is not good enough to leave this responsibility to the Attorney-General. In; a matter of this kind, we require summary jurisdiction, and not the hampering procedure of forms to interfere with our protection and development of industries that, are now stifled on account of their relationship with German organizations. Therefore, the quicker these measures can be passed and carried into effect the better. I have confidence in the Attorney-General, and I am prepared to trust him. Even if this power were to be exercised by the Attorney-General of a Liberal Government, I would still say that, in the circumstances, we must act quickly. </para>

                        <para>.- &#62;io doubt this Bill is very popular with a great many people in the community, and it would be popular in this House if members on both sides were absolutely sure of one or two things. One very large question involved is - what is the Imperial position in regard to this matter? If we are not careful we may do something which will involve some part of the Empire in serious consequences, which we have no desire to bring about. Until we have from the Attorney-General some assurance, that we are acting in harmony with all that is contemplated to be done by the British Parliament it would be wise for us to stay our hands. </para>

                            <para>- If it is to be made comprehensive, there should be a safeguard inserted, so that it may not be left to the sweet will of anybody in the community to take advantage of the law. We&#39; are asked to pass legislation of a very far-reaching character. This Bill deals with trade and commerce, which, in these civilized times, has become a very complex thing throughout the world. We are now under the influence of war; our minds are more or less inflamed with certain ideas; and we are desirous of making a thrust at the foe. In such circumstances, we are not likely to take the calm and impartial view which we ought to take; and, if we are not careful, instead of doing what we desire to do, we may overreach ourselves, and do our people more commercial injury than good. I desire to compliment the Attorney-General upon the informative and interesting speech he delivered when introducing this Bill last night. It has been clear for some time that Germany was securing a great deal of the world&#39;s trade, and was getting a monopoly of some lines of production. So far as Australia is concerned, that monopoly applies particularly to those complex ores which are the product of Broken Hill and the West Coast of Tasmania. Germany was practically the only country handling these ores in certain of the processes of manufacture. What I should like to know, if this Bill be passed, is this - Is Broken Hill likely to develop by leaps and bounds, and are these ores likely to be treated in Australia within reasonable time? I am afraid it will take some time to arrive at the stage when we can treat all these ores in order to place them on the market. </para>

                            <para>- While I desire that we should deal with this Bill with reasonable despatch, I must be satisfied that it is properly considered, so that we may not find we have done something silly. We were informed last night by the Attorney-General that he had sent&#34; the text of this Bill Home, and I think we ought to be told whether he has had an answer from the Imperial authorities, indicating what view they take of it - whether they have in any way suggested that the Bill should not be proceeded with. In the absence of any information in this regard, I should be prepared to vote against the motion for the second&#39; reading, because, as members of this House, we are entitled to know the nature of any reply that may have been received from the British Government. I have no desire to cast my vote against the Bill, because I am in sympathy with a great deal that it contains. I should be only too glad to know that, if the Bill be passed, we shall see the Broken Hill Company and other great metal-producing bodies :n Australia setting the wheels of industry in motion in the way in which they have not been able to do in Australia before. Has the Attorney-General any information that he has not disclosed to the House as to how the British authorities view this Bill? </para>

                            <para>- In a matter of such magnitude, in regard to which we are acting in line throughout the Empire, we ought to know exactly how the legislation is viewed by the other Dominions. Clause 4 seems to me so wide as to possibly affect a contract between Australians. It might happen that some one in Queensland had a contract with a person in Western Australia to supply and deliver goods, and, in case of a suspension in consequence of the war, a notice might be served that it was at an end. I am quite sure that any such results are not in the mind of the Government, though, as I say, the clause seems to be wide enough to permit of them. Cannot we in some way induce the Attorney-General to safeguard this clause? According to the first part of the Bill, the Attorney-General is constituted a sort of judge as to whether contracts are enemy contracts or otherwise, but there is no such safeguard in clause 4. </para>

                            <para>- I am not opposing the Bill or urging its delay in the interests of any particular persons, but I think we ought to have some assurance on the point. It is a serious step that we are asked to take, and it is possible, unless we are very careful, that what we do may react on ourselves with boomerang effects not anticipated at the&#39; present time. Of course this is a Bill that can be discussed just as freely in Committee, practically, as on the second reading ; but I am not anxious to occupy the time of honorable members further when we reach that stage. If I cannot obtain an assurance from the Attorney-General that the Bill is not contrary to the wishes of other self-governing Dominions, I shall take every opportunity that is afforded me in Committee to hold up the measure as a protest against it. </para>

                            <para>- I am not. I have only had an opportunity to look into this Bill to-day. But, at least, I have read it, and that is a great deal more than a majority of honorable members opposite have done. They are ready to swallow anything, and then to go out and indulge in a war whoop, as if they had flattened out the enemy, when, as a matter of fact, the Bill will probably affect the Australian community adversely more than it will the enemy. This is really a serious matter, and, as I have already said, the Bill is one which naturally would be very popular at the present time. I agree with its provisions up to a certain point, but I am not going to rush in and strike a blow when I know that by deferring action for two or three days we shall probably be able to strike a much more effective blow. The speech of the Attorney-General, it is true, supplied honorable members with a great deal of information. But he cannot assure us that the Bill will be favorably viewed by other parts of the British Empire. If the measure had no international aspect - if it lacked an Imperial outlook - I would not hesitate to support it so long as the Government were prepared to accept full responsibility for it. When Parliament reassembled a short time ago honorable members upon this side of the Chamber were quite content to allow our leader to state the position which they assumed in respect of the war. </para>

                            <para>- That is an entirely different matter. The Tariff is a measure which primarily affects Australia. But the Imperial side of the question which is involved in this Bill quite overshadows its local side. The measure is one which would not be brought forward in normal times. It is quite different from a Tariff measure. I repeat that the Imperial aspect of this measure is greater than i3 its local aspect, and, consequently, I am quite justified in protesting against it. In the absence of any assurance from the Attorney-General that the Bill does not run contrary to the wishes of the self-governing Dominions--- </para>

                            <para>- I am not at all surprised. The Postmaster-General has such a large Department to control that he has no time to devote to anything else, and, consequently, I can quite excuse any lack of knowledge he may exhibit in this connexion. It is reasonable to assume that the Imperial authorities have intimated to the Commonwealth Government their views upon this question. If  it be true, as reported in the press, that a very similar Bill to that now before us was introduced in the House of Commons, but was not proceeded with because of certain questions raised at Home, then it becomes doubly necessary to carefully consider what should be our action. </para>

                    <para class="block">I take the view that, whilst retaining the good in clause 4, we may mitigate its dangerous element. The sting of the clause would he removed if it were so amended as to provide that the permission of the Attorney-General, or some competent authority, should be obtained prior to the serving of a notice of intention to annul a contract. As the clause stands, it is quite possible that firms or persons within the Commonwealth, absolutely uninjured by anything outside, might take advantage of this Bill. Unless such an amendment be made as that which I have suggested, things may be done which no one, with any sense of commercial morality, would tolerate, even in these unprecedented times. A man in Queensland might break a contract entered into with a citizen of Western Australia. </para>
