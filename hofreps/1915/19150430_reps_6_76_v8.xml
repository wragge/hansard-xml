I would not ask these questions but that I am afraid the Minister's answers are giving a wrong impression outside. The Minister said yesterday that the Defence Department were equipping and despatching all the troops required by the Imperial Government. I ask him now if it is not a fact that the Imperial Government will accept any number of troops that we can despatch and send ? </para>

                    <para>- Is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware of the fact that 12,000 members of the Australian Workers Union, numbers which were not included in the figures quoted by the honorable member for Darling Downs, have volunteered? Also that a number of those who have gone to the front, and who are not included among those described as members of unions, are men who were employed in positions which did not make them eligible for membership of trade unions? </para>

It has asked that preference shall be given to the transport of meat, as meat is the commodity that it chiefly desires. If there is an opportunity to obtain space anywhere for the export of fruit or other commodities, honorable members may rest assured that every part of Australia will get the fairest of fair deals from me. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Postmaster-General aware that the Department over which he has the honour to preside is now cutting down the payments made to those in charge of allowance post-offices in the backblocks to such an extent that many of these persons are throwing up their positions, necessitating the closing of the post-offices, and causing inconvenience to the people of the district? These offices are being reduced to the state of the London sweat shops, but there is no similar reduction in regard to city offices. I hope that the Postmaster-General will look into the matter, and will give a Christian answer to my question. </para>

                        <para>The general question of granting relief to mail contractors on account of the drought has already been given careful consideration, but it is not seen how, without inflicting a grave injustice on tenderers, and striking at the fundamental principle of public tendering for mail services, any consideration can be shown to contractors by way of increasing their subsidy during the currency of their contract. The contracts are let both in good years and in bad years, and tenderers understand that they must make provision in their tenders to meet the vicissitudes of the weather. </para>
                        <para class="block">The communication adds that the concession offered by the Department is that services may be reduced 50 per cent., with a subsidy of 25 per cent. I ask the Postmaster-General whether he is not aware that horses have to be fed, whether they make two trips a week or a trip a day ? It is impossible, at the present time, to turn them out when they are not running. I ask him to again consider the representations that have been made to him on behalf of the mail contractors. </para>

                                <para>- The Department has entered into over 5,000 mail contracts, many of which are being carried out with motor cars. Since the drought, some of the contractors have substituted motor cars for horse-drawn vehicles. Of the contractors who are still using horses, while some have to feed their horses, others are able to obtain grass. All are not in the same position. The problem with which the Department has to deal is a most difficult one. A large number of the contracts were let last December, in the middle of the drought, and the contractors knew the conditions when they ten dered. Doubtless their prices were higher than they WOuld have been under ordinary conditions. The Department does not demand a refund when seasons prove to bp  unexpectedly  good, and it would be an unsound business arrangement to increase subsidies when a bad season was being experienced. To do this would be unfair to those persons who, having calculated the probability of a bad season, had tendered at a higher price than those who succeeded in getting the contract. To increase the subsidies in the manner now proposed would cost an enormous sum of money, and could not be done in the offhand way that seems to be thought possible. </para>

Two advertisements have appeared; one calling foi applications for the position of examiner of masters and mates and ship's surveyor, and the other calling for applications for the position of surveyor. The first advertisement called for persons qualified not only to act as examiner of masters and mates, but also to deal with the rigging and safety provisions on ships' decks; that is to say, the person appointed would need to be a surveyor as well as an examiner of masters and mates. The second advertisement applied only to persons qualified to act as surveyors of ships' hulls, boilers, and engines. The advertisements related to separate offices, and not, as stated in the paragraph in the press, to one person combining two impossible positions. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that only certain of the evidence is published, and that the Commission obtained evidence confidentially. It is quite possible that some of the decisions may have been based on that evidence. I suggest that it would be advisable to await some of the Commission's detailed reports. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard nothing of it. The Government specifically states that under certain conditions, which the honorable member may consider are moral conditions, pensions may not be granted. That is statutory, and therefore it is the duty of officers to so report and so carry out the Act. If any injustice has arisen I shall be very glad of particulars; but it is my duty to protect the chief officers of my own Department and of other Departments against insinuations that they are merely censors, when they are engaged in carrying out their duties under the statutory authority of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware that the slackening of the passenger trade between England and America has resulted in any surplus of tonnage suitable for the Australian trade. As regards the present difficulty in the shipment of Australian perishable products to England, it is probable that the operation of the Imperial Order in Council requisitioning the whole of the refrigerated space in steamship lines running from here to the United Kingdom, which space will be allocated here by the Commonwealth Government. in accordance with the requirements of the several States, will considerably relieve the situation. </para>

                            <para>The English Court records covering the last quarter of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century disclose thousands of cases of persons who were fined, imprisoned, and, in many cases, transported, because they had exercised what they conceived to be their rights as free men to combine with their fellow-workmen in order to obtain decent wages and conditions. I refer the honorable member to one typical case cited by the honorable member for Barrier, who is reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Vol. LXX., page 752, as follows: - </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>I have here a pamphlet which gives an account of the arrest and trial of six men simply because they proposed to form a trade union to improve the lot of their fellow-workers. They wore agricultural labourers, and were anxious to obtain a living wage for those employed on the farms of England. They had been receiving 7s. per week, and when they were told that this rate was to be reduced to 6s. per week, they formed an association with the object of securing a wage of 10s. per week. In opposition to their scheme, placards were distributed throughout the agricultural areas of England setting forth that any one who joined the union would be sentenced to seven years' transportation. In the words of this pamphlet - "This was no idle threat; within three days of the publication of the notice George Loveless and five other labourers were arrested and lodged in Dorchester gaol." </para>
                    <para>George Loveless was not only a Labourite, but a Methodist local preacher - a fact that should appeal to the Prime Minister - " The five other labourers were James Loveless, brother to George, also a Wesleyan local preacher ; James  Hammitt  their brother-in-law ; Thomas  Standfield,  another Wesleyan local preacher ;' John Standfield, his son; and James Brine." </para>
                    <para>These men had to stand their trial because they had formed a union with the idea of raising the wages of agricultural labourers to 10s. per week. </para>

                    <para class="block">By section 3 of the original Judiciary Act 1903, the Parliament conferred on the High Court original jurisdiction in matters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation; and by the amending Judiciary Act passed last year, in all matters of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The present measure gives the Court original jurisdiction in trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. There is a broad, general reason for the passage of this measure. It is, first of all, an eminently desirable thing that the Federal Court should have jurisdiction to deal with offences against Federal laws; and, secondly, it is very desirable that the power possessed by the Attorneys-General of most of the States to submit cases direct to the Court without any preliminary commitment, should be vested in the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth also. In South Australia that power is conferred by the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1876, section 334; in Western Australia by the Criminal Code 1913, No. 28, section 579; in Queensland by the Criminal Code 1899, section 561; in Tasmania by 19 Victoria, No. 9, section 4 ; and in Victoria by the Crimes Act 1890, section 386. By those Statutes the Attorneys-General of those States are enabled to do what it is proposed to empower the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to do under clause 3 of this Bill. By clause 4, section 72 of the principal Act is to be amended in such a way as to prevent a conflict of jurisdiction and prolongation of procedure. As the section stands at present it would be possible for a person tried in the High Court to require that Court to reserve a question of law for the Full Court of the State or the Full Court of the High Court. This clause amends the law so that it will be possible to reserve such a point for the Full Court of the High Court only. It is proposed to amend clause 4 by striking out of the last line the words " the Supreme," and inserting in lieu the word "a," so that the last line in the Bill will read " if the trial was had in a Court of a State." The-reason for the alteration is that in some States indictable offences can be tried in other State Courts than the Supreme Court, for example, in a Court of Quarter Sessions. I do not wish to labour this matter. The measure that stands next on the notice-paper must be regarded as complementary to, and consequential upon, this Bill, and I ask my learned friends to look at the Bill in that light, so that we shall not be traversing the same ground twice. As this is a measure which does not appeal to members generally, but only to' those learned in the law, and deals with matters quite" familiar to the learned members for Angas and Darling Downs, I will confine myself to the reasons I have advanced in support of the Bill, and without further remark move the second reading. </para>

                        <para>. - I propose to offer no objection to the passage of this and another related Bill, but what is running in my mind is this: I understand that the Attorney-General desires to have these proposals carried into effect because of something connected with the war - that they are in reality war precautionary measures. If that  be  so, why not limit the whole of this jurisdiction to the duration of the war ? </para>

                            <para>- I looked at the section this morning, but it does  not  follow that because the power is given ve should, therefore, pass Statutes for any purpose that may not be immediately and also ultimately desirable. The Bill is, of course, a grant of power; and I anr. not disputing the right of the  Attorney-General  to introduce the legislation, but merely discussing its expediency and wisdom. While I have nothing to say a.3 to any measures the Government  mav  deem it right to pass in order to equip themselves with reserves of power in connexion with matters arising out of the war, I think it would be wiser, on the whole, to insert a clause providing for the reconsideration of all such measures when the war is over. If that were done we might very well pass all the proposals, on the statement of the Attorney-General that they are necessary to the Government during the war. </para>

                        <para>.- I suggest that the Attorney-General may possibly have to consider some measure of the sort, even after the war; and it would be just as well to look closely into what has been done in the Old Country during the last ten or fifteen years. For instance, I understand that, in the legislation at Home, there are special provisions in regard to examinations by the Crown Prosecutor, and that, to some extent, is similar ground to that covered by the Bill. </para>

                    <para>As I have already explained to the House, this Bill is complementary to the amending Judiciary Bill just dealt with, providing the necessary machinery for giving effect to the latter. Without this Procedure Bill it would be impossible for cases to be tried in the High Court, there being no machinery in regard to the qualification of jurors, the preparation of the jury panel, and so on. Hitherto the High Court has had no jurisdiction to try indictable offences; and, of course, there is no provision in the High Court Procedure Act for such trials. In regard to civil cases, section 12 of the Act provides - </para>

                    <para>The principal object of this Bill is to give statutory authority to certain Acts of the Government of the Commonwealth since the commencement of the war. It contains no important principles. Its object is really to fill up gaps that have been discovered, the most important of these being the fixing of the application of the Army Act. Under section 55 of the principal Act, when Defence Forces of the Commonwealth are called out for active service the Army Act applies, but the application of that Act is somewhat vague. It is desired to make it more definite and to put it beyond doubt' that it applies both within and without the limits of the Commonwealth. An amendment of the existing law in that respect is therefore embodied in this Bill. At the beginning of this session, we passed an Amending Defence Bill, which was designed to legalize the raising of Expeditionary Forces. At the outbreak of the war the then Government took the necessary action to raise those Forces, but there was really no complete authority in the Defence Act for that action, and an Amending Bill was therefore introduced to legalize it. Unfortunately that Bill, which was introduced at the beginning of the session, was not dated back to the commencement of the war, and therefore it became operative only as from the date on which it was assented to, which was subsequent to the raising of the Expeditionary Force despatched to New Guinea. It is desirable that we should bring these actions of our predecessors within the scope of the law, and this Bill will have that effect. Then again, under the law as it stands, no power is given to surveyors in the Department to enter upon private property to carry out certain necessary surveys. </para>

                            <para>- Not altogether. It is sometimes necessary for our surveyors to enter upon private property in the neighbourhood of defended ports in order to put in certain pegs that will enable our Forces to know exactly the radius within which they have to operate. Some trouble has arisen with regard to this matter, and in certain cases pegs so put in have been disturbed. We now desire that the Defence Department shall have statutory authority for such action. Since the commencement of the war the Department has found it necessary, as an act of justice, to adopt a certain course, although it was doubtful whether we had the legal right to do so. For instance, as I mentioned in this House a few days ago, certain men enlisted for active service under assumed names, and stated they were unmarried. After their departure for the front, however, it was discovered that they were married, and the Department has assumed the responsibility of paying for the maintenance of their wives and children a portion of the money due to them. It is contended that under the law as it stands, these men, if they returned to-morrow, could claim a refund of the money so paid unless the authority for which we ask in this Bill be given to us. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; the clause dealing with the matter dates back to 1st August. That was some three days before the declaration of war, but even then the late Government doubtless had a good idea that war would be declared, because of circumstances: of which they knew. I do not think any one will object to the action we have taken in regard to these women and children. I regret to say that a good many cases of the kind have been discovered. Another matter with which this Bill deals, relates to fines inflicted on employers for dismissing employes because of their attendance at drills as required by law. Under the law as it stands, if it be proved that a member of the Citizen Forces is dismissed from his employment because of attending drill or a camp of instruction that he is commanded' to attend, then the employer may be fined, and the fine so inflicted is paid into the consolidated revenue. The Government consider that where it is proved - and it has been proved in many cases - that a citizen soldier has been thrown out of work owing to the action of his employer in dismissing him because of the service thus rendered by him to his country, the fine imposed by the Court should be paid to the soldier who has suffered. The clause dealing with this matter provides that - </para>

                        <para>. - There is no opposition to the Bill, which is largely a validating measure. It validates among other acts some done by myself. It adds another technical arm to the Defence Force, and makes further detailed provisions which, T think, on the whole are wise. In war time authorities cannot stop to consider whether a necessary action is legal; it must be done at once. That was what we felt when war broke out. During the six weeks that we were in office, we did many things that were not strictly <inline font-style="italic">ia</inline> accordance with the law, nor consonant with the expression of fine sentiment of which we have heard so much lately When war breaks out there is no time to theorize. The duty of the authorities is to make the country safe, so far as they are able to do so, leaving all political and social obligations to be dealt with afterwards. It-is an old maxim that the safety of the State is the highest law. The Bill validates any informalities and illegalities that may have occurred during the trying period to which I refer. As to the compensation of employes who are unjustly dismissed from their employment for attending drill, I am inclined to think that the matter is best left to a Court. It is better that a magistrate should determine what compensation shall be paid than that a Minister, Labour or Liberal, whose decisions in many cases would be looked upon by the public as influenced by political or personal considerations, should have the matter left in his hands. Employers who prevent their assistants from undergoing training should be severely punished, but the Court must act at its discretion, according to the circumstances. There are cases in which the employer is not wholly to blame. </para>

                        <para>.- The provision in clause 7, that the Court may direct that the whole or any Dart of any penalty recovered from an employer for penalizing an employe for attending training is related to a provision that is already law, which enables the Court to impose penalties for this offence. I would  point  out, however, that an employe may not be injured in any way by an attempt to penalize him or prejudice him in his employment. Yet, notwithstanding, the Court is empowered to direct that the whole or any part of the penalty recovered from his employer may be paid to him.. I think that the clause should be drafted to meet the case in which it is proved that the employe has been penalized or injured, so that the magistrate may then assess reasonable compensation, and direct that it shall be paid out of the penalty recovered from the employer. To my mind, as the clause is drafted, a wider power is given than is intended to be given. Section 55 of the principal Act is to be amended by making it apply to troops on active service, whether within or without the limits of the Commonwealth. If I am not mistaken, the Imperial Army Act of 1881 applies to our troops when they are outside the limits of the Commonwealth only if there is a provision in our local legislation to permit it to do so, or if those troops are serving with Imperial troops. The amendment to which I refer is intended to give the Army Act application, whether our troops serving abroad are with the Imperial troops or not, and whether they are within or without the Commonwealth. It is an amendment that is clearly necessary. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that Imperial reservists domiciled in Australia are being paid by the Department the difference between the Imperial rates of pay and the Australian rates of pay, but, unfortunately, this practice is not being adopted with regard to Imperial reserve officers. This seems to me exceedingly unjust. The reason that the men receive the same rates of pay as the men of the Australian Forces is that they have become citizens of Australia, and have entered into our  national  life, so far as their Imperial obligations will permit, and that consequently they ought to be treated as Australians are treated. The same reasoning will apply to Imperial reserve officers. I know of a case of a second lieutenant who has taken up land in Australia, and has ;iincurred obligations in connexion with it, but who, now that he has been called away to the front, is being paid only the Imperial rate of pay, although the rank and file of the Imperial reservists receive the Australian rate of pay. </para>

                        <para>.- I have no objection to the Bill, but I draw attention to the fact that it involves retrospective legislation. I cannot see how that can be avoided in this case, however repugnant it may be to our sense of right in ordinary circumstances. Parliament must always be careful how it sanctions legislation of this kind. In this instance we are compelled to pass such legislation </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the Minister of Defence has power to take action in the case of men who have gone from the country under an assumed name, leaving the Department in ignorance of the fact that they had wives or wives and families dependent on them, and without making provision through the Department for the maintenance of their dependants. This clause, however, deals with the question of an employer who may subject an employe to certain disabilities by discharging him from employment. This employer can be brought before a Court and penalized, and portion or all of the penalty inflicted may be diverted to the employe who has suffered the injury. I am concerned as to the constitution of the Courts. I may be a little prejudiced in the matter, but it may happen that all the ordinary justices on the bench may be employers, though I do not go so far as to say that this fact would interfere with the dispensation of evenhanded justice. So long as I have the assurance that these cases will be brought before stipendiary magistrates, or before Courts where stipendiary magistrates will be on the bench, I have no objection to the clause. </para>

                        <para>. - According to the Judiciary Act the Federal jurisdiction of a Court of Summary Jurisdiction of a State shall not be judicially exercised except by a stipendiary, or police, or special magistrate, or some magistrate of the State who is specially authorized by the Governor-General to exercise such jurisdiction. That covers the point raised by the honorable member. We certainly agree that if an employer has caused loss to an employe the latter should be compensated, but the Minister should take note of the plea submitted by the honorable member for Angas that where there is no proof of loss to the employe nothing should be awarded to the latter. At present the penalty goes to the Consolidated Revenue. It is now proposed to divert whole or part of it to the employes suffering injury, but that should only take place when the employe has proved that he has sustained injury. </para>

                        <para>.- The provision not only contemplates payment to the employe for the actual injury done, but also does so in any case of attempt to penalize or prejudice the employe' in his employment. Loss is often suffered, but cannot be proved. 1 have no desire to move any amendment. The Parliamentary Draftsman, who can consider the matter more carefully, should do so; but, perhaps, the fact of this discussion having taken place will show the desirableness of not misapplying the provision and giving compensation where legal proof of suffering loss has not been sustained. </para>

The latest information should be posted here, and so made available to honorable members. Constituents who have relatives at the front often ring me up here, and at my own home, to ascertain if there is news of them. It would alleviate their fears to know that their friends had not met with disaster in battle, and even to know the worst would be better than to remain in suspense. At present, honorable members are the last to be supplied with information, and to learn the latest details have to go down town to read the news posted in front of the newspaper offices. </para>

The suggestion of the honorable member for Maribyrnong that news of a special character should be posted in this building' is a good one. It frequently happens, however, that the press cablegrams anticipate the official communication. Anything that is news should be posted for the convenience of honorable members. I do not think that it is necessary to adjourn over next week, as the House has the Estimates to finish, and the Tariff is awaiting consideration. There is no news to give in regard to the Expeditionary Forces. </para>
