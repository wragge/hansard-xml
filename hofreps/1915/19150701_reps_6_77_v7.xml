When a member founds a question on a newspaper report, it is very often difficult for me to divine what he really intends to say. I have warned the House on several occasions that questions such as this should not be asked. As a matter of fact, I do not think that questions should be founded on newspaper reports, and if the practice continues, I shall have to put a stop to it. I have allowed, as far as possible, legitimate questions for the eliciting of information, but I must prevent the asking of questions of the sort now being asked. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Postmaster-General aware that his Department is calling for tenders for carrying on the work of the West Tamworth Post Office at a salary considerably less than is now paid? Will the honorable gentleman look into the circumstances of those who are at present managing that post-office for the Department, and have been man aging it for many years, and will he take into consideration the expense to which they have been put in erecting premises specially for the Department's work? </para>

                        <para>- Has the Prime Minister read the report in the Melbourne press of a speech in which the Leader of the Opposition warned the farmers that these were days when people had to look after themselves, and he had never believed, and did not now believe, in the State fixing prices? Does the Prime Minister think it would be useless to point out to the right honorable gentleman that he should follow the noble example of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George- </para>

                        <para>- This Government has, very rightly, decided to remit the probate duties on the estates of soldiers who may die at the front. Will the Prime Minister bring this decision under the notice of the various State Governments, with the suggestion that they should take a similar course? Will he also consider the desirability of providing some central means whereby the administration of these estates may be carried out cheaply and economically? </para>

                        <para>- I should like to make a personal explanation. I understood that the only portion of private members' time that was to be taken away was the time usually devoted, on Thursdays, to dealing with private members' notices of motion, but I also understood that the usual arrangement regarding the third Thursday was not to be interfered with. Consequently when I proposed the amendment I did last Thursday I considered that I was quite within the arrangement by which this time at least was guaranteed to private members. I met with a number of interjections, and in the confusion hardly knew whether an arrangement had been made or not with the Opposition that this particular private members' time should be also sacrificed. Certainly I did not know of any arrangement. I offered then to give way if any arrangement had been made. This offer was refused. I can quite see that the Prime Minister did not intend the statement as it appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which might lead readers to believe that the time I was occupying was part of the time covered by an arrangement previously entered into. </para>

                        <para>- The Opposition Whip now supports his leader in stating there was no arrangement. I did not understand that the third Thursday was to be taken away from private members. If that had been the intention there is a proper way of doing it - by moving to take such time for Government business. The fact that the Order of the Day being called on shows it was not arranged or understood that it should be dispensed with. </para>

Probably my inexperience in these matters - this is the first time I have taken a course like this - is responsible for no notice having been given.

                        <para>- For some time past rumours have been persistently circulating in New South Wales, and are still being circulated, to the effect that a good deal of mismanagement exists at the Liverpool Camp. So serious were some of the allegations that I determined to investigate for myself, and to place the results before the members of this House. Honorable members will well understand the difficulty that lies before anyone who endeavours to obtain confirmation of these matters from the officers. My experience has been that, however well an officer may be personally known to an inquirer, immediately an attempt is made to obtain from him some definite statement regarding any complaint, he becomes as dumb as the proverbial oyster. Therefore, I sought my information elsewhere. There are in the Liverpool Camp a number of men whom I have known for many years. I have had the opportunity of judging of their veracity, and the statements I am about to make have been given to me by men whose truthfulness and sincerity I have not the slightest occasion to doubt. One of the chief causes of complaint concerns the lack of uniforms at the camp. I spoke to one man who was acting as guard. There are forty men whose duty it is to act as pickets, sentries,' and guards in and around the camp. He informed me that there were only twelve overcoats available for the use of these forty men. I saw some of the overcoats. They were a disgrace to the Department, and, in my opinion, would have been rejected by any decent old clothes purchaser. I asked my informant whether it was a fact that all the men wore these coats at different times. He replied' that most of them did, though some men wore their own coats in preference to military overcoats which had been worn by men some of whom had been sent to hospital suffering from various complaints. </para>

                        <para>- I paid a visit to the German concentration camp, and found that every statement that had been made to me in regard to it was correct. There are 1,300 prisoners interned there, and every man is provided with a new, warm overcoat. What is more, there is a surplus stock in the racks waiting for other prisoners who may be sent there. The lack of uniforms at the Liverpool Military Camp is general. Some men who have been in camp for two months have had only the clothes they were wearing at the time they enlisted. They have been training and doing the ordinary work of the camp in these clothes, with the result that their garments have speedily become almost unfit to wear. I was assured that many of these young fellows had been unable to go home to say farewell to their parents or .friends, because they could not appear before them* decently clad. One man assured me that ho had spent nearly <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> on clothes which he had been compelled to wear since he had gone into camp. He had been there over two months. </para>

                        <para>- I should have said that he had been in camp for four months. At the Redfern railway station, a few weeks ago, I met a young fellow whom I have known for some years, and who told me that he was leaving for the front with the 13th Regiment two days later. When I inquired why he was not in uniform he said, " I have no uniform, but we have been told that uniforms will be issued on the morning of the day upon which we embark." He told me that he had been in camp six weeks, that he had never handled a rifle in his life before he enlisted, and that he had not undergone any rifle practice since he had been in camp. No ammunition, he said, was available at the butts, and no blank cartridge was obtainable to demonstrate to the men how to fill the magazines of their rifles. This young fellow told me further that there were only thirty rifles available for 500 men for training purposes, and that they were of an obsolete pattern, so that any instruction given to the men regarding the use of them would be valueless when they received the Lithgow rifles. That statement was confirmed by scores of men upon my visit to the camp. Men also told me that some of the rifles coming from Lithgow are defective, inasmuch as the screws attached to the " sights," which regulate the distance you desire to shoot at, were becoming detached and lost, thus making one of the most important sections of the rifle quite useless. This lack of rifle practice constitutes the  gravest  charge against the military authorities. I am bringing forward this matter, not in any party spirit, but in the interests of the men themselves. It is almost criminal to send away these boys before they have received the necessary rifle practice. In all probability the authorities will say that they will obtain the necessary practice when they' reach Egypt. </para>

                        <para>- A lot of these troops are now leaving as reinforcements, and if they are to be useful as reinforcements they will not be able to stop at Egypt, but must go direct to the front. One of my complaints is that there have been sent away as reinforcements men who have been in camp at Liverpool for only a week. If the authorities wish to send seasoned men - or men who have had some degree of practice - as reinforcements, why should they not select those who have been longest in camp, and who have had some training, instead of calling for volunteers from men who have been in camp for only a few days? Continuing my investigations, I found that the huts which are being erected for the men a Liverpool, while a big improvement in many respects on the tents, are really no improvement in the direction of conserving health. They are too draughty. The floors of these huts, which are laid on brick piers, have a space of from 1 foot to 2 feet beneath them, and since they are laid down in sections, openings arc left through which the draught comes up. The men are provided only with a waterproof sheet and three blankets for bedding, so that honorable members can understand the discomfort which they suffer and the liability to catch cold under which they labour. Fogs are very prevalent at Liverpool and colds are common. The principal sickness amongst the men consists of chest and throat troubles. These huts do not protect them from such complaints. The men in their spare time are filling in the openings in their huts in order to try to keep out the draught Hundreds of cases of pneumonia and kindred complaints have gone through the hospital, and numerous deaths have resulted. I would earnestly suggest to the Department the necessity of supplying the men in camp with mattresses. Straw is cheap enough, and straw mattresses would add to the comfort and protection of the men. I do not suggest that our soldiers in the making should be pampered and coddled, but we must take into consideration the fact that many of the men in camp have gone there direct from good homes, and that they have never had to rough it. One of the first considerations of the Government should be to insure the health of the troops. These men at Liverpool Camp at present are not receiving the consideration they deserve. Owing to the draughty character of the huts those occupying them are liable to catch cold even more readily than would be the case if they were under canvas. Considering the hardships and suffering which lie before them, we should at least make our lads decently comfortable while they are learning the work of a soldier. Each of these huts is occupied by forty-six men, and I find that no provision is made in them for the storage of bread. Bread is issued every night, and lies exposed in the huts all night, without even a partition between the bread and the men who are sleeping there. The Government should consider the desirableness of applying to our military camps some of the provisions that the various State Governments apply to ordinary employers of labour, to protect the well-being of their men. I ask the House to consider the difference between the treatment of the Germans at the concentration camp and our men at Liverpool. I found that those interned at the German concentration camp had everything possible to make them comfortable. They had straw mattresses and decent bunks, whereas our men at the Liverpool Military Camp say anything apparently is good enough for them. They say, " We are treated not like men, but like dogs." </para>

A want of system also prevails in connexion with the hospital arrangements. It is said that men are asked to line up at 6.45 in the morning, and if they are not in the ranks at that hour they cannot be seen again, by a medical man until evening, they being called upon to do their ordinary duties during the day. It is quite common for men to be lined up for an hour and a half or two hours waiting for the doctors to examine them, and this in wet weather, when the men have only their dungarees on. The result is that men, when they are admitted to the hospital, are in an infinitely worse condition than when they first applied. </para>

                        <para>- What I am doing is for the best; and I earnestly suggest that one of the huts should be lined and placed near the hospital, in order to afford the men some protection when they are seeking medical aid. This would be an innovation highly appreciated by every man; and I feel confident that it would prevent a good deal of sickness. When a man is not sick enough to go into hospital, and is given a prescription, the first thing the chemist asks is, " Where is your bottle ?" Naturally, the man replies that he has no bottle; and he is then informed that he cannot have any medicine until he produces one. Just imagine asking men, who are offering their services and their lives, to have the forethought to provide themselves with medicine bottles in case they should become sick ! All the details mentioned are such as should be attended to, in the interests of the men themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I understand they are brothers. I say that the presence of this doctor in the hospital is an insult to the people of Australia, and an outrage on those boys who are freely offering their lives in this time of the Empire's need, and he ought not to be permitted to remain there one moment longer. We have plenty of fully-equipped Australian doctors, and some of these ought to be placed in charge. I should now like to refer to the matter of the horses. Last week I asked the Assistant Minister of Defence a question in regard to 1,200 horses having been left at the Liverpool Remount Depot without feed, and the honorable gentleman practically admitted the fact. Here we have horses - a living asset of £30,000 - left without feed. At Liverpool the horses are tied in an enclosure, the ground of which is as bare as the floor of this chamber. The animals receive a few  handfuls  of feed per day, but as no nose-bags are available, these have to be improvised. Until very recently there were no halters, and I was informed, on reliable authority, that some horses had to be tied up with string. </para>

                        <para>- This is a serious question, and is not a subject for unseemly levity. The men of the 12th Light Horse, who left recently, were compelled, after asking in vain for halters, to purchase some out of the money privately subscribed to provide comforts for the troops; and they had difficulty in getting a refund. At the same time, I am informed that at the Ordnance Department there are halters galore, and that their non-supply is all due to red-tape, with which the place is reeking. It does not seem to matter how urgent the need, weeks may elapse before it is supplied. In order to show how wasteful the Department can be in some directions and penurious in others, I may point out that, though a water main passes within a few yard's of one hospital, and could be connected with the institution at a cost of about <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> the authorities have been paying a contractor 15s. a day for months past to cart water to this hospital. They can waste money in this direction, but they have no money to spare in order to provide medicine bottles for the troops. I have a few further facts which I would like to bring before the House if honorable members will grant me permission. </para>

                        <para>- Both camps are at Liverpool. I must confess that I can speak in the highest terms of the excellent management of the concentration camp. There are brains behind it. The sleeping arrangements are infinitely better than those provided in the military camp. Whereas in the military camp the men sleep in enclosed huts, the huts in the concentration camp are open to the north, and waterproof blinds are provided, which are dropped at night and rolled up during the day", allowing the sun and air to heat and ventilate the huts. In the concentration camp the prisoners are allowed to use the floors of the huts as places on which to have their meals. Quite properly, at the military camp the authorities will not permit the men to have their meals in their tents, but this means that the men have to get outside their tents and eat where they can in all sorts of weather. At the German concentration camp there is a better system of serving meals. The meals are served on the principle of a sheep race, and I saw 1,300 men served in fourteen minutes, each man getting his food steaming hot. The system is not so good at the military camp; neither is the cooking. I earnestly commend to the Minister the desirability of sending an officer to copy some of the innovations made at the concentration camp. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care who has been responsible for inaugurating those arrangements at the German camp. The ideas are very good, and they should be copied. The system of distributing the food is excellent. The huts are built of fibro-cement ; a hut to hold 110 men costs £184, whereas at the military camp a hut to hold forty-six men costs £250, and is not nearly so effective or healthy. Before the authorities erect any mora huts at the military camp they should certainly go to the concentration camp, and take a leaf out of the books of the authorities there. As an Australian, I felt my blood boil when I went to Liverpool and found that our own men were suffering disadvantages,- while men were living in the concentration camp in comparative luxury at our expense. </para>

The correspondence shows that British prisoners, with a few notable exceptions, have been treated with studied cruelty. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey quotes a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Vandeleur</inline> (1st Cameronians), who escaped from Crefeld, after being taken prisoner. The major stated, on the authority of a French priest : - " The German soldiers kick the British prisoners in the stomach, and break their guns over their backs. They force them to sleep out in marshy places, so that many are now consumptive. The British are almost starved, and such have been their tortures that thirty of them asked to be shot." </para>
                <para>Describing his own experience, the major wrote : - " All along the line we were cursed by officers and soldiers alike at the various stations, and at Mons Bergen I was pulled out in front of the waggon by the order of the officer in charge or the station, and, after cursing me in filthy language for some ten minutes, he ordered one of his soldiers to kick me back into the waggon, which he did, sending me sprawling into the filthy mess at the bottom of the waggon." </para>

                        <para>- Notwithstanding the Minister's interjection as to my statement being scandalous, it is the truth. Then another complaint concerns the officers who have volunteered for the front. Many of these men are giving up excellent positions in order to discharge their duty to the Empire, many of them are making great sacrifices by enlisting. We all know the type that they represent. They have proved their worth on the heights of Gallipoli. The officers of whom I speak are about to take the places of officers who have sacrificed their lives there, and who, by their fearless daring and dash - assisted by their gallant men - have made one of the most glorious pages in the eventful history of our Empire. The officers who are about to go to the front are men who have been engaged in various professions and businesses, and naturally a good many details in connexion with their private affairs require to be attended to before they leave Australia. It has been generally understood that the military authorities have been in the habit of allowing them ample time to complete these arrangements. But recently an order was issued under which these officers are required to appear at 10 o'clock in the morning before the Commanding Officer at the Camp, and to state their reasons for desiring leave. If the reasons advanced are satisfactory, passes are issued under which they are permitted to leave the Camp. But at the gates they are stopped by a sentry who examines their passes before they are allowed to proceed. On reaching the bridge, another sentry is encountered, and the same procedure is. repeated. On the day of my visit to the Camp an officer chanced to be leaving it in a cab, with the result that nearly the whole of the traffic on the road was hung up whilst his pass was -being examined. I do not say that the precaution is altogether unnecessary from a military point of view, but considering that these men have big private interests, I think that more latitude should be allowed them to arrange their private affairs. By adopting the password a good deal of the existing friction in respect of officers' leave might be avoided.  My investigations have convinced me that some very great change is necessary if we desire to make our military machine an effective one. I am sure that one of the causes of dissatisfaction in the Liverpool Camp arises from the evil of centralization. I am assured that it is necessary  to send to head-quarters in Melbourne for official confirmation of everything that is done at the Camp. The officers dare not act without that official confirmation. In his report last year General Ian Hamilton predicted that this would be the case if war ever broke out. He expressed his -opinion in very strong terms, as will be seen by reference to paragraph 73, at page 25 of his report - </para>

                <para>Actually, the Australian system, as it exists to-day, is so purely a product -of peace procedure that it could not hope to carry on beyond ' the first few weeks of war. The centralization in the Defence Department at Melbourne exceeds anything I have experienced during more than forty years' service in India, in the United Kingdom, and in every part of the world where troops administered by the British War Office are stationed. That this centralization is due wholly to  the  existing system of financial control I am not prepared to assert; but, unquestionably, it is on financial grounds that the present mass of petty questions, which in a well-ordered business would be dealt with locally, are now referred from districts to head-quarters. Hence an inevitable tendency to centralize in other brandies of work. Hence* also, an increasing unwillingness on the part of officers to act on their own responsibility. Hence, again, a real danger that, in course of time, the spirit of initiative throughout the Army may suffer. Hence, finally, the most fruitful cause of disaster in time of war - namely, the collapse of the officer trained for many years to be frightened to death of a sixpence when he is suddenly called upon to decide a matter in which thousands of pounds may be involved. </para>
                <para class="block">That prediction is being verified to-day. I am of opinion that many of our high officers, as the result of living for years in an atmosphere of red-tape, have become absolutely incompetent to deal with the present position. It is only too true that men who have been long accustomed to such an atmosphere fail to utilize their full powers of initiative. Whether the security of Government positions induces mental laziness, or whether there is some peculiar germ in the atmosphere of red tape which results in a kind of sleeping sickness, I cannot say. But I' am justified in affirming that our military system is suffering from what may be termed- "the blight of the official mind, which  sits  'u'pon the service like a frost, and which nips the most promising shoots of originality in the bud. This blight is' cementing the whole of the service into a hard, inelastic mass, which is incapable of initiative or original thought. The Minister of Defence has a unique opportunity at the present time, but he is hampered - as anybody else in his position would be hampered - if he does not possess the courage to break the bonds which bind the service as effectively as Gulliver was ever bound by the Lilliputians. I am quite prepared to accept full responsibility for my action to-day. Nobody regrets more than I do the necessity for bringing these matters before tha </para>
                <para class="block">House. But honorable members talk about recruiting. With the knowledge I possess as the result of my visits to the Liverpool Camp, how can I conscientiously go on the public platform and advise people to send their sons to the front? If my own son were of age, I would have to seriously consider the wisdom of allowing him to enter the Liverpool Camp unless some better conditions are substituted for those at present existing. </para>

                    <para>.- I have only a few words to say on this motion, but at the outset I wish to express my impatience at the exclamations with which honorable members opposite greet any honorable member on this side who endeavours to bring about some improvement of a condition of things that is notorious regarding the' training and equipment of our Expeditionary Forces. Speaking for myself, I have during recent months had to exercise a very considerable degree of self-restraint indeed, because I did not wish even to suggest anything which might discourage recruiting, or interfere with the work which I was' hoping that the Minister of 'Defence and the Assistant Minister were performing to remedy shortcomings so notorious. The honorable member has referred to conditions prevailing at the Liverpool Camp, but they are not confined to that camp. I have been for many months in close touch with both officers and privates of "the Expeditionary Forces of this </para>

                <para class="block">State, and if only a tithe of what they inform me is correct, some very radical change is required at head-quarters. I do not know how it is, but the Defence Department seems to be considerably lacking in ordinary horse-sense. Things are done which make one's blood boil, and are repeated again and again until one wonders where we have obtained the men who have control of these matters. I have a very high personal regard for the Minister of Defence. I do not care to criticise him too harshly in the circumstances. Again, in this connexion I deprecate the cry which is heard from the Government benches, whenever any matter connected with the Defence Department is discussed, that we should not blame the Minister, but some one else. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> appears to be sacrosanct in the opinion of honorable members opposite. I know that he has been kept well to the front as an ideal Labour Minister. I am aware that he has achieved a high reputation in this respect merely by leaving himself almost entirely in the hands of his officers, and speaking such words as they have instructed him to speak. Knowing the Minister of Defence well, I say deliberately that he is almost the last man of "the party opposite who ought to be in charge of the Defence Department at the present time. </para>

I was going to say that, in regard to the reforms that have been suggested by the honorable member for Nepean at the Liverpool Military Camp, and which are equally necessary at other camps, if the Minister of Defence had the necessary power of initiative  which  we have a right to expect in the occupant pf his office, many of those reforms would have been achieved long ago.

                        <para>- Very well. I want to revert to the question of the reforms that are necessary at the Liverpool Camp. I say that we require, in regard to the improvements that have been sought, and have not yet been achieved, the assistance, at least, of the permanent Secretary of the Defence Department, instead of having him away in the remote islands of the South Seas. I suggest to the Assistant Minister that, in consultation with the Minister of Defence, they should consider, not only the questions brought up by the honorable member for Nepean, but the method by which the improvements he looks for can be accomplished. It is only from head-quarters that the necessary initiative can proceed, and I contend that we have a perfect right to look for that initiative from that source.  </para>

While there, he sent for the State Commandant in order to ascertain from the lips of that officer how everything was going on there. The Commandant assured the Minister that everything was going on in a satisfactory way at the Liverpool Camp. </para>

                        <para>- I will. I make the right honorable gentleman that promise. I do not want anything to be kept in the dark. The Government want everything to come out, and they desire to do the right thing. This matter has been sprung on me quite unexpectedly. I had no notice of it, although I accept the assurance of the honorable member for Nepean that this was unintentional. ' The Minister has told me over the telephone within the last half-hour that while in Sydney he made it his special business to inquire into everything in New South Wales, and especially in regard to the Liverpool Camp. He says he was not informed of any shortage of uniforms, or anything else in that camp. I told him of the main complaints made by the honorable member in the earlier portion of his speech, and he says- that the reports he has received from the Commandant of New South Wales do not bear out the honorable member's accusations. I shall have the honorable member's speech posted to the Commandant, and ask for a report on it. </para>

                        <para>- At any time the honorable member likes. The Minister says he has been assured by the Commandant that there is no shortage in New South Wales of uniforms or anything else; but it must be borne in mind that every recruit at the Liverpool Camp has not got a uniform, and many of them have to wait for them until a week or perhaps even two or three days before they embark. That is quite true; but I would point out that every woollen factory in Australia is going at top speed in order bo mako cloth. </para>

                        <para>- If- they like to stand aloof and refuse to do the work, except on their own terms, that is their own look out. As soon as we get a roll of material from a woollen factory, it goes straight into the clothing department, to be made into uniforms. There is no delay whatever, and we cannot do more than- we are doing as regards the turning out of uniforms. I assure the House that the troops and the recruits in the camps get the first call in connexion with uniforms, and everything else. The honorable member inferred by his speech that the interned Germans were getting better treatment than our own troops. That is absolutely untrue. </para>

He has the right to buy straw to lie on if he needs it. The honorable member for Parkes laughs, but let me assure the honorable member that the interned Germans are buying themselves; nearly everything they are getting out of the ls. a day that they receive, and perhaps that accounts for the things which the honorable member for Nepean says they are getting over and above what our own troops receive. </para>

                        <para>- That is not general. The Minister will not admit such a thing. It must be remembered that nearly every soldier in the firing line had three or four months' experience in Egypt in solid training and firing practice before he went to the Dardanelles. If the troops have not received quite sufficient training here, they have sufficient before being put into the firing line. I promise the honorable member that his complaints will be looked into to see if there is any foundation for them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but 2 or 3 miles away there is an area of high ground, in every way suitable for a camp, and I am given to understand that that is where the German internment camp has been placed. There is high and dry ground only 3 or 4 miles from the river, but yet our camp is dotted over the river, so to speak. I am afraid, therefore, that a good many of the medical cases reported there are due to the location of the camp itself on the edge of the river. Now, may I suggest another thing? I very much doubt whether the principal medical officer is given the requisite discretion and authority necessary for the preservation of the health of the camp, and when I say that, I am not speaking without book. </para>

                        <para>- I am only pointing out that fact to suggest that if he has any bias it would be in the direction of this Government, and against the Opposition. But, as I have said, he is a good medical officer, in my judgment, and if he were given the necessary freedom, and had full responsibility thrust upon his shoulders, he would see that a Jot of the troubles lately reported were rectified. That is my firm opinion, and I urge upon the Minister that he should consult with this officer, who is on the spot, and is responsible foi- the health of the troops. If the medical officer has to shoulder the responsibility, he should have the requisite freedom to act according to his own judgment. At any rate, he cannot be held responsible until the Minister has taken his advice, as the responsible officer on the spot. </para>

                <para>I now want to point to a case within my own knowledge. I had a complaint the other day, but I did not trouble honorable members with it. A man in my electorate rang me up to say that one of these young doctors at the camp had sent his brother-in-law, who resides  with  him, home for a day or two on account of a bad cold. When the man got home, however, the local doctor found that he was suffering from measles seven days old. The camp doctor had not diagnosed the illness, and had sent the man home for a day or two on account of a bad cold. The man, of course, was very indignant that his brother-in-law should have been allowed to roam about the camp, taking all the risks which come in cold weather to people suffering from measles, if not properly treated. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has a habit of saying point blank that such and such things are not as reported; but I venture to say that all honorable members will acquit the honorable member for Nepean of party bias. I do not think that he ever laid himself open to such a charge, and we have been informed this afternoon that he has, been to the Liverpool Camp, and has investigated these matters for himself. The honorable member for Nepean is_ a man of the world. He has made his own way in his own business, and is able to pass judgment on these matters as well as any of the honorable members on the other side of the House who have been hurling interjections at him. He has been to the camp to see things for himself. Is it not unfair that honorable members who have never seen the camp should gibe and jeer at him when he gives first-hand information? </para>

                        <para>- I am urging that the men should have rifle training, which is an important matter, in my judgment. The necessity for this training evidently has not been grasped by the Department during the last eleven months, for in front of my house there is a rifle range which, with a little expenditure, could be so improved as to double its capacity. The Department cannot be persuaded to spend n fraction over it, and still the men are not getting rifle shooting. </para>

                        <para>- That is the very reason which I was going to point out. It is because the General cannot send the men straight to the front that they ought to receive the training here. Let it be remembered that all the while the men will be getting three or four months' training in Egypt our numbers in the trenches will be depleted. It is really a serious matter, and party considerations ought not to come into play. Here are the facts; the Minister cannot deny them, because they are facts within my own knowledge; they are occurring every day. </para>

                        <para>- I am discussing the question of rifle training at the Liverpool Camp, and pointing out that my own place is close to that locality, and that the authorities could easily take troops there and train them in the use of rifles if they would only go to the expense of duplicating the existing targets. That is one instance of reform which I am mentioning. We cannot get the authorities to incur the little expenditure necessary in such matters. Year in and year out we are at the Department, and here is a chance when the authorities have unlimited funds at their disposal. Nobody is questioning them on matters of economy, yet with all this infinite pressure upon us the trouble still exists, though it could be at once obviated by the Department if it would only spend a little money. As regards the matters of administration referred to at Liverpool, I know that there are very serious complaints. The question of the supply of cloth has been referred to. The honorable gentleman made the statement that every place in the Commonwealth which can turn out a roll of cloth is doing so at top speed, but that is not so. Notwithstanding the statement of the Assistant Minister, it is not the case. </para>

                        <para>- In the Commonwealth there are mills which are not supplying cloth to the Department, while there are other mills which are not working full time. In a time like this every ounce of energy ought to be pressed into all the preparations, no matter where they may be made, because the matter is as serious as it can be, both for our troops and for our cause and all that relates to the preservation of our Empire. I ask the Minister himself to look into these matters, particularly .into the health of the troops. I have suggested to him a way of getting at the truth. I suggest to him that, instead of being content to ask a general question of the Commandant, who no doubt answers to the best of his ability, and on whom I make no reflection, the man for him to consult in regard to the medical conditions of the camp is the Chief Medical Officer in charge of the camp and of the State. If the honorable gentleman will do that, I shall await with the greatest possible interest the outcome. </para>

                        <para>. - Had I been present yesterday when the Estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department were under discussion, I should have asked some questions about a matter of some importance to the working of that Department - the application of preference to unionists in its administration. Some time ago, the line repairers and others obtained from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, as  President  of the Arbitration Court, an award whose benefits were conferred only on those who were parties to the plaint. As these did not constitute nearly the whole of the employees of the Department, the Public Service Commissioner recommended to the last Government that the terms of the award should be applied generally throughout the Department. </para>

                            <para>- So far as the Department was concerned. That was done, but I understand that this Ministry has repealed the act of its predecessors. The award, amongst other things, fixed the terms and conditions of officers as well as of the men in the Department, and, I understand, affected officers of salaries as high as £400 a year. This Government, in reversing the act of their predecessors, have practically decided that from to-day no man in the Department may expect an increase of wages or of salary until he has joined a union. As there are no unions of officers for this section of the Public Service, that means thai a manager or overseer must join the men's union, whence it will follow that, while the men may be under the control of their overseers during the day, they can at night haul them before the union and place them under control. Are you likely to have discipline under a system of that kind? This is, in my judgment, carrying unionism to an absurd extreme. Outside the Service, men in many cases refuse to allow bosses to join their unions, objecting to their influence there, but in the Department of the Postmaster-General you compel the managers and overseers to join the men's union, because you refuse to pay them increases unless they do so. </para>

How can you expect discipline if the bosses can be hauled before a union to be brought to book by the men under their control ? What does it all mean? It means that honorable members have had to say to the men, " We, your special representatives, have been unable to give you justice, and have, therefore, set up an outside court to do so."

My honorable friends are running mad over this matter of unionism when they apply the principles of unionism  in this way. and will ultimately wish that they had not gone to these extremes. Things cannot continue as they are. There cannot be discipline in the Department unless those in control are free from any but reasonable restrictions on their conduct. The overseers and managers must have control of those under them, but proper control' is impossible if they themselves are to be subjected to discipline imposed by the men. Indeed, that is a contradiction of terms. But, as things are, the men in control are, by the fiat of the Ministry, subjected to the discipline of the men. This is a reversal of the position outside the Service, and I dp not think the results obtained will be good for unionism in the long run, nor beneficial to the public interests. I say that the men  employed  by the Government should have the best conditions possible. State employees should be treated well ; but to say to the bosses, ' ' Unless you join the men's union, and thus subject yourself to the discipline they may impose, you will not get increases of salary," is absurd. </para>

The officers cannot form a linemen officers' union ; they must ally themselves with some other officers in another Department with which they have nothing to do, or they must join the men's union, and be subject to the men's discipline at night, while the men are subject to their discipline during the day. </para>

But the Government will not allow the Public Service Commissioner to fix the salaries, nor will they allow the Court to fix them unless the officers- join a union. They are not only taking the matter out of the hands of the Commissioner entirely, but they are making it impossible for the officers to get increases unless they join the union. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are preventing the Commissioner from dealing with them. He said, "In order to get over the difficulty, I propose to give the men the increases they are entitled to, just the same as if they were parties to the plaint." Now the Government say that he must do no such thing. They are reversing the very regulation which was intended to get over the difficulty which the Commissioner pointed out. The Government's attitude is so utterly foolish and fatuous that I cannot conceive that a great many honorable members know what is actually taking place. In a memorandum to me, when I was Prime Minister, the Public Service Commissioner pointed out what the decision of the Court would lead to, and how it would be destructive of discipline in the Department. To get over the difficulty, he proposed to give the officers justice by making a regulation exempting them from the award of the Court, and yet paying them the increments to which they are entitled. </para>

                            <para>- That is unionism run stark mad. It means that the manager controls the men in the daytime, and subjects them to the proper discipline necessary for the efficiency of the Department, and the men, in turn, bring him up before the union at night and subject him to discipline. That is a sort of unionism with which I was never associated. In the unionism I knew we wanted the bosses to be outside the union, and not in it. </para>

That is absolutely destructive of discipline in the Department; it must minister to inefficiency in the end, it must lead to all sorts of complications, and it cannot be advantageous to the union in the long run.

                        <para>.- In view of the statement made in regard to the sugar question, I think the Ministry ought to carefully avoid entering into any understanding with the Queensland Government that might forestall the deliberate judgment of this House as to the contract or arrangement. I do not think that any Government ought to give a contractual undertaking to, or make any binding agreement -with, any person in relation to the Tariff, and I include in that opinion the State Governments, because we cannot regard one State as representing the whole people of Australia, whom it is our duty to protect. There are one or two facts in connexion with the sugar industry which we must not leave out of account. The Royal Commission which reported in 1912 stated that the adjustments made up to that date in connexion with the sugar industry meant an annual subsidy by the Commonwealth of about £1,000,000 a year, and an obligation on the consumer of about £1,500,000 annually. I have been endeavouring to look up some figures, but I find it difficult, without checking, to present them as I should like to do. However, there are a few statistics to which I wish to draw attention. When we began to deal with the sugar question in 1901, the. import duties produced £780,000 per annum. Looking at the Budget figures for this year, I find that in 191? the Commonwealth received only £351,821, and that the estimate for this year - a time of drought and of shrinkage in production as well as in importation - is' £90,212. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">What is apparent is that we have wiped out at least three-quarters of the revenue we were receiving in 1901 from a smaller population, whilst the sugar industry itself, though better in that white labour has been practically substituted for coloured labour, does not show that development which was one of the chief grounds upon which some honorable members advocated the adjustments that were made in 1901. For instance, we had at first an import duty on cane sugar of £6 a ton, and I think there was a rebate of £4 a ton for sugar grown by white labour. There was also, until 1907, an Excise duty of £3 a ton. About 1903, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, we changed the rebate into a bounty. We continued to give this bounty until about, twelve months ago, and imposed an Excise duty, keeping an effective rate of £6 a ton on cane sugar, with a comparatively ineffective rate of £10 a ton on beet sugar. The result of that policy is seen in the figures I have given. I am not going to deal with the development of the sugar industry throughout the world during these years, but, taking normal times, there is no doubt that there has been a large increase in the world's production of sugar, and had the more normal import duties that prevailed before 1901, which, I think, averaged £3 a ton, been maintained, we (should probably have been able to benefit more than we have done by the increased world's production - I mean that the large consumers in Australia, the purchasers for various industries such as jam making and confectionery, who use something like 60,000. or 70,000 tons a year, must have obtained a large benefit by the competition in the world's markets which would have been caused by a more moderate import duty. The thing we have to remember is that in 1905, when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> reported on the sugar industry, and before we came to the arrangement which was to end in 1913 or 1914, there were 28,614 persons directly or indirectly engaged in the sugar industry. Of these 21,970 were in Queensland, and 6,644 in New South Wales. The number in New South Wales has greatly declined, but for many years we had a rather foolish policy as regards bounties. We so framed our bounties that we paid New South Wales a fairly large sum - it ran to over £70,000 in one year, I remember - for growing sugar by white labour, but not for substituting white labour for black labour, because almost all the production in New South Wales before 1901, when we brought in our Federal policy, was grown by white labour. Against the remonstrances of one or two of us, we made this blunder in arranging our policy, thinking that the Constitution would not permit the provision as regards bounties to be framed otherwise, and we actually paid New South Wales a very large sum, although it did not involve the substitution of white labour for black labour, which was the policy we wished to encourage, simply because the labour was white before. I might go on to show how misplaced that policy- was by following up the figures for the last three or four years, showing the numbers engaged in the industry in New South Wales, but I" think the Budget-papers disclose that there has been a considerable diminution. I have not got the Queensland figures for 1912, but I do not think there has been a great variation in the proportion as against earlier years. I think the Budget-papers show that ou 31st December, 1912, there were 24,789 persons directly or indirectly engaged in the production of sugar "n Queensland and New South Wales - that is, practically in all Australia. These figures compare with 28,614 in 1905, so that the prophecies that there would be a large development in the sugar industry which were made in support of the policy of 1905 and 1906, when wo extended the provisions of the Acts of 1903 and 1901, have been falsified by the figures given in the Budget-papers. This is a somewhat serious matter for the people of Australia. Let us remember in connexion with the sugar industry that from the first we have been legislating on the basis of understandings and undertakings. I hope that this Government will not again make the mistake of entering into any undertaking with the Government of Queensland that will forestall the better judgment of this House, because I say deliberately that there is no precedent anywhere for binding a Government with a private party, or even with a State, to continue duties, or to modify duties, or to abolish duties. If we do such a thing at all, we ought to do it, as we did in 1901, by making it part of the schedule of a Tariff Act. We have acted similarly with regard to bounties; we have done so with the import duties ; we have done so in connexion with the Excise Tariff on stripper-harvesters. The matter is one of general policy, which should be incorporated in the schedule of an Act of Parliament. I repeat that our legislation has all through been based on understandings. In 1B85, Queensland determined to put an end to the importation of kanakas, and, in 1889, in consequence of the report of a Commission which then sat, ten years' grace was granted - from 1892 to 1902 - in the matter of the introduction of kanakas. We then had a sort of implied undertaking - some called it a contract - with the producers of Queensland to take up the sugar question under some sense of moral obligation, which led to the policy to which I have made reference. I could go further, and show that it is a great mistake to enter into any understandings of this sort. Let us look at the report of the Royal Commission of 1912. That Royal Commission gave the net revenue of 1910-11 as £157,000. The figures for 1901-2 were £780,000. The Royal Commission spoke of the futility of bounty and Excise systems as a means of promoting a just apportionment of the profits of the industry, in that it virtually abolished all competition by placing the control of prices in the hands of large industrial concerns. It spoke of the failure cf these. systems as a means of securing fair wages. We have, since then, provided by Act of Parliament for better means of accomplishing that end. The report also spoke of the connexion between Tariff and Trusts, citing two American authorities, one the  President  of the American Sugar Trust, to show that the mother of all Trusts is the Tariff, though the Commission regarded that statement as too sweeping. Nevertheless, the Commission did admit that it must be apparent that an unnecessarily high import duty, unless it is stringently safeguarded, by tending to eliminate internal competition, renders the formation of Trusts more easy, and their despotic control very effective and enduring. It did not for a moment declare that there was a Trust of the class established as a result of the bounties in Australia, as had been suggested before the inquiry of the Commission. I am not, however, going to- enter into that question at all. I am merely giving the evidence of an American authority, cited by that Commission, as to the effect of the policy that had operated in Australia, as well as in America, up to that date. The Commission also suggested that there should be a standard price fixed for both raw and refined sugar. It said that the standard price for Australian refined sugar should be fixed on a basis of not less than £21 10s. per ton, adding that, on account of the Australian cost of production, the price of raw sugar should be fixed on a sliding scale by the Inter-State Commission. I am not going to defend or to criticise that policy. I am only referring to it now because it is the occasion of correspondence between the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister of Australia. Luckily, at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was not led into any arrangement with the State which would have had the effect of binding the hands of the Commonwealth as regards what the rate of duty should be. I notice that in one telegram sent between 6th December and 11th December, 1912, the then Premier of Queensland asked, "Will you, by Statute, fix the minimum price at £21 10s. ? If so, it will be necessary for you to secure such power under the Tariff as will preclude foreign sugar being sold in Australia under that price." To some extent, at least, a State speaks with a continuous desire, if not on a continuous policy. Governments change, but there  is generally a fairly well-marked inclination existing from year to year as to what the State's view is, and I am merely referring to this matter now by way of caution, because I think it is only fair that we should beforehand, to some extent, indicate the trend of our desires in this matter, which is, at present, in an unsettled condition as between the two Governments. I do not know exactly what direct interest in the sugar question, apart from this matter of purchase, which I am not dealing with, the Government of Queensland have. At the time <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> reported a return was obtained, which stated that the Queensland Government had an indirect, if not direct, relation with the mills established in that State under the Sugar Works Guarantee Act of 1893-5. I notice that an estimate was given of the obligations due to the Government in respect of thirteen mills and one tramway, which amounted to about £584,000. That is a pretty large sum, and I should be only too glad if the Government would give us a statement of the exact financial relations between the Queensland Government and the sugar producing industries in Queensland at the present time. They are all factors which must influence the Ministry when they are asked to enter into an arrangement with a particular State on the basis of the purchase of all the sugar available. I am only throwing out a few words of caution, but I do say that, considering the enormous sacrifices of revenue that we are making, and the tremendous burden upon the consumer - the big sacrifices that we have made to attain a good end regarding the kanakas - which have by no means given the large benefits that were anticipated, the Ministry should be particularly cautious as regards the terms of any contract or undertaking that they may enter into or make with the Government of Queensland. At the beginning of the war <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenna</inline> made a large purchase of sugar for the United Kingdom. </para>

In a subsequent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> however, he rather modified his previous statement, and commended the Liberal Government for having invited Lord Kitchener to come to Australia to inquire into and report upon a system of military defence for the Commonwealth.

                        <para>I hope that when honorable members are discussing this Bill they will try to remember what arguments have been put forward in other countries in favour of conscription. I see that the Prime Minister, in answering a deputation from the Peace and Humanity Society, 'said he would not favour "a conscription system but I think there are very strong arguments to be used in connexion with conscription and compulsory drill. ... I think that the proposal that has been made that every man should be compelled to make himself perfect in the use of the rifle, as a sort of preliminary to his right to vote, is a very good one. . . . There is one matter that should be provided for in the Bill, and that is that the cadet system should be compulsory. I would make it compulsory for every boy between the ages of thirteen and eighteen to join a cadet corps. </para>

That measure, however, lapsed at the second-reading stage. The present Prime Minister came into office on 13th November, 1908, but did little in the matter of defence until 30th March, 1909, or eighteen months after the defence policy of the Deakin Government had been enunciated. On that date <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> enunciated the policy of his Government, which made provision only for three years' compulsory training. In June, 1909, the Fisher Government were defeated, and the Deakin-Cook Government came into office. During the session of 1909 the right honorable member for Parramatta, as Minister of Defence in that Administration, introduced and placed upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth the first measure to provide for compulsory military training of junior and senior cadets. The whole groundwork of the scheme, as we have it to-day, was placed on the statute-book in 1909 by the present Leader of the Opposition, as Minister of Defence. The Government, however, were not satisfied; and it was decided to invite Lord Kitchener, the greatest living soldier in the world, to come to Australia. </para>

                                Ewing in 1908, though the first Government to give effect to the policy of that Bill was the Liberal Government of 1909. The policy then adopted was that in operation today, and that which was indorsed by Lord Kitchener without alteration, except in the way of organization. I think that the facts do not require further comment. I have not time to go into any comparison of the schemes, or even refer to that laid down by the present Prime Minister in March, 1909. That scheme provided for only three years' training; but, however that may be, I desire now to refer, as rapidly as I may, to one or two documents which have reference to the Naval Unit. It has been claimed by the Labour party that they have to be credited, not only with the scheme of military defence, but also with the scheme of naval defence. The present Prime Minister, in his Gympie speech, on the 29th March, 1909, a few months after the Imperial Naval Conference, detailed the proposals of the Labour party.  His  scheme, however, was quite different from that proposed at the Imperial Conference. The unit was to consist of twenty-four vessels - four ocean destroyers, with a speed of ten knots, and with twenty-six knots in an emergency; nineteen destroyers of the River class ; and one armed vessel for police duties. That would have been an insufficient defence for Australia. I am afraid that we should have found ourselves very insecure if that had -been recently the only naval defence in the Pacific. In response to the invitation of the Imperial Government, the Liberal

                            <para>- I have some of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson's</inline> proposals or statements amongst my notes, but do not wish to detract from the Labour party's advocacy of an Australian Navy in the early, years of Federation. All I am endeavouring to show now is that the crystallized .efforts of the Labour party for years and years meant this proposal by the present Prime Minister in 1909. I guarantee that the two vessels which were sunk at Falkland Islands would have blown such a unit out of the water in an hour. As against that scheme, we had the one enunciated when our representative was present at the Colonial Conference in 1909. It was decided that the Commonwealth should construct one armoured cruiser, the <inline font-style="italic">Australia;</inline> three second-class protected cruisers, <inline font-style="italic">Sydney, Melbourne,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane;</inline> six destroyers, <inline font-style="italic">Parramatta, Warrego, Tarra, Torrens, Derwent,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Swan;</inline> and two submarines. A certain number of these have already been sent out, and one of our second-class cruisers is almost ready for launching, although it should have been launched long ago. The <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> in my opinion, was really a substitute for the proposal of the Liberal party to present a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to- Great Britain - a step which would have been more effective than half-a-dozen fleets such as those suggested by the present Prime Minister in March, 1909. </para>

                    <para>I think I have shown very .clearly that the first member within this House who suggested compulsory military training was Colonel Crouch. Subsequent debates on the subject took place here in which members on both sides spoke, the views being of a more or less declaratory character,  affirming  in some form or another a citizen soldiery responsibility. Resolutions were moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> on the one side, and afterwards by the present Attorney-General on the other side. These were individual and preliminary views on a subject which was occupying much public attention in the press, and in the thoughts of the people. The first real authoritative responsible pronouncement was the unfolding of a comprehensive compulsory system of cadet and citizen soldiery, also an Australian Naval policy, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> in 1907. This was followed by a Bill embodying that policy by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, then Minister of Defence, in September, 1908. That Bill, however, did not pass the second reading. It was not until after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin-</inline> s declaration, in 1907, that the citizen defence scheme found its way into the Labour party's programme. Soon after <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing's Bill of the 29th September, 1908, the Labour party gave the Deakin Government notice that it withdrew its support, and the Fisher Labour Government came into power in December of the same year, and held office until June, 1909, during which period it did nothing. Then the Deakin-Cook Government came into power, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> as Minister of Defence in  that Government, carried through the House, and passed into law, amidst the stormiest scenes and fiercest opposition from the Labour party yet experienced in ' this House, the great scheme of citizen and compulsory training, which provided for the training of our youths from twelve to twenty years of age. . That system is now in force. The same Minister, in the same session, gave us the proposals for the Australian Naval Unit, of which we are so proud, and which has done such valuable service to Australia and to the Empire; and, not satisfied with these two monumental, colossal pieces of achieved statesmanship, he also advised that Lord Kitchener, the greatest active soldier of the Empire and the world, be invited to Australia. This was agreed to by Cabinet, and an invitation, in the terms already read to the House, was extended to Lord Kitchener by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> Lord Kitchener accepted the invitation in 1909, and in February, 1910, finished his notable and comprehensive report, which, while indorsing <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> the Australian law of 1909 then, in force, proposed a complete scheme of extended territorial organization to enable general effect to be given to the Cook military law, and advised that the age, as already contemplated, should be increased to twenty-five years. It was in April, 1910, two months after Lord Kitchener reported, that the Deakin-Cook Government were defeated and the Labour party proceeded to extend the existing Defence Act on the lines he had recommended. In the case of the Naval Unit, the representative at the Imperial Conference in 1909 was a Liberal Minister, and the Unit agreed upon, including the <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> was ordered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> Hie Minister of Defence. This Unit superseded the obsolete, low-speed, River class destroyers, which were the policy of the' Labour party, as enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> at Gympie in 1909. Whatever may have been the nature of the preliminary discussions and suggestions on the question of defence by land or sea, and whatever may be the ultimate achievement of our system, these facts from the history of the Defence schemes of Australia prove irrefragably  that, whilst a substantial majority of the House has indorsed the policy laid down in the Deakin-Cook law of 1909, the authors of the two schemes - the military scheme, which is attracting world-wide attention and approval, and the existing Naval scheme, which satisfies Australian aspirations, and forms a substantial addition to the Imperial Naval defence strength - can rightly be claimed to be the Liberal party. </para>

                <para class="block">That was but a short discussion, but the system which the honorable member for West Sydney had in mind at the time, as indicated by . him on public platforms, was a system of compulsory training and an Australian-owned and controlled Navy. He had given expression to these views sometimes in the face of much opposition, and, at that time, at considerable risk to his political reputation. If I had gone to the same trouble as that taken by the honorable member for Wimmera, I could, no doubt, bring forward convincing proof as to who was the first to take a stand in regard to our present defence system. I am open to correction in regard to the quotation that I shall now read from page 2960 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament. On the 24th July, 1901,  Colonel Crouch,  the then member for Corio, was speaking on the second reading of the Defence Bill, introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest: but I shall not make from it the same deduction that was made from it by the honorable member for Wimmera.  Colonel Crouch  said - </para>

                    <para>Although we cannot adopt the principle of conscription, because of labour and sentimental difficulties, in regard to able-bodied men, every boy should be in a position, on reaching the age of eighteen, to join some militia or volunteer corps, and take a part, if necessary, in the defence of his country. This cadet system is one of the cheapest forms of military training that has yet been designed. At the present time the metropolitan corps of senior cadets, consisting of 500 youths, costs only ?400 a year; and when we remember the extravagance that military organization usually involves, I think that that is a very creditable result. The cadet movement should be very largely extended and encouraged, and I would suggest to the Minister that the system should be made compulsory to the extent I have indicated. </para>

                    <para>Now, since our chief danger to Australia must take the form of a bombardment, we have a right to demand that the first feature of our defence scheme should bc to provide complete and satisfactory means for protecting us from that possible and even probable contingency. I want honorable members to realize that this question of a bombardment, or of an attack from a marauding expedition, or whatever you may please to term it, is by no means a chimerical idea, but it is the one thing which has made Federation possible in these States. </para>

                <para>Well, " a volunteer," the maxim goes, " is worth a dozen pressed men." Yet the volunteer is very like snow in the summer. He melts away when the glamour and the novelty of the thing has worn off, when he realizes that after all there is in military tactics and preparation a good deal of hard work to be done. The volunteer, unless he be an enthusiast, such  its  these shores do not contain a large proportion of, melts away in such circumstances. Take the case of the  nien  who volunteered for service in South Africa. They were largely composed of men who never belonged to any volunteer force at all. If any man can sit easily down under the volunteer forces of this country, and believe that, with all their virtues and enthusiasm, they constitute a sufficient force to repel an invasion from a European or Asiatic source, he is easily content. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Wimmera, and most other honorable members on the Opposition side of the Chamber, got the verdict of the people on their defence policy when the elections took place in 1910. The Fusion policy was irrevocably turned down. Honorable members opposite, who belong to the procrastinating party, would never have been in a position to meet the present crisis but for the three years' tenure of  a  Labour Government from 1910 to 1913. </para>

My own opinion is that we ought to'do more work in our postal workshops, instead of sending out of Australia for many of our requirements. I am informed that there is in progress a " wet-blanketing " process in connexion with some schemes recently evolved for providing the equipment and material necessary in the carrying out of telephonic and postal work. I understand that the Department is waiting until the more commodious workshop at the corner of Spencer and Bourke streets. Melbourne, is in a position to turn out the articles that we need. In. this connexion I have received numerous complaints, not merely from workmen, but from contractors. The latter complain that some of the articles which we require are being imported from other countries. For instance, there are telephone boxes the manufacture of which is very simple. I am sure that the Postmaster-General will admit that Australia can turn out woodwork equal to that turned out in  any  part of the world. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- No. . I am commending the good qualities of our Australian workmen. I say that their superiors cannot be found in any part of the world. I would counsel the Postmaster-General not to defer action in this connexion until the completion of the new building at the corner of Bourke and Spencer streets. The requisite plant might easily be transferred to that building when it is completed. I believe that private contractors are doing well out of the Postal and other Departments, just as they are doing well out of other Departments. The sooner we eliminate them from the manufacture of our  requirements,  the sooner we shall be in a position to pay our employees better wages, and to  give  them better conditions generally. </para>

                        <para>- That is as it should be. The leading firms of the world recognise the worth of employees who aid  them by making valuable suggestions. I would like to see the same plan operative in connexion with most of our Departments. As an old public servant, I know that it sometimes happens that when a junior places a brilliant idea before his superior officer, it is either turned down or some months later is suddenly evolved in quite another quarter, and the superior officer very often obtains credit for the invention or improvement. I hope that the Postmaster-General will confer with the Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister of Defence, in connexion with the matter to which I have referred, and that, as a result, we shall have workshops established in which it will be possible for us to manufacture much of the material we require more cheaply than we are now getting it from contractors. </para>

                    <para>.- I have never been much of a party man during my political career, and, at the present time, I cannot help congratulating myself that, throughout the British Empire, party considerations are receding very much into the back-ground. I have noticed with much satisfaction that my ideal of a Ministry has recently been carried into effect in London, namely, a Ministry of all the talents in the Parliament, irrespective of the political party to which they belong. I welcome that innovation as an indication of what can be done under the stress of urgent necessity, and a step which will probably lead in the near future to what I regard as a very great reform in parliamentary government. I regret that members of the present Government, and those who are behind them, cry out to the Opposition to cease party warfare, especially when we happen to be offering some useful and necessary criticism, and yet, when they get outside this chamber, they are ready to claim for their party, and in relation to the war, a credit to which they have no right whatever, unless they are prepared to give equal credit to their political opponents. I refer to the claim made time and again that it is to the Labour party, and to that party alone, that our present defence system should be credited. </para>

                        <para>- In this way, that I have a fairly good knowledge of the position of both parties in this connexion. I wish to indorse what has been said here this afternoon with regard to the magnificent work done by the honorable member for West Sydney, the present Attorney-General. There is no doubt whatever that the honorable gentleman has done great work in educating the members of his parliamentary party, and also the supporters of that party outside. There has been, and still is, a section of the Labour party very strongly antagonistic to any kind of war preparation whatever. The honorable member for Maranoa will agree with me when I say that, at one time, the members of the Labour party holding the views which the honorable member for West Sydney has so ably and forcibly expressed inside and outside of this House, were not particularly numerous. </para>

                        <para>- They had a very hard row to hoe for years, but in view of the developments taking place in the world the conviction gradually grew in the Labour party that Australia should do something definite, and do it soon, in order to prepare for the evil day that was coming on the Empire. There was an essential difference between the attitude taken ug by the Labour party as a whole, or at least by a large majority of its members, and that taken up by the members of the opposite political party. The ideal of a majority of the Labour party was preparation solely for local defence in connexion with both our Naval and Military Forces. Our Naval Force, according to their idea, was to be a purely local fighting unit. </para>

                        <para>- That was undoubtedly their position. There were members of the Labour party who did not take that view, but they were in a hopeless minority. The attitude of the party, as a whole, was that we had really nothing to do with the affairs of the Empire, and were concerned only with our local defences. Again the present Attorney-General came to the rescue with his magnificent enthusiasm,  and made the supporters of Labour outside Parliament realize that we are vitally associated with the interests of the Empire in all respects, for good or for evil; that the cause of the Motherland is our cause, and that we have to stand or fall with the people of the Old Country. Again I deprecate the claim that the Labour party should be credited with the defence system of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- We do know that it is bosh, but the trouble is that if a statement of that kind is repeated loudly enough and often enough, the bulk of the people come to believe it. That preposterous claim has actually been recognised in the Old Country. Again, I say that these questions should be altogether above party considerations. I feel sure that where the welfare of Australia or of the Empire as a whole is concerned, there are sufficient men in both political parties to take the true, broad, national, and patriotic view that will insure the establishment of a condition of affairs which will make for the security of Australia and of the Empire at the same time. I was interrupted earlier in the day when making a reference to the necessity for vigorous action by the Defence Department. I want to repeat my statement that the present Minister of Defence is a very estimable man in all respects, but that he does lack the initiative we have a right to look for from the head of his Department at the present time. This has been proved in no way more conclusively than by his action in regard to the Small Arms Factory. Our whole difficulty in connexion with the Expeditionary Forces begins and ends there. It is because of the insufficient output of the Small Arms Factory that we have not been able to take all the recruits that have offered. It is because of it that we have not been able to arm our men in sufficient time. We are now told, after several months have elapsed, that steps are to be taken to institute a double shift at the Factory. We had two reports from Parliamentary Com.mittees, but, not content with them, the Minister of Defence called for a third report, and he has since received that report. In my opinion, that third report should not have been called for at all. It was practically an insult to Parliament that the Minister should have waited for that third report in view of the opinions expressed by both the Parliamentary Committees that investigated this matter. They said in no hesitating words that the introduction of a second shift at the Factory was both desirable and practicable. I say that if a Liberal Minister had permitted matters to slide for so long as Senator Pearce has done, the Liberals in this country would not for a long time have heard the last of it. We should have had the neglect and delay discussed morning, noon, and night, as not so long ago a mistake made by a Liberal Minister was dinned into our ears in .similar fashion. I have already said in this Chamber today, and now repeat the statement, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is almost the last man of the party opposite who should occupy the position of Minister of Defence at the present time. I can imagine the honorable member for Maranoa in the chair of the Minister of Defence, asking why a second shift was not going at the Small Arms Factory, and being told that it was not practicable at the present time. Would the honorable member have given the same instructions as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> gave, "If it is not practicable at present, do it as soon as you can?" I can imagine the honorable member for Maranoa saying, " I will give you a month, and if it is not going then you will have to get out." That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should have said at least six months ago. If a Liberal Minister had made the mistake that has been made with regard to the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> I wonder whether we would have heard so little about it as we have heard. Just imagine a ship of that kind being constructed high and dry at a place where no preparation was made to launch her. Imagine, too, the time that has been lost in the building of the vessel, the unnecessary additional expense that has been incurred, and, above all, the deplorable fact that if she had been built as the Liberal Government proposed, she would be afloat and fighting the battles of Australia and the Empire to-day. </para>

                        <para>- And this sacrosanct and omniscient Minister, whom no one should criticise at all, has allowed the matter to drift on in the way it has been doing up to the present time. Let me remind honorable members of what happened under the Labour <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> in the Defence Department with regard to the rifle clubs. Honorable members opposite know, as we all do, that the present Minister of Defence permitted the rifle clubs to be almost starved out of existence, deliberately and intentionally, by the permanent officers responsible for the management of defence affairs. They did not want to be bothered with rifle clubs. They wanted all the frills and furbelows for military style and swagger, and, as the rifle clubs did not fit in with that sort of thing, they had to go to the wall. The present Minister of Defence has got off very lightly in connexion with this matter. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence now realizes the mistake he made in allowing his officers to influence him in that direction. My complaint is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has left himself almost unreservedly in the hands of his subordinate officers. Unfortunately, he had to do it, because, until he took the position of Minister of Defence, he was a man who by natural bent and inclination kept as far away from military matters, soldiers, rifles, and bayonets, as he could possibly get. That was his disposition, and he found himself in charge of a Department to which he had previously given very little attention. He had to leave himself in the hands of his permanent officers, who, of course, exercised the influence they had under those conditions, as they thought, for the benefit nf the country, but sometimes to their own advantage as well. Consequently, the present Minister of Defence has had his reputation created for him by those same gentlemen who will,  one and all, tell you that he is the best Minister they ever had. If you ask them why, they will tell you, " He has done just as we wanted him to do, including the multiplication of well-paid positions and the increase of salaries where any kind of excuse was offered for it.," </para>

At the time it was first mooted I did my level best to get the Defence people to consider the question of adopting the Ross rifle. It is a notorious fact that the rifle we are manufacturing to-day, in common with the rifle manufactured by the British Government, is the worst-shooting military rifle in Europe. I can bring competent authorities to prove that the rifle that we and the British Army are using is absolutely the worst-shooting rifle in Europe. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt they are doing very well with them, but if they had had better rifles we should have had even better shooting results. I would remind the honorable member for Maranoa that in international matches in which Canadian teams have competed the Bisley authorities have found it necessary to handicap the Ross rifles. It is a better rifle in all respects than ours, and I feel sure that, instead of the trouble we have bad in equipping the Small Arms Factory and getting it to work, with its excessive initial cost, if we had made a business-like arrangement with the Ross Company of Canada we could have had the best military rifle in the world, as the Ross rifle undoubtedly is, at half the cost of the present one, so far at any rate as regards equipping and getting the Factory to work. </para>

                        <para>- No. A contract has been given only recently by the Imperial authorities to the Ross Rifle Company of Canada for 170,000 rifles. It may be that some of these have not been quite up to the mark on account of the haste with which they have been turned out. But I have gone into the matter very thoroughly, and I know that the Ross rifle, up to quite lately, was recognised as the best military rifle in existence. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is anything of consequence in that matter, any more than there has been in regard to our own rifle. There is not the slightest doubt that the Australian rifle, within the limitations -of the pattern, is as well made as possible, and any minor defect is of no material consequence. But my trouble in regard to the Defence Department is that it persists in proceeding on the old-fashioned jog-trot lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton, in his valuable report, pointed out time and again that the organization of the Department would probably go to pieces in a few weeks if it were actually face to face with war, and I believe it has done so. He also said that it badly needed a business head to deal with business matters in a business-like way, and we have not got that yet either. There is no doubt that at a time like the present a little more energy and common sense than we have seen up to the present needs to be shown by some individual in a responsible position in the Department; and we cannot but hold the political head of the Department responsible. That. is what constitutional government means. I do not regard the present Minister of Defence as by any means sacrosanct, and if I do not see more activity and common sense at work in the Department than has so far been in evidence, the Minister will hear from me not infrequently in the future. </para>

                        <para>- I would shoot some of them over the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> if I had my way. The honorable member for Wimmera went to a good deal of trouble bo let the Committee and the country know who originated the defence system, both naval and military, in Australia. It appeared to me that he searched <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> ever since the inception of Federation to find out who did anything in connexion with our defence scheme. He quoted just -as much as suited his book, and I suppose he thought he was going to sneak it into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> without any reply whatever. But, having been a member of this House from the beginning of Federation, and having taken a very lively interest in defence matters myself, I know a little about the subject; and it is only right that I should give the Committee the benefit of the knowledge I possess. I am pleased to know that I had something to do in the framing of the first Defence Bill in this House; but I want to say that, at that particular time, the man who was most consistent and persistent over the whole business of soldiering and compulsory drill for the juniors of Australia was the Honorable William Morris Hughes, member for West Sydney, and our present Attorney-General. At that time, too, it was a most unpopular thing for a Labour member to advocate soldiering ; and I might tell the honorable member for Wimmera that, after the experience we had in the 1891 strike, with what we called the "scab" protectors, or the Military Forces of Queensland, I came into this House with the fixed determination to singe the wings and cut the spurs of the "gold-spurred roosters'-' as the honorable member for Darwin would call them. But, after I listened to the several debates, I came to the conclusion that the time had arrived when something should be done to protect this young nation from the peril which we then thought confronted it- I refer to the Japanese. That was the consideration which induced me, and several other members of the Labour party, to advocate compulsory training, and I was very pleased indeed to hear the honorable member for Perth give a small meed of praise to the Attorney-General for his consistency at that time in regard to the compulsory training system. But, after all, what does it matter to us to-day who was the father of, or who was the sponsor for, our system of continuous military training and the establishment of. the Naval Unit? What does it matter to Australia, so long as we have it? I give the Opposition credit for being just as anxious as we were to introduce compulsory training, only I want to make it clear that if the Labour party had not been in favour of it, we would not have had it in Australia to-day. I take that much credit for our party. Had we opposed it as a party, the system, would not have been in force to-day, and the honorable member for Wimmera would have had some other tale to chronicle. Let us get down to. the facts. We know very well that the then honorable member for Richmond, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing. introduced compulsory training in this House; and we all know the fate of that Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, who was then Minister of </para>

That would be a criminal, cruel wrong to them.  . . In my opinion, the only justification for compulsion in the matter of service is a national emergency within n reasonable prospect of time. ... Do not let us forget that Great Britain, the Dominion of Canada, South Africa, and every other British Dominion have been able from time immemorial to solve their difficulties in even darker hours than these without resort to this foreign method of compulsory training. ... I sum up my attitude upon this subject by. stating that I regard these projects as wild and impracticable, as being not founded on necessity, or even in prudence, but arising either from hysteria, fear, or from a craze for militarism that is foreign to the history and the spirit nf the British race. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Wimmera has been trying to fix things on to this party, and, as I said before, it is not my wish to have any quarrel as to who started the movement. We are in it now, and I believe every honorable member on both sides of the House is eager to do the best he can for Australia, and to do it as quickly as possible. But the honorable member for Wimmera went out of his way to launch a tirade against the Labour party, simply because one or two members of the party talked bosh on the platform. But what does it matter who inaugurated the scheme? All honorable members of this House glory in the results of our compulsory training as ' disclosed in the recent operations at the Dardanelles, and in the achievements of the Naval Unit, and surely the time has come when we should cease to use these arguments as to who was responsible for the defence scheme for political purposes. Members should cease trying to get these into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to be used against one another at the earliest possible opportunity. Yet that is what the honorable member for Wimmera has done.  His  whole object was to use the facts, as he presented them, against us for party purposes, and " paste " us over the referenda. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There was a small minority in the Labour party who had the courage to tackle it. But, after all, it was only a question of time, for this, like all other great movements, had to spring from a mustard seed. What I dislike about the whole business is that the honorable member for Wimmera should try to belittle our Attorney-General over this subject, because, if there is one man deserving of credit for consistency in connexion with compulsory training ever since the inception of Federation, it is the present Attorney-General. </para>

Most of the Labour party's supporters outside of Parliament abhorred the sight of a military uniform, just as I did particularly after the action taken in the 1891 strike in Queensland. If there was anything I detested more than a rat on earth at that particular time it was a soldier in uniform. Having experienced what we did in 1891, no one can blame us for having that feeling. Yet, despite that, the honorable member for West Sydney was persistent, and in the Labour ranks - I do not say in the whole of the country - his persistency was' the means of bringing compulsory training to what it is to-day. Here is what the honorable member for Echuca said at that time - </para>

They declared that they would present the Old Country with a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> raised by public subscriptions. They had a great bean-feast that night in the Town Hall, and while the champagne was flowing a pad was taken round the room for the banquets to put down the amount which they would subscribe. </para>

                        <para>- I will tell the honorable member directly. On the night the banqueters had the "  shicker  " in them, and did not know what they were doing with the pad, they subscribed £2,500,000; but when the mayor went to collect the actual cash, after several weeks or months, the great patriots who had done the flag-wagging and set the bands playing, had to part up to the tune of £46,000. They offered that sum to the Old Country to purchase a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and the Imperial Government said, " No, thanks; we are not that hard up. We do not want your money. You had better do something with it in Australia." The Fusionists put the money in a bank at fixed deposit, and found that nobody would have anything to do with it. They were like the kid in the advertisement for Pears' soap. They were not happy till they got it, and when they got it they did not know what they were going to do with it. After all the " flapdoodle " and flag-wagging, the Fusionists had £46,000, and they wanted to present the Minister of Defence with the money to furnish the Naval College on condition that it was to be built within so many miles of Sydney. The Minister could not accept the offer conditionally, and the consequence was that the money was handed over unconditionally to the Federal Government to buy furniture with which to furnish the Naval College now being built at Jervis Bay. It is of no use for honorable members on the Opposition side to think that the public have such a short memory that they do not remember these things. I, for one, have never claimed, either on the platform or in this House, that the Labour party did anything more than its just share, and it should only get its just reward. in connexion with the starting of compulsory military training and the establishment of the Naval Unit of Australia. We know very well what the honorable member for Parramatta said, or was reported to have said, in Adelaide about the "River" boats. He wanted to know what rivers there were in Australia for the " River " boats to go up. </para>

                        <para>- The- honorable member does not like it, because he was one of those who were going to show the Imperial Government that the private citizens of Australia could put the Labour party in their proper place. I can well understand him not wanting to hear about the banquet, These old tales are true. The honorable member for Wimmera has gone back to the days of Noah. Surely, then, there can be no harm in referring to  matters  of a little more recent date ! </para>

                    <para>.- What impressed me in the remarks of the honorable member for Maranoa was the apparent sincerity with which he deprecated the importation of party feeling into the speech of the honorable member for Wimmera, and the gusto with which he himself made free and unjustifiable use of recent history in an attempt to gain kudos for the Labour party in regard to Australia's preparations for defence. The speech was an extraordinary mixture of half-facts and whole nonsense ; but I must congratulate the honorable member on his imagination in referring to a banquet which he should have known did not take place, because, had it been held, he would have contrived to be at it. </para>

He seems not to think that any on© could do a generous thing unless as the result of a good dinner. As a matter of strict fact, a considerable sum was raised in Sydney, and has been used by the Department of Home Affairs in the construction of the Naval College at Jervis Bay. Although the honorable member threw gibes ' at the donors, other honorable members are thankful for their generosity. </para>

                <para>I do not propose to quarrel about how the dreadnought <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> came into be ing; about how our Citizen Forces came to be created ; or about the party, or set of persons, to whom credit is due for what has been done in the past for the defence of this country. Our business now is to do the best we can at the present time, and to put past squabbles behind us. It is not as if we were facing an election, and had to be constantly taking liberties with the truth; we are confronted by a serious national crisis; and, unless we concentrate our attention upon the problem of making our offensive abroad efficient, we shall be false to the trust which the people have reposed in us. I regret the absence of the Assistant Minister of Defence, because there are one or two matters to which I wish to direct his attention; but I have no doubt that he will read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of my speech. </para>
                <para>I cannot help thinking that there is something wrong with the Central Administration of the Defence Department, though whether the fault is in its organization or in the allocation of duties I am not in a position to say. I strongly  suggest that Ministers should look into this matter, and wipe away the corroding dust which is clogging wheels that should revolve silently and expeditiously. I will take a few matters which have come within my own notice. It should not be impossible for the Department to pay witH reasonable expedition; yet the overtime payments of the ordnance storemen in Sydney are about ten months overdue. These men have waited for their money month after month, and a week or so ago they had not been paid overtime since last September ;. and, so far as I know, have not yet received it. My last question to the Minister on the subject drew forth the reply that one must expect delays during a time of considerable stress. But these are delays which should not occur after the initial stress. The Department ought to have expanded, and if it has not yet expanded, ought immediately to expand sufficiently to enable all questions of payment to be settled with expedition, and facility. </para>
                <para>Let me give another instance- of departmental demoralization : I hold in my hand papers relating to a matter which was placed in my charge in Sydney last week by the representative of two ladies who had given money to provide a motor ambulance for the First Australian Light </para>

                <para class="block">They made inquiries in Sydney, and found that their draft, which was dated 8th February last, was forwarded by the New South Wales Commandant to the Minister at Melbourne on the 8th or 9th of that month. But, according to a letter which I have received from the Secretary to the Defence Department, it was not until the 30th March - seven weeks after the money had been received in Melbourne - that a cablegram was sent to the High Commissioner in London advising him that this donation, with others, had been received, and asking him to make the necessary arrangements for the purchase of the ambulance, and to inform the Department here what action had been taken in the matter. The letter added that this advice, which it was expected would come by mail, had not yet been received. A donation is given to provide a vehicle which is urgently needed for the use of our wounded soldiers, and yet the money is kept unused in Melbourne for seven weeks. Something must be radically wrong for that to have been possible. I am not bringing forward these matters to give offence to honorable members opposite. </para>

                <para>A few days ago another instance of the same sort of slackness was brought under my notice, but in this case there was some excuse for the Department. Some time ago a friend came to see me on behalf of a contractor in Sydney who was the lowest tenderer for a Defence contract for the manufacture in Australia of signalling lamps. Certain parts of the signalling lamps could not be obtained in Australia. I went to the Department, and suggested to the officer in charge of contracts that, in the circumstances, the best thing to do would be  to  cable at the contractor's cost to the </para>
                <para class="block">High Commissioner to obtain quotations, and arrange for the immediate shipping of the goods, and then the contract could proceed with facility. The officer in charge of that sub-department recognised the suggestion as a sane one, and I thought there would be no further trouble. To my astonishment, however, about a week ago my friend, together with the contractor, who had been obliged to come across from Sydney, interviewed me and asked me to see the Department about the matter. There I found that the cable, which ought to have gone to the High Commissioner the day after my previous visit, because the matter was allegedly one of urgency, had been delayed for some reason for three weeks, and was then sent, not as an urgent cable at the cost of the contractor, but as a week-end letter at the cost of the Department. </para>

The Department had never previously had to inquire at the contractor's cost for some essential of his contract. Apparently, the practice would be to call for tenders afresh, or to start negotiations with one of the unsuccessful tenderers. I had suggested a rough-and-ready method hitherto unknown in the Department of overcoming the difficulty and of bringing the lamps into existence a couple of months earlier than they will now be available. </para>

The men were needed urgently, the wire said. The twenty-eight bakers were engaged the next day, and the Sydney office, for the following two or three weeks, was telegraphing to Melbourne without result to ascertain what to do with them ! </para>
                <para>I have another instance in mind. A number of guards were appointed to accompany convalescents from Alexandria to Malta, and Base Records at Cairo notified Australia that the men had embarked at Alexandria, and had been struck off the strength. Promptly the pay of the dependants in Australia was also struck off. One lady who interviewed me in Sydney was in the greatest difficulty owing to the pay of her son being denied her, as though he had been dismissed, although she was able to produce letters from her son at Malta which showed that he was still in the Commonwealth service. I went to the pay officer in Sydney, and he produced his file. He said, " Yes, I have been asking Melbourne for authority to regard this man and others similarly situated as not having been struck off the strength." The officer desired to pay, but the file showed that he could not get an answer from Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- If there is one portion of the Defence Department that ought to be efficiently conducted, it is the Central Office in Melbourne. If we have a state of centralization, such as does exist to an  exceptional  degree in the Defence Department, the Central Office, which is the focal point of the centralization, must essentially be supremely efficient, or the whole 'machinery will be clogged. I believe ' that a great number of " the disappointments in the Department are due to the fact that the Central Administration is utterly clogged. I heard of another instance in relation to Colonel Ryrie's Light Horse Brigade. Heel pegs were required so that the horses could be lined approximately near the men, but will honorable members believe that it was necessary to requisition Melbourne for those heel pegs? Any one of us would have taken an axe and gone out into the bush and cut the pegs; but it was necessary in this case to requisition Melbourne, and I understand that the pegs were not received until a week or two before the Brigade embarked for the front. That there is some laxity in the administration is obvious, and I am mentioning these matters in the hope that the Ministry will take the matter in hand. If there is too much work for one man, let it be divided amongst others. I do not suggest that honorable members opposite ought to divide up the:.r salaries with any honor able member on this side of the House. There are plenty of private members on the Government side, and if there is too much work on one Minister's shoulders, let the work be distributed so that it can be. done  expeditiously.  At the present time the work- is not being done. I do not wish to say more. I shall not touch upon the obvious failure of the Department in connexion with the camps of training; that is knowledge within the brain of every honorable member. I direct attention solely to those branches of the Department which ought to work automatically without a hitch. The authorization of pay and the sending on of accounts are things in themselves of the utmost simplicity, and the failure to properly attend to them is proof of serious demoralization in the Department. I have addressed these remarks to the Assistant Minister of Defence, and, in his absence, I hope the Minister of Home Affairs will do me the favour of asking the Minister to look at my <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>.- I admit that there  might  be some improvement in the administration of the Defence Department, but I do not think that it lies in the mouth of the , Opposition to complain, because the chaos and disorder in the Department prior to the Labour party taking office last year were publicly acknowledged by the Liberal press throughout Australia. The position is infinitely better than it was or could have been under a Fusion Government. The newspaper champions of honorable members opposite, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> - the Conservative press of Australia, the newspapers that support Conservative politicians, and are known as the anti-Labour press - recognised that disorder, chaos, and maladministration were so rife in the Defence Department under the Fusion <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> in 1913 and 1914 that it was impossible to hide the condition of affairs existing. The idea was prevalent that those then in charge of the Defence Department were opposed to compulsory service in Australia, and that they were not sympathetically administering the Naval Branch. To show that these were not mere statements, I will give chapter and verse for  them </para>

                        <para>- No, it was not. They did not go to the country with it. The position was this : There were twenty six Labour members supporting thirteen Deakinites in office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and twenty-four other members of the Labour party sitting in this corner, advocated the establishment of an Australian Navy and a citizen soldiery. It was on our platform, and the Deakin Government took parts of our platform and made some effort to deal with them, because we formed the bulk of their support, and compelled some semblance of action. The honorable member for Parramatta then derided the Deakin party for conceding our demands in return for our support. But really they did nothing. A Bill was passed to come into operation by proclamation, but the proclamation was never issued. When the Labour party came into office they put into operation, sympathetically, the platform they had been fighting for for years. While the leaders of the present Opposition were jeering at these proposals, the Labour party had to educate public opinion up to- them, and, though the then Deakin section under duress made a somewhat lame move, it was the Labour party that organized and set the scheme in motion. </para>

                        <para>- I make these quotations because members of the party opposite are seeking to make political capital out of the present position. My honorable friend has not been in the House while members of his own party have been seeking to cast ridicule on the Labour party in connexion with their attitude on the subject of defence. The Liberal party came into office in 1913, and had charge of the reins of government for twelve short months. I am going to quote what the Conservative press of Australia had to say about their administration of Defence matters during that time, for it was upon this that the people of Australia turned them out of office, if it was upon anything. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which is well known as an anti-Labour paper, on the 12th August, 1914, said this about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> administration for 1910- 1913- </para>

While he was in the pay of the Commonwealth as Attorney-General, he felt in his own conscience that he ought not to act as its legal adviser, and, therefore, handed over to his colleague, the honorable member for Angas, all matters relating to the Marconi Company's litigation with the Commonwealth. That fact shows that his own conscience convicted him! The Commonwealth was entitled to his services as Attorney-General, but it was deprived of them because he held a general retainer from the Marconi Company. </para>

In its issue of 6th June, 1914, it wrote - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In their zeal to demonstrate the iniquities of their opponents, they (the Cook Government) have seriously hampered the routine of the national defence in Australia. . . . One by one the unfounded and usually malicious charges were disproved. . . . The Minister of Defence . . . has ever since dangerously hampered the simplest processes of Defence administration by attempting to discover justification for the charges so recklessly made. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The Liberal party had been making all sorts of unfounded charges against the administration of the Defence Department by its predecessors in office. It had said, amongst other things, that at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard there were boilers the condition of which was such as to render it unsafe to work alongside them, and, that the men working there were endangering their lives. It condemned the Labour Government for taking over Cockatoo Island Dockyard; but the fact remains that that dockyard has been of invaluable assistance to the Commonwealth, not only in building ships, but in repairing our own war vessels, and in assembling war-ships. Several war-ships have been assembled there, and one is now ready for launching. The dock is now working at high pressure to meet the exigencies of the present international situation, so far as is necessary from our Australian point of- view. We know the charges that were made. It was stated that the property taken over, with the machinery therein, was obsolete, and represented a robbery of the Commonwealth taxpayer. As the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> points out, when the Cook Government assumed office, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> set about, by the most extraordinary means, and at great expenditure of public money, to endeavour to prove, by all sorts of inquiries, that the statements made were true. I have quite a budget of that kind of matter; but my time is limited, and there is another subject to which I desire to refer. </para>
                <para>Agricultural Bureau. On the 27th May, in the House, the Leader of the Opposition made some statements in reference to the Agricultural Bureau Bill. Some of my honorable friends on this side, who knew that I had looked up the record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> asked me to have the facts placed on record, so that they might be accessible whenever necessary. The figures may not sound very interesting, but under the circumstances I ask honorable members to bear with me. The reading of the facts I have tabulated will be very convincing. The Leader of the Opposition on the date mentioned said - </para>
                <para>The substantial fact remains, and cannot be rebutted, that every effort to pass an Agricultural Bureau Bill has been strangled by honorable members opposite, and I wish to put this on record because it will be useful in the near future. </para>
                <para>The right honorable gentleman further said - </para>
                <para>I made a statement at Maryborough which was wrong in one small detail. I said that every effort that had been made to pass the Agricultural Bureau Bill had been defeated by the Labour party. . . . The only particular in which I was incorrect was in the statement that the Bill had not left this Chamber. As a matter of fact, the Bill had left this Chamber on the day before Parliament was prorogued. In those circumstances, I think, I might well have been forgiven for making that small mistake. The honorable members who prevented that Bill from reaching the statute-book were the supporters of the party now in power. I say, moreover, that the honorable members on the Government side of the House have defeated every effort to date to place a similar measure on the statute-book. That statement cannot be controverted. </para>
                <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition very cleverly confuses events, and refers to statements that were made when the Agricultural Bureau Bill was previously before the House. To be fair, he should have confined himself to the effort that he said was made by his party to pass that Bill during the session they were in power. The records show that it was the Liberal party that, in the 1913 session - the last term they were in office - evidently had no sincere desire to promote this Bill; and this I can prove from the records. The Leader of the Opposition, in his policy speech at Parramatta, reported in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">DailyTelegraph</inline> of 16th July, 1914, said- </para>
                <para class="block">It is with infinite regret, and not a little disgust, that I have to announce that the Bill to establish a 'Federal Agricultural Bureau is still among the proposals for legislation. It should have been on the statute-book, and would have been there but for the determination to prevent it on the part of the Senate. </para>
                <para>In the Senate, of course, the Labour party had a majority. The facts are that the Government made no serious effort to go on with the measure until the day before the House adjourned for Christmas in 1913. There was only about nineteen hours' debate on all stages of the Bill, and the time was almost equally divided between Liberal and Labour members.

                    <para>. - My reason for rising at the present time is to draw the attention of the Government and the Minister of Home Affairs to what I consider to be an improper as well as an illegal regulation that has been framed and issued by the Government, I presume, with the assistance of the Crown Law officers; because it seems to me that it is not in accordance with the law. I refer to the regulation dealing with the appointment of temporary employees in the Public Service. The regulation states that any temporary appointments shall be given to those who are members of a trade union or industrial organization ; that is to say, shall be given to them in the first place. The object and spirit of the Public Service Act is to remove patronage of Ministers, influence of members of Parliament, and influence of all sorts generally from the Public Service, and to intrust all appointments to a Commissioner, who is supposed to be removed entirely from political life, and to be in a position to deal with appointments on merit alone, subject to no influence from Ministers and members of Parliament or any other person. That was the intention of the Legislature when the Public Service Bill was introduced in the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901. I have taken the trouble to refer to what was said on that occasion; and, as I recognised that the quoting of what was said by persons no longer in the House, or persons not in the present Ministry, would be of little use, I looked up what had been said on the subject by the present Attorney-General when the Bill was under discussion in 1901. A change seems to have come o'er the spirit of his dream since those days. </para>

                        <para>- Probably it may be so in his case. Under the present policy of the Labour Government, appointments of temporary employees in the Public Service no longer depend upon merit, but upon favoritism and preference. The realization of this has come as a great shock to me. I have had experience of Ministerial life: but I had no idea that under our Public Service Act I had the right to influence the appointment of persons to the Public Service. I knew the object the Legislature had in view, and knew the law as it was passed. The present Attorney-General must have held the same views as I in 1901, as he said, as recorded on page 1628, <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard,</inline> 1901, when dealing with the Bill which had been introduced, first, that it was " most eminently undesirable to give the Ministry political power in the Public Service"; and then went on to say exactly what I thought then, and still think, and what I believed everybody thought, though it seems it is not now so - </para>

                <para>We all want appointments to be made on the merits of the case, so that there shall be no influence, political, bureaucratic or social, and that the right man may be appointed to the right place. </para>
                <para class="block">Shortly afterwards, he further said that " to set up a political tribunal would be disastrous to the Service." Those were the views I held; and, as I say, it has come as a great shock to me to learn that this principle, which has been in force for so many years - ever since the establishment of the Commonwealth - has been departed from by the present Government. It is section 40 of the original Public Service Act which provides for temporary employment. This section reads - </para>
                <para>Whenever, in the opinion of the Minister of a Department, the prompt despatch of the business of a Department renders temporary assistance necessary, and the Commissioner is unable to provide such assistance from other Departments in the State in 'which such assistance is required, the permanent head or the chief officer shall select in such manner as may be prescribed- </para>

                <para class="block">The governing words of the section are "as appear to be best qualified for such work," and any regulation based upon the subsidiary words " as may be prescribed " cannot interfere with them. There is a clear direction in the Statute that the selection of employees must be from those who " appear to be best qualified for the work." Regulations were framed under section 40 of the Public Service Act, and regulation 121, which dealt with this question of temporary employment, repeated almost word for word section 40 of the Act. It is as follows: - </para>
                <para>Whenever, in the opinion of the Minister, the business of a Department renders temporary assistance necessary, the permanent head or the chief officer shall select, in order of registration as far as possible, having regard to the nature of the work, from the persons whose names are upon the register in the State in which such assistance is required, such available person or persons as appear to be best qualified for such work. </para>
                <para class="block">Almost the very words of the Statute are repeated. That has been the mode of appointing temporary employees in the Public Service until very recently. My excuse for speaking to-night is that I was nob aware, until to-day, of what the Government had actually done in this regard. I knew that a rule had been established giving preference to members of trade unions or industrial organizations, but I was not aware of the way in which it had been done. I am sure honorable members on both sides of the chamber will be astonished to hear that, as a result of my inquiries, I found that regulation 121, founded on the very words of the Statute, namely, " that the persons selected should be the best qualified for the work," has been so altered that these words have been omitted from the new regulation that has come into force. Why were these words omitted ? The new regulation reads - </para>
                <para>In the selection of temporary assistants, under section 40 of the Act, preference shall be given, other things being equal - </para>
                <para class="block">But the words " other things being equal " cannot override the terms of the Statute. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I hold that this regulation, which purports to direct that members of trade unions shall have preference irrespective of whether they are the best qualified applicants or not, is legally not worth the paper upon which it is printed. To declare by regulation that, no matter how incompetent a mau may be, he shall have preference for employment in the Commonwealth Service over a better qualified man because he is a member of a trade union, is absolutely contrary both to the letter aud spirit of the Statute. The contention of the Minister of External Affairs that the words " as appear best qualified for such work " have been omitted because they are superfluous is a very weak one. Why did the Government cancel the old regulation <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- There is no reason why a trade unionist should not receive a Government appointment. He has as much right to consideration as has anybody else, but he has no more. The Statute does not declare that the man best qualified. for any position shall not be a unionist. If the regulation is valid the Government might frame a regulation affirming that only an adherent of the Church of England, or the Baptist Church, or the Roman Catholic Church, should receive an appointment in the Commonwealth Service.

                        <para>- It is perfectly true anyhow. If any one offends the Labour party he is never forgiven. However, I do not wish to say anything offensive, and I withdraw it if I have done so. I ask whether it is right for the Government, with a Public Service Act such' as we have, to order the Public Service Commissioner to frame such a regulation for the carrying out of his responsible and independent powers or . duties under the Act ? I know the Public Service Commissioner pretty well, and have always found him to be an upright, independent, honorable man, most anxious to do his duty to the best of his ability. I confidently make the statement that I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> of his own motion ever framed such a regulation as that to which I have referred, and" must, therefore, have been directed to do so by the Government. If he was directed to do so, and I believe he was, the action of the Government was absolutely wrong and illegal, being contrary to the Public Service Act. .It imports political influence into the administration of the Public Service in a way which I very much regret, and which, in my opinion, cannot be defended. </para>

I have taken the responsibility, in conjunction with - the Minister of Defence, of taking further action, involving considerable expenditure, which will provide for the future.

                <para>Small Arms Factory. The question of duplicating the present capacity of the Small Arms Factory has been under consideration for some time, and meanwhile inquiries were made regarding the additional plant required. The Government having decided to proceed with the duplication, an order for the bulk of the necessary machines has been placed with the Pratt, Whitney Company, the firm that supplied the existing rifle-making plant, at an approximate cost of about £48,000. Further machines and tools, at an estimated cost of £3,700, are to be obtained from other sources, and it is anticipated that nearly all bf. these will be made or obtained in Australia. The placing of an order for duplicate plant was also recommended in a report by the Public Works Committee. </para>

The probability is that some of it will be landed in six months, whilst, according to the reports of our advisers in London, it was anticipated that it would take a year or more to provide the necessary plant.

                        <para>- The States have received an amount equivalent to that which we have received on account of the war loan of £18,000,000. We get ours for nothing, and they pay for theirs at a lower rate than they could get it at otherwise. I desire again to take this opportunity of thanking the private financial institutions for the manner in which they came forward to meet the crisis, for their own advantage as well as for the advantage of the nation. The emergency was met by the use of the national credit, which is, I think, safe beyond any dreams of trouble. It was the desire of the Government at the time not to borrow any money at all for war expenditure. It was obvious that what we are doing now could have been done without borrowing at all ; but at that time it was impossible for the States to borrow, and it was impossible for the Commonwealth itself at the time to borrow except for war purposes. Both private institutions and Governments were in a high state of tension lest their credit should fail at the period when they wanted money. I have secret documents with me, which can be seen if there is any doubt in the matter, to show that it became absolutely necessary that credit should be got in London for the purposes of the Commonwealth and State Governments. An arrangement was made with the consent of all parties for the Commonwealth to pledge its credit, not at first for war purposes, but ultimately for war purposes, because that was the only way in which we could get the money. We told the British Government frankly at the time the whole story of our troubles, and they raised the money for us. ' The Commonwealth gets the loan, and in turn lends to the States an equivalent amount. The agreement is that, whatever the price of the loan may be, the States,, on receiving the money from us, pay interest for the time being, at a rate agreed upon, but that when the Commonwealth comes to borrow money for its own purposes to an amount equivalent to the total £18,000,000 to be lent to the States, if the interest is then higher than the amount which the States are paying, the States shall  indemnify  the Commonwealth the difference. That was a perfectly fair and legitimate bargain for the mutual advantage of both parties. </para>

                        <para>- I think my right honorable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, might have refrained from that interjection, because honorable members behind me understood the note issue when it was inaugurated, and they do not get excited when they are told of its success, that being nothing new to them. Be that as it may, there is no citizen of Australia who does not appreciate the fact that, by our own credit, and without the shadow of a doubt or difficulty, we have been able practically to avoid raising another £20,000,000 upon which we would have had to pay interest, and without being in any  way  helped further forward than we are under present conditions. I take this opportunity of saying to the Committee that I hope to have an early opportunity of making a Budget statement forecasting, as far as can be seen, the financial position for the next half-year, and providing for any eventualities that may arise. In a Democracy like ours, with an educated and free people, it is the business of Ministers to lay the financial position before them at the earliest opportunity; and I shall endeavour, on behalf of the Government, to do so. I am sure that whatever view honorable gentlemen opposite may take of it, I shall be able to claim their assistance in giving effect to the policy of this country for the prosecution of the war, the carrying on of our industries, and the protection of our own people. </para>

                        <para>- There you are again ! The honorable member is only saying over again what his Leader said the other night, that we never gave the Government any assistance except in a nagging way. Whether we nag or not, this assistance is sought, and I hope it will always be freely rendered. I want now to congratulate my honorable friends over there on the unanimous cheer that went up just now when the possible limitation of the note issue was mentioned, and when they were warned by their own Prime Minister of the dangers of an unlimited note issue. May I suggest that the war has done one good thing ? It has heaved overboard that old-time notion, of the invulnerability of a note issue, which honorable members opposite preached assiduously over the length and breadth of this country. A little practical application of the principle has knocked all that nonsense out of their heads, and I congratulate them sincerely on their financial conversion, at any rate. </para>

                <para>Now, I want to say a word of congratulation concerning the magnificent revenue which has been derived from Customs and Excise during this war year. Is this not the best of all tributes to the might and invulnerability of the British Navy, which has kept our seaways open for us, with the result that our trade has been unmolested from the beginning until the end of the year ? I remember, when this war broke out, that the officials of the Treasury wore an aspect of gloom for some days, and they were talking of having no revenue, if the war lasted, by the end of the year. Thanks, however, to the way in which Jellicoe has kept the seas open, there has been no diminution in our Customs revenue, which means that our  activities  have flowed on, as usual, our commerce has been borne over the sea without let or hindrance, it has reached its market at the other side of the world, and in return we received those things which we need for our own use. For this we ought to be profoundly thankful as we close the financial year. To my mind, that is the outstanding feature of the financial statement which has been made by the Prime Minister. There is just on© other matter upon which I would like the attention of the Prime Minister for a moment. As I follow his figures here, I take it that the result of the year's financing - I mean the ordinary financing, and eliminating the war altogether - is that we have spent, roughly, £1,500,000 more than we received. </para>

                        <para>- Altogether, we can congratulate ourselves, notwithstanding this criticism which I am making. I am trying to get at the facts, for this reason. We ought to remember that in war time all special expenditure arising out of the war should be met generously and without question. But that only lays upon us a greater obligation to see that our ordinary administrative expenditure is kept to the lowest possible point The more we can save reasonably and consistently with efficiency on the ordinary administration, the more we shall have to spend for special war administration. Those two things are being kept separately, as they ought to be. They show here that there is a very steady increase in the cost of ordinary administration, leaving out the war altogether.' They show, too, that, notwithstanding the additional taxation which the Government have imposed during the year, they have gone to the bacl on the year's financing to the tune of nearly a million sterling. All this needs careful financing, so that we may not go further to the rear. In the meantime, our income has kept up; it i3 better than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and the intrusion of the war has not materially altered the revenue from Customs duties and other sources. All that is a magnificent tribute to our defensive resources, looking at the Empire as a whole. I cannot sit down without making mention, also, of the way in which our own defence preparation, particularly in' respect to the Australian Navy, has helped to keep the seas open during this terrible year. T want to make another remark about the Small Arms Factory. I have read the new proposal of the Government, and I want to say that I do not object to them duplicating the plant, but I do hope that my right honorable friend will not rely on the duplicated plant for much relief during this war time. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am afraid that the months will lengthen out in connexion with the duplication, if not to the same extent as the original duration, yet to a very considerable time beyond what I hope will be the termination of the war. At any rate, I trust that the Government will not make that an excuse for staying their hand in any way concerning the full utilization of the means already at their disposal in the Factory. </para>

                        <para>- Not only are there in Australia experts who say quite the contrary, but the opinion of a practical working engineer there is, I think, in this matter, as valuable as that of any expert. I would just as soon take the opinion of the man who is associated with the machinery every day, arid knows what it can do, as the opinion of any one else. He knows what he can do, and he has told the Government that they ought to have had two shifts long ago. The point I got up to stress is that the Government ought not to rely on the duplicated plant for any relief during the war. They will be building on an insecure foundation if they do. Let them lose not a minute in their preparation for running the Factory all the twenty-four hours, with all the trained experience and ability that is already in Australia, and is placed freely and unreservedly at their disposal. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that lie will get a  move on;  that is all. We have a plant here, and the Government's own chairman says in his report that it can supply, and ought to supply, 20,000 rifles per annum on the basis of an eight hours' shift. I do not see any reason why, in these stressful days, the Factory should not very soon work up to an output for three shifts of 50,000 rifles per annum. There is hope in that direction. There is not very much immediate hope here. </para>

                    <para>.- The financial statement presented by the Treasurer to-night must afford to every member of the House, as well as to the public generally, considerable satisfaction. The knowledge that we have financed the ordinary governmental Departments of Australia, and finished with a surplus of £347.000, is a matter for very sincere congratulation. But perhaps the most cheering and satisfactory feature of the whole statement, is that, for actual war expenditure, Australia has been able to finance itself. The Prime Minister need have no hesitation in believing that there is still left, in Australia an amount of capital available for carrying on the war if necessary, or at any rate, for carrying on the work of the Government in every Department. If the Treasurer will give the people an opportunity, I believe that their patriotism will find its outlet in rendering financial assistance to the Government during this time of crisis. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that  they will in time. The Leader of the Opposition is not generally charged with possessing any humour; but it was decidedly amusing to notice the cool and assured way in which he referred to the surplus of £1,222,000 which he left to the present Government. It forces one's mind back to the end of 1913, when the Labour Government left £2,600,000 in the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- 'Even so, the functions of our Government have extended, as the right honorable member himself has admitted. Our expenditure on defence has greatly increased, and the increased expenditure on pensions and the maternity allowance alone would almost account for the difference to. which he has referred. But I heartily agree with him in the statement that the expenditure of all our Departments needs careful attention and supervision. I am convinced that in the Defence Department the country is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds annually. I am prepared to believe that by the military contracts entered into in the early stages of the war, and to some extent even now, the country has been made to pay for services that have not been rendered, and to give high prices for inferior goods. I believe that the supervision exercised by the defence officers is not satisfactory, and that, generally speaking, these officers are incapable of managing financial matters. </para>

I am not prepared to say that our officers are corrupt, but some of their transactions are open to suspicion, and we shall not get satisfaction in the supply of military requirements until business matters have been taken out of the hands of the defence officers. </para>

                        <para>- No; but they are put in charge of business concerns. I was told some time ago that in the calling for tenders for materials connected with the management of horses, the Imperial specifications were followed so closely that stable forks, such as are used in the Old Country for the laying out of straw beds, were ordered, and that to-day some thousands of forks and rakes lie at the barracks - merely useless lumber. There is no consideration of value and finance in the administration of the Defence Department. For this I do not blame the Minister; he is altogether overloaded. The country expects one man to do more than two should be expected to do, particularly at this juncture. </para>

                        <para>- Eighteen months or two years. The Leader of the Opposition is correct in stating that the new machinery which has been ordered for the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow will not increase the output of rifles during the war, unless the war lasts much longer than we anticipate. It will probably be at least six months before that machinery reaches here, and, if it is turning out new rifles within a year, that is all that can be expected.I agree with those who complain about the condition of affairs at Lithgow. The remedy is to get new management. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright's</inline> term of office does nob expire too soon, and personally I am glad that he is going. Privately, he is an estimable gentleman, but his conduct of affairs at the Factory cannot be regarded as satisfactory by the Government or by the country. I am not so concerned about his failure to do the work of the Factory - he has an airy and easy way of explaining why certain things were not done, why rifles were not produced - what I am more concerned about is the perpetuation of the trouble. The assistant manager has been appointed acting manager in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright's</inline> place, the latter being due to leave very soon. " God speed the parting guest !" </para>

The State Parliament has adjourned, and appointed a Committee, which is working in conjunction with the mayors of all municipalities throughout the State. Federal members are being requested to attend meetings, and I ask the Prime Minister to take into consideration the adjournment of this House over next week. </para>
