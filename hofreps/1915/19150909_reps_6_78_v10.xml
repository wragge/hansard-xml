                    <para>- In yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was published a letter addressed to the editor on the subject of the Aspirin trade mark, of which I propose to read a paragraph to correct a misapprehension which might otherwise be created regarding myself.

                    <para>While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> is devoting so much attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blau,</inline> it may not be out of place to inquire who is behind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> relative to the Aspirin question? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> stated in the House on Monday that - " Aspirin could be manufactured in England." Will <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> produce his authority for this statement, and enlighten the public as to the name of the person, firm, or corporation who has discovered the process, and whose product answers all the tests of the Bayer genuine German Aspirin ? I do not refer to the impure drug with which the English market has been flooded, and with which an attempt is being made to exploit the Australian public, but pure Aspirin which will conform to the test prescribed by the recognised authority. </para>

                <para>Nobody is behind me in this matter; I have merely stated a fact that is well known to all doctors. In the <inline font-style="italic">Digest of the New and More Important Features of the British Pharmacopoeia</inline> 1914, the British equivalent is given of the trade name of various German proprietary drugs, the synonym for the German production " Aspirin " being acid acetylsalicylicum. This compound is produced under the following trade names :  - Aspirin, acetosal, acetysal, salacctin, saletin, and xaxa, and it is also known as empirin. All these are names for the one synthetic chemical. The letter to which I have referred, asking why I have stated this simple fact, is evidence of either the frantic desire of Germans to bolster up "goodwill " in this trade, or the wish of a local producer to exploit the market. </para>

On making representations, we have had similar embargoes lifted, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, and I shall certainly ask that the prohibition referred to be removed. </para>

He states that all the information they receive as to the doings of the outer world are contained in a small newspaper called the <inline font-style="italic">Peninsular Press,</inline> a copy of which I hold in my hand, and that the mail service is extremely bad. The letter was written on the 21st July last. I should like to know if, after months of complaining, anything has been done in Egypt to rectify the mismanagement there ? </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be much better if this statement by the Prime Minister were read when the matter to which it relates is again before the House. But I should like to point out again that the House is getting into such a loose manner of doing business that it is almost impossible for me or any other Speaker to conduct the proceedings of the Chamber in a proper way. By leave this, that, and the other thing is done, and the result is that the Standing Orders are brushed aside in all sorts of ways. The Attorney-General asked for leave to make a statement, and that leave was granted. I did not know the nature of the statement, but as soon as the Attorney-General commenced to read it, exception was taken. If the House were to conduct its business in accordance with the Standing </para>

                    <para>Orders, difficulties of this kind could not arise. I ask honorable members to consider if it is not possible to carry on the business in a regular way. The statement which the Attorney-General wishes to read is practically an argument in favour of a motion appearing on the notice-paper, and I think the honorable member can put forward the Prime Minister's views when that motion is before the House. </para>

For. years endeavours have been made by both the State and Federal authorities to improve the ventilation of this building. </para>

                        <para>- I, and I think the  President  also, received a letter from the honorable member for East Sydney suggesting the possibility of some alteration, but it is difficult for me to decide a matter of this kind. All the experts available in Victoria have dealt with the question of ventilation. As the building does not belong to the Commonwealth, any alteration must be made through the State authorities, and the State authorities say they have tried everything possible to improve the ventilation. </para>

                        <para>- The power of the Commonwealth in this matter is somewhat doubtful, but I think it will be generally accepted as most desirable that there should be some control and supervision over the various war funds. To what extent that supervision should go I am not in a position to say definitely, but the Prime Minister has already given considerable attention to the matter, and I understand that he proposes to approach the various State Governments on the subject. The Premiers will meet in conference either this we'ek or next week, and I shall see that the matter is brought forward in order that some common action may be adopted. </para>

I thought that I made it clear that it was not the intention of the Government to proceed except with the co-operation of the States, and that that could best be secured by approaching the State Premiers. I shall be very glad if the War Committee can supply the Government with its suggestions, so that we may have them before us when we approach the Premiers. </para>

I am not aware of being influenced by the Act myself, but I have noticed that the population has increased in a most satisfactory way. I may say that there is no gloom in my own house, but very much the contrary. </para>

                        <para>- With further reference to our soldiers, I wish to ask the Minister for the Navy a question, without notice, on the subject of the non-payment, not merely of men in the trenches, but of men in hospitals. A case was brought under my notice only yesterday of a young man who had been in hospital for between three and four months, and had never received1s. of his pay during all that time. I should like to know what is the rule with regard to the payment of soldiers at the front, and when in hospital. Instead of replying to separate questions on this subject, the Minister for the Navy, as representing the Minister of Defence, might make a statement to the House as to the system adopted in dealing with these payments. Are men while in hospitals supposed to receive any pay at all, and, if so, why do they not receive it? The same inquiry has to be made with respect to allotments of pay by men who have gone to the front. Their relatives are not receiving these allotments. Why? </para>

                        <para>- It appears that the hospitals in Egypt and elsewhere to which wounded soldiers are sent are under the control of the Imperial authorities. I have heard that a regulation has been passed by the Imperial Officer-Commanding that no pay is to be given to soldiers while in hospitals. The regulation is the result of certain things that have transpired. It would appear that some of the wounded soldiers have been using their money for the purchase of things that are detrimental to their health. These have been brought into hospitals without the knowledge of the medical officers or nurses, and injury has followed to the patients. A regulation was issued in consequence, stopping the pay of the men while in hospitals. Of course, they receive their pay immediately they leave the hospitals. With regard to the other portion of the right honorable gentleman's question, I shall see whether a statement dealing generally with the matter cannot be prepared by the Minister of Defence. </para>

                                promised me that a certain man who has been fearfully treated in the Base Hospital would not be arrested for breaking the bounds of the hospital. Relying upon that, I told a committee of my constituents to quietly secure the facts of the case for me and I would see whether I could have the matter remedied. In spite of his distinct promise, the Defence Department sent an ambulance last night at 11 o'clock to remove this man from a private hospital. Two doctors had been there from 8 o'clock to 10.30 o'clock, and yet an ambulance was sent round at 11 o'clock to take the man back to that infernal Base Hospital. I now ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, to assure me, on the floor of this House, that this unfortunate man, who has been falsely accused of malingering, will not be arrested and taken back to the Base Hospital?

                            <para>. I have never in the twenty-five years of my political life had to deal with a sadder case than that which I am now bringing before the attention of this House. If the usual meeting of the Caucus had been held I would have brought the matter up there, and if I had not received a more definite answer than that with which the Minister for the Navy has been supplied by his colleague, I would later have brought it before the House. In the last resort, the appeal of the people is to Parliament. The safety of the individual citizen depends to a great extent upon the protection of this Parliament. I pledge my honour to men who have known me for twenty-five years when I say that the doctor who says that this man is malingering is mistaken. This man has been tortured in the Base Hospital, and such treatment would have been justified only if he were a malingerer. I propose to read out a statement which I have here, and which I sent to the Minister of De fence. God only knows what is the matter with the Minister. It may be that swelled head has made him grow so big that if his feet were in hell his head would reach the clouds. I do not know what is the matter, but there must be something wrong with the man when he will not permit his human feelings to influence him, and refuses an inquiry by the best surgeons in Melbourne who have offered their services without fee or reward. Why should he not have asked one of these men to examine this man ? </para>

                                <para>- He is  a  man who fought under the British flag throughout the South African war, and also in China. He volunteered here, and was accepted for service. He was kicked in the back by a horse, and was picked up, I think, by the nephew of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Madden. He was taken to a hospital in Egypt, and was under the treatment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Springthorpe,</inline> one of the ablest of our medical men, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fred</inline> Bird, a surgeon whose equal has never been in the Base Hospital. He was sent back here and taken into the Base Hospital. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> may have thought that he was malingering, and he subjected him to the torture of electricity. The man said he was not a malingerer. Imagine a medical man having a patient court martialled ! Yet that is what was done in the case of this man. Thank God, the officers who constituted the Court were men of common sense. I think that the  chairman  was Captain Cox Taylor, of whom, I understand, Ministers have a high opinion, and the decision of the Court was that the man was wrongly accused of malingering by the doctor. A number of my constituents asked me to take up the case. They told me that two doctors were prepared to say that the man was not  a  malingerer, and I said that  I  was willing to accept their opinion. I then played the game fairly, and went to see <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade.</inline> I told him that the matter had been brought under my notice and that  I  came to him, not as a medical man, because I had given up practice, and now only supervised a dispensary. I said that this was a serious case, which had been brought under my notice by my constituents, and I was willing that he should see all the cards. I stated the facts as  I  have detailed them here. I propose to read the statement to which I have referred  so that honorable members will be able to see it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> When I referred to the decision of the court martial, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> said that we could not expect soldiers to understand a medical question. The court martial was composed of common-sense men, and they were right 'and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> was wrong. From that time onward Perry's life was a misery. Then his friend visited the hospital  and carried him away to his little tome in West Melbourne. Subsequently I asked the Minister of Defence for an assurance that Perry would not be arrested and returned to the hospital for having broken bounds. I told him that if this unfortunate man was arrested I would call a public meeting to protest- against the scandalous treatment meted out to him. Having obtained the Minister's promise in t the matter, I relied upon it. Honorable members have heard the answer given by the Minister for the Navy this morning to the effect that no promise has been broken - that the man is to be taken before the Medical Board. If that be so, why was he to be removed at 11 o'clock last night ? Do medical boards meet in the night time? I would rather go out of political life than have my views on this matter stifled. I know that honorable members upon both sides of the Chamber are anxious to prevent the perpetration of any infamy. In England, admission to the rank of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons can be obtained only after passing the most severe examination that is conducted within the confines of the Empire. Nevertheless an average of marks carries a candidate through it. But for  admission to the British Army, in the capacity of a surgeon, if there are a hundred vacancies there may be 2,000 applicants at one time, and the examination being a competitive one, a much higher degree of knowledge is necessary to achieve success. </para>

                                <para>- No; he left the Base Hospital. I intend to read his own statement in regard to the matter. I may add that this is not the first case of extreme hardship which has been brought under my notice, and which I have attempted to get remedied without first ventilating it  on the floor of the House. The following letter from Perry was addressed to me under date 27th May last, although it did not reach me until quite a long time afterwards: - 58 Walsh-street, West Melbourne, 27th May, 1915. </para>

                        <para>I beg to complain that I am a patient in the Base Hospital, St. Kilda-road, invalided by the Medical Board in Egypt, with paralysis, caused by a kick in the spine from the doctor's horse in Egypt. </para>
                        <para>For the sisters and hospital treatment generally I have the highest feeling of gratitude and praise. </para>
                        <para>Such medical officers as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fred</inline> Bird, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Springthorpe,</inline> and others of like repute, tried every means of getting me to use my legs; all to no avail until the latter end of my time in Egypt, so I was invalided home. This <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade,</inline> at the Base Hospital, from my very first acquaintance with him, told me that I was a malingerer, a schemer, an impostor, a crawler, and all that is base and indecent, though <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> has never advanced any motives for me being in the state I am in. His arrogant manner was overbearing and cruel in the extreme. </para>
                        <para>I fought my way, sir, in Africa, with the Naval Brigade through Belmont,  Ensign  Modder River,  Magersfontein,  siege of Kimberley, and the storming of Pekin, in China, and  I resented  this doctor's imputation. No complaint or entreaty will induce him to give me humane treatment. His antagonism was unbearable, and one morning I respectfully told him so; he there and then determined to have me court martialled for being a schemer; but, in the face of the medical testimony of the medical gentlemen whom I have mentioned, I was found by the court martial not guilty. T was discharged without a stain on my character; but my health in the same wretched state. Where can I go or what can I do for succour? His attitude towards me was worse than ever. He became livid in the face and white with passion, and came to me denouncing the gentlemen of the court martial as a set of blockheads. </para>
                        <para>I would be better dead, sir, than have to submit to this kind of treatment, so I decided to apply to get out of it to go to my home. My request was refused, so I got a friend with a motor car to get me out in the middle of the night. I expect to be punished for this, but he will heap no more insults on my body until I get better. </para>
                        <para>When we landed from Egypt we were allowed to bring ashore £10 worth of Egyptian goods. Many men had them stolen nt the hospital, mine included. When I complained to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> he only laughed. He said he wanted to hear no complaints or comments, or we would find ourselves in the cells. </para>
                        <para>In a most flagrant manner our clothing is being sold by some one for small sums to men from Broadmeadows. Now, dear sir, I am not seeking to be vindictive, but I waB induced by the doctor attending me now to write to you. </para>
                        <para>Hoping that you will see that I get a square deal without unnecessary fuss. I can substantiate all I have said to the hilt. </para>
                        <para>I am no stranger here in union and political circles. The reasons I advance for complaining arc humane, not political or influence-seeking. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that the poor woman has any children. I made inquiries over the telephone, and, unfortunately for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I heard a big hearty laugh from him, and the words, "He is a malingerer." I knew that charge to be false; and if I expressed myself as any man would do under the circumstances, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> feels offended, I can only offer him the chance of what satisfaction he requires. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> over the telephone that I had acted in this matter purely as a politician, and, further, that if any man said that this soldier was a malingerer that man was a liar. On my sacred honour as a man, I declare that any man who says that this soldier is a malingerer, is a liar and a cowardly liar at that. I do not know whether I have done what is right, but I have sent to have this soldier removed from his place; and I have received a sign since I began to speak that he has been removed. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> dares to take this man away, I am willing to fight on his behalf while I have breath in my body. We have heard about a Board to be appointed, but I ask whether Boards meet at night time ? Why was an ambulance sent at 11 o'clock at night for this man ? I am willing to find medical evidence of the highest in support of what I have said. There are, of course, very few great surgeons left in Melbourne today, most of them having offered their services for the war without fee or reward; and yet such a medical man as I have described is allowed control of this hospital. In this respect, things are managed very differently in England, and in every other part of the world. Would it ever enter the head of any humane person in such circumstances to apply electricity as a test? In such a case, if the patient were not a malingerer, the application of electricity would be absolute torture. </para>

                                <para>- He was examined by two doctors, also a magistrate, who said to me, " Any one who says that he is a malingerer does not know what he is talking about." One of the highest surgeons in Melbourne - whose name I could mention but do not like to do so without his permission - would not think of taking any fee for examining this man, and he declared him to be not malingering. We have been promised time after time in this House that every wounded or injured soldier sent back would be paid 6s. a day with board and medical attendance if necessary. Has that promise been kept by the Minister? I have, I think, said sufficient to show that there is a case for investigation; and I only wish that it could be submitted to the Committee that has been formed from both sides of the House, with a view to independent surgical examination. It is a matter which I think ought to be taken out of the hands of this Minister, who is only a jelly fish - a rubber stamp - in matters of this kind. Proud as I am of my position here, and glorying in the love of my fellow-men and fellow-women in the city of Melbourne, I would rather be put of political life for the rest of my existence than stand and see this infamy perpetrated. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> believes the doctor who says this man is malingering, and the honorable gentleman has the pluck to resign his position, I also am willing to resign, so as to contest the constituency of Melbourne against him, where the citizens may see the man. I am sorry to have to speak thus of a man with whom I have been friendly - a colleague for whom I have voted - but to see this poor woman, as I have seen her to-day and on other occasions, is enough to make any one take up weapons and fight. I trust that the press will make this case widely known; and I only hope that this House will not adjourn or go into recess just now. We can fight for people on the floor of the House: but what chance would I have had with the Defence Department, under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> if Parliament had not been sitting ? </para>

                            <para>. - The case presented by the honorable member for Melbourne is one which, I am sure, must appeal to the sympathy of every honorable member, no matter on what side of the House he may sit. If the allegations, or even a portion of them, can be substantiated - if anything like such treatment has been meted out to a patient, especially one returned from the front- I am sure there is no one here who will not support the honorable member for Melbourne in demanding the fullest investigation by an impartial tribunal. If, as I say, the statements are substantiated, a case will have been established that will certainly necessitate the removal from the military service of the officer responsible. Personally, I have no knowledge whatever of the medical man referred to ; and up to the present, of course, we have heard only one side. There may be something to be said on the other side which may put a different complexion on the matter, but if the facts are as have been stated there certainly should be an independent inquiry by a small Committee of this House. Further consideration ought to be given to the suggestion that a Committee should be appointed for the purpose of visiting the various military hospitals in each State in order to hear complaints, and see whether proper treatment is meted out to the soldiers. It would be advisable for the Government to request honorable members who are at liberty to do so to place their services at their disposal, and act on such Committees. I do not propose that there should be any fees paid for such services. Honorable members would be only too glad to serve in that capacity voluntarily. I should be willing to act on those terms. We are all anxious to see that justice is meted out, not only to the soldiers who are in our camps prior to going to the front, but also to those who are returning from the front, and especially that every consideration is given to those who return wounded or incapacitated in any way. If it should be thought that when they return from the front they will not be properly treated it will have a disastrous effect on recruiting for reinforcements. For this reason, apart from all other considerations, the Government should certainly take prompt and effective steps in order to preclude the possibility of there being any serious ground for such complaints as we have heard in the House to-day. </para>

                            <para>.- I support the request of the honorable member for Melbourne that there should be an impartial inquiry into the case brought forward to-day. The honorable member spoke under deep emotion, and those who know him well knew that he would not have brought the matter before the House in such a dramatic manner had he not investigated to the best of his ability all the facts relating to it. The man to whom he referred had fought on two former occasions under the colours of the King. I do not think that a man who has passed through so many campaigns can be described as a crawler or a malingerer. I hope that the  Acting  Prime Minister will promise an early investigation. I know that it is a delicate matter to interfere with the Defence Department, and I am prepared to accept the judgment of the honorable member as to the procedure that should be followed; but speaking with some knowledge of the hospitals of Victoria, I maintain that Ministers would be adopting a wrong policy in permitting our military hospitals to remain absolutely under the control of military or medical officials. The public would be better satisfied if some civil authority were united with the military and medical control. </para>

                            <para>.- We should insist on a strict inquiry, not only into the allegation of the honorable member for Melbourne, but also in regard to the whole administration of our Base Hospital. Quite recently I brought under the attention of the Minister of Defence a matter which came under my notice in connexion with this hospital. A friend of mine who had enlisted, and was in the Seymour Camp, was supposed to have contracted meningitis, and was sent to the Base Hospital on a Saturday morning. He had telegraphed to his friends on the Friday evening, and they had communicated with a friend in Melbourne, asking him to go to the hospital and see the lad. </para>

If this soldier returned in the state described by the honorable member  - if he was injured in the spine as the result of a kick by a horse - there is no doubt in my mind as to the responsibility of the Government concerning him; but it appears that he was discharged at the request of the honorable member for Melbourne. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says the honorable member did. The question of Perry malingering in the hospital needs to be thoroughly inquired into, and I should say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> ought to have an inquiry by persons not associated with the medical work in the Department at all. That, of course, is a matter for him to decide, but I shall certainly have a consultation with him on the subject. I trust that we shall look at this matter in a quiet and compassionate way, and await further developments. If the statement made by the honorable member for Melbourne is correct, the duty devolves on the Government of seeing that this man and his wife and children are not treated as they have been treated. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not think this is by any means a solitary instance of a man invalided back from Egypt being discharged before any arrangements had been made to give him and his wife and' family a pension. It seems to me a most grave scandal that any one should come back from Egypt ill or invalided from any cause whatever, and that the Defence Department should for any reason discharge him before making, at all events, some effort to see that he was able to earn his own livelihood or to give him means to maintain those dependent on him. That is the principal reason why I spoke a while ago. The Minister has only borne out what I anticipated had been done. If an inquiry is instituted in this case, I hope it will embrace the whole of our Base Hospital organizations first and last, because, although I am not in a position this morning to formulate a series of grave charges against the administration, I have sufficient information in my possession now of a character which I venture to say will be most startling if the investigation bears out the allegations that have reached me from various sources. I trust that if an inquiry is made it will embrace the whole administration of our Base Hospitals, and the whole of the organization of the Army Medical Branch of the Australian Service. If that is done, I think it will satisfy honorable members, and I do not think anything short of it will. </para>

No matter how important they may be, or what interests are involved, we can get no information. J have kept my tongue in my teeth all this session about the Defence Department. </para>

He is a perfect nuisance. Nobody can speak without a constant running fire of comment concerning what is said in the House. There is altogether too much of the honorable member. It would not matter much if what he said were intelligent, but it is not. </para>

                                <para>- As things are, the House knows nothing. Notwithstanding the fact that we have three Ministers administering the Defence Department, no information is obtainable concerning these base hospitals. In all conscience, enough promises have been made. Unless a case like this is sifted to the bottom, and its real merits judged fairly, nothing could be more detrimental to the <inline font-style="italic">morale</inline> of the Department as a whole, and nothing worse for the recruiting movement in Australia. All we ask is that, since three Ministers are controlling the Department the matter should be investigated with reasonable celerity. I suggest to the Ministers that, if they are overburdened with work, they might refer this matter to the War Committee, and let the members of that body inquire into the merits of the case.I have never heard stronger allegations made concerning any complaint brought before this House. </para>

                        <para>Mr.JOSEPH COOK.- If the statements "made are true, somebody ought to be punished severely, and if they are not true, the people making the allegations ought to be dealt with accordingly. If this man turns out to be a malingerer, no punishment could be too severe for him, but we ought to be very careful how we treat a man who is merely believed to be malingering. This man fought through one war, and wanted to fight through another, but was sent home, on the advice of two of the finest doctors at the front, as being incapable of performing further duties, and I say it is an infamy to charge him with being a malingerer without the fullest possible proof. The case ought to be inquired into and sifted to the bottom at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                                <para>- I think the Acting Prime Minister should indicate to the House to-day what his preliminary investigation inclines him to do in this matter. I tell my honorable friend candidly, and without trace of unfriendliness to his colleague - I know that he himself is not personally responsible - that there is a feeling of grave disquiet regarding the Defence Department; that it is thought that if anything has to be set right, an inquiry is instituted by the very persons who are alleged to have set it wrong. If we can be assured that the promised inquiry will be something different, and that it will carry some result, I take it that the House will be perfectly satisfied. We desire results. If you have a crowd of officers working with the absolute knowledge that anything they do will be reported on by themselves, and that no punishment will come upon them in any event, you will have muddle worse confounded as the months go on. If the facts in this case are at all as they have been presented by the honorable member for Melbourne, who, I have no doubt, thoroughly believes what he has told us, one thing is perfectly clear, and that is that the Commonwealth Government should have nothing further to do with the particular officer who has been referred to. I want to be assured, and so do honorable members generally, that something definite and tangible will result from the promised inquiry. </para>

If we had to bring before Parliament every case of complaint, there would be no time for the transaction of the ordinary business of the country. I hope that the promised inquiry will be thorough, that it will be made by an impartial tribunal, and that punishment will be meted out to whomever may be at fault. </para>

I remind the Minister that if our opponents were on the Treasury bench, the party would make a howl should such cases be allowed to continue. We would move the adjournment of the House, and would storm until we got a redress of grievances. The trouble comes about because the  Defence  Department has never been organized. Ministers have not adopted the digest system, which would give them control, and the result is that they are out in the jungle. They have lost track of her; she has got away. I am for the men. </para>

Officers who are not going to the front show absolutely no sympathy with the men. The biggest difficulty with which those who have come back, or are going to the front, have to contend is that caused by the autocratic attitude of officers who remain in Australia and have no sympathy with them. We have frequently brought matters before the Minister, but the procrastination that has been complained of is quite a common thing. </para>

                                <para>- It is inconceivable that a man with Private Perry's splendid record should be a malingerer. I hope that the House will take into consideration the suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava. Let us have an independent tribunal, which can not only deal with this case, but investigate other cases also. Were a Commission or Committee to be appointed to visit the States, and inquire into what takes place, more would be done to encourage recruiting than is achieved by all the platform speaking that we have had. We are not treating those who return from the front, injured, or wounded in warfare, as they should be treated. This is becoming known, and the public are losing confidence in the Defence Department, because people are of opinion that they will not get  a  fair deal when they place a good case before the Department. </para>

My feelings are being continually harrowed by cases that I would hardly believe to be possible, in which men in authority, who should have at heart the interests of those who are sacrificing so much, have treated them indifferently and callously when they have been waited on with genuine grievances. </para>

One has to use his discrimination. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade,</inline> unfortunately, represents a class that is growing in numbers rapidly in the Defence Department. He is only one of many. We shall have to take some firm step to stop the Prussian spirit that is creeping into our Defence administration. Some men, immediately they don a gold braid uniform, consider themselves beings from another planet. Those who come back from the front do not put on as much side as those who have no intention of going to the front. It is the man who intends to stay in Australia who does the most strutting and posing. We should inquire into the methods' of those men,. and stop their proceedings, if we desire to inspire in the people that confidence in our Defence administration which they should have, in view of what it costs. </para>

                            <para>. - I agree with honorable members that the case which has been brought under notice needs investigating to the roots. It seems impossible that, although this case was brought under the notice of the Minister by the honorable member for Melbourne, nothing could be done in regard to it until he had drawn attention to it here. I do not wish to say much about the Defence Department. We are in a very difficult position, and many officers seem to take it on themselves to dictate to every one. There are many who are not carrying out their duties as they should be carried out. I hope that reorganisation will take place at the Base Hospital. I rose to speak of one particular thing which has been brought under my notice in connexion with that hospital. Is it fair that men who have been invalided from Seymour Camp should be required to fall in at Spencer-street and march to the Base Hospital? Surely the Defence Department could meet such men with an ambulance, or provide some other form of transport. I have in mind the case of a man, who certainly is not a grumbler, and who said to me, " We want only a fair chance; I desire to get to the front. I have two brothers fighting in Gallipoli, and if they stop a Turkish bullet they will have done their duty, but I do not desire to die in camp in Australia." This man was invalided from Seymour, being unfit for duty. He and sixteen other men in similar condition were met at Spencer-street by an officer, ordered to fall in and march to the Base Hospital. He and another man refused to march. The other fifteen were obliged to march through the streets to the hospital. That man and his comrade arrived there by tram, and they were not punished. He has since told me that the treatment he received at the hospital was the best he had ever had. He had been discharged from the hospital, had visited his home, and was returning to camp. Invalids from Seymour Camp can hardly be expected to be in a condition after a train journey to march to the Base Hospital. I suggest that they be met with a conveyance of some kind. </para>

                            <para>.- I very much regret that there should be cases such as those which have been brought under notice. But whilst I deeply deplore that action has not been taken by the Defence Department to remedy these wrongs, we must admit that the duties of the Minister of Defence are growing daily. Some excuse must be allowed for the Defence Department. I believe that the Government should remit to the War Committee control of all camps and hospitals, and also recruiting. The Committee has been appointed by both parties, and the entire Parliament has complete confidence in the men selected. More responsibility should be entrusted to the Committee than it has at the present time. Hospitals, camps, and recruiting are co-related matters, and if the Committee were given control of them, subCommittees could be appointed to visit the various camps and make inquiries. If that were done fewer complaints would be brought into the House. Every member  is  receiving a large number of complaints. I have received many, but if every member were to bring forward all the complaints he receives, the business of this Chamber would be confined to the registration of grievances. We cannot expect a big war to be conducted without injustice being done to some persons. </para>

                                <para>- It is easy to find fault. Those men in and out of Parliament who are criticising the Minister would find, if they were in his position, that they would not be able to give satisfaction to everybody. We should realize that fact. I do urge upon the Government that they should remit the matters to which I have referred to the War Committee. We should have confidence in any investigations made by the Committee; the congestion of the business-paper would be relieved, and we should be free to attend to the duties for which we were returned here - the making of laws in the interests of the country. </para>

                        <para>.- This simple little Bill- and there was never a more innocent looking measure presented to the Parliament - raises fundamental questions of the greatest possible importance to the future industrial progress of this country. The words, " together with such other persons, whether engaged in any industrial pursuit or pursuits or not," which appear in clause 2, really initiate a new order of things, unionistic and industrial. It cannot be denied that they strike a blow at the very vitals of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; that they go right into its very core and marrow. The decision that the House has to arrive at in connexion with this small Bill is whether we should keep to the old lines of conciliation and arbitration and industrial unionism or whether we should enter the new path leading to Syndicalism and all that it connotes, so invitingly held out. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, and they are in favour of it at the present time, but they are also in favour of something more. The Australian Workers Union is unlike almost any other union in that its affairs are controlled chiefly by an executive. Nearly every other union holds weekly or fortnightly meetings, at which its affairs are conducted according to old-time notions, and where its officers are subject to criticism, while everything they undertake is open to review. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that I may be permitted to proceed without these frequent interjections. I desire to discuss this matter calmly, without importing any heat into it. I am justified, I think, in pointing out the difference between the control of the Australian Workers Union and that of the ordinary craft unions. The craft unions meet from week to week, but this organization is not so controlled. A member of it obtains his shearer's ticket, and, in many cases, troubles no more about the control of his organization. Its control is left in the hands of a small executive possessing plenary powers. That is one reason why it has acquired the position of importance that it holds in the community to-day. The executive of the Australian Workers Union, however, are not satisfied with what has already been done. The  president  of it has time and again affirmed the opinion that there should be one big union of all the workers of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is, therefore, very near being a Syndicalist. That is the very essence of Syndicalism, and it is death to Arbitration Courts and to all other means of settling disputes. It means that the union takes the place of the Government and controls the affairs of the country in any way that seems fit to it in accordance with certain defined industrial groupings. It means, in short, a State run purely and simply on unionistic lines and only for industrial purposes. </para>

                        <para>Industrial unionism has not yet accomplished its highest purpose, and built up a confraternity of all nations. But within the limits of nationalism it has wrought wonders. It has made itself a force to be feared by enthroned despots. Here in Australia it has completed the conquest of political power. The Government of the country is virtually in its hands. Magnificent as its victories have been, the triumphs that lie before it will dim their splendour and make their glory pale.

                            <para>- I said twice that this union was not conducted like an ordinary union. Did the honorable member hear me? He forgets these things. The point is that a union outside the House is absolutely controlling the condition of affairs inside it. That is the first outstanding feature in connexion with the consideration of this matter. This is not the first time that the Australian Workers Union has said to the national Government of Australia: "You must stop every other business that you are proceeding with and attend to ours." </para>

                            <para>- I was just about to make the same remark. If we are to have outside bodies initiating legislation here, let us have the initiative in its proper form; let us do the thing above board. Here is an initiative which ought not to be in a free system of government such as ours is supposed to be. When a body of men outside can dictate to this Parliament what it ought to do, stop Parliament from closing its doors until their wants have been attended to, and get Parliament to open its doors again when they want other business attended to, that is a kind of thing which needs looking after in a free community, and where Democracy is supposed to obtain. Powerful as this organization is, it is still a very small minority of the whole of the voters of Australia. </para>

                    </continue><para>This is not the first time that the organization has done this kind of thing. It did it away back in 1910, when my honorable friends opposite had to alter the laws to suit the organization. It did it again last year, when it compelled my honorable friends to bring about an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, for the purpose of enabling outside help to be got in connexion with the management of the unions, and here again it is doing it, not merely to get help in the management of the unions, but so that it may swell its ranks in any way which seems fit and proper to it. This is a proposal to depart from the lines of industrial grouping and industrial arbitration such as was the very genius of the Act of 1904 when it was introduced here. It is a clear departure from the principle of conciliation and arbitration as we have known it all these years in connexion with industrial pursuits in Australia. I want to say that I do not approve of this radical departure. I think that the workers themselves will live to regret it bitterly. Let them have their big unions if they like, but it means that an individual group, within the big union, will be subject to the domination of the whole. It means that local disputes will be  settled  by men who know nothing of the details. It means that miners' disputes will be settled by shearers, and that shearers' disputes will be settled by the members of other industrial groups. I say that this is the way to provoke hostility, and promote strife, and not the way to settle disputes, and put an end to strife. Local disputes arise out of local circumstances and conditions, and require, in those who are called upon to settle them, a knowledge of those circumstances and conditions. I do not know how it is to-day, but I know that when I had to do with the Miners Union at Lithgow it was impossible to get the three mining districts of New South Wales alone to agree upon a basis of union. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- They are not going to do anything of the kind. What the honorable member refers to is going to be done for them by the Arbitration Court. I venture to say that if they try to do what the honorable member suggests they will be entering upon a sea of trouble. No one knows that better than does the honorable member who represents the Newcastle miners. It is impossible to get these three correlated groups of workers into one organization because of the difference of local conditions. For the settlement of a local dispute local sympathy and knowledge are required, and influences which are inconsistent with a big union. </para>

                            <para>- That is another misstatement which shows the honorable member's absolute ignorance of events. Perhaps that is why he talks so freely about these matters. I advise him to let that ghost lie. He will Pet nothing by raising it. The fact remains that during the time I had to do with the union 'n Lithgow there were no strikes. I left them when I did leave them with better conditions as to pay and in every other respect than they have ever had since from the Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- I doubt it. I know that it led to an awful tragedy of much suffering and trouble. I have never seen any good come out of strikes yet. I have never believed in them. I believe that the very best way to preserve industrial peace is not the way of the big unions. The best way to preserve the peace of this community, in my opinion, is for the workers to proceed with their craft groups and local tribunals, which will be on the spot to settle local troubles arising out of local circumstances. I know that from experience. I have seen that system at work. I have also seen the bigger groups and unions at work, and in my opinion the result of their operation will be infinite trouble and numerous strifes. That has been the experience of them wherever they have been tried in every part of the world, and Australia is no exception to the rule. In spite of the proposals on the other side for peace to-day the fact remains that the only way of preserving industrial peace just now is for the Arbitration Court to be continually stepping in at the demand of the unions. The Broken Hill workers only the other day told the Minister plainly to his face, and the Arbitration Court plainly to its face, that if they did not set their wants attended to in a specified time, they proposed to strike. </para>

Syndicalism is what is aimed at. That is what is finally intended. That is made quite manifest by all that they say and all that they do. There is no secret about it. My reading induces me to believe that present day Syndicalism is a synonym for industrial trouble and unrest. In other countries it has brought about revolution.

This legislation really raises issues which are bound to affect the future development of trade unionism in a way far beyond the immediate object of the Bill. </para>

What is happening is that, in dealing with a particular case, we shall fundamentally alter the very basis of our Arbitration Courts, and adopt a new line of procedure which, I think, will profoundly affect all future industrial development in Australia. As I understand the principle of arbitration laid down in our Acts from time to time, it is that the Court shall deal only with bodies of men engaged  in particular industries. Now we have a proposal to supersede that principle, and for the future to proceed on lines which threaten to make the Arbitration Court of little effect, and may alter the <inline font-style="italic">rationale</inline> of the whole movement. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>Whether that be right or wrong is a question which ought to give us serious pause in this National Parliament. The point I arn trying to stress is that, having regard to industrial relations hitherto in Australia, and to the whole surroundings here, the peaceful evolution of our industrial life would better and more safely proceed on the lines already laid down - along the lines of arbitration, conciliation, and Wages Boards - than on the Syndicalist lines suggested in the' Bill. I put this point without reference to the particular union, except in so far as that union is a very proper illustration to take as applying to the general principle. Somehow or other it would seem that we cannot get away from the surroundings of these local cases which colour everything, including the Attorney-General's speech last night, with the  result  that he touched every point but the real point raised in the Bill. For instance, he began in a very dramatic way by saying that we are at war, and that he threw on the Opposition the responsibility for anything that might happen to the industrial peace of the community unless we helped him to put this Bill through. In other words, while the honorable gentleman was talking industrial peace, he seemed the whole time to be rattling the sabre. A strike in war time, he told us, is a fearful thing to contemplate. " Overseas yonder," lie said, " there are strikes occurring during the war which would not occur if there were Arbitration Courts." The simple answer to that is that strikes are occurring over there, although means have been furnished for the settlement of disputes by conciliation and arbitration. The very last strike of all was a revolt against the decision of a referee to whom both sides had decided to leave the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Runciman</inline> gave his decision, and immediately the South Wales miners refused to accept it, and went on strike. I do not know whether that strike has been settled, but I think so. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I think the honorable member is altogether overstating the case. I should say that the gentlemen on the spot know all the circumstances. Both miners and proprietors agreed to leave the matter in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Runciman</inline> for final decision ; and yet, after the Government had gone to the trouble to guarantee these men that they should have justice, they went on strike because they did not get as much as they thought they ought to. </para>

                            <para>- Unlike the Attorney-General, the honorable member for East Sydney evidently believes in strikes in war time, unless the men get what they want. Truly the honorable member supplies the answer to the Attorney-General, and repudiates the notion that we should do everything we can to preserve industrial peace in war time. The honorable member tells us that he thinks the men ought to strike if they do not get what they think they are entitled to. I, however, have a different notion. I think that when men agree with the masters to abide by the decision of a referee they ought to abide by it. However, the point is that at Home they have machinery actually in operation to adjust those differences, and that, notwithstanding the fact, this unfortunate strike took place. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is not; but may I suggest that everything is not always perfectly right that the honorable member and his friends do? I dare say that the honorable member makes just about the average number of mistakes ; and I hope he will forgive me if I suggest that he is making a big mistake, particularly as concerns the men he represents, in following the lines hinted in the Bill. I would have preferred that this matter should not have arisen in connexion with any particular union, because I am not here to launch any attack against the Shearers- Union or any other union, but I maintain that this proposal constitutes a grave and new departure in that it strikes at the very principle of arbitration and conciliation and Wages Boards, and aims at the building up of a union which later on intends to sweep all these aside, and be really the State itself. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. If the aim is one big union which is to match the oneness of the State, that means that it is to take the place of the State - that it is going to control the State. I venture to say that the State is a much bigger union than any trade union, even one big trade union, and if that be the aim of any union, the State must grapple with it just as France, Sweden, and other countries have grappled with attempts to push this matter with the same object in view. Many a time the State has had to take hold of these organizations and put them in their proper place; they must always be in subordination to the State itself. In other words, no union, however powerful or beneficial its objects may be, must attempt to usurp the functions of the State itself.- </para>

These Wages Boards are confined to particular industries, and settle disputes on the spot by representatives from either side talking over matters quietly across a table. </para>

I think they are going wrong now, and I know that a great many things that they have done have come back like a boomerang and done them considerable damage. Their opinion on this matter differs at the moment from mine, and, of course, being in the majority, they will have their way. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what the honorable member means by his reference to my friends the Conservatives. My duty is to stand for the citizens of Australia in their entirety as far as I am able to do it, and I am here to say that in a young country like this, with all the prospects ahead of it and all the wonderful potentialities - I ask pardon for using the word again - it possesses, nothing could happen which would so injure its prospects and alter its final destiny as will development along Syndicalist lines. The very thing that we ought to strive to avoid, and not develop, is what this Bill appears to encourage. How will it affect Arbitration and Conciliation Courts and Wages Boards? The very principle of compulsory arbitration is that it should be accompanied by penalties which are  enforcible.  If we have one big union, with every one in it, how is the State to enforce penalties <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It could not fine all the unions if they are all amalgamated in one big union. The Arbitration Court could not enforce its decrees. As a matter of fact, if we have one big union, the Arbitration Court and the whole of the government will be at the feet of the big union, and our industrial tribunals would not be wanted. But the result in the final settlement will be that the sections who are interested will be profoundly disappointed. Let honorable members do what they can. to settle the local trouble that has arisen, which is the cause of the introduction of this Bill, in any way that seems fit to them, but do not let them put into an Act of Parliament a new principle that runs counter to the lines upon which industrial evolution has proceeded, or the consequences may be very serious in the long run in the working out of this principle. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite aware of that; but I think that they are wrong in doing so, and I am endeavouring to put my opinion as calmly and as temperately as I can on record. I think this development is a wrong one. The unions are looking forward to something that is not going to do them any good in the sequel. They may get some temporary advantage. I believe that they will get some political advantage out of this. We are already realising the influence that this particular union has over the National Parliament. But, beyond that advantage, I do not think they are going to get anything out of it so "far as the industrial efficiency, comfort, and peace of the working men themselves are concerned. However, honorable members are so powerful just now that the Bill is to be placed on the statute-book; but I take leave to make my position quite clear on the matter. I shall look to the future with some confidence that the view I am now putting forward will be found to be the correct one when a few more years have come and gone. </para>

There are 525,000 unionists in Australia who contribute annually something like £750,000, but I do not see any new proposals for devoting that money, that energy, and the co-operative principle along constructive lines. The old craft unions believed in looking after their members when they were unemployed. Have any of the unions to-day any proposition for dealing with the unemployed among their members? </para><interjection>

I have already read the announcement of persons in authority in this union as to what they seek. Syndicalism means having one big union or organization on industrial lines taking the place of the State. </para>

                        <para>.- The speech of the Leader of the Opposition was accompanied by so many interjections that it reminded me of the Pilgrims' Chorus in "Tannhauser."

                    <para>The primary object of Parliament, which has been recognised more or less by decisions of the Court, was to create organizations within industries having a common interest in matters in dispute. One can understand the enthusiasm with which, in 1904, Parliament hailed the advent of a measure to substitute judicial arbitration for strikes. The meaning of " industry " has been widened, perhaps, beyond the expectation of some, but not necessarily beyond what may, on the whole, conduce to the main end in view, although in carrying its interpretation to the length desired, and not yet effected, the Australian Workers Union will, in the opinion of a good many, strike at the chief efficiency of organization for the purposes of the Act. I do no more than adopt the argument of the Leader of the Opposition that, in combining a number of industries within such a breadth of comprehension that you have, in effect, Syndicalism, you destroy the union powers of self-government which have been one of the chief agencies of industrial reform in the United Kingdom. There has been a wide discussion in America as to whether the old principles of trade unionism should be preserved, or whether the large grouping which has been so marked during the last fifteen or twenty years should he continued. The discussions on the subject were republished in the <inline font-style="italic">Annals of the American Academy</inline> two or three years ago; but I think that the best opinion in America is that - apart from the securing of individual ends - it is better to stick to the old trade union principles. To differentiate unions in accordance with the branches of particular trades is, in the long run, more efficacious for the settlement of industrial disputes. About twelve months ago applications were made to the Arbitration Court for the cancellation of the registration of, perhaps, the strongest union, numerically, in Australia, and at the end of 1914 a Bill was introduced here to amend the conciliation and arbitration law, so as to give the  President  of the Arbitration Court the option of saying, in regard to this application, that, unless certain conditions were complied with, cancellation would be ordered. As the law stood, if certain conditions had not been complied with, it was imperative to order the deregistration of the union and the cancellation of its certificate. I very much doubt the wisdom of passing substantial legislation that is retrospective, but the </para>
                    <para class="block">House, on the assurance of the Attorney-General - which personally I did not accept - that this was a matter of procedure, passed the measure. Thus the union was afforded an opportunity, should the  President  of the Arbitration Court think fit, to recast its rules so as to get rid of the invalidity which might otherwise he proved against it. The  Deputy President,  being appealed to, gave the union until the 1st July, afterwards extending the period to the 1st September, to alter its rules to bring them into accordance with the Act. The order of the Court showed that the organization comprised some 90,000 members, and that it was not truly an organization of employees, because it contained, not only employees, but also a number of employers, and persons who were in no sense connected with the pastoral industry. Now we are told by the Attorney-General that the rules of the organization cannot be altered to comply with the order, but we have not been told why compliance is impossible. All that has been communicated to us is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke</inline> - whether as counsel for the union or as counsel for the applicants for the cancellation of its registration I do not know - has advised that it cannot comply with the law. Surely he has not advised that it could not get rid of certain of its members, though that might be inconvenient. Last year the Attorney-General said that only 1 per cent, of its members could be regarded as not belonging to the pastoral industry. Surely, then, it is not beyond the power of its officers to recast its membership to comply with the order of the Court and with the law. I do not think it is fair to ask us, without further information, to pass a measure of retrospective application, dealing, not with a mere matter of procedure, but with a matter of substance. If procedure alone were concerned, I should not oppose the measure. _ </para>

                            <para>- The Court found that the rules allowed persons who were employers, not employees, to be admitted as members of an organization registered as an organization of employees, and that such persons were admitted. The evidence shows that barristers - I am glad that we are at last declared officially to be workers - members of Parliament - also officially recognised as workers - hotelkeepers, storekeepers, dentists, hairdressers, and other employers not engaged in any work connected with the pastoral industry, are members of the Australian, Workers Union. Employers have been admitted as members, and have been allowed to continue as members. They have been allowed to vote for the appointment of the executive and of officers administering the affairs of the organization, although it is this executive which generally decides whether claims are to be enforced against employers, and to what extent, and how. The principle of the arbitration law is that the members, of the union should control the question of whether or not a dispute is to be submitted to the Court. </para>

                            <para>- I sympathize with that point of view if it can be shown to be correct. I do not  say  that we should vote against the Bill if in the light of facts it can be shown that it ought to be passed. The desire of the Opposition is to get more information on this point. The last thing we ought to be asked to do is to bring in a Bill to alter retrospectively the conditions of any industry in relation to which there is a dispute, if that alteration involves a matter of substance. If the alteration involves merely a technical flaw, we are justified in altering retrospectively the provisions of the Act. As regards the provisions of the Bill, I confess that I do not know whether the measure is adequate or not to attain its purpose. The amendment made last year contains, as regards section 55, which deals with the registration of organizations, the provision that a union may be a certain organization of employees in an industry " together with such other persons, whether employees in the industry or not, as have- been appointed officers of the association and admitted as members thereof." What is the distinction between the Act as it will be amended by this Bill and the Act as it was amended by the Act of 1914 ? The latter referred to such other persons " whether employees in the industry or not," and this Bill refers to " such other persons, whether employees engaged in any industrial pursuit or pursuits or not." That is the only distinction I can see, and I ask the Minister to explain the effect of it. If he will do that he will help us to apprehend what is intended by the Bill, and. will enable me to resolve my uncertainty as to whether I should vote for the Bill or not. If it is clearly pointed out that it is impossible at present to comply with the Judge's order, we should be reluctant to vote against the Bill, if by so doing we might bring down a whole superstructure of awards and agreements that have been made. </para>

                            <para>- That is admitted. As a matter of fact the Judge himself in making his orders has said so. He has paid a compliment to the union on the good work it has done in many lines of activity. In his award in the Killen case he said he would hesitate a good deal before he would grant an application to deregister an organization that has produced in so many cases a settlement of industrial disputes. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the Minister will give us more information on the subject. The technical effect of the Bill has not been explained. The words " industrial pursuit " have been introduced, whereas at present the words are "in the industry." That seems to widen, the section indefinitely so as to make the position of the union practically the same as it was at the time of the dispute. The main point we should consider is as to what is best in the interest of the large number of those who are most affected by strikes. In my opinion, in their own interests it would be better if the men did not extend too widely the basis of the union, because it would militate against the settlement of disputes on the ground of community of interest. I hope the Minister will explain on what grounds <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke</inline> advised that the union could not, without an amendment of the Act, comply with the Judges' order. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to say a few words on this Bill largely on account of the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition.  His  contention is that if the present constitution of the union is allowed to continue so that it may go before the Court and obtain an award, the union will ultimately grow into one great organization that Will dominate the State - that will, in fact, be the State. If that is the opinion of members of the Opposition, and if they believe that such a development is likely to prove fatal to the best interests of the country, surely they should give a promise to the country at the next election that if they are returned to power they will undertake to remove this Act from the statute-book, and so limit the scope of the unions in the future. If honorable members opposite believe that the growth of unionism in that direction will be disastrous to the country, they ought not to rest content until the law which permits such a union to exist is abolished. I look upon the position in quite a different light. Here is a great union bringing under its protective wing sections of workers who are not strong enough to combine together and get decisions in the Arbitration Court, but because those sections do not happen to be directly allied with a particular industry, we are asked to say that the union shall not include those men in its membership. The same trouble arose in connexion with the miners. Their union applied for registration, but because the union included timber-cutters it was not allowed to register, the Court holding that timber-cutters were not connected with the mining industry. Therefore, those timber workers had to be eliminated from the union. Although the Australian Workers Union includes "men of different occupations, it does not necessarily follow when the union appeals to the Court to get an award in, say, the shearing industry, that the Court cannot give a decision affecting that industry alone. Any award given in that industry cannot affect the conditions of men WhO may be publicans, lawyers, members of Parliament, or who follow any other occupation. The Australian Workers Union serves a good purpose in another way, because employees like the bush workers, who are scattered throughout the country districts, have an opportunity of joining such an organization which will protect and aid them, whereas if they were left to themselves they would have no opportunity of taking advantage of the decision of a Wages Board or an Arbitration Court. Therefore I do not anticipate all the dire results which the Leader of the Opposition has predicted. The right honorable gentleman had something to say about the influence of the Australian Workers Union on this Parliament. Is this the first time that any combination of men has approached an Australian Parliament and exercised its influence or made its desires known? Have we never known the members of the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Mines, or the Chamber of Manufactures to approach Parliament and ask for legislation which they considered just and in their own interests? Then, why is so much said because a bi,g industrial union exercises the same privilege? When a decision of the Court seriously affects the members of a big union, why should they not approach Parliament and ask for consideration ? </para>

                            <para>- I know of instances of big outside organizations approaching Parliament in their own .interests. The Leader of the Opposition had much to say concerning the merits of Wages Boards, bub there are industries to which these sectional Wages boards cannot apply, and in which they would not operate satisfactorily. The evidence taken by them is given voluntarily, and is not on oath, and the award of the Board applies very often to a limited district. There is a strong objection on the part of the workers to the decisions of sectional Wages Boards. Continual friction arises under them where an endeavour is made to apply an award to an industry in a city, but not to the same industry when carried on in a country district or where, in other words, it is sought to provide for a lower rate of wages and longer hours in a rural district than those applied to the same industry when carried on in- a city. There is yet another objection which has not been raised during this debate, but which is heard chiefly outside Parliament. The Opposition, as their Leader has said to-day, profess to believe in unionism, but not in what they describe as political unionism. They object to a union taking an interest in politics, and using any portion of its funds for political purposes. That is the crux of their objection to any growth or extension of what they speak of as political unionism. It may be arguable whether this Bill is going to be beneficial ; but I do not think it will interfere in any marked degree with well-defined craft unions as they exist today. It will be advantageous, however, to unions which are small and weak, as well as to workers outside any union who cannot band themselves together in a separate organization. To such people the basis on which we desire that the Australian Workers Union shall be able to stand before the Courts will prove of inestimable value. They will be able to march under the banner of that union, and I feel confident that none of the doleful predictions of the Opposition will be realized. </para>

                        <para>.- The general attitude of this Parliament towards industrial problems has been that of trying to secure a fair and equitable adjustment between the parties to a conflict, in the interests, not merely of the parties themselves, but of the whole community. Towards that end our legislation has from time to time been directed, and this House has never been hostile to any fair and legitimate attempt to bring about an equitable settlement of the differences between two large classes of the community when they are in economic grips. It is to be regretted that the Attorney-General did not explain the exact reason for the introduction of this Bill. After dwelling upon the advantages of industrial peace, and the value of legislation of this character in securing industrial peace, he referred to the case of <inline font-style="italic">ex parte Killen,</inline> in which the learned Justice made an order with which he said the Australian Workers Union could not comply. We were further informed by him that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke</inline> had advised that an amendment of the law was necessary, but he did not tell us what the legal difficulty was. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that assurance. I wish now to point out the change that has been coming over legislation of this character by the Commonwealth Parliament. Originally the whole of our industrial legislation was based upon the existence of disputes between employers and employees in a particular industry, and provided for the making of awards only with respect to the persons engaged in that particular industry. That was made clear in the judgment given by the High Court on the 27th June, 1911, in the Federated Enginedrivers' case. It was pointed out distinctly that that was the whole basis of our industrial system in the Commonwealth - the settlement of disputes in a particular industry. A craft guild had been registered, and in the case that went before the Court there were about 117 different defendants, representing all sorts of industries. The Court held that the application could not be entertained, with the result that Parliament was approached, and the whole basis of the Act was altered. At that time we were told of the great value of the craft as the basis of industrial organization; but now it would appear that we are going through a third phase. The idea is not so much the craft basis, but the organization of unions representing all sorts of crafts. If this Bill passes, there may be, in theory, a union practically as wide as the Commonwealth, including painters, carpenters, shearers, shipwrights, and others. Who is to decide the case under such circumstances? We 'still have the principle of one industrial Judge, and he will be called upon to settle the whole of the industrial conditions of all sorts of trades throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

I wish to protest against the introduction of a very dangerous practice which appears to be growing in this House. If a union is challenged in Court on any particular ground, one of the parties is entitled, even before the hearing is completed, to bring his influence to bear on the Executive of the day, and have a measure introduced that may alter the judgment. </para>

An application was made to cancel a union's registration, and the Act made it obligatory on the Judge, if certain conditions were fulfilled, to cancel it. However, a Bill was introduced into this Parliament while the case was before the Court, to take away its obligatory character, and make it discretionary. What had that to do with the amendment of the Constitution? </para>

The honorable member for Bendigo has declared that the workers have the same right as the members of Chambers of Manufactures, Chambers of Mines, and other associations to come to this House for redress; and with that I entirely agree. The workers have as much right as anybody to present petitions and show the wrongs of existing legislation, and just as much right to obtain redress. But if, during the progress of a trial, the Chamber of Mines or the Chamber of Manufactures were to come to Parliament and ask us to interfere in a matter in which they were particularly interested, I should regard their action as absolutely unjustifiable. As a matter of fact, the analogy set up by the honorable member is entirely misplaced. I may mention that this is not the first, but the third, time there has been interference in the way I strongly deprecate. </para>

                            <para>- As I say, this is the third time ; and we are asked to apply this Bill to a particular body. I should like to make one or two observations on the real value of the plank in the Labour party's platform relating to conciliation and arbitration. Although there is that plank, further light is thrown on the matter by an official document published at the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> office in Brisbane, the object of which is to show what it really means. We find from this document that the Labour party outside do not place much value on Arbitration and Conciliation Acts as a means for securing their ends. </para>

Trained in the law of a capitalistic State, all the faculties of his mind educated to capitalistic concepts, his judgment guided by capitalistic codes of equity, it is not likely that he will deliver awards calculated to break down the capitalistic system of society. </para>

                            <para>- Still, the Act has secured a great many advantages, and, in some respects, it has attained its object of preventing strikes and insuring security in industry. I appeal to the Attorney-General not to force this matter unduly, and particularly to keep in view the fact that this Court is going to work better the more it is dissociated from political matters. If it is confined to the discussion of the problems between employer and employed there will be that freer and fuller co-operation which alone can result in greater industrial peace. </para>

                        <para>.- The organization to which I have the honour to belong has taken every opportunity to improve whatever industrial legislation has been in operation with a view to increasing the facilities for having disputes between employers and employees settled without the need to resort to the extreme step of declaring a strike. Prior to the passing of the Commonwealth Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1904, the most militant union in Australia was that now known as the Australian "Workers Union, and that was because they had no other means of obtaining justice from those controlling the pastoral industry. It has to be said, to the credit of the members of this great organization, that immediately this Parliament brought into existence a system of conciliation and arbitration it was one of the first to recognise that it was its duty to submit matters in dispute to the  President  of the Arbitration Court instead of using the strike weapon, and that from the first occasion on which it applied to the Arbitration Court, the decisions of that Court have been upheld by it. </para>

                            <para>- It was an easy mat* tei- for the  President  of the Arbitration Court to give the members of the Australian Workers Union improved conditions, because the evidence submitted in support of its claims disclosed that its members were poorly paid, and that the pastoralists housed them in sheds or places that could hardly be compared with respectable pigsties. The Court recognised that there was reason and justice behind the men's claims, and they made alterations in certain directions. Since then a further award has been applied for and given, and there has been industrial peace between employer and employee so far as the pastoral industry is concerned. The members of other organizations have loyally abided by the decisions of the Arbitration Court to which  they have applied for improved conditions rather than enforce their demands by strikes. It is the duty of this Parliament to remove any difficulties which may prevent unions from approaching the Arbitration Court rather than place obstacles in the way of their doing so; and an extension of the system now in operation will mean much to the community. The honorable member for Darling Downs has said that numbers of men may be admitted into the unions who are not permitted to join them at the present time, but I understand that in this direction the Registrar has always had discretionary power, and the Bill does not take it away. I have been assured that this request has been put forward by the Australian Workers Union, not for the purpose of taking in large numbers of men who are not at present members of the union, but for the purpose of enabling many who are now members, and have been for many years, to retain their membership. In these circumstances, I trust that the House will see its way clear to adopt the Bill. The right honorable member for Parramatta and other honorable members of the Opposition have taken strong exception to the fact that officials of this union have approached honorable members on this side for the purpose of having this amendment brought about. My mind takes me back to an episode in the Victorian State Parliament. The Wages Board system had been in operation for some time in Victoria, and was proving fairly satisfactory to the employees, and conditions which were not creditable to the community were gradually being improved, when the employers waited on the Ministry of the day and brought whatever influence they could to bear on it, with the result that the Act was altered in certain respects. The effect was to practically paralyze the Wages Board system. At that time I did not hear from those officially connected with the party at present in Opposition in this House a great many objections to the action of these employers. In fact, many honorable members now in Opposition in this Chamber were supporters of, or members of, the State Ministry concerned, and they raised not the slightest objection when the Liberals in the State House practically wrecked the industrial legislation in force in Victoria. I have no objection to representatives of recognised organizations approaching members of Parliament, whether in opposition or supporting the Government, in order to bring about any alteration to legislation. It is then a question for the party that is approached to consider whether a just request has been put forward. If honorable members on this side of the chamber have allowed themselves to be approached by members of the Australian Workers Union for the purpose of getting this amending legislation passed, and if the Government have complied with the request put forward, we have only been doing something which is consistent with the attitude of the party towards industrial legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I have not been officially informed that the only object of the Australian Workers Union in asking for this amendment is to admit publicans or retain those who are already members of the organization. I believe that their object is a higher one. The Australian Workers Union has a record of which any member of the organization may be proud. Not only has it endeavoured, by every legitimate means, to improve the position of its members, but it has at all times done what it could to improve the condition of every worker in the community, and therefore any request that the officers of the union put before any Parliament, State or Commonwealth, is worthy of the best possible consideration. In this case, the representatives of the Australian Workers Union have done only what ia right. Strong exception has been taken to what the right honorable member for Parramatta has referred to as a breach of confidence on the part of the Prime Minister in regard to this matter. </para>

This should be the attitude of all honorable members, irrespective of the party to which they may belong. We should do all that we can to enable the unions to approach the Court with the least delay and expense. In many cases, days, and even weeks, have been occupied in the discussion of legal technicalities. In one case, something like five weeks were spent by counsel for the employers and counsel for the employees in arguing questions of law, with the result that the union concerned was put out of court, and had to pay legal expenses amounting to between £2,000 and £3,000, without the  President  of the Arbitration Court having an opportunity to consider the merits of its application. Such a state of things is not calculated to bring about the industrial peace that we are all preaching. Parliament should assist the unions in going to the Courts to obtain the peaceful and constitutional settlement of disputes. There is, however, a class of politician who, although advocating from the platform industrial peace, shows no practical sympathy with unionism, and, instead of voting to remove the difficulties of unionism, tries to place obstacles in its path. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Fawkner was not particularly happy, nor as enthusiastic as ousual, in his defence of this measure. As he justifies the action of a particular organization, simply because it is the action of an industrial organization, I ask him to consider for a moment how a similar action would be viewed if taken by an individual. If an individual litigant had been worsted in an appeal to a Court, and had been informed that, unless he put certain matters right, a decision would be given against him, and if, instead of putting his mistake right, he were to go to his political friends and order them to amend the law so that he could perpetuate his mistake, and thus get past the decision of the Court, what would the honorable gentleman think of his action? The early trade unionists never dreamt of the possibility of the inclusion in unions of persons not belonging to the organized industry. A few years ago no one would have dreamt that innkeepers would be made members of a union of shearers. </para>

                            <para>- I can understand a person who has ceased to work in an industry by reason of old age, or incapacity of some other kind, remaining a member of a union in that industry; but the position that we are asked to consider is something very different, and was ' undreamt of not so many years ago. The honorable member for Fawkner said that the record of the Australian Workers Union was one of which we should feel proud. While that union has a good record in many respects, there is evidence that many of its members now think its organization capable of improvement. When in Sydney not long since, on public business, I read in a newspaper serious complaints of intriguing at the headquarters of the organization to keep new blood out of the Council. If only a small proportion of the statements that were then published were correct, the union is in need of radical reorganization. Apparently it has grown altogether too large, and the control of head-quarters is regarded as irksome in many directions. That is the curse of centralization, and it will ultimately prove the ruin of the present Labour movement. The measure under discussion has been shown by speakers on this side to be a step in the direction of further centralization. I should like to know how the organizations and portions of organizations in the remoter States regard this proposal, and whether they have taken the trouble to find out where it is likely to lead them. If the members of the Australian Workers Union who reside in outlying States, and the members of other trade unions which will shortly be merged in this colossal organization, were alive to their own interests, they would fight tooth and nail against the tendency to centralization. In Western Australia we have great difficulty in bringing matters before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. We are so far away that it means considerable expense to get questions dealt with at head-quarters which could very well be dealt with in the State itself. This trouble is likely to develop throughout </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia. I have always been an ardent believer in the principle of conciliation and arbitration, and the honorable member for Fawkner was scarcely fair in stating that many members on this side had shown themselves hostile to it. When it was first mooted, it was looked upon with great hope. Employers generally anticipated the abolition of strikes, and Liberals were quite as ready as Labour members to indorse the principle. </para>

The Labour party did most of the hard work, but genuine Liberalism undoubtedly welcomed this movement for arbitration, and whenever any legitimate difficulties stand in -the way of cheapening and making more rapid the operation of the Arbitration Court, I feel sure that Liberalism will be ready to improve the principle as much as possible. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think the honorable member can expect that assistance on this occasion, because this Bill represents an entirely new development in trade unionism - a development of which I am confident a great many trade unionists will not be proud, and which will undoubtedly wreck the Labour movement in the future. I have, always held strongly the view that the Labour movement ought to decentralize rather than centralize, that if Labour means true democratic government, it means decentralization and not centralization, because centralization is only another word for o autocracy. In my opinion, Labour is making a big mistake in its own interest in endeavouring to create one huge organization, the strings of which will all be in the hands of one clique, who will work the union as they think fit, and over whom there will be very little control by the bulk of the members. I am inclined to think that the proposal before us to-day is not intended for the benefit of industrial trade unionism. Its real meaning is political. Its object is to get that control over the votes of the industrial community which, it is hoped, will enable the Labour party to remain indefinitely in power. There are many trade unionists who are not prepared to follow their leaders through thick and thin in many matters, and this line of action will only increase their numbers. </para>

                            <para>- The first question that suggests itself to my mind is whether the Bill is to serve a political or an industrial purpose, and it appears to me that, no matter what may appear on the face of the measure, its object is political rather than industrial. It aims at giving a certain political faction a larger measure of control, and such a predominating influence as will enable its members to become ultimately the masters of this Parliament and of the country. Why should persons who have no direct personal interest in a dispute be allowed to make themselves a party to it? That is the direct and positive result of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill involves also the dangerous principle of legislating to interfere with cases which axe pending in the Law Courts. It is considered improper to even mention cases which are <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> yet the Government not only deal with matters which are before the Court, but present a Bill which is to have the effect of interfering with the judgment of the Court. Of all matters that could be dealt with in this Chamber I consider that the most dangerous. It may undoubtedly suit the legal profession to have these things done, tut we are not here to bolster up the legal profession, and I do not think the legal members on this side desire to do that. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that the Opposition are altogether too fearful of this measure, and that they are conjuring up in connexion with it a bogy that does not exist. If any loss is to be suffered by the so-called rehabilitation of the Australian Workers Union, it will be suffered by the union itself; the organization, and not the country, is taking the risk. I see in this proposal but a furtherance of that regimentation of the industrial community, more particularly, which marks the degree of progress we are making as a civilized people. It was well pointed out this morning by the Attorney-General that, in the absence of extensive organizations, there is always a tendency for friction to occu'r here, there, and everywhere, and from petty misunderstandings great troubles may spring. Under such a system, no branch or section may please sion of the ranks of the Australian Workers Union, one can easily foresee how debatable questions, whatever they may be, will be removed from the heat of the industrial battle-field to the serenity of the council chamber. That, surely, will be a step in advance. Under such a system, no branch or section may please itself as to what it shall do in the way of going out on strike. It is in connexion with strikes that the most wealth has been lost, and most misery caused in relation to industrial matters, and anything that will tend to minimize the risk of strikes should be welcomed by the community and approved by this House. While there may be an element of risk associated with this change, 1 am quite satisfied that it will be taken by the union itself. While 1 realize, as the Opposition fear, that the central control of a vast organization might be directed in some way against the body politic, 1 think too much of the independence of the average man, whether he be a unionist or not, to believe that he will submit to too much dictation. The functions of the organization having been discharged, and those in control of it having attended to their special duties, any attempt to coerce the big body of men into a channel of which they do not entirely approve, will assuredly fail. There is a greater danger of an organization being diverted from its proper channels when it is divided into sections than there is where men picked from the ranks of a union 100,000 strong are handling the levers, and know that those for whom they are acting will keep them up to the mark, and will resent any undue interference. Taking into account, as I do, the standard of intelligence that prevails in this country, I cannot for one moment subscribe to the dangers foreseen by the Opposition as likely to arise from the passing of this Bill, and the consequent substantiation - if I may so describe it - of the existing position. This Bill, after all, is not to create any new order of things. It is merely to ratify that which already exists. The Australian Workers Union has already in its ranks men of many callings, and, in the majority of cases, those belonging to it, who follow other avocations, are members of it only because they are graduates of it. I think we can safely pay a tribute to the Australian Workers Union. Travelling in the west country of New South Wales, I have developed a profound respect for the average members of the Australian Workers Union. Wherever I have gone, I have found them intelligent, enthusiastic, and kind-hearted. There are, of course, exceptions, and upon these my honorable friends opposite can dwell. For the most part, however, members of the Australian Workers Union have demonstrated that they are the aristocrats of Labour in Australia. Owing to the far-seeing policy which has guided their destiny, under the direction of those whom they have nominated to responsible positions, they practically blazed the track to Federation in this country. It was the first organization to be Australia-wide in its scope. Its members saw the advantages to be derived from federating or unifying, and, fostered no doubt by the very nature of their organization, have done more to bring the ends of Australia in touch with each other than has any other body of men. The amalgamation of the different units has been practically the forerunner of Federation in Australia. I hope that the results flowing from the passing of this Bill will effectively disprove all that has been predicted by the Opposition as to the motives actuating the proposed amendment of the principal Act. The honorable member for Perth endeavoured to draw an analogy between the action of the organization and that of an individual who was not getting all he wanted outside, and who appealed to Parliament to set his case in order. The analogy is too remote ; .in fact, it does not exist. The honorable member knows as well as I do that quantitative changes make qualitative differences, and if ever there was a difference in quantity which made a difference in quality it is in this case. Already so far-flung are the interests concerned, so wide are the ramifications of the organization, that it behoves the National Parliament to do all that it can to facilitate its peaceful legal working. </para>

                        <para>. - I should not have spoken but for the fact that neither the Attorney-General nor any member of his party has attempted to justify the inclusion in the Australian Workers Union of persons who are altogether outside the great industry to which it chiefly relates. In the grouping of those engaged in industry, in order that they may be called before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, it is undoubtedly necessary -that the members of an organization shall be partners in the industry to which it relates. Although a man may be in the lowest ranks of employees he takes an important part in an industry, and becomes, for the time being, a partner in it. When a dispute arises regarding the conditions of his labour, or the divisions of the spoil of industry, the partners are brought before a judicial tribunal in the shape of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and only those who are legitimate partners to the suit should come before the Judge to advance their claims. If those who have no interest whatsoever in the industry to which an organization relates are allowed to be members of it - if, in connexion with the primary industries, we may have a great conglomerate of this description - then members who are not connected with those industries may throw their influence into the balance to outweigh that of legitimate members, and we may be brought face to face, very often, with fictitious suits. </para>

                            <para>- In the ordinary administration of the Labour movement membership of a union is not sufficient to entitle an applicant for employment in another industry to membership of another union relating to that particular industry. In these troublous times of unemployment a worker is now compelled, even if he is a member of a union, to register afresh before he can secure employment. In this case the position is reversed. It is proposed to group in one union, for legislative and other purposes, as many persons as can be induced to join it. The Court found that the Australian Workers Union had in its ranks many whom it directed should be cast aside, since, although their influence was very great, they had no interest whatsoever in the industry to which it particularly related. Take the case of the innkeeper to whom the honorable member for Perth has referred. I do not think any honorable member will have anything to say against legitimate members of the Australian Workers Union. They have fought the battles of the past under adverse conditions; but in country districts such men often congregate at an inn, and the influence of the innkeeper who is a member of their union may be used very often to upset their judgment. Let me tell of my own experience. A hotelkeeper who was an official in a Liberal organization, and at the same time a member of the Australian Workers Union, on one occasion took the chair at one of my political meetings. Was he doing justice to the Australian Workers Union ? </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that that mood has altogether left him, because the other day we saw a stinging article from his pen; and I fancy that even now he is not averse to the political sandbag as a means of bringing people to his way of thinking. A serious stage has been reached - a stage which no honorable member can afford to discount when we find parties to a suit influencing the Executive to amend the law in their interests. As a justification, the Attorney-General has said that in a former case a hint was given by a Judge; b 11 no matter whence the hint comes, the country would be well advised in putting its heel down on this sort of thing. It is a development in the public life of this country that the House ought to scotch. If any influence of the kind were attempted I should feel very much inclined to vote against any consequent proposal, even though I might otherwise be favorable to it. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been a member of the Australian Workers Union since 1886, and I was the first treasurer when the present Postmaster-General was president. From that time until now I have been a" financial member, having once been employed as a shearer, though I am not now connected with the industry. I understand that under the ruling that has been given, I can no longer be associated with the organization, although it is one that I helped to build up. </para>

                            <para>- That may be the interpretation by the Court, but I do not think it was the intention of Parliament. However, while I support the Bill, I am not altogether in favour of the industrial trend of to-day. This,, of course, is the concern of the organization itself; and if it means its undoing, as anticipated by honorable members opposite, the organization must put up with the result. One big industrial union, covering many industries, and embracing the whole continent, would, I think, result in a certain lack of interest in individual branches, an interest that was possible under the older methods of trade unionism. </para>

The honorable member for East Sydney is, I understand, connected with the plumbers' union; and if that body were to throw in its lot with the larger organizations contemplated, I doubt whether it would receive the same amount of attention that it does under the present arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- There has already been some friction on this point amongst those employed on the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway. Of course, if there were to be sub-divisions of industry under one head, I can see some advantage to trade unionists, though, as I say, I doubt whether there would be the same amount of local interest. One of the complaints to-day is that, although a man may be a financial member of one union, he has to pay another fee before he is permitted to work under another union ; and if there were only one fee, covering the whole, there would, of course, be a distinct saving to members. I have always held that this payment of further fees is very unfair. One great organization would, I fancy, have a tendency to prevent a number of individual disputes in the various States. I may say that under the Commonwealth arbitration law there has not yet been one actual strike. Every award has been carried out, and all the hundreds of strikes quoted by honorable members opposite have been outside the purview of the Commonwealth law. </para>

                            <para>- Personally, I know of no case in which the men have gone back on an award or an agreement; and surely this must be of considerable advantage to the community ? We recognise that, once industry stops, so does the production of wealth; and any machinery which has the effect of preventing the cessation of labour pending the settlement of a dispute, is in the interests, not only of the public generally, but of the men themselves. Altogether, I think that our arbitration law has been singularly successful in this respect. I must again express my regret if this Bill prevents me from continuing my membership of the Australian Workers Union. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that, as an officer, the  president  may retain his membership. I was one of those who, in order to remain a member, had to sign a declaration showing that I had been connected with the shearing industry both in Victoria and New South. Wales. . In any case, I can look back with a great amount of pleasure on the good work that has been done by this organization; and that good work is testified to by the pastoralists themselves. I cannot think of any pastoralist who would go back to the conditions of the early eighties. At that time, all sorts of agreements were in force, and an employer had the right to deduct 5s. a 100, not only on account of sheep in regard to which fault had been found, but in regard to the whole of the sheep shorn. I may point also to the conditions under which the men had to live. There has been an improvement. </para>

                            <para>- In many cases the charges were very stiff. The men have much better conditions to-day, and the position is much more satisfactory to the employer. I may say that in the instance that I have mentioned the owners, Messrs. Main, Sells, and Company, had nothing to do with the store. The manager was running it himself, and getting all these extras out of the men. It is better for the employer to know that there is not likely to be any trouble at shearing time, and that he can get on with the work. He can well afford to pay the additional rates, because of the great improvement in recent years in the breed of sheep. Compared with the early eighties, the sheep of to-day have wool of high class right to the very nose, and the owners get a very much better result from the clip. The sheep are very much harder to shear. </para>

The unions approached the House of Commons, in which there is only a sprinkling of Labour men. In the case before us an organization considers that a decision of a Court affects it very materially, in fact, so as to practically dismember it. As far as I can see, nothing has justified the very severe criticism that has been offered to the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- In this particular case the litigant was unsuccessful. The decree which was made was against the union, and is one which the organization now declines to obey. It is useless attempting to conceal the plain facts of the case with which we are dealing, because they stand out apparent to any one who looks at the forefront of the Bill and compares it with the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers. An attempt by an unsuccessful litigant to move Parliament to pass legislation which will enable him to evade the consequences of a judgment given against him is none the less serious because the litigant in question happens to be one of the most powerful unions iu the community. That the danger is all the greater is a fact which must be apparent to every one on both sides of the chamber. One point which was completely ignored by the Attorney-General when introducing the Bill was that the Australian Workers Union itself selected the tribunal before which it appeared. It chose to enter the door opened to it by Parliament under the Arbitration Act of 1904. A body consisting not only of employees, but also of others besides employees, became registered subject to all the conditions then prevailing, knowing, as it must have known, that the door - for reasons which I shall point out later, and which I think I can convince honorable members, are to-day as valid and as essential and fundamental to the principle of the Arbitration Act as they were when they were imposed in 1904 - was only open to an association consisting solely of employees. The whole position of this association was that it made a deliberate choice". There is nothing to prevent any association admitting any number of persons, employers or employees, into its ranks. That is for the union itself to decide. It must always be remembered that associations may choose to adopt forms of organization which may include employers and employees. But when this association first became registered - I do not know whether it contained any employers - it became registered subject to the conditions which it knew, and must have known, were laid down by the Act. It must have known that if the conditions laid down by the Act in regard to membership were not then in existence, or did not continue to exist, in the union, its registration must be cancelled. </para>

                            <para>- That was the Act of 1909, but it does not matter one jot to me whether they knew or did not know. If they did not know, they could not have read the very plain terms of a very plain section of an Act of Parliament; because section 55 states distinctly that two classes of associations only are to be registered, one of employers and one of employees. There can be no doubt that they knew this; but whether they did or did not, they went before the Court saying, "We want to come under the law as it stands. We want to claim the benefits of the machinery which Parliament has created, subject to the conditions that Parliament has imposed." But when it subsequently admitted a number of persons who were not employees, it must have known that it did so at the risk of being deprived of the advantages which Parliament had given to associations of employees as long as their rules prevented persons who were not employees from becoming members. Therefore, when this union asks Parliament to override a decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers on this point, it does so as a defeated litigant that has chosen its own tribunal. </para>

                            <para>- It does not touch the point with which I am now dealing. The Australian Workers Union, finding itself in breach of the law, and pending litigation, asks this Parliament to alter the law so that the result of that litigation may be different from what it might otherwise be. We are asked to take a dangerous step, and it is the more dangerous because the Australian Workers Union, as the Attorney-General has said, is one of the most powerful and influential bodies in Australia. That fact constitutes the seriousness of the position. </para>

                            <para>- The Attorney-General cannot blame us if we regard with a good deal of suspicion a Bill brought in to enable a powerful organization which has selected its own Court to evade the judgment of that Court. It is all very well for him to say that the Bill was brought in to enable this organization to give effect to the judgment of the Court; but, with all respect to him, I say that that is absolute moonshine. If that is the object of the Bill, the measure is unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>-I have given the House a statement of what I respectfully submit to be the meaning of the Bill. I shall now proceed to deal with the merits of the measure. Knowing the circumstances, I cannot blame too much the Government, who have been practically forced to bring this Bill forward at this time. This measure is a sort of legislative foundling laid on the doorstep of the Government by those whose dictates the Government are bound to follow. I have a good deal of sympathy, too, with the honorable member for Maranoa, the Postmaster-General, the honorable member for Grey, and others who in their younger days were associated with a movement which, like almost all these movements in their initiation and throughout a considerable part of their history, aimed at the elevation of the people and the obtaining of fair terms for workers who were to some extent oppressed. I expended the large sum of1s. a few days ago on a book called <inline font-style="italic">The History of the Australian Workers Union,</inline> by W. G. Spence. It , is not such an interesting book as I had expected it to be, but it narrates a large series of facts, and the later history, especially since the passing of the Arbitration Act, as derailed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence,</inline> gives a good deal of food for reflection. He points out that the Australian Workers Union was instrumental in bringing about the settlement of industrial disputes by arbitration. We know that that was so. But we find in the whole history of industrial arbitration, as related in this book, that when ever any decision was given in favour of the union it is treated as merely the union's just due, but whenever its views were not entirely agreed with, or whenever an order or injunction was made against the wish of the union, the language used is extremely severe. We find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence</inline> saying of one decision by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Registrar</inline> Addison that "he gave a rambling decision, in which he dragged in irrelevant matter which had nothing to do with the case." </para>

But when the decision was of an opposite character it is referred to as having been secured by false affidavits, or as illustrating the power of Judge-made law in a new form. </para>

He was at one time an active, energetic, and useful member of that organization, and in its initial stages did excellent work, but he is now as servile a member of that association as any other member on the Government side, distinguished from the rest only by the more complete humility with which he submits to its dictation. </para>

                            <para>- Because this Bill comes before us in the sinister aspect of a measure introduced at the dictates of an all-powerful association to enable it to avoid a judgment under the law. And was that judgment a very unfavorable one? The attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers was as favorable towards the union as anybody could rationally expect. I am informed that very many charges were made of gross boycotting and other offences against the Act on the part of the union. The Judge said that the charges had not been proved, but he would not permit the whole proof to be gone into, because he said that if those charges could be proved they would be matters for criminal prosecution. He took the view which, to my mind, seems extremely favorable to the organization, viz., that even though the offences or the reasons which would in ordinary circumstances be sufficient to enable the other side to have the registration of the union cancelled, were so very serious as to amount to a criminal act, they themselves afforded safety to the organization attacked. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that the union had to fight its way as every such organization does. But what we are concerned with in connexion with a Bill of this kind is the position and power of the union to-day. I do not know whether I am saying too much of matters not generally known to members on both sides of the House when I state that the means whereby it obtained the enormous power it now wields have been the simple and efficacious ones of utilizing the great and powerful influence of the boycott, thereby forcing storekeepers, carriers, and all classes of people into its ranks on pain of losing their businesses or occupations. </para>

                            <para>- I do not profess to have accurate knowledge of the use of the boycott, but I know that 400 or 500 affidavits have been filed, alleging against this association acts of actual boycotting. No doubt the Postmaster-General would dismiss them at once, probably without reading them, as containing falsehoods from beginning to end. It is common-place knowledge that the association wields an enormous and overwhelming political power in Australia at the present time, and if such an association can come forward and dictate the course of business in Parliament, direct the Prime Minister to abandon the course which directly or indirectly he had marked out for himself for the conduct of the affairs of this House, and compel Parliament to pass a Bill the immediate effect and purpose of which is to defeat a judgment in a case which is in course of trial, we must be filled with apprehension as to what the future of this Parliament is to be. </para>

All I say is that it is accused of these offences, and that the matter has never been decided. Abundant evidence lias been brought forward in support of the allegations, and as ordinary reasonable men we have to act on the basis of the material put before us. </para>

                            <para>- I arn using the language of the Judge, who said that he, as an Arbitration Judge, could, not deal with matters which must properly be left to a Court having jurisdiction to deal with criminal offences. I do not, nor did the Judge, mean that the union or any member of it, had been guilty of an ordinary crime such as theft or burglary, but that they had been guilty of offences against the Act which were only punishable in that branch of jurisdiction which is not civil. Turning now to the particulars related by the honorable member for Grey in connexion with this great organization, let me say that I find on this occasion, as I have found on every occasion when amendments of the Arbitration Act were being dealt with in this House, a persistent misapprehension as to what the object of arbitration is. It must be remembered that it is not the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that maintains any association, union, or body of men. The Act was passed merely to say to the men in any industry, "You may form an organization of employees if, as employees, you think you will have a dispute with the employers." Why was that permitted? The whole matter was argued out at length at an early stage in the judicial history of this legislation. In the Jumbunna case, it was argued on the one side that this was not constitutional; that the power of the Parliament under the Constitution was merely to make laws for the settlement and prevention of industrial disputes, and that there was no power to have organizations. The Court held that there was, for the reason that a dispute under the Constitution must be one between employees on the one side and employers on the other. That is the root of the matter. Such a dispute cannot be effectively heard and determined before any Court unless there is an association to represent the employers on the one side, and an association to represent the employees on the other. That was the whole purpose of the Act. We may now have any number of associations and unions that may or may not be capable of performing the functions of such associations or organizations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Apart from this Bill altogether I desire to warn honorable members opposite that if they wish to carry out the principles, of the Act they cannot adopt a more dangerous course than that of so enlarging these organizations as to include within them persons who are not employees. Even although an Act may be passed enabling such an organization to remain on the register, that organization is deprived, by its very constitution, of the power of effectively representing employees who are in dispute with their employers. This particular provision, however, is not an exceedingly important one. It merely says to the Australian Workers Union, or any other body, "If you choose to have employers in your ranks, you may do so and still secure registration, but you must remember that even if you do obtain registration, you will, by the admission of these outsiders, defeat the very purpose for which you sought registration, because you cannot effectively carry out in the Court the purpose for which your association is registered." I am not, and never have been, a very great believer in the principle of judicial arbitration. I claim to be as eager as is the Attorney-General in the pursuit of industrial peace by any means that can be effectively adopted, but I have always maintained that the methods of judicial tribunals applied to industrial disputes are out of place, costly, cumbersome- </para>

I believe that we shall never attain industrial peace in Australia until we recast the whole foundation of the machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes - until we attack a matter before it is turned into a real, active dispute; until we create bodies of a representative character, which will not be Courts before whom lawyers may or may not appear, but before whom persons may give evidence-- </para>

                            <para>- To some extent it has. To my mind the provision in regard to compulsory conferences is the one bright spot in the arbitration law. I admit that it has brought people together, but, after all, it provides for nothing more than a compulsory conference; the conference carries no power with it. There is not sufficient time, and even if there were, I am sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> you would not permit me to go into the whole principles of arbitration law at this stage; I was led to make these observations by a remark that fell from the lips of the honorable member for Grey. I venture to say that no matter what form of organization you may have, if your object is industrial peace, you can permanently obtain it only by having bodies representing both sides, which shall possess, not a judicial power, but a subordinate legislative authority over the conditions prevailing in the particular industries with which they deal. While I do not agree with the principle of judicial arbitration, many honorable members do, and Parliament has already placed that principle on the statute-book. All that I desire now to say is that if the House embodies in the conciliation and arbitration law the principle of including in a registered organization a number of persons who are not, and cannot be, parties to any industrial dispute to be heard before the Court, then a blow will be struck at the very foundation of the machinery of industrial legislation. While holding this view, let me say that I do not object to extended organization. I have always maintained, and still maintain, that organization must go on, not only in particular, but in allied trades. But any organization, whether it be amongst shearers or ship-owners or manufacturers, which claims to possess the protection and security of the law, must cut itself absolutely loose from certain methods that have been too prevalent amongst associations of capitalists as well as of labour. A boycott or conspiracy to injure a man must not be permitted. That, however, does not involve the right of every man in every occupation to choose with whom he will work side by side. That is a right which I claim in my profession, just as every other man is entitled to claim it in connexion with his trade or occupation. It is an undoubted privilege possessed by every man. But where an association goes beyond it, where it says, "There is a man who has injured us;, he is a black sheep, and we are going to use not merely the ordinary means of selecting with whom we shall work, but all our powers to injure that man directly and indirectly, and to crush him " - such a principle, whether it be adopted by a ring of ship-owners or a union of shearers, is absolutely wrong. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to deal with any particular profession; but any profession that does adopt such a practice comes within the condemnation that I am now applying. If a firm of ship-owners said to a particular merchant, " We are not going to carry any of your goods as long as you give any freight to such-and-such a ship-owner who is outside our ring," honorable members opposite would say that that was a most improper thing to do. I have never be enable, however, to distinguish such conduct from that of a shearers union which says to a squatter, " We will not shear your sheep if you employ at any time a man who is not a member of our union.'' These principles must apply all round. I do not think there is so very much, one way or the other, in this Bill when it is carefully scrutinized, except the difficulty about the appearance before the Court to* which I have referred. But it is one step in that march towards a wider and fuller organization of industry in all its branches; and if it is coupled with those restrictions which, I submit, should alwaysatfiach to it, it will be beneficial. If it is not, it will have a deleterious effect. </para>

                        <para>.- I endeavoured to show last night, in the few scattered remarks I was permitted to make, that I object to the main principle of this Bill, and to many of its machinery provisions. I agree with, some honorable members opposite that the Bill, if it is not to become more humorous than effective, ought to be subjected to drastic amendment. No defence has come from the lips of Ministers as to the main principle of compulsion in voting, and I think that before the Bill is finally passed we are entitled to expect from them some justification of that principle. The machinery of the Bill, it strikes me, is rather crude. The  Deputy  Returning  Officer of a division in which a vote takes place is expected, in accordance with the provisions of the measure, to return a list of those who have not voted, of those who have sent reasons good or  insufficient  for not voting, and of those who have not replied to the Chief Electoral Officer of the State. There is no clear direction as to how this officer is to deal with the complaints - whether he has to send them to the central office or place them in the hands of those who are to take summary or other judicial proceedings. I assume that the Chief Electoral Officer, either State or central, will not be the sole judge of whether a reason is sufficient or valid. I do not know whether that is what the Minister intends, or whether the idea, is to try the offenders by judicial proceeding, and strike them off the roll. </para>

                            <para>- According to clause 5, we propose that there shall be trial by regulation. Never before, even in this Parliament, has an attempt been made to give the Governor-General in Council power to prescribe modes of trial without any stipulation as to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Court, the procedure as to notice or summons, or anything of the kind. I think that, instead of clause 5 providing for' regulations, a number of clauses should be embodied in the Bill, prescribing the way in which an alleged offender shall be tried. Then, I take leave to Say that it will be necessary to allow a longer period for the trial. Unless we are very careful we shall bring to the ordinary Courts of the States hundreds of thousands of people probably in a very short time, and this will mean that the usual business concerning buyer and seller, landlord and tenant, and so forth, will have to be put aside. Otherwise there will be a glut of work all over Australia, causing a vast amount of irritation both to the judiciary officers and the persons who are summoned. Therefore, I think there should be some procedure suggested which would ' spread the trials for these offences over, probably, six months, so as to give a chance for their adequate hearing. If this is not done, there will be a series of complaints in the newspapers and to the Department which will destroy whatever other virtue there may be in the proposals of the Government for compulsory voting. I have been called upon unexpectedly to finish my remarks, and I do not propose to detain the House any longer. I ask the Minister to believe honorable members on his side who have pointed out with considerable force that there is a lot of raw haste shown in the preparation of this measure, and raw haste, as the honorable gentleman knows, is the sister of delay, as well as the sister of disaster on some occasions. However much we may object to the measure, I hope that the Minister will consent to alterations which will render it more smooth of operation. If the Chamber agrees to .the second reading which I shall feel compelled to vote against, I shall suggest amendments which I think will facilitate the operation of the Bill. </para>

At one time, however, the honorable member, when in the State sphere, was so much in favour of compulsion that, when he got a voter into the polling booth, he compelled him to exercise his vote in reference to all the candidates offering. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Balaclava, along with others on his side, is very much concerned because there are something like 100,000 soldiers at the front who will not be able to exercise a vote upon the referenda. We never hear a word, however, about the half million people in Victoria who have no vote at all, owing to the' Legislative Council, which had the last say in the matter. It has been said that we on this side have our tongues in our cheeks when advocating measures of this sort; and yet we hear honorable members opposite urging that, because our soldiers in Gallipoli and in Egypt will not be able to vote, this Bill should not be proceeded with. They never urge that this half million people in Victoria should be given the franchise. Then again, I suppose there are thousands of our soldiers who are only about eighteen years of age; and I should like to know whether honorable members opposite would reduce the voting age from twenty-one years in order to meet their case, and also allow them to exercise the franchise for the Legislative Council and other bodies of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know why honorable members opposite should be so concerned about the fact that there will be 100,000 soldiers unable to cast votes on the referenda, because that will be the misfortune of the Labour party. I believe that the bulk of the men who are away would vote the Labour ticket, and I think it is an underestimate to say that 75 per cent, of them would vote ' ' yes ' ' upon the referenda. It is not in the interest of the party in power that these questions should be submitted while all these men are away from Australia. </para>

                    <para>We have heard from honorable members opposite a good deal of talk about submitting these proposals to the people at a time when their minds and thoughts are concentrated on different matters and honorable members have claimed that we should not introduce legislation compelling the people to exercise the franchise during a time of war. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> says that this is " specious nonsense which originated on the Liberal side, and was eagerly seized on by Labour leaders though it was the merest clap-trap." Honorable members claim that it is party politics to introduce a measure such as this. When they make this claim they remind me of many discussions I have heard at meetings of the Australian Natives Association as to what is the real meaning of party politics. That body has found that when a matter is first mooted, and is not exceedingly popular, it is generally regarded as party politics, but when it becomes popular, and both sides of the community are in favour of it, it is considered to be a national question. To a certain extent, this is experimental legislation, but honorable members opposite have said that we are not going far enough by not applying it also to general elections. First, they blame the Government for introducing compulsory voting. Then they say that they do not believe in compulsion, and that it should not be introduced at a time when 100,000 men are out of the country, and then they say that we should go further, and extend the principle to election of members of Parliament. To satisfy honorable members opposite is impossible. They approach a matter from all points of the compass. They say, " You should not do it " ; and when we do it, they say, " You are not going far enough." Of course, there will be cases such as those cited by the honorable member for Gippsland, who asks whether we are going to compel a person who lives 20 miles from a polling booth to go over mountain roads to cast his vote, and fine him if he does not do ro. In my opinion, such a measure as this will be administered with common sense, and  there  will be no harassing or fining or dragging before a Court if persons can urge reasonable excuses for not having cast their votes; but where thousands of people in cities or towns do not exercise the privilege which it has cost so much  to gain,  they should be compelled to pay fines. While the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> blames the party on this side of the House for submitting these proposals at the present time, and for advocating compulsory voting, we would not hear anything from that quarter if the Government would only include the Initiative and Referendum among the questions to be submitted to the people. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> takes the attitude assumed by honorable members opposite. It blames us for doing something at such a time as this, and then stands on the other foot, and says that we are not doing sufficient, and should do more. The duty of the Government is to go straight ahead. The whole operation of politics and government cannot cease simply because the war has overshadowed everything else. It is to the disadvantage of honorable members on this side of the chamber that the referenda should be submitted at such a time. It certainly is not to the disadvantage of the party opposite. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like honorable members opposite to give us some reason why the Bill is brought before the House at this time. If the Government stated that they were in favour of compulsory voting, I could understand a proposal to amend the electoral law, and institute it in connexion with all elections and polls; but it seems strange that we are to have it only in connexion with the referenda. </para>

                            <para>- That is the second occasion on which the honorable member has admitted that there is a great deal of evil in connexion with the referenda. That is what we complain of; also the greater evil in the discussion of these questions at the present time. The Bill deals specifically with the referenda in 1915. I am surprised that some effort was not made by the Government to have the referenda taken at a later date. After reading in the papers this morning the enormous list of casualties sustained at Gallipoli, leaving so many houses in mourning, we can realize the feeling of the people when they are told that, in a few months hence, they will be compelled to go to the poll, and make themselves conversant with every matter submitted to them at the referenda. It is astounding that the Government should insist on these issues being placed before the people at such a time. Over 100,000 Australian citizens who are absent from the country performing the highest service for the Empire are to be disfranchised deliberately. Some time ago, in reply to a question asked by me, the Minister said that an effort would be made to enable these men to vote; but there is no clause in the Bill which gives effect to that promise, and it is, in fact, impossible to make such provision. </para>

I believe that trade unionists have joined the colours as freely as members of other sections of the community, though there is at the Trades Hall, to their everlasting discredit and disgrace, a large number of responsible persons antagonistic to the action that the Government has taken in connexion with the war. I am sure that honorable members opposite do not agree with them. I protest strongly against the disfranchisement of over 100,000 citizens in connexion with an alteration of the Constitution under which we live. </para>

                            <para>- No; it would be preposterous. Another objection that I have to the referendum is that it is to be held in December. That arrangement will strike a second blow at those opposed to the referenda. I believe that a large majority of those absent on active service would vote against it, and that a large majority of the farmers would do so. But in December the latter will be -busy getting in the harvest, and it will be difficult for them to get to the polling booths. The vote could be taken early in November or in January. That would suit the primary producers better, and they have more at stake than any one else has. If honorable members opposite desire that those who live in the country shall exercise the franchise, they will provide for something in the nature of postal voting. In the constituency which I represent, many persons have to travel from 50 to 100 miles to record their vote, the constituency being a place of enormous distances, as is that represented by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and it is impossible to provide a sufficient number of polling booths to convenience all the electors. During the last election some persons travelled 200 miles to record their votes, and many persons travelled distances varying from 30 to 70 miles. It is unjust to disfranchise the dwellers in the country, and I hope that in Committee provision will be made for some kind of postal voting. I do not like the provisions which deal with excuses for not voting. Apparently the Divisional Returning Officers will be able to accept excuses from any person who does not vote. If electors do nob vote, and do not give good reasons for not voting, I think that their names might very well be removed from the rolls, only to be replaced on a second application for enrolment. But if we are going to have compulsory voting, the Divisional Returning Officers should not be allowed to accept any excuses that may be made for not voting. </para>

                        <para>.- The Bill, like the curate's egg, is good in parts. I have always been in <inline font-style="italic">favour</inline> of <inline font-style="italic">compulsory</inline> voting, but have maintained that it should go hand in hand with compulsory registration. Many members of the Opposition have announced the same opinion, but when compulsory registration was being considered, three-fourths of them voted against it, as being useless without compulsory voting, and now they are condemning compulsory voting. The electors, however, must have every opportunity for recording their votes, and it appears to me that considering that we are making voting compulsory, we are not providing sufficient facilities for voting. I propose to vote for the Bill only on the understanding that in Committee some amendment will be made fixing a distance limit. I would suggest that all persons within a limit of 7 miles of a polling booth should be compelled to record their votes, but persons residing outside that limit should not come under the compulsory clauses. </para>

                            <para>- As a result of past experience there is a taint attached to postal voting which makes its re-introduction almost unthinkable. When postal voting was in operation the abuses of it were endless, and in the electorate of Wannon there was a number of prosecutions, notably at Coleraine, where a J. P. was fined about <inline font-style="italic">£40</inline> for the abuses in connexion with postal voting1 practised under his observation and control. What happened there was only typical of a great number of abuses that took place throughout the Commonwealth. The postal voting provisions were inserted in the Act for the benefit of the people in the back country, but I believe that more postal votes were recorded in the electorate of Kooyong at one election than in the whole State of Queensland, a fact which shows that the facility was availed of in places where it was not required. But, whilst I say that a return to postal voting is unthinkable, I quite agree with the honorable member for Corangamite that in his electorate, my own electorate, and a number of other electorates, there will be endless trouble in consequence of these compulsory voting provisions. In fact, there are electors who cannot possibly comply with the requirements of this Bill, and in Committee I shall propose an amendment to insert some such limitation as I have suggested. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any prosecution would be allowed in any civilized country in such cases as those quoted by the honorable member for Corangamite. I was struck by the remark of the honorable member for Balaclava, that while he was opposed to the principle of compulsory voting, he had always favoured the principle of compulsory registration. I would remind the honorable member that he represented the electorate of Essendon in the State Parliament for 10 years, and that during the greater portion of that period there were over 2,000 electors off the roll who should have been on the roll. During the short period of Labour Government in Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Prendergast ordered a police canvass, which showed that over 2,000 names had been intentionally, or otherwise, kept off the rolls of the electorate of Essendon alone, and the fact that those names were subsequently added may have had something to do with the presence of the honorable member for Balaclava in this Chamber. A contradictory attitude was adopted by the honorable member for Dampier when he pleaded for consideration for the 100,000 men at the front, and in the next breath told the House that he believed in the property qualification in connexion with the Upper Houses of the State Parliaments. The honorable member must know that State legislation cannot reach the statute-books  until  it passes the Upper Houses, and thousands of men and women are deprived of voting for the return of members to those Chambers. The honorable member made a plausible plea for the men serving at the front, knowing that as State electors they have never been entitled to a vote for the Legislative Councils of their respective States. To a large extent he was speaking with his tongue in  his cheek,  because he has always supported the action of State Parliaments which denied those men a vote for "the Upper House. I am glad to have the assurance of the Minister of Home Affairs that in Committee an amendment will be made to give a greater facility to the people in the country districts to record their votes. As they are to be compelled to vote it is only right that they should have full opportunity to do so. </para>

                        <para>.  - There is in this Bill a very serious defect. The object of universal franchise was to insure that any vote taken would be truly expressive of the will of the whole of the people. Every adult was given the franchise in the hope and expectation that every one would exercise it, so that Australia would speak clearly and distinctly for or against any candidate or measure. The franchise has been given to every adult in the community, but we find that the means of exercising it are not as wide as the franchise itself. Therefore, we are not enabled to get from the people their truly expressed will, because honorable members opposite have taken away the convenience which would have enabled that to be done, and to that extent the true principle of Democracy has been violated. Already there is on the statute-book the principle of compulsory registration, so that every adult is compelled to have his or her name placed on the rolls ; but though we have not yet provided the complement of that in the form of means of exercising the franchise, we are about to place upon the  people  a legal obligation to vote. The honorable member for Indi, who represents a country constituency, knows how seriously this provision will affect the people in the rural districts.  His  conscience very properly tells him that the Bill is defective, but the amendment he suggests is not a remedy at all.  His  idea is that those people who reside in the settled areas within 7 miles of a polling booth shall be compelled to vote, but that people residing outside those areas shall have no compulsion placed upon them. A vote taken in those circumstances would not necessarily be a vote representative of the will of the whole of the people of Australia, but only of the populous districts in the immediate neighbourhood of cities and towns. Such a proposal would make this measure a compulsory exclusion Bill instead of a Compulsory Voting Bill. Honorable members opposite say, " Of course, we should like to give you the postal vote, and it grieves us sorely to see old pioneers and sick people deprived of the opportunity of voting, but we cannot restore the postal  vote because the system is tainted." The system has not been tainted. Postal voting was investigated by a Select Committee of this House in 1904, and the law, which was originally framed on the assumption that it would be exercised honestly, was found to be defective on account of the weakness of human nature. In the year 1905 or 1906 a new Bill was introduced to provide for postal voting under safeguards which were accepted by members on both sides in this House. Since the insertion of those safeguards there has been no general complaints against the postal voting system. There have been complaints in isolated cases, but consider the number of cases of personation. Would honorable members abolish voting at the ballot-box because a certain number of persons were guilty of personation ? </para>

                            <para>- All the documents and sworn declarations were in the Department. The taint of the postal-voting system was not in any defect in it as an instrument of electoral expression, but because it was found by honorable members opposite to be an inconvenient instrument which was used against them. The system of compulsory voting did operate in Queensland at the last State general election, but there were two provisions which made the principle acceptable to the people, namely, voting by post Wit.- the safeguards which had formerly existed in the Commonwealth Act, and voting facilities for the men about to leave for the front. The application of the principle in Queensland has been effective in securing a higher percentage of voting. In 1;&gt;03 the voting for the House of Representatives was 50.27 per cent., which is undoubtedly a very low standard. At the next general election, in 1906, it increased to 51.48 per cent.; in 1910, it was 62.80 per cent. ; in 1913, 73.49 per cent. ; and in 1914, 73.53 per cent. At the general election for the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1902 the voting in those electorates where a contest took place represented 7S.SS per cent, of the electors on the roll. That was a very high percentage considering there was no compulsion. At the election for the same House in 1904 the voting was 74.16 per cent.; in 1907, 71.61 per cent.; in 1908, 67.39 per cent.; in .1909, 72.57 per cent.; and in 1912, 75.52 per cent. At the last State election, under compulsory voting, the percentage increased from 75.52 in 1912 to 88.14. In some constituencies there were no contests. </para>

                            <para>- There were 266,240 votes polled. The number who voted by post was very considerable. Twelve thousand seven hundred and forty-one votes cast into certain electorates in Australia at the last Federal general election would have meant that the Labour party would not be in a majority in this House to-day. These 12,741 electors were entitled to exercise the franchise, and they did so. The Commonwealth Government, however, will deprive such electors who are sick, or who, for some other reason, cannot go to the poll, from recording their votes. To provide for compulsory voting, and to give all facilities for the exercise of the franchise in our cities, while neglecting to provide any facilities for people living in scattered districts, and those who are sick, to record their votes, is but to intensify the existing disparity as between town and country. This should be a non-party question, . and I have certainly delivered a non-party speech, as will be recognised by the fact that the honorable member for Indi has agreed with me that the Bill will operate injuriously on the rural districts of Australia. I come now to the question of excuses that may be offered for failure to vote. Here are some of the excuses that were made at the last State election in Queensland :  - " Sudden illness," a very valid excuse; "Ignorance in regard to postal voting, and thinking absentee voting in force." That arose from the fact that the Commonwealth and the States have two different systems. Another excuse was, " Inability to have postal votes witnessed owing to absence of eligible witnesses." That trouble could be easily remedied. Still another excuse was " Religious convictions." Is there to be a conscience clause applying to those who have religious convictions ? </para>

                            <para>- Surely the electors could not be called upon to vote upon anything more important than a proposed amendment of the Constitution. A Ministry may be elected to-day and deposed to-morrow; but an amendment of the Constitution, once having been made, cannot easily be repealed. It is, therefore, most necessary that we should take care that the vote cast on these referenda proposals is a fair and proper one. Still further excuses offered for failure to vote at the last Queensland State elections were "absence from the State, and inability to have postal vote witnessed outside State," "inability to receive postal votes while travelling," and "being unable to write, could not get postal vote." </para>

                        <para>.- In proposing to hold a referenda at this juncture, the Government are offering sufficient hostages to fortune, without providing for compulsory voting in connexion with it; and as one who is interested in their career I feel that, in submitting a proposition of this kind, they are taking, from their own point of view, risks which are not warranted. It has been contended that the present Leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister, objected to postpone the last general elections, as was suggested, because of the outbreak of war. That, however, is a two-sided argument. We then desired that the election should be postponed, though the war was not at its height; whereas to-day, although the situation is more serious, we are not only voluntarily entering the political arena to hold a party fight, but are taking steps to compel the people to record their votes. The most serious objection is that we are intruding, to a great extent, upon the sanctity of the people's grief By the time that this vote is taken, at least 25 per cent, of the homes of Australia will be houses of sorrow, and we shall be almost guilty of sacrilege in intruding upon the people in their time of mourning, and compelling them, under penalty of a fine, to participate in a party struggle. If I had my way, compulsory voting would not be introduced at this particular juncture. It is more or less of an experiment, and it might be tried with advantage at other times. But if it is to be applied now, we should, as far as possible, smooth the way for those who will suffer considerable distress of mind in  being  dragged to the polls, and some provision in the nature of postal voting, or something to ease the situation, should be introduced. Discussing this Bill on its merits, it seems to me that, instead of any benefit accruing from the application of this principle at the present time, the Government, in compelling the electors to vote, under pains and penalties, are going to be  rended  by the people. Wherever the principle has been applied, the Government responsible for its introduction has suffered. The fate of the late Queensland Government is a case in point. I believe that those who vote against their will will vote against the Government which compels them to vote. That, after all, is one of the first principles of human nature, and is  likely  to operate more particularly in view of the fact that many people have so much justification for resenting this compulsion at the present time. Instead of benefiting us, as is thought, this Bill will tend, in my opinion, to prevent the carrying of the Constitution Alteration Bills, which we <inline font-style="italic">are</inline> all anxious shall be accepted. </para>

                            <para>- My concern is not as to what the Opposition may do, but as to the success of the referenda and the credit of the Government. The Ministry are acting unwisely in compelling the people, particularly at the present time, to record their votes. The excuses for which provision will have to be made will provide many an avenue for escape from the obligation. The Bill, indeed, is likely in this way to fail in its object, since owing to the situation many excuses will be availed of. If special leniency is not displayed in dealing with those who find it impossible or inadvisable to vote, then the trouble of sheeting home breaches of the law will be such that the Bill will fail from its own weight. </para>

                        <para>.- I confess to a feeling of disappointment with the Bill as placed before us. The Government have had the advantage of having before them the report of the Electoral Commission, bub they have fallen far short of what they might have done in a matter of this kind. I object to the application of compulsory voting to only me particular form of election. I am » believer in compulsory voting, consider ing it to be the natural corollary of compulsory enrolment; but in limiting this measure to the forthcoming referenda, and making no provision whatever for the large number of persons who, because of sickness on the one hand, or patriotic efforts on the other, will be unable to record their votes, the measure falls far short of what might reasonably be expected from the National Parliament. I agree with the honorable member for Macquarie that it is very unreasonable on the part of the Government to intrude a proposal of this sort when there is so much trouble and grief in the households of Australia. I quite believe with the honorable member that the results of this measure will be exactly the contrary of those anticipated by the Government. Why should we have referenda on alterations of the Constitution, of vital importance to the whole community, when there are over 100,000 voters away from our shores? Then, again, why should we take such referenda without any provision for 77,000 sick and infirm people, who, according to the Statistician, are too ill to attend a polling booth on any day during the year ? Thus we have nearly 200,000 citizens who will not be able to exercise the franchise. I quite sympathize with the opinions expressed in regard to the desirability of equality of voting. Is the vote of a man who lives within a quarter of a mile of a polling booth of any greater value than that of a man who lives 25 miles away? Is the latter not just as much entitled to facilities for voting as is the man who lives next door to a booth ? I take it that the object of the measure is to have compulsory voting, and not to obtain a record of excuses made by people who do not vote. What is the good of thousands of excuses when the idea is to make every person vote under a penalty ? The whole thing on the face of it seems inconsistent. I am not wedded to any particular method of insuring that every person on the rolls shall record a vote, and if there is any objection to postal voting let us try something else. I confess that after eighteen months' experience on the Electoral Commission, and after taking evidence in every State, and asking for suggestions to overcome the difficulty, I have not heard of any better plan than postal voting under proper safeguards. We heard many assertions during our travels as to abuses of postal voting, but in spite of the legal penalties provided there is no record, as the honorable member for Darling Downs pointed out, of one prosecution. I can only conclude that, as I say, we have but mere assertions as to abuses. Then does the Minister realize the enormous amount of extra work and the difficulties this Bill will impose on his prominent officials? The Divisional Returning Officers, according to clause 4, are compelled to supply information that will really be found impossible. For instance, is any record kept of the men who have gone to the front, and of their old addresses? Will each Divisional Returning Officer be supplied with the names and addresses of all the men at the front in order that he may comply with the law, and, within the prescribed period after the close of the referenda, </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Bend by post to each elector whose name appears on the list at the address mentioned in that list a notice that he appears to have failed to vote ? How will he be able to discriminate between the individual who is shirking his duty and the man who has gone to the front? What will be the position when he finds that he cannot return this information in accordance with the Act ? How is it going to be proved that any man is not in Australia? I should rather welcome a measure for compulsory voting if it were on reasonable lines, because I believe it would assist greatly in the cleansing of the rolls. Of course, the idea of taking the vote in the trenches is ridiculous; but if we could devise a plan whereby we could get a fair and reasonable return of the voters, it would in a short time make our rolls much cleaner than they are to-day, and settle for ever any suspicion of names being wrongly there. I hope that when we get into Committee some remedies may be suggested for the difficulties that I have indicated, and the Bill made a little more workable. I should prefer that, even at this late hour, the Government should reconsider the position, and show that they have come to their senses by declaring that they will not impose referenda on the suffering public at this time. If, however, they insist on carrying out their declared intention, I hope that every facility will be afforded for recording the vote of every elector in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the honorable member not to press his amendment, because it is against the whole spirit of the measure. We are not amending the Electoral Act. We propose to allow the existing electoral machinery, whether it is good, bad, or indifferent, to stand, with the exception that we are applying to it the principle of compulsory voting. I propose to meet the difficulty raised by honorable members by an amendment to sub-clause 6, which deals with prescribed persons who may witness the excuses advanced by electors for not voting. If I define "prescribed person " as an elector or person qualified to be an elector, it should meet the case. The Government do not wish to make this measure a vindictive Bill, inflicting hardships on hundreds of people, whose difficulties have been so strongly urged by honorable members representing scattered electorates. The measure would certainly be intolerable without some amendment, but as the principle underlying it is that every one must vote or give a reasonable excuse for not doing so, the better course to adopt is not to make a boundary, as suggested by the amendment, but to provide for enlarging the number of persons who -may witness excuses,  i  Any person may witness a claim for enrolment, but he must vouch for the truth of the statements upon the claim. Honorable members have signed hundreds of these claims. I propose to have the same simple machinery in regard to excuses for not voting. Some people say that all sorts of excuses will be put up. I do not believe it. To enlarge on the virtues and honesty of the people of Australia in electoral matters is of no use. If we can trust the people in regard to one portion of electoral business, why should we not do it in re gard to this matter, and thus remove the disability that the Bill imposes on country people ? The Government have no intention of using their position for the purpose of inflicting hardship on persons who reside in country districts. I ask the honorable member for Indi to withdraw his amendment. </para>

I admit that when we demand that people shall do something which they have not hitherto done there is responsibility on the Government to make it possible for the people to do it. But we have no need to adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Indi, or even that which the Leader of the Opposition has forecasted. It can easily be done by increasing the number of polling places, and making it possible for every elector to reach a polling place within a reasonable distance. </para>

                        <para>- I take the responsibility of what I do in my own electorate, and I do not require any guidance from the honorable member. The remedy lies in the extension of polling places. We know that Divisional Returning Officers have sent out tents to establish booths at saw-mills and such places. It may cost a little more, but it will prevent our making a laughing-stock of this Bill, and, at the same time, will enable us to carry into effect the object it has in view. I believe in compulsory voting, though some people have told me that I shall regret adopting it. I think that, in a democratic community, every elector should exercise his responsibility to vote, but under reasonable conditions. </para>

                <para class="block">Indi will press his amendment. The honorable member for Gwydir seems to think that polling booths can be established within a reasonable distance of every home; but it is the experience of most country members that there are many places in which that is impossible. On one occasion I travelled over very bad roads to the top of a steep hill; to visit a place where there were, only four persons, and they were many miles from any one else. I would sooner pay £1 than travel 5 miles over such a road to record a vote. I do not believe in the provision of travelling polling booths; but something might be done to convenience country electors by opening a  booth  at one place for a certain number of hours, and then transferring it to another place. At the present time the poll officials and scrutineers have to remain all day in a polling booth, although it may be situated at a place where only half-a-dozen votes will be recorded, and they cannot close the poll even when they know that all the voting that can take place has been done. In my opinion, the best way to get over the difficulty would be to reintroduce postal voting. In city constituencies I would allow only those who were too unwell to visit polling booths to vote by post, perhaps requiring a doctor's certificate to prove inability to go to the poll; but in sparsely populated country districts I would make the provision more liberal. The supporters of the present Government, because of abuses that occurred many years ago, do not believe in postal voting, and we are not likely to have it provided for now; consequently, I shall support the amendment. I am glad that the honorable member for Indi did not fix the distance at 7 miles. </para>

                        <para>- That does not get over the difficulty. Provision is not made to excuse an elector for not voting if he resides more than a certain distance from a polling booth, and there should be some such provision. At the present time an elector may vote or not if he chooses, and we have no right to say to persons living perhaps 10 or 20 miles from a polling booth, " If you do not vote, it will rest with some electoral official to say whether you shall be prosecuted or not." We should state definitely that electors shall not be prosecuted for non-voting if no adequate facilities are provided for them. The electors should not be left in doubt as to their position. If we make voting compulsory we should provide polling facilities within reasonable distance of the electors. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Gwydir says truly that he represents' a large electorate, in which the population is scattered, and it might be thought from his attitude that there is no need for providing better facilities for voting in the back country. I have known the Gwydir electorate since I was a mere boy. In travelling in it I have taken ten days to go 100 miles with the best horses procurable. I have known it to take the coach a day and a half to get from Collarenebri, the few miles to the railway station, and I have known times when you could travel 60 miles in the electorate without seeing a house or a drop of water. People in such districts need every facility that we can give them for the recording of their votes. Personally, I believe in postal voting, and my knowledge of the conditions of the Gwydir electorate confirms my belief in that system. There are dry times and wet times in that dis- &amp;trict, when it is impossible for a great many of the electors there to go to the poll. I am afraid that the Minister has such a prejudice against postal voting that there is no chance of its being adopted, and, therefore, I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the amendment will be accepted. In my district many persons reside more than 5 miles from a polling booth. The Minister tried to make it appear that the difficulty could be got over by making it as easy as possible to get a witness to give an excuse for not voting. But the Chief Electoral Officer may not accept any proffered excuse, and the elector is to be dealt with, not by a Court, but by that official. In my opinion, those living more than 5 miles from a polling booth should not be prosecuted if they do not vote. </para>

We, therefore, suggest the amendment of the. Act to provide for postal voting prior to the day of election, with sufficient statutory safeguards. </para>

                        <para>- They could be visited by accredited men, who would be answerable for seeing that the postal voting system was properly carried out. No member of any Parliament has suffered as I suffered through the abuse of the postal-voting system in Victoria, but I fought my case in the High Court, and won it. I had 150 sworn declarations. In the small Gipps division, no elector in which was more than half-a-mile from a polling booth, more postal votes were recorded than in the whole State of Western Australia on one occasion, of Queensland on another occasion, and of Tasmania on two occasions. The repetition of such infamy must be prevented. But if we have proper statutory regulations, I see no objection to a system of postal voting. The adoption of that system will remove any complaint that certain persons are deprived of the opportunity of voting, and unless a. clause for that purpose is introduced I will vote for the amendment moved by the honorable member for Indi . </para>

                    <para>. - This is no longer a Compulsory Voting Bill, but only a Compulsory Voting Bill for some voters in some places. The amendment only accentuates the disabilities of those who live in far-back districts. While the Government regiment the whole of the people in the city, and compel them, under pains and penalties, to record their votes, are they going to provide no facilities for the people far back, who suffer under such disabilities? Are they to be allowed to vote or not, as they please ? It seems that the more sectional an Act of Parliament can be made the more it commends itself to honorable members opposite. The Electoral Commission made a unanimous recommendation in favour of the incorporation of the postal vote in the electoral machinery. I was not aware until this moment that there were two or three honorable members on the Government side who were in favour of postal voting, and I hope that we shall secure their aid in putting into the electoral law the principles they as members of the Commission recommended after travelling the whole of Australia and taking exhaustive evidence upon the subject. I do not propose to argue the question at length, because it has been threshed out until it is threadbare, but I move - </para>

                    <para>.- I am disappointed with the reply of the Minister. After the ready way in which he accepted the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Indi, I thought he would at least have done the honorable members on this side the compliment of accepting any amendment we moved, particularly when such an amendment is the inevitable corollary of the amendment to which the Committee has just agreed. I do not believe in the Bill, and I desire, if possible, to make it useless and ridiculous; I think the amendment . moved by the honorable member for Indi does that. The  effect of  the Bill, as amended, is that at the forthcoming referenda, roughly, two-thirds of the people are to be compelled to vote, and about one-third will be beyond the reach of compulsion. I represent a constituency every elector of which will be theoretically compelled to vote; and I now say to honorable members who represent far-distant parts of the Commonwealth that, as metropolitan members have helped them to gain freedom for the more distant parts of their constituencies, they ought now to help us to provide facilities for the rest of the people to vote if they are under disabilities in regard to voting at an ordinary polling booth. I feel obliged to vote for the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter and accept the recommendation unanimously arrived at by the Electoral Commission for the restoration of the postal vote. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that this Bill does not propose a permanent amendment of the electoral law does not affect my argument. If it is a good thing to have compulsion in connexion with the first big referendum, we ought to apply the same principle to electoral contests; and the mere fact that the Minister does not deem it advisable to adopt that course at this stage is no reply to my argument. The Minister proposes to insert what he regards as a remedial provision in subclauses 5 and 6 by making " prescribed persons " to mean any elector. The effect of that is only to make it easier for the elector who receives a communication from the Department asking why he did not vote to supply an answer, but it does not relieve him of liability to the penalty. When he has provided the answer, what happens ? The Divisional Returning Officer writes the answer on the margin of his roll, and gives his opinion of it. But the Chief Electoral Officer may take no notice of that opinion, and proceed to prosecute the elector. It will not be much comfort to him then to recollect that he had been able to return to the Divisional Returning Officer, with comparatively little inconvenience, a reply to his inquiry. I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the matter. </para>

                        <para>- No. The principle which the Government are following is that of accepting every amendment moved from their own side, and of ignoring every amendment submitted by the Opposition. If the statement made by the Minister is all that can be said against postal voting, then he is proceeding in the most arbitrary way to disfranchise thousands of people without paying them the compliment of telling them the reason for his action. Why will the referenda differ from any other exercise of the electoral machinery ? The people will have to vote just as they would at a general election under our electoral machinery. They will suffer the same disabilities, and will be subject to the same penalties in addition to the new ones now being enacted. Their vote will be even more important than when cast at a general election. </para>

                        <para>- What we have to keep in view is the object of our legislation. The object of this Bill is to secure a big vote. We should therefore give the people every facility for voting. Instead of doing so, the Government are providing the fullest facilities for, and applying the principle of compulsion to, two-thirds of the electors of Australia, leaving the rest to vote, or not, as they please. My honorable friends opposite have called themselves Democrats, and Democrats are supposed to provide equal opportunities for all. That is supposed to be their lodestar, but in this case they are throwing the principle overboard. They are legislating for sections of the people while ignoring other sections, troubling nothing whatever about their vote or their facilities for voting. The whole matter is now becoming a screaming farce. </para>

                        <para>- I shall tell the honorable member what is the matter, and I hope he will forgive me for speaking plainly. The supporters of the Labour, party live in crowded centres of population, and the Government are going to take care that they vote, while at the same time they seem to care little whether the people in the back parts of Australia vote or not. They are going to make perfectly sure of their own vote in the centres where it preponderates. It is neither more nor less than a party movement for a party end, and for party purposes. Honorable members opposite cannot escape from that imputation unless they consent to give the people in the back parts of Australia facilities for exercising the franchise equal to those afforded city residents. The fiat, however, has gone forth; the Czar has issued his ukase ! This is not a joking matter. It is of serious import to the electors of Australia that one section should be penalized and compelled to vote, while other sections are completely ignored by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I object to any radius being fixed. An elector, wherever he may be, should be given the fullest facilities for exercising his vote. We should take the facilities to the people, whether they be close at hand or far off. We should try to remove some of the disabilities under which people living in the back country labour; but the Government decline to give them any relief. It is useless, however, to argue with them. They are going to round up their own vote in the cities, where it preponderates for the most part, and to ignore entirely the voters in the interior of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- I certainly think that this facility should be given. The object of the Bill is to secure as large a vote as possible, and the Government would be well advised in displaying this consistency in the matter of voting. I have already given expression to my view as to the wisdom of passing a Bill of this kind at the present juncture, but seeing that it is to become law, we should endeavour to make it as effective as possible. We have eliminated one objectionable feature, the retention of which would have penalized those who could not get to a booth. That is good, and to complete the good work I see no alternative to the amendment now before us. I am not afraid of the postal vote; it has always been as much in my favour as in favour of my opponent. That people who cannot go to the poll - particularly when their inability fs" due to illness - should be deprived of the franchise is quite at variance with the democratic sentiment of- the day, and I cannot understand the Government standing for such a principle, since it is both illogical and unjust. </para>

                    <para>. - I appeal to the Minister to agree to the amendment to provide for voting by post. I do not care how strongly the principle is safeguarded ; my sole desire is that those living outside a certain radius of a polling booth shall still have an opportunity to record their votes. In the more sparsely populated districts the  Deputy  Returning Officers or poll clerks could be authorized to receive postal ballot-papers some days before the date of the poll. Surely they are to be trusted. I do not know that it would be possible for them to travel all over the country and to call on all who would be unable to attend a polling booth; but surely they might be permitted to receive and witness postal ballot-papers.  Deputy  Returning Officers, poll clerks and police magistrates might be made authorized witnesses. As my honorable friends opposite seem to have a strong grudge against justices of the peace, I shall not ask that they be made authorized witnesses. This Bill will press very harshly on many people, unless they have an opportunity to vote by post. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, then he might agree to have movable polling booths shifting from place to place on referenda day. Arrangements could be made to have tents, covered waggons, or motor lorries, such as are used by creameries, at certain points on certain roads, at a given hour, at which people could record their votes. This is a practical suggestion. The people would know that from, say, 8 a.m. until 9 a.m. they could vote at a certain point on a certain road, and that if they did not vote within that time, they would have to drive to a point further up the road in order to do so. Even if the Minister is opposed to the application of postal voting to a general election, surely he might very well consider the advisableness of applying the principle to the forthcoming referenda. </para>

                    <para>.-! also appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. The country districts are altogether differently circumstanced from the city and suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney. There is nothing in the argument that the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition means an amendment of the electoral law, because the restoration of postal voting would be only for the referenda to be taken in the year 1915, and could not be grafted on to the electoral law unless that law were amended. Compulsory voting is now proposed, and it is incumbent upon us to provide the very best facilities for voting. I am afraid that the amendment of the honorable member for Indi will result in a tangle, because if we adopt the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition it would, in view of the former, apply only to people within 5 miles of a polling booth. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Minister will listen to the pleading of the Opposition and the honor able member for Macquarie, and extend the right of postal voting to 100,000 electors who otherwise will be disfranchised. The Minister has said that this is not the proper place for the amendment, which practically means an alteration of the Electoral Act, but the sub-clause under discussion, if it means anything, also means a temporary amendment of that Act, providing, as it does, that, if an elector does not respond to the invitation given, his name shall be struck off the roll. Compulsory voting is a temporary measure which will expire after the referenda, and the same may be said of postal voting if it be adopted. There are thousands of electors who take a deep interest in constitutional questions, which affect them more than they do the nomadic population, and the postal vote ought certainly to be extended to them, and also to the sick and infirm. Personally, I feel grieved to think that the Government are showing such despotism as to force a referendum on the people at this time, but, in any case all facilities for voting are a necessary corollary to compulsory enrolment. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems strange that the Minister should hold that this is not the proper place for an amendment of the sort, seeing that compulsory voting for those within 5 miles of a polling booth is certainly an innovation in the face of which facilities for those at a distance ought not to be refused. It would appear as if the keen desire of the Government was only to get the votes of a large majority of one section of the community, and that they are careless whether others vote or not. In 1912 there were 133,000 births in Australia, and if even only one-sixth of these women were not able to attend at the polling booth it means 23,000 and over will be disfranchised. In addition, we have to remember that, according to the latest returns, there are some 77,000 sick and incapacitated persons who ought to be afforded an opportunity to record their votes by post. Further, the referendum is to be taken in December, when the farmers are particularly busy, and they, together with the enormous number of other people who live in the back country, are worthy of more consideration than those who live about the cities. It is the former who are developing the country, and upon whom we depend for our future welfare, and tens of thousands of them will be dis  franchisee! unless proper facilities are afforded. In Western Australia, with a Labour Government for four or five years, the Electoral Act allows postal voting by those who have reason to believe they will be more than 7 miles away from a polling booth, for women who are in ill health, and others who are prevented from attending owing to illness or serious infirmity. Special- application forms are issued, and special officers appointed to see that the Jaw is properly observed. There is no doubt that sufficient safeguards could be devised, and I can only come to the conclusion that the Government have no desire that proper facilities shall be afforded. They have only one object, and that is to disfranchise a great number of people who, they think, will vote against the referenda proposals. </para>

If there be any merit in the principle of compulsory voting it ought to apply to all, for the only object can be to enable all the Australian people to determine legislation. I never heard of such a "shandy-gaff" proposal as that laid before us by the Minister. I do not impute motives to the honorable gentleman, but it is well known that supporters of the Labour party are generally to be found within 5 miles of a polling booth. If we are to have constitutional changes they ought to be determined by the whole of the people of the country. </para>

Let the Minister; adjourn this matter until he can consult with the members of that Royal Commission. </para>

The Minister said that the amendment of the honorable member for Indi would strike at the foundation of the whole of the Bill. What an absurdity it is for him to to go on with a Bill out of which the foundation has gone ! If he is such a strong supporter of the principle of the Bill as he claims to be, he should have reported progress upon the Committee agreeing to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Indi, and we should  have heard the last of the Bill. In any event, T am confident it will not see the statute-book in its present form. </para>

                        <para>- Then I am bound to remind the honorable member for Indi that, at the last general election, the highest percentage of voting took place in his electorate. Ballarat was second, and Wannon third. In my scattered electorate, which runs from the thirty-sixth parallel to the sea coast, and is about 100 miles wide, with a poor train service, nearly 86 per cent, of the people enrolled voted, whereas in the cities the percentage was about 60 or 70. How does the honorable member for Indi justify his proposal to exempt those who have cast an exceptionally high percentage of votes? T am also bound to say that the Government, by accepting the amendment of the honorable member for Indi, are attempting to muster supporters in industrial centres, while allowing a go-as-you-please in rural constituencies. If the Bill goes to the Senate in its present form, and becomes law, it will be a laughing stock. The Minister will stand as the champion of a Bill which compels people in one constituency to vote, and exempts people in another constituency from voting. The proportion of electors within 5 miles of polling booths in the country constituencies is very small. In regard to the administration of the measure, who is to decide as to what persons live within 5 miles of a polling booth? </para>

                        <para>- I do so. I hope that the Minister will not be adamant in the matter, and that he will have some consideration for what people outside will think of his passing a Bill in this form. He told the Committee a little while ago that he was opposed to the amendment of the honorable member for Indi. Surely, therefore, he can agree with me that the Bill should be recommitted, so that a blunder of this description should not be permitted. </para>

                    <para>.- Nothing can more clearly illustrate the absurdity of the former amendment than that now proposed. How is it possible for a Returning Officer, who has ascertained from his list the names of the electors who did not vote, to find out which of them live more than 5 miles from a polling place ? He cannot of his own knowledge be aware of the position of every home in the electorate. The honorable member for Gippsland desires that electors living more than 5 miles from a polling place shall not be bothered with a request for reasons; but it is practically impossible to do what he proposes. An elector may not know exactly how far he lives from a polling place; certainly the Returning Officer would not know which of the electors who had not voted lived beyond the prescribed distance from a polling place. </para>

In our haste to make this curious piece of legislation testable by the flight of time and experience, we have not decided how the 5 miles is to be measured; but I think the expression "as the crow flies" is known to the law, and as we cannot get any better system than the radial, I suggest that we do not  bother  the Returning Officer with consideration of the roads along which the electors have to travel, but that the words I have mentioned be added. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like the honorable member for Gippsland to indicate how his amendment is to be given effect to. The carrying out of his proposal will cost more than the whole of the balance of the referenda operations. If the 5-mile limit is to be measured radially and exactly the first thing to do will be to supply the Returning Officer with a sextant. Then he will be required to be examined educationally to ascertain whether he knows anything about trigonometry. The Acts Interpretation Act provides that in the measurement of any distance for the purpose of any Act that distance shall, unless a contrary intention appears, be measured in " a straight line on a horizontal plane." Joking apart, what I desire to know is whether an effort is to be made in connexion with this Bill to carry out the unanimous recommendation of the Electoral Commission? The whole purpose of that inquiry was to discover the best way of administering the electoral laws of the country and to frame such proposals as would provide facilities for gathering the votes of the people at general elections or in connexion with voting of any other kind. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee has already decided that this Bill shall apply only to those who reside within 5 miles of a polling booth. The clause under consideration provides for the preparation of a list of those who did not vote, and every person whose name appears on that list is to be required by the Returning Officer to send an explanation within a certain time on one of the prescribed forms, signed before one of the prescribed witnesses. Why should a person who did not reside within 5 miles of a polling booth be put to the trouble of making a return ? </para>

                        <para>- The Returning Officer will be able to ascertain that information easily, because he will act on the evidence of the Presiding Officers in the various districts. In nearly all cases those officers are local men, and have an excellent knowledge of the distances at which people reside. By the amendment I have proposed the Returning Officer will be saved the trouble of making out a list of a great number of those electors who have not voted, and those persons in turn will be saved the responsibility of sending in a statement of the reasons for their not having voted. The amendment is absolutely necessary in consequence of the alteration already made. </para>

                        <para>- How could a man judge with certainty to within a few hundred yards, a distance of 5 miles? Either the Returning Officer will have <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> exempt everybody within a certain distance of the 5-mile radius or he will take all sorts of risks in sending out notices to those who did not vote. Absolute accuracy cannot be obtained from maps. The Committee has already made it impossible to work this measure, and the further they go the further anomalies and difficulties they are creating. This proposal will not lessen the difficulties, but will multiply them, increase the costliness of the system, and make it impossible to work the Bill in an equitable way. </para>

                <para class="block">Act has no application. It would be absurd to require Returning Officers to see that all who failed to vote lived within or without the prescribed radius. It is unreasonable to imagine that the electoral officer at every polling booth will be able to determine the distance at which every elector on the roll resides from that booth. The number living outside the proposed radius may be infinitesimal as compared with the total number of electors in the Commonwealth. Thousands of circulars would have to be sent out to electors inquiring why they had failed to vote, and it would be sufficient for any elector to reply that he was living more than 5 miles from a polling booth. </para>

I was five years on the roads as a traveller, so that I am familiar with many of the disabilities of country life. In this case the people are to be asked to vote on proposed alterations of the Constitution, and it seems to me that even if it should be necessary for an elector on this one occasion to drive 30 miles in order to record his vote on a question affecting the nation, he should be prepared to do so. </para>

The proposed amendment is likely to give rise to increased difficulties. In the light of present day experience we think it the duty of the electors to vote on the constitutional questions to be submitted to them, and I do not think the Bill will be rendered more effective by such an amendment as the honorable member for Gippsland has proposed. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a great deal of force in the contention that an Act to provide for compulsory voting of the electors on proposed amendments of the Constitution should apply without respect of person or locality. I think, however, that a good deal of the trouble arises from the place in which the amendment as to the 5-mile radius has been inserted. If we make the law applicable to all the electors, and then make the fact that on the day of election an elector is more than 5 miles from a polling booth a valid excuse for failing to vote under sub-clause 12, the objection to the amendment taken by the honorable member for Gippsland will be overcome. The trouble has arisen from confusing two entirely different things. The fact that counts is not where a man resides, but where he is on the day of, election. He may be in his own home on the day of election. If so, well and good; but he may be 50 miles away, and 10 miles from a booth, although his home may be within 100 yards of a polling booth. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out whv the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Gippsland should not be accepted.  His  object would be better met bv striking out the amendment where inserted on the motion of the honorable member for Indi, and inserting it in subclause 12. There is a good deal in what the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Angas have said, but this will not put any elector in a position different from that of any other elector. It will only declare that any elector has a valid excuse if he is 5 miles from a booth on the day of election. If the honorable member for Gippsland will withdraw his amendment, we shall recommit the clause. </para>

                    <para>.- I object to the withdrawal of the amendment. With the consent of the Government, the amendment moved by the honorable member for Indi, to impose a geographical limitation, was accepted by the Committee. It is an absurd thing to have done, but I think that the whole Bill is absurd, and the more ridiculous the amendments that are proposed the more inclined I shall feel to vote for them. It is because of this that I desire a vote to be taken on the amendment now before us. I disagree with the view expressed by the Attorney-General that the amendment should be embodied in sub-clause 12, since that provision relates to electors who are guilty of an offence, and provides for a penalty. It might be inserted as a separate subclause 11a, but I think that the proper place at which to insert it is sub-clause 4, where we have the first reference in the Bill to a " valid, truthful, and sufficient " excuse. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, I desire to show that the 5-mile limit, which apparently was unanimously accepted by the Committee, has been refused at a later stage. The clause now is an object of ridicule or contempt to students of Act building. If the Government do not feel inclined to vary the suggestion made by the Attorney-General, it is no good honorable members on this side urging the necessity for. further amendment, particularly as they seem to be violently opposed to one another. I think that the penalty which hangs at the end of the clause like a sword of Damocles is not sufficient. Let us make the penalty £10, with a month's imprisonment. If we are to do the thing in really Draconian fashion, for the first time in the history of the Australian nation, let the medicine be hot and strong, so that the people will appreciate it. I urge this suggestion for the consideration of the Attorney-General. </para>

                    <para>.- Some provision should be made to enable electors to pay the penalty without having to go before a police magistrate. It is hardly fair to drag electors into a Police Court. Many women have never been in such places, but if they fail to record their votes the Bill will compel them to appear before magistrates, and they will not take to it very kindly. They would rather pay their fines to Returning Officers, and escape the ordeal of appearing in a Police Court. I shall move an amendment to sub-clause 13. </para>

The Committee having decided upon the question of postal voting, further discussion on that matter is not in order. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to know if the Government have any proposal to enable people who are under disabilities at every poll to vote, and so apply the principle of compulsion equally and fairly. The provisions of the Bill can be amended in order to do so. I do not know what the Royal Commission cost the Commonwealth, but one of the things into which they had to specially inquire was what facilities could be furnished to the voters of Australia, yet not one honorable member opposite who sat on that Commission is making any practical proposal. We cannot do anything on this side of the chamber because we are in a minority; but the honorable member for Denison, who was an enthusiast beyond all others, has all the power of the Commonwealth behind him to buttress him in any suggestion for machinery in regard to granting these facilities. I want to know what these Commissioners, who have the power and the opportunity, propose to do in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- Since honorable members have declined to insert a provision for postal voting, the obligation is on them to provide some other machinery, and here is the opportunity for inserting that machinery. Have the members of the Royal Commission, after all their trouble, nothing to suggest in the way of amendment? On what did we spend the money the Commission cost, and. why was so much trouble taken, if the results of their inquiries are not to be applied to a matter of this kind - the greatest question we can ever vote on in Australia ? Honorable members have only to make the proposal to have it accepted by their party. </para>

In order to make the principle of compulsion just in its application, provision should be made so that every man will have an equal opportunity at the ballot-box. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely remarking that in the absence of the postal vote it is a fair thing that honorable members should furnish some alternative machinery. Having turned down the only machinery that I can suggest, the obligation rests upon them to find something to take its place, and now is the time to do so. But do honorable members care how the far-back people are situated or treated ? They have already inserted an amendment which gives them a distinct advantage in the populous centres, and they care nothing about the man in the back country. However, I am endeavouring to say a word for that man who is under all these disabilities, who should be considered above all others, and has a special claim upon our parliamentary attention. Now is the time to give him that consideration ; but men who are constantly mouthing their Democracy from the housetops neglect the opportunity to do so. </para>

The honorable member for Hunter has rightly pointed out that many persons who cannot read or write may thus be punished. </para>

They will require all the assistance that can be given them if this Bill is to operate effectively. The persons residing outside the 5-mile limit are also entitled to consideration. Whilst the compulsory voting provisions no longer apply to them, they are still compelled to submit an excuse for not having voted. That appears to be an anomaly. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to move an amendment so that anybody guilty of an offence under the Act shall have the option of paying the penalty to the Returning Officer or of going before a Police Court. My object is to prevent many persons, especially women, being dragged before a Court. The fact that a woman who has always led an exemplary life has been taken before a Police Court worries her considerably, and she would much rather pay a fine and escape the Court proceedings. If the excuse of the elector was not sufficient the person administering the Act should be able to say that he or she could either pay a fine, or test the case in a Police Court. I move - </para>

By the amendment I have now moved it is proposed to exempt them from the notices that are to be served on all electors who have not voted and from all consequent penalties. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that all that it is proposed to do is to perpetuate the absurdity that has already been introduced in the Bill. This Bill imposes on the Returning Officers the duty of preparing a list of all voters who have not voted, but it tells them that every voter whose place of residence is more than 5 miles from a. polling booth need not be included in that list. How is a Returning Officer to ascertain from the rolls before him who does and who does not live within 5 miles of a booth? </para>

                <para>I promised to have certain amendments made when the Bill was before this Chamber, but was unable to carry out that promise. These amendments have been made in another place. In the first place, I promised the right honorable member for Swan that amongst those classes exempted from income tax should be unions of employers as well as of employees. That exemption is made in the first of these amendments. In the second amendment, the " financial " year is substituted for the "calendar" year, and the third of these amendments is consequential upon that alteration. Amendment No. 5 has been made in accordance with a promise that I gave the honorable member for Corangamite. Amendment No. 7 allows a deduction to be made in the case of calls on shares in a mining company paid in the year in which the income is derived. Amendment No. 5 enables employers to get the benefit of any sum set aside in the interests of their employees. I have had made amendment No. 10 relating to the assessment of trustees as the result of representations made by the Leader of the Opposition in another place this afternoon. As the clause now stands a trustee will pay, not upon the total income for the whole trust estate, but only on his share of it. </para>

The first amendment, which I shall propose be disagreed with, is in clause 4, which provides for a minimum wage, and the amendment of the Senate is to strike out £126, with a view to inserting £138. The amendment creates a blank, and the Government propose to omit the whole clause, leaving matters exactly as they are now, subject to regulation. The second amendment, which we propose to accept, is in clause. 13, which provides for an extension of eligibility for appointment, and is a purely verbal and formal one. I move - </para>

                    <para>The object of this Bill is to amend the War Precautions Act in such a way as to make the regulations thereunder effective. A recent decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Victoria, in the matter of Franz Wallach, declared the regulations under which the Minister has power to arrest any person whom he has reason to believe is acting in any manner prejudicial to the safety of the Commonwealth to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> This Bill is intended to cure this defect. I do not propose at this hour of the morning to say more than that it is not intended to use this measure for any purpose other than that for which we are using the Act as it stands. We are not seeking any new power, but merely the power which it was imagined we had, and which we still believe we had, under the Act. It is absolutely necessary, in the interests of the Commonwealth, that power should be vested in the Minister to intern persons who are suspected of having designs against the peace and safety of the Commonwealth. This measure will not operate in a pending case. This Bill is one properly within the province of the Minister for the Navy, and I shall do no more than, on his behalf, move that the Bill be read a second time. </para>

I do not know that in any country, governed according to the principles of responsible government, and with our western modes of thought, anything like this power has been sought in connexion with the prosecution of the war. </para>

                    <para class="block">It may be that such power has been granted elsewhere, but I am not aware ot the fact. I do not think that the British House of Commons has conferred any such power on the Imperial Government; if so, the fact has escaped my recollection. The Attorney-General, as the law. adviser of the Government, tells us that this power is necessary for the purpose of dealing with certain aspects of the war, and I only desire to be clear about one or two points. The attitude that we on this side have taken all through the war has been that, where the Government say they require legislative power to enable them to deal with the situation, we have conceded that power without let or hindrance. But this is a power of quite an unusual character. It not only seeks to make the Government for the time being the repository of this absolute and unqualified power, but it also seeks to make any delegated body the repository of that power. That is what I take exception to. </para>

                        <para>. - Those who have watched the course of recent events will thoroughly understand why the Minister desires to be invested with further power. In common with many others, I confess that I was rather surprised at the decision of the Supreme Court of this State in the Wallach case. But whilst I feel that an enemy in our midst should be prevented from doing anything which may be detrimental to the Empire, I have a perfect horror of conferring upon any individual the powers which are contained in this Bill. I well remember that in Victoria many years ago the authorities had a happy knack of suspending the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act. They used to bring a great many persons before the Court every Monday morning, and those persons were almost invariably remanded until the following Monday. Whilst I am quite willing to confer upon the Ministry power in regard to the internment of any alien enemy in the interests of the safety of the Empire, I will not support any measure which will confer such a power upon the military authorities. I admit that paragraph 3a of clause 3 to some extent provides a safeguard. </para>

                            <para>- They may detain him for three months or three years. I do not wish to draw any distinctions between the Minister of Defence and the Attorney-General; but while we hear much said against lawyers, from a legal stand-point, I would be more inclined to trust them than the military community, because they do keep within the law, whereas the military people may not do so. I feel that anything done by the Defence Department will be done off their own bat, irrespective of the Attorney-General, once they have the power. Very strong medicine may be required to deal with the case that the Government are now handling; but Ministers are endeavouring to secure powers so drastic that people outside the Military Forces can have no idea of their extent until they see them brought into operation. I have always been one of those who have endeavoured to preserve the dominance of the civil over the military law. We have lately had evidence that the civil law has determined that personal liberty should be given to those who deserve it, but we would never get it from the military authorities. Justice may be obtained if the suspension of the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> powers is controlled by civilians, but one is not likely to get it from the military section of the community. Quite recently, in a case against the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> newspaper, the military authorities refused to place evidence before the Court as to why they had taken a certain action, but the Court made them produce it. I do not wish to see that power taken away from the civil Courts. Therefore, I suggest that the proposed new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">da</inline> be amended by inserting after the word " persons " words such as "of enemy origin." </para>

Therefore, i am quite prepared to give the Minister the whole of the powers he seeks in this Bill. Certain matters have transpired since the outbreak of the war which have shown the necessity for giving the Government more powers than they have at present; but the objection i have to this Bill is that it is extending enormously the delegated powers which the Government are seeking to obtain - for instance, in proposed paragraph 2, in which powers are to be imposed upon the Minister, and upon the Naval Board, and the Military Board, and the members of the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth, " and other persons." </para>

                            <para>- That is an entirely different matter. No one supposes that the Minister will personally arrest suspected persons. That will be done by a servant of the Minister, acting under his authority. I object to the wholesale power of delegation provided for in the Bill, but I am willing to give the Minister all the power he considers necessary for securing the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - The attitude of the Opposition in regard to these measures may be considered consistent and somewhat complimentary to themselves, but I wish to protest in the most emphatic manner against the continuation or extension of these extraordinary powers. The war seems already to have distorted our ideas of right and wrong. We seem to have become so impressed by German methods that right has become wrong and wrong has become right with us. </para>

                            <para>- With perhaps less reason than could be advanced by the people of any other country, we seem to have suffered from a fit of hysterics because of the war. Our people appear to be far more anxious to come under a military tyranny than are the people of any other country in the world. The people of the Mother Land, though much more directly associated with the war, and risking more than we risk, have already taken fright at the continual efforts made for the extension of the military power. The history of the world proves the tendency of the military power in all ages to defy and dominate the civil power. The civil authority has had to fight for its very existence in peace times, and in war times has had to stand on the defensive against the military power, often with very poor results. It is not necessary to elaborate the point that we are faced here with a critical position. We shall escape from that position, not by casting ourselves into the arms of the military power, but by preserving our civil liberties and preventing the military forces securing control of the civil forces. There is no tyranny in the world, not even excepting the religious tyranny, that is more detrimental to the welfare of the people than is the military tyranny. If this Bill is passed as it stands there will be nothing in the Prussian system of militarism to compare with what is going to be established in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Franklin has said that he is willing to give the Minister as much power as he thinks necessary. The honor able member forgets that the Minister cannot possibly deal personally with every case. He must rely upon his responsible advisers. In the last resort the Minister may take the final action, but the recommendation upon which he will act will come from other sources. As the war goes on, events, instead of increasing our confidence in the fairness and reasonableness of the two branches of our Defence Force, increase our suspicion and dread of both. I am more in fear of the military authorities to-day than I was at the beginning of the war, and less inclined to intrust them with power. The Bill allows the Governor-General in Council to delegate to the Military Board, the Naval Board, and persons of the Military and Naval Forces the power to ignore every civil right, and I shall oppose its provisions to the fullest extent. Were the proposal to give to the Attorney-General the powers conferred on the Minister of Defence, my objection to the measure would vanish, because he is the legal representative of the Government, and it is his business to uphold the law and to respect all civil rights. The Minister of Defence has no such responsibility.  His  concern is not the upholding of the laws of the Commonwealth, but the interests of the military. </para>

Before action is taken in the Courts, the Minister of Defence, or some one appointed by him, may arrest any person and detain him in custody for any length of time. The Attorney-General told me to-day, in reply to a question, that this was a free country, in which citizens could do as they liked, but under the Bill, if a man expressed in public sympathy with naturalized Germans, he might, at the caprice of the Minister of Defence, or of some member of the Military or Naval Board, be arrested and kept in prison for any length of time. There are persons in the community who are not entitled to the protection of the law; but they are entitled to justice, and should be tried before being imprisoned. Every citizen of the Commonwealth, wherever born, is entitled to the protection of our laws. Let me read a part of a letter  signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> E. Vance, of Cheapside-street, Maryborough, Queensland - </para>

I have written to the military authorities in Brisbane, placing the facts before them, and more than this, the recruiting officer, knowing that I objected, gave him a pass to camp at Enoggera, at the same time telling him that if I made trouble in Brisbane that there were other camps in Australia, and that he could easily secure a pass to one of them, and enlist under an assumed name. It has been stated freely here for some time that recruiting officers have been advising men under age how to get away without their parents' consent. </para>

                            <para>- But they would have to give him a trial. At the beginning of the war hysteria prevailed in the Old Country, and a Defence of the Realm Bill was rushed through the House of Commons in one night; but when a Tory peer discovered that it swept away the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act, the Bill of Rights, <inline font-style="italic">Magna Charta,</inline> and all civil rights gained during centuries of agitation and suffering, another measure had to be introduced. We are trying to outdo the Imperial Government in this matter, and I am opposed to it. So far from the war developing the abilities and capacity of the military authorities, each week shows how feeble the administration of the Defence Department is. Complaints about its management are made every day, and we know that they are based on good grounds, and could be multiplied over and over again. I am out to take from the military authorities as much power as it is possible to drag from them. I have already expressed my opposition to their having, the power to deal with supplies. It is evident that they ought not to have even the power to deal with the care of the wounded and sick soldiers, for that is one of the saddest features in connexion with the whole war. I have no complaint to make about the fighting qualifies of the military people, but let them stay at their own particular business. When they put in their noses and try their inexperienced hands at doing work which can only be properly done by business men, it is about time to curtail their authority. The military people in this community are already getting very saucy and impertinent. As one goes down the street he notices that already the fact that a recruit is wearing the King's uniform seems to give him the idea that he has the right to the footpath, and that an ordinary man in civilian clothes ought to take off his hat and step into the gutter to allow him to go by. That Prussian military feeling gets into the men as soon as they get the King's uniform on. We shall have enough trouble after the war is over with some of the officers in the Defence Department. I advise honorable members as the guardians of the civil liberties of the people not to allow the military authorities to dominate us, and to acquire such power as to rob us of every right that we possess under the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- The power of depriving a subject of his liberty is by this Bill conferred on the Minister alone, and nobody else can do that thing. I admit frankly that it is an immense power to put in the hands of the Minister; but I submit to honorable members, and especially to the honorable member for Brisbane, that if they are going to insist that there shall be a trial there must be proof. The only way in which it can be proved that a man ought to be interned is by making public to the Court and to the country the evidence which the Minister has that he should be convicted. The probability is that if that evidence were made public it would destroy altogether the powers given in the Act, because it is not likely that the Minister would receive any information of that sort. I do not like the idea of a man being deprived of his liberty in this country without his case being submitted to the determination of a Court of justice. But in a time of war we have to leave a great deal to the discretion of those who, in the wisdom of the country, have been put in charge of its affairs. Something has been said by honorable members opposite about not trusting the Minister of Defence, and trusting the Attorney-General. If honorable members opposite cannot trust the Minister of Defence, the best thing they can do is to put in office a Minister whom they can trust. I do not see why the Attorney-General can administer this Act better than the Minister of Defence. If the Attorney-General is sufficiently trustworthy to be given this power, the Minister of Defence should be equally trusted to carry it out. If honorable members cannot trust the Minister of Defence, the sooner they get a new Minister the better. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to oppose the granting of this additional power to the Minister of Defence. Clause 15, sub-clause 2, says that " if the Minister is satisfied " he may do certain things, and there is no alternative before any man whom the Minister chooses to intern. There is no provision that after a certain time the interned person may ask for a trial. The war may last for two years, and if the Minister is satisfied that the man has committed an offence against the Commonwealth there is no alternative before that person but to remain interned. Our whole idea of British justice revolts against any such powers being given to one man. It is such a power as we used to say was exercised by the Czar of Russia. </para>

For the sake of a deterrent to other people the Government should let the public know how they were dealing with these cases. It is a nice state of things when the Government allow the military authorities to put persons in prison without telling them the offences they have committed and without giving them a trial. This Bill deals, not only with Austrians and Germans, but with any ' person who does anything to injure the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.The tone of the debate indicates that it is, perhaps, injudicious to pursue the subject to finality at this hour, because some honorable members are not seeing quite so clearly as they saw in the earlier part of the evening much simpler problems. It is also dangerous to discuss questions of law with most of the prominent lawyers of the House absent. We on this side are deprived of the assistance of three eminent members of the profession belonging to our party, and we laymen are left to decide for ourselves how the Bill stands in relation to the present law. I am entirely with the Government, so far as I have examined the Bill, in their desire to pass it, but not because I am not apprehensive of the rise of military tyranny in Australia, for I share to some extent the feeling of the honorable member for Brisbane and others, and believe we have to set our face resolutely against the upsettal of civil rule by military rule in this country. While we philosophize in that way in time of peace, I am prepared to throw all the civil powers deemed necessary by the authorities into their hands in time of war when they ask for them. That is a pretty large order, but I shall go the full length of redeeming that promise in any Bill in relation to the war submitted by this or any other Government during the war. It is a question of some doubt as to what the Bill really does. It is divisible into three parts. The first part of clause 2 is purely a rearrangement qf the latest amendment of the principal Act. It puts in slightly more legal form what this House deliberately intended to do at the request of the present Government, and may set at rest any doubts with regard to the power of the Governor-General in Council in relation to certain specified matters. The second part is the centre of the whole. Bill, and has been referred to as the suspension of the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act. All we have to do to judge of its necessity or wisdom is to read the Acts we have passed. They show that the powers asked for have already been granted to the Minister. That is the opinion of the chief law officer of the Crown, and only one particular phase of that interpretation has been tested before the Victorian Pull Court. The case, so far, has gone adversely to the advice tendered to the Crown, but the matter is not finalized. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely. I see in this Bill no such great enlargement of powers as has been referred to by two honorable members opposite. I see rather a distinct simplification and curtailment of them in some specified and desirable directions. The first section of the most' recent Act dealing with offences leaves the matter as we passed it before, in a very indefinite and uncertain state. It provides that offences against the Act may be prosecuted summarily, or by indictment, or, if the regulations so provide, by court martial. The punishments are set out, and other details defined, but right through the subsections following all these powers have been committed to the Government without any specified obligation resting on the Minister or the Attorney-General to exercise them. It is true that, broadly speaking, the Military or Naval Board, or the military authorities, or the police, could operate the Act without special Ministerial direction, but this Bill cancels that possibility. It practically says, " These are very far-reaching powers, wider than any exercised in any British Dominion in recent centuries, and must be hedged round with precautions. Only two people, the Attorney-General and, alternatively, the Minister of Defence, shall have the power of summary prosecution, while the still more serious form of prosecution by indictment shall be left expressly to the Attorney-General." These are severe restrictions of those wide powers which both Houses, after elaborate discussion, agreed a few months ago to give the Government. I can quite imagine that the honorable member for Brisbane desires to still further curtail the power handed over in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 2 of this Bill. For the purposes of this argument I ask him to look at the clause again. It may be desirable that we should give the power of indefinite detention without control only with respect to alien subjects, just as we have done in regard to courts martial. Honorable members will recollect that under the Bill as originally introduced every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth was subject, under certain conditions, to be court martialled. The House, however, persuaded the Government to apply that form of control only to enemy subjects, naturalized or unnaturalized. It may be advisable, if this House thinks fit, although I shall not move any such amendment, to insert after the word " person " in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">da</inline> some words which would qualify or limit the power of indefinite detention without trial in respect of persons who are not born in a British Dominion, and are not subjects of the King. I would recommend that to the Attorney-General as a basis of compromise if it appeals to his judgment, in view of secrets known to him as to the processes of the Crown and its needs. </para>

                            <para>- I am profoundly influenced by the information which the Government possess, although it may not be thought prudent to fully disclose it, as to the necessity felt by the Imperial authorities for such a power, and I shall therefore yield to the request of the Ministry for the fullest power in this respect. Let us now look at the question from its broadest aspect, apart from the interpretations to which I have referred. We must remember that we are passing through the most extraordinary times that we have ever faced or of which we have ever read. There have been occasions in British history when what is known as martial law operated in many parts where the British flag flew, and where other great Continental nations had their life. The position was not then nearly so critical as it is to-day; yet martial law was proclaimed without murmur, and apparently without injury to the subsequent progress of the community. I fully expected long before this that in . Britain and the Dominions the necessity for martial law would arise. I would be prepared to accept all that that means - and it means the surrender immediately of al] our privileges. Every protection that we ordinarily enjoy in times of peace has to go, because we are really struggling for existence against the foe. I should be prepared to yield up that the moment the Government declared it to be necessary in the interests of the nation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, every human being - all life and property - would be at the disposal of the men holding the power of government - civil, military or naval. That is surely the widest request that could be made, and if things do not run better for our nation it may be necessary to acquire that power in the Homeland, and in some, if not all, of the Dominions. This, therefore, is a small request when compared to so wide an authority. Without criticism of the Minister, who has been severely under the lash during the last two months, or of the Ministry - with whom I am not particularly friendly, and from whom I am divorced by wide differences of opinion - we ought to say to the Government, without further question, "You must take the full responsibility for the exercise of these powers. If you are prepared to do so, then we, quite irrespective of party, will grant them to you." That is my personal view, and it is the view I hope to take whenever any such measure comes up until the termination of the present struggle. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. It is simply designed to avoid any risks and to do that which we thought we did under the principal Act. There was recently before the Supreme Court of Victoria a case in which one Frank Wallach, who had been interned on a warrant issued by the Minister of Defence under the War Precautions Act, appealed for his release. The Court held that the regulation under which that Minister purported to act was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and gave an order for the release of Wallach. The Government have appealed against that decision. If the High Court were to uphold what the Supreme Court of this State has laid down the decision would have a very serious effect in hampering the power of the Commonwealth Government to deal with interned aliens, especially naturalized aliens. Assuming the judgment of the Supreme Court to be a correct interpretation of the law, an amendment of it is necessary to give the Government the power which the Parliament thought it had given to it.' It was stated by the Chief Justice of Victoria, for instance, in regard to the exercise of the power by the Minister, that the Minister was not included in the term "other persons." That term was used to indicate certain specified persons who were to exercise power under the War Precautions Act, but the Chief Justice of Victoria decided that the Minister did not come within it. It was on that ground that the decision was given which led to Wallach's release. The Court laid it down that if Parliament had intended to give the Minister this power it would have mentioned him, because the Act having sanctioned others, such as the Military Board and the Naval Board, it was not conceivable that Parliament intended to include the Minister controlling the Department amongst " other persons." We have met that objection by this amendment of the principal Act, which specifically names the Minister. Then the question arose as to whether Parliament intended to give the power, and whether the Act expressed such intention. The Chief Justice held that it did not express it clearly, and said that if Par,liament intended to give such a wide power, in view of its conflict with the Act of <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> and the Bill of Rights, it would have expressed that intention quite clearly. Iu our judgment, Parliament did express it clearly, but that was not She opinion of the learned Chief Justice of Victoria, and the majority of the Court. We are therefore clearly expressing the intention in this amending Bill. </para>

                            <para>- It heard evidence only concerning the power of the Minister. There is one other feature of this Bill to which reference might be made. We propose to amend sub-section 6 of the principal Act, which deals with trials of offences, by providing that summary prosecutions shall not be instituted without the consent of the Minister or of the Attorney-General. This action, we think, is necessary, because there have been cases instituted by other persons - in some cases the police authorities; in other cases the State Governments - and we think that as the Act deals with offences arising out of the war, the instigation of prosecutions under it should be in the hands of Commonwealth Ministers. If not, there will be a want of uniformity, and probably we should have a prosecution in some States, instituted by the State law authorities, for one class of offence, whereas across the border there would be no prosecution for the same class of offence. It does not follow that if this Bill is carried there will not be prosecutions for this class of offence; but it will provide that if a prosecution is instituted in one State for an offence, there will be prosecutions in all States for similar offences. I have here a measure passed by the Imperial Parliament last year, and conferring extraordinary power? upon the Imperial Government. It is entitled -  </para>

                            <para>- Nobody can; that is my objection. And this right of trial is the privilege of every British citizen. I find, according to the records, that the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act has not been suspended in Great Britain on more than three or four occasions at the outside ever since it was passed. It was suspended in 1677, and from 1694 till 1801, and not suspended again till 1866, during the Fenian riots. If, then, during this war, it has not been necessary to suspend the Act in Great Britain, which is so much nearer the storm centre, and where naturally the greatest alertness is necessary to insure the safety of the Empire, the situation is not serious enough in Australia to justify its suspension here. In Great Britain the offences for the most part have been in regard to trading; and, notwithstanding what the Minister has told us, the Act has not been suspended in the Mother Country, so there is nothing to warrant the drastic measures now proposed by the Attorney-General. Under this Bill, the Minister will arrogate to himself the right to say who shall be suspected and who shall be incarcerated. This takes us back almost to the Middle Ages. It suggests the <inline font-style="italic">lettres-de-cachet</inline> of France in the times of the Louis, under which any person could be put in gaol and left there to rot - it is reversion to medievalism. Incarceration is bad at any time, and, without trial, it is intolerable in any British community, unless we have reached the stage when martial law is essential, and when, of course, we cannot help ourselves. However, we are not likely to reach that stage in Australia, and it has not yet been reached even in England. </para>

                            <para>- I doubt that. I think trial is to be had by any one who desires  it; and even under martial law there is trial according to that law. To incarcerate people without a hearing is against the most treasured principles of British statesmanship; and I cannot believe that any such extreme steps are necessary in this country, which is so far from the storm centre, and where most of the offences are connected with trade. I was surprised to notice the other day that in matters of this sort at Home, the greatest leniency has been exercised, and that the Privy Council allowed the Continental Tyre Company, although owned entirely by Germans, with the exception of one share held in England, to continue trading, though, of course, we may take it for granted that none of the profits are going to Germany. Such, however, is the attitude of British jurisprudence to-day. And yet we are told that, in order to sustain the Empire, and prevent disaster overtaking our armies on the Continent or at Gallipoli, we must invest one man with the right to say who shall be interned. So far as I can see, the whisperings of the Minister's subordinates have more to do with his actions than his own cool, collected judgment. I know a little of what I am talking about, because I have had some unfortunate experience; and so long as I occupy a position in this House I shall protest vehemently against adding one jot or tittle to the power of the military, who control the whole situation, and merely manipulate the civil element, which is supposed to be in authority. Whatever the military people advise is done, and whom they suspect the Minister suspects, and that suspected person may be imprisoned. This, as I say, is against all our most cherished principles; and I hope that the measure will not pass as at present drafted. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not often trouble the House, but on a question of this kind I feel it my duty to say a few words. I am amazed to think that any one in Australia, particularly a representative of the people, in the greatest crisis the country has ever known, should prefer, practically, to leave the direction of all steps for the public safety in the hands of untrained civil authority. That is what the words of the honorable member mean. </para>

                            <para>- That is the case I have just alluded to; and events have happened in Australia of which notice ought to be taken. Whether the Minister of Defence be chosen from one side of the House or the other, or from outside, he, or some one else, must be in supreme authority. Does the honorable member for Macquarie think that the Minister will act on his own initiative, or without evidence or good reason, in his efforts to insure the safety of the realm? I was one who was astonished to gather from newspaper reports that an attempt has been made here by a civil Court to take the direction of warlike proceedings, not only out of the hands of the Minister, but out of the hands of Parliament, which gives the Minister his authority. We were approaching a . position in which a civil Court could compel, and, in fact, did try to compel, the Minister appointed by the representatives of the people to declare, not only to Australians, but to the enemies of Australia, the reasons why he interned certain persons. It amazed me, I say, to think that there was a Judge in any Court who, under the circumstances, could take such a step. The Government could not leave the position as it was; and if they had not taken action to enable this House to express its opinion, they would have been recreant to their duty and traitors to the national cause. Now the Government come down and tell us that, owing to the action of this civil Court, it is found that sufficient power has not been given, and they ask us to inform the Court, clearly  and definitely, that we intend to extend the power, and make assurance doubly sure. I have reported, and given evidence in, cases in which our avowed and open enemies, Germans, not only in my own electorate, but in others, have gone so far as to hold services in this country and sing their Hymn of Hate. Yet they are free to-day. Every one of them should have been interned. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. There was one case at West Wyalong, and another in the Albury district. Ministers are being heckled day by day by irresponsible, and I might almost say ignorant, persons outside of this House. But when they are heckled by the representatives of the people, the position becomes an entirely different one. Does the honorable member for Macquarie think that any Minister will deprive a man of his liberty unless he has reasonable grounds for so doing? </para>

That body recognises that a dire necessity exists for men and more men offering their services if the war is to be brought to an early and successful conclusion. That body is inviting honorable members to go out into the highways and byways for the purpose of appealing to all able-bodied Australians to rally to the colours. What results will our efforts produce if this carping criticism of the Ministry is to continue? Personally, I regard it as a waste of time to enjoin young men to offer their services at the front if these tactics are to be pursued. As an Australian, in this time of crisis I would be prepared to trust any Government feeling that its members would regard it as their paramount duty to do their best in the interests of Australia. We ought to trust Ministers in the knowledge that they will not abuse their authority, and that if they do so, this Parliament has power to punish them. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendment. It is not in accord with the spirit and intention of the proposed paragraph. It does not give any person mentioned in it power of arrest. The Minister alone has that power. This sub-section creates the machinery to give effect to the Act. Does the honorable member suggest that an Act for the safety of the realm can be put in force by one individual with no one to help him ? The paragraph gives power to the Governor-General to make regulations to appoint persons to carry out the provisions of the Act. It does not give to any of those persons the power of arrest. That power is given in the following paragraph, which confers on the Minister the power by warrant under his hand to detain any person in military custody. That is the only power that is given to arrest on warrant without trial. In every other case an assurance was given by the Government when the measure was before Parliament previously that every person other than an alien enemy should have a civil trial, and that every case should come before the Attorney-General, as the representative of the civil power. The power to arrest by warrant under the Minister's baud is given for the purpose of interning the enemies of the country, whether they are aliens or masquerade under the disguise of naturalization, or are traitors of our own race. The safety of the country if infinitely more precious than empty talk about the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus,</inline> or the Bill of Rights, or <inline font-style="italic">Magna Charta.</inline> All these things will crumble to dust unless we are successful in this struggle. This is no time for academic talk about the liberty of the subject when the very foundations of real liberty are in danger of complete destruction. Honorable members seem to think that Germans in Australia are going about in a peaceful, law-abiding spirit, seeking how they can help us. One would imagine we were in no danger from traitors and spies - that this is the only country in the world in which no danger from our enemy is to be apprehended. That is not true. There are spies and traitors here, and they are as active as the law allows them to bo. Wherever they are found they will be interned. We shall not hesitate, and shall pay no respect to persons. If the Government are not given the power that they ask in this respect, how can they carry on ? Are we to be governed by a State Civil Court, which has no power and no responsibility in regard to the war, which could not vote a penny in regard to it? Is this Court to determine how the war is to be carried on ? It is this Parliament which has to carry on the war, and there is power in the hands of this Parliament to punish any Minister of the Crown who does wrong. but there is no power to right a wrong done by any Court which dictates the war policy of the country. If Ministers do wrong, punish them. Do honorable members suppose that it is possible to publish to the world the reasons for interning any person? If so, they completely misunderstand the nature of our enemies, and the means through which they work. In fact, they do them a grievous wrong. They wrong their cunning, their determination, and the tenacity with which they pursue their purpose. I have known a man twenty years, whom I would have trusted as I would trust the Leader of the Opposition, and yet he has turned out as pro-German as the Kaiser. No German can be trusted during this war. So far as I know, no one of British race has been interned. I rose to point out that the power to arrest is given to the Minister in the following paragraph, while the power granted in this paragraph can only be exercised in regard to offences under the Act, and in regard to those offences every person other than an alien is entitled to a civil trial. In these circumstances I ask the honorable member to withdraw his amendment. </para>

                        COOK (Parramatta) member will not, press his proposition. 1 am inclined to think that he misapprehends the real intention of the paragraph. I understand the Attorney-General to say that he would rather rely on Parliament to prevent any wrong-doing. I am afraid I cannot follow him there.

                            <para>- I should have no objection to the Government dealing with such a person. _ No intrigue outside a matter of trading could, under existing conditions, be carried on in Australia effectively. If the Germans burst the bounds within which they are confined at present, and the German fleet got to sea again, and was adjacent to our shores, I could understand that it might receive assistance from some one in Australia. Until such a contingency arises this provision as it stands places too much power in the hands of the Military Department. No matter how sincere the Attorney-General and other members of the Ministry may be in their desire to preserve the authority of the civil power whilst these matters are supervised by the Defence Department, action taken under this Bill is likely to be so highly coloured by military influence that the desires of the civilian population are not likely to be given effect to. I am prepared to push my amendment to a vote if I can secure support for it. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the Attorney-General will accept the amendment. He has just said that, so far as he knows, no Britisher has yet been interned. He must have heard sufficient argument to-night to convince him that there is no urgent necessity at the present time to curtail the rights and liberties of British subjects whatever may be done to aliens. I am not here to support the rights and privileges of enemy aliens, because I feel sure that British subjects are given very few privileges  and  very little liberty in Germany to-day. T object to the rights of British citizens being taken away from them, even at a time like the present, without any opportunity to appeal to the Courts of the realm. At this time of the morning it is unnecessary to speak at length about the fight which our ancestors put up to secure those rights and privileges. They ought not to be taken away because of any scare from which any member of the Ministry may suffer as to what might happen if these powers are not conferred. I hope that the Committee will consider the importance of preserving the freedom of British subjects, for which the people of our race have fought in the past, and will not, under the influence of a scare, sacrifice those rights at the will of  any </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister. The war may continue for many years, but the actual scene of conflict is far removed from Australia, and long may it remain so. While that is the case, and the enemy fleet have been removed from Australian waters, British subjects living in Australia ought not to be deprived of their rights. If the enemy had control of the seas the position would be entirely different, but under existing circumstances I hope that the Government will agree to accept the amendment, and if they do, we can pass the remainder of the Bill as it stands. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports will not press the amendment. It is foreign to the purpose of the measure, which is to provide for the safety of the Commonwealth. I say that the history of our race, much as we have reason to admire it, is studded with stories of treachery. Many of the difficulties of the British Government during the first few months of the war were caused by the system of espionage which had been created with German money by German cunning, and depended for its success, not on Germans, but on Britishers, who could do their work free from suspicion. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot say when we may not be threatened. A little while ago the enemy's submarines were in the Channel. Then we heard of them passing into the Mediterranean, through the Straits of Gibraltar. Later they may get through the Suez Canal. Who was it who sold coal to the <inline font-style="italic">Emden,</inline> to the <inline font-style="italic">Gneisenau,</inline> and to . the <inline font-style="italic">Scharnhorst f</inline> Some one in this country. Those vessels were supplied with Australian coal, and the British sailors who went down off the coast of South America were murdered by the men in Australia who sold it. . So far we have not been able to get them. I do not pretend to say how it was done, nor who did it.; but it was done, and no punishment is too severe for those who did it. The power that is asked for should be used most carefully, and only when the need for its use is supreme; but it ought to be given. At the very outset of Federation, I advocated that every man over the age of eighteen years and under sixty should be trained to the use of arms. I have never disguised my hatred and detestation of military despotism. The country, however, can be defended only by an armed force, and we are discussing now,  not  the gathering of buttercups, but the crushing of a viper. This is no time for talk but for action. If the honorable gentleman will accept my assurance that this power will not be exercised in regard to others than aliens and naturalized aliens, except on the advice and authority of the whole Government, I shall give that assurance. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The Bill authorizes an appropriation to enable the Government to carry out an arrangement which it has entered into with the wheat-producing States for the purpose of obtaining freight to carry the wheat crop to the markets pf the world. I hope that I shall be excused at this hour of the morning for not entering at any length into the- matter. Shortly stated, the arrangement involves the complete control by the Commonwealth of all freight engaged in the transport of wheat and flour from Australia during the next season. It is to be carried out by the aid of two firms who have been engaged as agents, and the terms on which they have been engaged have been set before the House, and are embodied in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It is highly probable that it will not be necessary for the Government to use any loan money; but it is desirable that the authority should be granted in order that the money may be available if necessary. It is proposed to open the wheat season about the 15th October: that is to say, to declare on or about that date the probable rate of freight for November, so that farmers and shippers may know the conditions which will regulate the price of wheat at the end of that month. It is likely that some 250,000 tons of freight will be provided by the Commonwealth itself through the Commonwealth steamers ; but, in addition, it is probable that anything from 1,000,000 to 1,250,000 tons of freight will be chartered. That, of course, will represent a transaction of considerable magnitude; and if freight is, as it probably will be, vary high, it is easy to, understand that the sum of money involved will be very considerable. Yet, , as honorable members will readily understand, the amount of cash actually necessary for the purpose of the transaction will be small. We ask for authority in order that we may make an arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose. It is proposed that - </para>
