                    <para>- There is no chance of the steamer being able to take up her work at the date contracted for. She waa launched in June last, and under ordinary circumstances would have been finished within three months; but as tha shipbuilding yards have been commandeered by the Imperial Government, the  fitting-up is a sort of spare-time job, and it is impossible to say quite when she will reach Australia. The company is not to blame for the delay ; I believe that it has done its best to secure expedition. </para>

As to whether vessels will be taken from InterState lines, that is a matter about which I cannot give information here. I cannot promise any honorable member that this, that, or some other vessel will not be taken. We shall do what we think best in the interests of the whole community, without regard to the possible upsetting of local arrangements. Our study must be the national welfare. I cannot make any promise as to any vessel engaged in trading between, say, Fremantle and Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>My Government views with concern the effect on future supplies of beef which such practices must inevitably entail. It is recognised that in an abnormal season stock-owners are compelled to dispose of female stock for which there is not fodder, but with the return of normal seasons the hope is expressed that your Government may see the way to adopt measures which will prevent indiscriminate slaughter of female calves and cows of breeding age. </para>

                            - The Minister for Agriculture is making exhaustive inquiries, but feels unable to express a definite opinion. His inclination - from what he has learned - is in the direction of prohibition, for a certain number of years by the State and Commonwealth Governments of the slaughter of female cattle under a certain age, such prohibition to be subject to exception to authorized permission. A further communication will be made conveying the Minister's decision.

                            - The Minister for Agriculture does not feel disposed to indorse the opinion that indiscriminate slaughter of female cattle takes place in normal seasons. Suggests the remedy will probably be found in opening up suitable cattle country with the consequent demand for female stock.

It would be almost unkind to have the whole of these soldiers placed within one State, involving thereby separation from their nearest relatives, and causing great inconvenience to all concerned. The Department is endeavouring to have arrangements made whereby those men whose minds have become unhinged should be located in the States in which they enlisted, so that they may be near to, and have the attention of, their relatives. We are doing all that is possible to insure the greatest comfort and care for these soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago the honorable member for Flinders asked a question regarding speeches against enlistment, and I promised that an inquiry would be made. I am now able to say that the Minister of Defence has informed me that each individual case brought before his Department is inquired into, and where necessary the ?aadvice of the Crown Law officers as to a prosecution is taken. In cases where a good case has been established, prosecutions have been instituted. Any specific case brought forward will be investigated and dealt with in this manner. </para>

It also states that we take no consideration of what is happening in the outside world. I should like to ask the Prime Minister, in view of such an article, whether he does not consider that it would be to the advantage of the Commonwealth for us to have a representative in London who would truly reflect the Democratic sentiment of the Commonwealth, and resent, on behalf of the Australian people, the publication of such Tory balderdash? </para>

The chief officers of the Department argued the proposal before me, and I came to the conclusion that a case had not been made out which justified the removal of these officers to Port Darwin. The matter is one that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt will inquire into during his visit to the Territory. </para>

                    <para>- On Friday the honorable member for Calare, when speaking about the  advisableness  of establishing district camps throughout New South Wales, addressed a question to me, asking whether I would establish a district camp at Orange, and apparently he was under the impression that I said " Yes " to that question ; but what I understood the question to be was whether I would mention the matter to my colleague the Minister of Defence? I do not wish the honorable member to fall into the error of thinking that I pledged the Government to the establishment of a camp at Orange. All that I agreed to do was to refer the matter to my colleague. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that each country newspaper despatched to the front must bear a penny stamp, but as there are so many men from the country districts who have gone away, and who are very anxious to receive local papers, a request has been put forward that more than one paper should be contained in the one wrapper, so long as the weight does not exceed that which can be carried for one penny. I spoke of this matter last week. Has the Postmaster-General come to any decision in regard to it? </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The rate of 6d. per word for wireless messages was, with the concurrence of the Amalgamated Wireless Company, made to apply to vessels in the local Australian or New Zealand trade, the rate of lid. per word applying to vessels engaged in the oversea trade, and the basis on which it was decided to fix the rate to be charged in the case of a particular vessel was made the place of registration, that is to say, messages to and from vessels registered in Australia and New Zealand were charged 6d. per word, and messages to and from vessels registered elsewhere were charged lid. per word. The <inline font-style="italic">Runic</inline> being a vessel registered outside Australia, the charge of lid. per word applied to her. A slight anomaly occurs when, as happens in some cases, an Australian registered vessel is taken as a troopship, because, under the arrangement above referred to, the charge in her case would be 6d. per word. It would, however, be practically impossible to keep our offices advised in regard to every vessel as to whether she was engaged in troopship work or in local trade, seeing that as soon as the vessels finish with one class of work they resume the other. The anomaly cannot well be remedied. </para>

                    <para>In  introducing  the  measure,  it is proper that I  should refer  to the  circumstances responsible for  its  introduction  and the principles upon which all sound schemes of taxation must rest. That additional revenue is necessary to meet the great and growing liabilities created by the war is amply apparent, and the Government has decided that this can be best raised by an income tax. The Commonwealth has hitherto not resorted to taxation of incomes. But I have always regarded this form of direct taxation as peculiarly appropriate to the circumstances of a moderate community; and, if the incidence of the tax be based upon sound principles, not only an effective means for raising money for the conduct of government, but serving as an instrument of social reform. This measure, however, is to be regarded merely from the fiscal aspect. It is a Bill to impose a tax upon incomes for the purpose of obtaining revenue, and must be considered from that point of view. In imposing taxation, it is necessary to consider not merely the requirements of the revenue, but also the incidence of the tax, so that the economic equilibrium may be disturbed as little as possible. Australia is a very rich country, her production per capita being very great; perhaps the greatest in the world. It has rapidly grown during the last decade, increasing from £36 14s. 2d. in 1906 to £45 8s. 6d. in 1913. A country's productivity is the measure of its labour force, its energy, and its resources. The productivity of labour depends mainly upon two things: the amount of capital available and the manner in which it is being used, and the efficiency of the labour. At this juncture it is of the utmost importance that we shall do nothing to discourage enterprise; on the contrary, we must do all that we can to encourage it. We hear a great deal about economy just now. The organs of the Conservative party assure us that economy is the very corner-stone of the national edifice. But from the rather hysterical manner in which they state their case, it would appear that they consider that economy should be applied to the " other fellow." This is certainly their hope, but this hope appears to be premature, and, in any case, the Bill supplies a useful antidote. </para>
                    <para>I shall now lay down what I conceive to be the lines on which economy, which has become essential, should be based, and I invite those who differ from me to prove these unsound. As the. productivity of  a country and its development depend mainly on the amount of capital invested in it, and the employment of that capital, it follows that income taxation must distinguish between that portion of wealth which is destined for the production of more wealth, namely, capital, and that portion over and above that destined for consumption, and in excess of the amount necessary to maintain the community, which may be called surplus consumption wealth. I invite the close attention of honorable members to these matters, because, if the basis of our scheme of taxation be wrong, the superstructure must fall. It may be regarded as axiomatic that to tax wealth used for the production of more wealth reduces the productivity of the country by diminishing its capital; but to tax the surplus wealth affects merely the margin available for luxuries, and so leaves the nation's power of productivity unimpaired. It is to this margin that economy ought to, and must, apply at the present time. One of the basic principles of this Bill, then, is the taxation of surplus wealth as distinguished from capital. In my opinion, the principle is sound. It is consistent with tie manner in which production is carried on in these days. Modern production is conducted largely, if not mainly, through the agency of companies. I have found it impossible to obtain from the Commonwealth Statistician a statement of the amount of capital invested in Australian companies, but it is certainly more than 50 per cent, of all capital invested in the Commonwealth. The capital invested -in companies whose names are listed by the Stock Exchange is about £138,000,000. The total amount of capital invested in companies is probably about £202,000,000. Practically all enterprises requiring large quantities of capital are conducted- by companies. It is thus obvious that a tax which pressed heavily on companies would tend to retard production should the impost be more than the companies could earn on an average. </para>
                    <para>If this were a light income tax, we might follow the practice usual in the various States, of imposing a flat rate on companies and treating them as individuals. But this is a graduated tax; distinguishing between incomes in such a way that the rate on small incomes is very much less than the rate on large incomes. The rate of tax increases as it proceeds, upon an even scale of graduation, so that each additional £1 of taxable income bears a higher rate of tax than that which precedes it. Companies as such are not taxed on their distributed profits; and dividends from companies are treated in exactly the same way as income from any other source. By this method each individual shareholder will pay such a rate of tax as his income from companies, together with that from all sources, warrants. And this is fair. Companies are aggregations of individuals. Some companies have hundreds of shareholders, and one or two in this country have thousands. Under this Pill, dividends are very unevenly distributed; in some cases, hundreds of shareholders do not average more than £50 or £100 each, while a few shareholders, on the other hand, get the lion's share of the dividends. To tax companies' incomes as such, would be to place on the small investor an impost that he should not fairly bear, and which would certainly deter him from investing his savings in companies. But as we have seen that it is through the agency of companies that modern production is mainly carried oh, this would mean to seriously discourage production. Therefore, companies, as such, are not taxed under this Bill on their distributed incomes. On their undistributed incomes, they are taxed at a low flat rate. The Bill draws a very sharp distinction between that portion of wealth used for production, and that portion of wealth over and above that which is necessary for- maintenance - which is, in short, devoted to luxury. The tax falls on the shoulders of the community in such a way as to bear most heavily on those who have an ample margin over and above that which is necessary to maintain themselves according to the station in which they live. </para>
                    <para>This Bill, of course, is frankly a war measure, designed to meet the present circumstances. It calls on those who have the means, to pay according to their means. No doubt, this Bill touches the high-water mark of income taxation, but it does not do so without ample warrant. Our present circumstances are such as to justify, and more than justify, the tax; and I know of no other means whereby we could raise the necessary revenue. Certainly there are none which would so little disturb the  economic equilibrium of the community, and impose so little hardship on individuals. The tax is equitable, and, so far as the data at our disposal will permit, economically sound. I wish to say here, frankly, that there is a complete absence of statistical information showing the distribution of wealth and incomes throughout the Commonwealth. In <inline font-style="italic">Riches and Poverty,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chiozza</inline> Money shows the manner in which the income of Great Britain is distributed. I desired to get something analogous here, but no figures are available for the purpose. Without complete data, I have to rely on rough estimates of the Commonwealth Statistician. I shall give these estimates, and what figures are available, to the House. I have only one more observation to make in this connexion. The absence of statistical data has prevented that proper scientific adjustment of the tax which the Government desired. It also prevents an accurate statement of the distribution of incomes amongst the masses of the people. There are some who suggest that all war expenditure should be met out of loans. I have no doubt whatever that this is the ideal of those gentlemen who speak so loudly to-day of economy. What they mean is that there should be imposed on the poorer classes of this country an economy which would reduce them below a fair and reasonable subsistence level, and that all extra expenditure should be provided for out of loans. </para>
                    <para>On the other hand, there is a section of the community who believe that all expenditure should be met out of taxation. The first of these plans is grossly inequitable to the mass of the people, who are always too heavily taxed, and everywhere contribute more than their fair share to the cost of government; and the second plan is impossible. The Government is satisfied that its proposals are equitable and suited to our present circumstances. </para>
                    <para>I now come to the provisions of the Bill, with which I . shall shortly deal. The rate of tax is graduated, and a distinction is drawn between incomes derived from , personal exertion and incomes derived from property, the rate of tax upon incomes derived from personal exertion being lower than the rate on incomes derived from property. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but I am giving honorable members sufficient in formation to enable them to understand what I am talking about. I propose to deal with the schedule afterwards. I now come to the exemptions. The exemption for incomes derived from personal exertion is £156, no tax being paid on any income below that amount. On incomes from personal exertion between £156 and £500, the full exemption of £156 is allowed. On incomes between £500 and £1,000 the exemption abates in such a way that at about £1,000 it disappears. On incomes derived from property there is an exemption up to £156, but the exemption begins to abate on the first £1 thereafter, and continues to abate in even gradations until it disappears at £500. For absentees no exemption is allowed. Exemption for children- under the age of sixteen years is granted to all taxpayers, and is unaffected by the amount of income. This exemption amounts to £13 for every child under the age of sixteen years. </para>

                    <para>A fiat rate of ls. 6d. is imposed on the undistributed -profits of companies. Before I give some figures showing the actual amount that will be paid by taxpayers, I wish to review shortly the scheme of taxation, Municipal, State, and Federal, as it now exists, with a view of comparing it with the proposed tax; for we have to consider not merely this proposed tax by itself, but its relation to other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth, States, and municipalities. I have said that it has proved impossible to ascertain precisely the distribution of incomes in this country; and' it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do more than guess at the manner in which taxation is paid. I have, however, endeavoured' to do what was possible in this direction. What I did desire to do, and what' we ought to be able to do, is to show, as Chiozza Money does in his book, exactly how the wealth is distributed in the country, and who pays the taxes. I think one of the most striking and powerful sermons ever preached on social and economic conditions in the modern world is set out in two diagrams in that book. There we are shown that for the year 1908 the income of the United Kingdom was, roughly, £1,800,000,000. Approximately one-half of that goes to 5,500,000 people, and the other half to 39,000,000 people. The other diagram shows that there are 1,400,000 rich people who divide amongst them £634,000,000, another comfortable class of 4,100,000 people divide £275,000,000, leaving only £935,000,000 for 39,000,000 people. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is impossible to say how the national income in Australia is distributed amongst those persons who receive under £200 <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> annum; but of all the people who earn money in this country, only 115,000 get over £200 a year. That is the first fact to be borne in mind in discussing a measure of this character. Of this number, 59,000 get over £300; 26,000 get "over £500; 16,000 get over £750; 10,000 get over £1,000; 5,500 get over £1,500; 4,000 get over £2,000; 2,850 get over £2,500; 965 get over £5,000; 165 get over £10,000; and 75 get over £15,000. The figures showing the distribution of incomes are as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">If companies are excluded, as they ought  to  be, from that calculation, the number ,of persons in receipt of over £200 a year is relatively very small indeed. </para>
                    <para>It will, no doubt, be said that the amount of taxation proposed by this tax, plus the land tax and the State taxes, will be very high. I do not deny that it will be high, but I deny it will be higher than it ought to be. In this country the rich have been more lightly taxed than any in the world, and it is time, and high time, for them to do something for the government of their country. We have been told, and no doubt we shall be told again, that this tax is iniquitous : Let me give some figures that speak for themselves. These figures show the position of the various classes of the community under this tax, and set out, by way of comparison, the position of the rich under this tax and that of the rich under the income tax in Great Britain. The comparison is a complete answer to all criticism. </para>
                    <para>The poor always pay more than their share of indirect taxation, and in this country indirect taxation has always borne to the whole a much larger proportion than is the case in tie United Kingdom. Even now, with this tax - the heaviest income tax in the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth - the proportion of indirect taxation is still higher here than in the United Kingdom. I will give the figures - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>May I express the matter in another way by quoting the proportion of income paid by the bulk of the community as compared with that paid by the well-to-do classes. The following figures will explain it: - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="078331191508183_14_1.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">My point is the man who receives £156 a year pays - the overwhelming majority of the people of this country pay - from one-third to twice as much in proportion to their income as the men who will have to pay taxation under this measure, plus the whole of the other imposts under State and Federal taxation. The man who has £104 a year will have to give up a larger proportion of that income by way of taxation than the man of £500 a year, or £1,000 income, including not only Customs and Excise, but all direct and indirect taxation paid by the latter. May I state further, as bearing upon this point, that the cost of living has very greatly increased during the last few years. Particularly has it increased, as everybody knows, during the last twelve months. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> in figures which certainly do not err on tie side of exaggeration, shows that what in 1911 could be bought for a sovereign would, in 1901, have cost 17s. 7d., and in 1914  22s.10d.  I have not the figures for 1915 with me, but I ask every honorable member in the chamber this question: If he had to live on £156 a year, or, as most of the people in this country have to live, on an income of between £104 and £156 a year, how would he do it? Every man knows that there is absolutely no margin left for taxation with such incomes. And this is the complete and satisfactory answer to all suggestions that the tax should fall upon incomes below £156. Those who receive such incomes - that is, the bulk of the community - could not pay any more taxation and live decently. The inevitable result of imposing additional taxation would be that the whole wage system of Australia would have to be readjusted. The masses of the people would have to be given more wages if the Government sought to compel them to pay any more than they now have to pay. </para>
                    <para>Then there is another point. The poor are not only taxed disproportionately to their incomes, but taxation is distilled from  them in various insidious -ways. In rent all taxes appear. Whatever tax is imposed comes out in the shape of rent, and the people have to pay it. Interest is another insidious way through which the poor are taxed.

                    <para class="block">The poor man who borrows pays a much higher rate of interest than the man who borrows in large amounts. He pays, not the true economic interest, but the interest that his circumstances compel him to pay. On the other hand, the poor man with savings to invest receives a smaller rate of interest than the rich man who has much to invest. In every way, then ; in the amount that he pays in Customs and Excise taxation, in the taxes he pays in the shape of rent - for he pays all taxes in the shape of rent - in the disabilities under which he labours in regard to interest, always paying a heavy embargo for borrowing and receiving a smaller return for the money he lends, in the increased cost of living the circumstances of the poor man are sufficient to show that in this scheme of taxation, when it is necessary that there should be sacrifice, the burden must fall, not upon those who have already borne, and are bearing, more than their fair share, but upon those who have too long escaped it. I speak not here of the middle classes, but of those who, at the other end of the scale, with their large incomes, have an ample margin on which they might be fairly called upon to retrench. </para>

I have here a table showing what the tax will be at different amounts of income. As already pointed out this is a progressive tax, and proceeds in such a way that the tax on each succeeding £1 of income is the same irrespective of the amount of income. The man with £10,000 a year pays on the first £1,000 the same as the man who has £1,000 and no more. I have had this progressive rate reduced to a flat rate, showing the equivalent flat rate at each point at which the progressive tax is illustrated in my table. For example, where the progressive tax is 27. 6d., the flat rate is only 15d. The table is as follows: - </para>

The machinery sections of the Bill follow those of the Land Tax Assessment Act very closely, and provide for the usual penalties, and for the usual provisions for objections and appeals. An appeal can be made from the assessment of the Commissioner to a Supreme Court, or to the High Court. An appeal may be heard by a single Justice, and a case can be stated for the decision of the High Court or a Supreme Court. When the High Court hears an appeal, it will do so under its appellate powers. The usual provisions are made for the recovery of the tax. It is a debt due to the Crown, and the Statute of Limitations does not run against it. Provision is made by which all contracts to evade the tax or pass it on are void. Further explanations can most usefully proceed when we are dealing with the schedule. </para>

                <para class="block">The whole of the formula relating to incomes derived from personal exertion is set out in the first paragraph. Although it appears somewhat involved, it is really quite simple. For so much of the taxable income as does not exceed £7,600 the rate of tax per £ sterling is to be 3d. and three eight-hundredths of1d. where the taxable value is £1 sterling, and increases uniformly with each increase of £1 sterling on the taxable income by three eight-hundredths of1d. Thus, if one wants to find the rate on £1,000 of taxable income, it is only necessary to multiply £1,000 by three eight-hundredths of one penny, getting thus three thousand eight-hundredths of1d., or 3¾d., which, added to 3d., gives the rate of tax on £1,000 as 6¾ d. Thus every taxpayer can find what he has to pay on income derived from personal exertion by multiplying three eight-hundredths of1d. by the amount of his taxable income. I can hold out no hopes of such simplicity with regard to the second schedule relating to the taxation of incomes derived from property. There is a difficulty in the formula which I am unable to express other than in the terms of the higher mathematics. I am credibly informed it has something to do with the perturbations in the curve. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> has very finely expressed the difficulty in the first paragraph following paragraph &amp;, to which I direct attention. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> gives the formula for ascertaining the rate of tax in cases where the taxable value does not exceed £546. There the difficulty is not great, because in those cases the exemption does not disappear until £546 has been reached (in the case of personal exertion it disappears at £1,020). In order to ascertain what the rate of tax is for incomes of £546 and under derived from property, it is necessary to multiply the amount of taxable income by 8.713/1032, add this to three, and thus get the rate of tax. With regard to incomes above £546, the Government Statistician sets out the difficulty in the beautifully simple terms of the mathematician. It represents a curve of the second degree - a term peculiarly appropriate for the noose of taxation that will fall round the neck of the unfortunate taxpayer. A curve of the second degree appears to be a curve which can be cut by any straight line at only two points. The manner in which the rate of tax is to be determined on all amounts over £546, but under £2,000, is set out in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> at various stages of its progression. At £546 it is 11.713d. At £600 it is 12.768d., and so on. For the benefit of the community generally I would explain that the rate of tax is to be calculated for incomes in between the points set out in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> by means of a table .that is being prepared by the Statistician. Paragraph c sets out the rate of tax for incomes above £2,000. At £6,500 the rate is 60d., and for every £1 sterling of taxable income in excess of £6,500 the rate is 60d. The third schedule deals with the rate of tax on the income of a company, which, under the machinery Bill, is its undistributed profits. Its distributed profits are taxed separately per shareholder. </para>

                        <para>- My information was furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician, and I give it for what it is worth. It has been found impossible to obtain from State Acts a consistent principle on which to deal with mining companies. In some of the States, calls are a set-off against taxation, and in others a set-off against dividends. We propose to regard them as capital upon which the shareholder is entitled to a return, and have put them on the same basis as mortgage charges. A taxpayer living in his own house must put down 5 per cent, of its value as an equivalent of rent, but is entitled to deduct what he pays in mortgage charges. If clause 16 is read in conjunction with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of clause 17, it will be seen that mining companies are to be fairly treated, although the proposal is open to suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite fair to tax on the income of 1914, because that is a completed year, and one for which returns have already been compiled in many cases. It is the almost universal practice to tax on the income of calendar years; that is done by the State Governments without exception. It may be urged that there has been a shrinkage of incomes this year, and I do not deny it, but during 1914 the pastoral and farming interests suffered as much as they will suffer this year. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member, but it has been, I think, unassailably held that, as the Public Accounts Committee would travel, the members of it could not be less liberally treated than were the members of the Public Works Committee. This Bill will practically bring the members of the Public Accounts Committee within the same scale of payment as is allowed in the case of another similar Committee. Innumerable questions have arisen as to what should be the payments made, and it has proved an endless problem for any one in a position like mine. Travelling expenses, of course, are necessary; and the Government have come to the conclusion that if the Public Accounts Committee is to be of any utility at all, and relieved of the necessity of appealing to the Treasurer from time to time for money, it ought to be placed in the same position as the Public Works Committee or any other Committee of the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, that is the only logical way in which we can deal with this Committee if we are to make it a useful and independent body. When the original Act was passed, it was with the idea that the Committee would sit and do their work in Victoria, much! as the Public Accounts Committee of the State does; but when we consider that they have to cover the whole of the Commonwealth, we get a different outlook altogether. I am doubtful whether Parliament made a good move in the appointment of this Committee, but, having appointed it, we ought to put those gentlemen, intrusted with this important work, in the same position as the Public Works Committee. Briefly, this Bill rnakes provision for the appointment of a  chairman  and vice-chairman, and for other improvements. It empowers the Committee to summon witnesses, and to take evidence, and provides for the remuneration of members of the Committee on the same basis as in the case of the Public Works Committee. It is proposed that the fee of the  chairman  shall be £2 for each sitting, and for the other members of the Committee £1 10s.,- with an allowance of £1 per day for travelling purposes. The total amount to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue for this purpose, in any one year is limited to £2,000, which is precisely the amount fixed in the case of the Public Works Committee. At the present time, the members of the Public Accounts Committee are paid, as travelling expenses, 25s. per day to the  chairman  and £1 per day to the other members. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask honorable members not to press the amendments foreshadowed in the earlier debate. The whole matter has been gone into very carefully, and honorable members should bear in mind that, although this Bill does not represent the last word in pensions, if passed it will become quite the most generous Pensions Act ever passed in any Parliament. While honorable members may desire to do justice to every one, they must be careful not to impose an unlimited burden upon posterity. This is not a party question. It cannot be made a party question, and I ask honorable members not to support the amendment now before the Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- While it is perfectly true that we do not desire to burden the country with a heavier pensions bill than the country can bear, and while it is equally true that this is probably the most liberal pensions scheme that has ever been put before any Parliament in any British Dominion, it must not be forgotten that this is the only occasion on which this Parliament will have an opportunity of insisting upon anything like reasonable provision being made for military dependants. Later, we shall have no opportunity of increasing the pension. If anything is to be done on behalf of the dependants of those who are now fighting the battles of the Empire in Europe, now is the time to do it. We know very well that little consideration will be shown to them in later years when the burden of war taxation begins to be felt. The proposal before the Committee is simply that the widowed mother of a deceased soldier should be entitled to a pension without the necessity of proving dependence being imposed upon her; and I certainly think such a provision ought to be inserted in this Bill. It is proposed to make the widow and children of a soldier entitled to pensions as of right, whether they be dependent upon the soldier or not, because we recognise that the payment of these pensions is the least the country can do for those left behind. Surely the widowed mother of an unmarried soldier leaving neither wife nor children ought to be put in the same position. I hope the Committee will insist upon this amendment being carried. It may mean that a few widowed mothers who are independent may get the pension as a right; but why should they not get it? Can any woman make a greater sacrifice for her country than the sacrifice of the child she has  borne? We pay the maternity allowance as a recognition of the act of maternity whether a woman is dependent or not; and if we can make that recognition of her service to the country in giving birth to her son, we ought to do something to recognise the act of the widowed mother who gives up the son she has borne and raised to manhood. </para>

                    <para>. - I must express regret that the Government have not seen their way to accept the reasonable request contained in this amendment. Since the matter was previously before the Committee I have1 received quite a number of letters quoting cases that ought to* meet with the most sympathetic consideration. I do not think that the extra expenditure involved by the acceptance of this amendment would be very great, and in my view it is only right and proper that action of this sort should be taken on behalf of the widowed mother who has allowed her unmarried son to go to the war. It may happen that a widowed mother has to take charge of a soldier's children. A widowed mother placed in that position will not be in the same category as the widow who has children to look after. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suggest that the Minister can give orders to the Commissioner, but if the Prime Minister or the Treasurer considers that any case brought under notice is a particularly hard one, the Commissioner may be induced to relax somewhat. I have letters supporting what has been said in this House regarding the hardships that may be inflicted unless a very liberal and generous interpretation is placed upon this clause. I know of one case where a man has been wounded on two occasions, and is now going back to the trenches for the third time, leaving his widowed mother behind. Such a man goes out to fight the battles of his country, and yet, in case he is killed, his mother will have to go to all kinds of trouble in order to establish her right to a pension. If she were his widow, all that she would be called upon to do would be to prove her identity to the pensions officer, and receive "the full pension, notwithstanding the fact that she might be worth a considerable sum of money. I place the wife and the widowed mother  in the same position. So long as the wife can prove her identity she can receive the full £52.: but the widowed mother who may be earning a few shillings a week at present, but may not be able to do so in a few years, is cut down to the paltry sum of £26 a year. </para>

                        <para>- I am informed, on the best of authority, that our pensions are not so liberal as those of New Zealand, which has done even better than the Commonwealth in the matter of the proportion of soldiers she has sent to the front; and, though it is only a little Dominion, with but a shade over 1,000,000 of population, and with resources which are small in comparison with ours, it has framed a more liberal pension scale than ours. I do not feel inclined to play second fiddle to a small Dominion such as New Zealand is - I mean that it is small in comparison with this great country of ours, which, with its magnificent resources, should deal magnanimously and in a liberal spirit with those people who are dependent on those of its soldiers who fall at the front. </para>

I hope that, even now, the Ministry will give way. Possibly the Minister for the Navy might have progress reported, in order to make inquiries as to whether our pensions scheme is equivalent to the New Zealand scheme; so that if ours is behind the New Zealand scheme it may be brought level with, if not ahead of, it. I hope that the honorable member for Barrier will not withdraw his amendment. I hope that he will press it to a division, and, if it is carried, that the Government will take it that the Committee wish to see more liberal treatment given to the dependants of those who go to 'the front.

                        <para>- At any rate, the Minister for the Navy believed in the principle of the Maternity Allowance Act. I know of a case at Ballarat where, since the son has gone to the front, the father has had to cease work through the rapid development of miner's complaint. If the son is killed the mother will get only a portion of the pension because he was not her sole support prior to enlistment, though, had he remained, that would have been his position. The father will probably die soon, but the widow will not be entitled to the whole of the pension. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the Minister, after having heard the expression of opinion of the Committee, has not withdrawn the Bill for further consideration and brought forward an amendment in accordance with the wishes of honorable members. I cannot distinguish between mothers and wives. In accordance with the wishes of Parliament, the Government have brought down an amendment to the War Pensions Act, entitling every fallen soldier's widow to claim the pension without any qualification. In my opinion, the fallen soldier's widowed mother should also be entitled to make the same claim without any qualification. There are nearly 500,000 married women in the Commonwealth between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five, and though we hope that not a very large percentage of these wives will find it necessary to claim a war pension, no one can forecast what that percentage will be. There are 50,000 widows between the ages of forty-five and sixty-five, who are not likely to draw war pensions for anything like the length of time that the widows of fallen soldiers would draw them. Some time ago I noticed statistics which showed that 12 per cent, of our soldiers are married, but there is no information available as to the number of soldiers who have left behind them widowed mothers dependent or partly dependent upon them. Probably 80 per cent, or 90 per cent, of the widowed mothers of the Commonwealth are dependent in some way or another on the earnings of their children, and by taking away the son we are depriving the widowed mother of the main portion of the revenue received from her children, on which she may be dependent for her livelihood. If the Minister will secure a return from the Commonwealth Statistician as to the extra expense involved in placing the widowed mother in the same position as the widow, he will probably find that it will not be a considerable sum. In all likelihood a large proportion of the widowed mothers will prove absolute dependence under the Bill in its present form, and the number who are perhaps receiving partial support from their families should not be very large. There will be very few absolutely independent of the earnings of the son who has gone to the front. Thus the acceptance of the amendment should not involve the Government in any considerable expenditure, and it would be performing only a simple act of justice. Even at this eleventh hour I hope the Government will not find it necessary to force the amendment to a division; but, if they are determined not to carry out the wishes of honorable members, I shall support the honorable member for the Barrier, whose desire is to place the widowed mother in the same position as the wife of the soldier who falls at the front. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that the Government have not seen their way clear to agree to what seems to be the evident desire of honorable members not only on this side but also on the . other side. If we could avoid a division I would prefer it. I hope that the Government will not ask for a division. I do not think that the expenditure we are asking the Government to undertake by this amendment. will be a great amount. There is, however, a principle at stake, and I shall be glad if the Government can give way. I have not yet voted against them, so far as I know, either in Committee or in the House, and do not want to begin to do so. There are others in the same position, and if we began to do it, we might develop the habit. I do not think that a number of us have been very unreasonable, and we can surely expect the Government to meet the wish, not merely of a number on this side, but also of the Opposition. I hope the Government will be on the Treasury bench for many years. If they are, and a great burden is involved by the amendment, it is they who will be called upon to finance it. That consideration might also influence them. The arguments in favour of the amendment have been strong, and should be given every consideration. I have heard honorable members in this House urged to think of the traditions of the race and the sentiments of the people from whom we have sprung, but the people from whom we have sprung have never hesitated to give pensions. The Old Country has paid in pensions to the illegitimate descendants of Kings millions more than we shall be called upon to pay in pensions to those who have fought for us and the parents and widows of those who have died for us. I trust the Government will not put some of us in the unpleasant position of having to call for a division. I and a number of others feel strongly on the matter, and the Government should find no difficulty in meeting the wishes of the Committee if a majority desire the amendment to be given effect to. I have not heard one honorable member speak against it. The only argument used by the Minister is that it will cost a good deal of money. The war is costing us a great deal of money, and a great many sacrifices are being made. Some people are making a great sacrifice in allowing their children to go to the front, and to huckster as to whether they shall receive 19s. 6d. or £1 is unworthy of the National Parliament. If. it is necessary, I shall call for a division, and hope that the majority of the Committee will vote as I do, so that the Government may know clearly and unmistakably the wish of this section of the Legislature. At this juncture I would make a ' further appeal to the Minister not to force us into the position of voting against the Government, but to say kindly, gracefully, and cheerfully that the Government are prepared to meet our wishes. </para>

The honorable member for Maribyrnong has cited an isolated case of a lady who lost her son, and on application was granted only <inline font-style="italic">£26</inline> instead of £52 per annum. Why? Because the case had been inquired into, and it is found that she has some other source of income. </para>

                        <para>- The rich wife has to make application, and I suppose m many cases will not do so. However, the Government have given the matter consideration, even since Friday last, and feel that, being responsible for the expenditure of public money, they have gone as far as they can go. We are not prepared to give the pension to the rich widowed mother. The present Act gives it to the widowed mother who is deserving of it, and we do not feel called upon to go beyond that. </para>

The amendment will "make the Senate's proposal meaningless. I hope the Government will not be put in the position indicated, because honorable members must know what that will mean. I do not stand here to make any threat, but the carrying of the amendment  will  put the Government in a position whereby what we intend to do, and what we have practically done, will be blocked. I therefore urge honorable members to consider the position in which we will be placed if the words indicated are struck out. The matter, according to my promise, was brought before the Cabinet, and was before the Cabinet even as late as Monday of this week, and my instruction from the Cabinet is to stand by the Senate's amendment as printed. We cannot go any further.' </para>

                    <para>.- I regret the Minister's concluding remarks. If they mean that the Government are going to disagree with the amendment made in the Senate at their own instigation, and go back on their promise to this House, it will be a subject of considerable regret. The words of the amendment before the Committee were selected for the simple reason that to strike them out is the only way to comply with the Standing Orders. We cannot increase the burdens on the people in the ordinary way, and the only course open to us was to strike out some word or words, with the understanding that the carrying of the amendment would have a certain meaning. </para>

                        <para>- We heard the Prime Minister say this afternoon that this was not a party matter. That being so, why should the Government stake its existence on the position that it has assumed? I hope that' members will not be forced to disregard considerations of humanity to maintain the Government. The time has arrived when honorable members should have a free hand on many subjects. Personally, of course, I am free to vote as I conceive to be right, because I am not subject to party discipline by any caucus, and from what I have seen I think that caucus discipline is as severe on one side as on the other. </para>

                        <para>- Yielding to the wishes of honorable members, the Government promised to amend the Bill in the Senate in such" a way as would make it unnecessary for widows and children of fallen soldiers to prove dependency. It was thought that that would be some slight recognition of the sacrifice they had made in the interests of the nation. Now it is asked that mothers of unmarried sons who fall shall be placed in the same position. The Minister asks, " Should we pay a pension to a widowed mother who is rich?" But he is prepared to pay a pension to the widow of a fallen soldier who may be rich. In my opinion, the widowed mother of a son who falls makes a greater sacrifice than is made by the widow and children of a fallen soldier. The mother went through the trials of maternity to bear the soldier, and Parliament, recognising the merit of maternity, has provided that all mothers, whether they be as wealthy as Croesus or as poor as Lazarus, shall be entitled to receive a maternity allowance. The women of the community have shown their appreciation of this provision, because practically every mother who has given birth to a child since the Act became law has claimed the allowance, which is a sufficient answer to the statement that the giving of it would degrade women. The mother, in addition to undergoing the trials of maternity, has the trouble and the anxiety connected with the bringing up of her offspring. Yet we are told that, should she sacrifice a son in the interests of the community, she should receive no recognition from those who have been left in possession of their lives and property, unless she comes as a suppliant, and shows that she was dependent on her fallen son. What if it will cost a little more to make provision for widowed mothers? As the honorable member for Wimmera has pointed out, they will claim for a shorter period than that for which widows and children will claim. </para>

                    <para>.- The other day the Minister said the widowed mother is provided for, and that each case would be dealt with according to its merits. But a case which I should like to bring under the notice of the Committee will serve to show the probability that the administration of the Act will not be as sympathetic as we should like it to be, if the provision relating to widowed mothers remains unaltered. In this case a widowed mother had three sons, two of them of military age, and a third a boy of twelve years of age. The two elder lads went to the front, where one has already lost his life. Each of these sons left to his mother 14s. a week, and from one of them she still receives that allowance. When the other son was killed, she applied for a pension, but the Board would allow her only 10s. a week because she was receiving 14s. a week from the son still serving, and would give her nothing for the maintenance of the boy of twelve, whom she will have to keep until he is at least sixteen years of age. </para>
