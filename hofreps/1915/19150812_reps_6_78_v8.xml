                        <para>- I understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> wished to import cattle, not from Queensland, but from the Northern Territory. When he brought the matter before me, I told him that there was no Federal restriction on such importation, but advised him to see the Agricultural Department of Victoria regarding it. I understand that the Victorian authorities object to the importation, because they fear the introduction of the tick pest. However, I shall make representation as requested. </para>

                            <para>- I answered the question as I understood it. But it appears that the point upon which information is desired is whether the pay of soldiers in the hospitals at Men a House, Alexandria, or elsewhere has ceased. I have already stated that the pay of a soldier does not cease until he is discharged. It appears,  however, that under an Imperial regulation the soldiers in hospital receive only a very small allowance. Their pay is not stopped, bub it is not given to them while in hospital ; it is allowed to accumulate. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the comprehensive reply I made yesterday when dealing with the motion of the honorable member for Wannon, and also in answer to a question by the honorable member for Dampier, I cannot understand the repetition of the question; but in order that there may be no confusion, I shall say once more that Elder, Smith and Company, as such, were never agents for Beer, Sondheimer and Company. At the outbreak of war, Elder, Smith and Company held half the shares in the Elder Metal Company, which was agent for Beer, Sondheimer and Company. Soon after the outbreak of war, the Elder Metal Company went into liquidation, and that severed completely the connexion between Elder, Smith and Company and Beer, Sondheimer and Company. Elder, Smith and Company was, and is yet, the only firm that has completely severed its connexion with Germany. </para>

                        <para>- This matter has been brought up many times by the honorable member for Oxley; and a fortnight or three weeks ago, in reply to a question by him, a return was laid on the table relating to the matter. All the State Ministers of Agriculture have been communicated with, and urged to bring the subject under the notice of those most interested, in order to prevent the slaughter of heifer calves in view of the serious position in which Australia may find itself, so far as our beef supplies are concerned, in the near future. As to bull calves, I think that, in consideration of the shortage of meat, it is, perhaps, advisable that they should be slaughtered. None of the calves brought to Victoria have been exported during the last three months. </para>

The fault seems to lie with the soldiers' commanding officer for not reporting to the proper authority all the casualties in his unit, although the great difficulties under which the operations are being conducted must be taken into consideration. The wounded may be picked up and taken away without his knowledge, or, even if with his knowledge, it is quite possible he himself may become a casualty, and the matter overlooked. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>On the 3rd December, 1914, I stated that the probable revenue which would be received during the financial year ended 30th June, 1915, was £23,273,000, and that this would be supplemented by a loan for war purposes to be received from the British Government of £10,500,000, also by proceeds of Treasury-bills amounting to £2,588,314, which with £1,222,401, the surplus it was anticipated would be brought forward from 1913-14, made the total amount available for expenditure £37,583,715. </para>
                <para>The revenue actually received was £22,411,710, or £861,290 less than the estimate. The Customs revenue exceeded the estimate by £613,247, but there was a shortage in land tax of £746,222, and the probate duties amounted to only £39,646, whilst the estimate was £1,000,000, being a shortage of £960,354. Defence revenue was in excess by £211,389, owing mostly to freight received from cargo carriers. </para>
                <para>At the time the Estimates were framed, it was expected that only £10,500,000  would be received as loan from the British Government, but arrangements were afterwards made for a second loan of £6,500,000, of which £3,600,000 was received up to 30th June. </para>
                <para>It was estimated that Treasury-bills amounting to £2,588,314 would be required in aid of revenue, but owing to the receipt of the additional British loan, it was found necessary by the 30th June to issue only £311,905. </para>
                <para>The total expenditure amounted to £38,047,962. The surplus actually brought forward from the previous financial year, viz., £1,224,347, was available towards meeting this expenditure, thus leaving £36,823,615 to be provided during 1914-15. </para>
                <para>The special war expenditure amounted to £14,792,960, being £4,406,031 for Naval, and £10,386,929 for Military. The war expenditure was thus in excess of the amount of £14,100,000, borrowed from the British Government up to 30th June. </para>
                <para>Finance 1915-16 As regards the Estimates of the current year - and here may I pause to state that this is not the Budget, but an intermediate statement that honorable members desire, and that, I think, can with advantage be given - I estimate the revenue at £23,540,000. </para>
                <para class="block">This is £1,128,290 more than that received during 1914-15. The items are: - </para>

                <para>Honorable members will be glad to hear of the estimated revenue from the Transcontinental Railway. </para>
                <para>In addition to the total revenue mentioned, viz., £23,540,000, the amount of £10,400,000 has still to be received from the British Government as the balance of the loan of £24,500,000. </para>
                <para>I also add £20,000,000 to be received as the proceeds of the Australian "War Loan. Strictly speaking, the expenditure on war services will be charged to loan up to this amount, but for the sake of clearness I have included the amount in this statement in the same way as the £10,400,000 to be received from the British Government. </para>
                <para>The balance of expenditure over receipts is £20,103,104, of which it is estimated that £4,000,000 will he received as income tax. </para>

The comparison of revenue I have read shows that the Budget estimate of revenue for 1914-15 was £23,273,000, whilst the revenue actually received was £22,411,710. The rough estimate of revenue for 1915-16 is. £23,540,000. Allowing for £10,500,000 war loan from British Government, and £2,588,314 Treasury-bills in aid of  revenue,  the total of the Budget estimate for 1914-15 was £36,361,314, -while the actual revenue for 1914-15, including these two items, was £36,823,615. To the rough estimate of revenue for 1915-16, set down at £23,540,000, we have to add £20,000,000 in respect of the Commonwealth loan for war purposes, £10,400,000 in respect of the war loan from the British Government, £4,000,000 for income tax, and £16,103,104 to be otherwise provided, making a grand total of £74,043,104. </para>

Since the question has been raised, I think that the people of Australia are capable of raising, not only £20,000,000, but double that amount should our necessities demand that. That, however, is merely by the way. I am tempted to refer once more to the question of bonds, but as it relates to the note issue, I would rather not deal with it at the present time. </para>

                <para>Since the declaration of war on the 4th August, 1914, great and unique responsibilities have been cast upon the Commonwealth. Australia has been splendidly represented in the actual arena of hostilities. Much has been done by this portion of His Majesty's Dominions. Much remains to be done. The Government's determination is to .continue to train, equip, and transport to the seat of war every available man fit to help defeat our enemies. </para>
                <para>Units Despatched. Since the beginning of the war 76,000 troops have been organised, equipped, and despatched for active service abroad. These troops consisted of the First Australian Division, complete with Light Horse Artillery, Engineers, and Infantry; four brigades of Light Horse ; four Infantry brigades ; and other arms as shown on the attached table: - </para>

                </para>
                <para>Troops in Training. In addition to these units, 40,000 troops are now in camps of training throughout Australia in preparation for despatch to the front. Included in the troops quoted is the Military Expeditionary Force for operations in German New Guinea, which sailed on the 19th August, 1914. This territory was captured, and with the neighbouring islands is now garrisoned by Australian troops. </para>
                <para>Flying Corps. At the request of the Indian Government a half flight of the Australian Flying Corps was despatched to the Persian Gulf for operations in the Tigris Valley, and is carrying on valuable work in conjunction with members of the Royal Flying Corps. Reinforcements are about to be sent at the request of the Government of India. </para>
                <para>Reinforcements. The actual number of  troops  being sent monthly to the front as reinforcements is 5,300, and for the months of October and November this will be increased to 10,600. </para>
                <para>New Units. It is proposed to despatch (in addition to the reinforcements already mentioned), in order to complete a second Australian Division, 4,400 troops; together with the Eighth Infantry Brigade, with signalling, ambulance and supply units complete, numbering an additional 4,600 troops. </para>
                <para>General, <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> will thus be seen that 76,000 troops have already been sent to the front. Those about to be sent are 4,400 - to complete the Second Division - 4,600 - 8th Infantry Brigade and details - and the monthly reinforcements of 5,300. The number in camps of training is 40,400, making a grand total Australian Expeditionary Force of 117,000. Not included in this 117,000 are the 8,000 troops of the Citizen Forces mobilized in Australia for home defence. </para>
                <para>Equipment and Clothing. The whole of the troops forming the Expeditionary Forces of the Commonwealth have been fully clothed and fitted out with the' very latest fighting equipment. Every member of the Expeditionary Forces has been provided with two suits of warm woollen garments of excellent quality; also underclothing and substantial, comfortable boots, and, in addition, a reserve stock of these is being shipped to Egypt monthly in sufficient quantity to enable the troops to obtain new issues every three months. Special clothing had also to be provided for the Tropical Force. To provide the garments for the number of troops already embarked, or shortly due to embark, has necessitated the manufacture of 8,000.000 yards of material. </para>
                <para>Resources of Australia in Equipping Forces. The fitting out for service abroad of units which hitherto had not formed part of the Australian War Organization, called for considerable initiative and resource. Ways and means had to be devised, new ground to be opened up ; but all difficulties in this respect have been surmounted. The resources of the Commonwealth in labour and machinery sufficed to produce almost every item of necessary military equipment, including many articles which had not previously been manufactured in Australia. The local manufacture of machine guns, wireless telegraphic instruments, compasses, periscopes, and other articles of important military value will shortly be undertaken. Probably the most successful achievement of the Department in this connexion has been the designing and production for the first time of a purely Australian Infantry equipment. </para>
                <para>Vehicles and Harness. For transport and supply services in connexion with troops embarked to date, over 2,000 vehicles and 7,000 sets of harness have been provided. Practically all these vehicles have been made in Australia; 90 per cent, of the harness, and, in addition, 10,000 sets of saddlery, have been manufactured by the Commonwealth Harness and Saddlery Factory. </para>
                <para>Rifles. It has- been found possible to provide rifles of the latest pattern for the whole of our Expeditionary Forces, lt is satisfactory to note that 25 per cent, has been manufactured at the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory. The weapons supplied from this source have been well reported upon from Egypt. </para>
                <para>Small Arms Ammunition. The supply of Small Arm Ammunition (also made in Australia) has always been found to be one of the greatest difficulties in time of war. The resources of the Commonwealth have been severely taxed in this connexion, but all requirements have been fully met. The large initial reserve provided for each rifle in the hands of Expeditionary Troops is being maintained by the shipment of monthly supplies to Egypt to replace that expended in action. A liberal allowance of ammunition is also being provided for practice purposes. </para>
                <para>Local Defence Requirements. In addition to clothing and equipping troops for oversea, the requirements of our Citizen Forces and Senior Cadets have to be met, and every endeavour is being made to keep their clothing and equipment as fully maintained as possible. </para>
                <para>Food Supplies. It would be quite impossible to furnish definite figures to illustrate the enormous quantities of food supplies which have been obtained by the Department to provision the troops during the currency of the war ; but the following items may be set forth as examples showing the daily requirements of the troops at the present time : - </para>

                <para class="block">and other articles of provisions in like proportion. </para>
                <para>Horses. Since the outbreak of the war 31,627 horses have been obtained by the Defence Department for military purposes, of which 2S,988 were purchased at a cost of £560,968, and the balance, 2,639, were donated. Up to date 24,270 horses have been sent away with the Australian Imperial Forces, and there are still about 6,600 remounts remaining within the Commonwealth to fulfil future requirements. This establishment, of course, has necessitated the purchase of enormous quantities of forage. </para>
                <para>Casualties. Our casualties in connexion with the present war, including those who have died in Egypt and <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> since the embarkation of the first contingent, now total some 13,976, made up as follows: - </para>

                <para>Care of Wounded and Sick. Every possible attention is given to our sick and wounded, who have the most skilled and experienced physicians and surgeons of the Empire at their disposal, as well as the invaluable and self-sacrificing ministrations of our nurses. </para>
                <para>Department of the Navy. The Royal Australian Navy, since the outbreak of war, has fulfilled all the calls upon it. Each ship has done its part. In the </para>

We may not definitely say in which of the Seven Seas our ships are serving, but I am proud to be able to tell honorable members that each ship is doing her share at her appointed station, and is helping to maintain that sea supremacy which is the biggest asset on the side of the Allies at this moment, the maintenance of which, moreover, necessarily means our safety. </para>
                <para>Revenue. The amount of revenue from this Department to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the year 1915-16 is estimated at £450,000. This is made up of - </para>

                <para class="block">It is also estimated that a sum of £1,000,000 will be collected as freight in respect of cargo carried on transports. This amount will not be credited to revenue, but will be treated as a set-off against transport expenditure. I think that is the better way to deal with it. </para>

                <para>A notable inclusion in the Estimates of the Navy for the current year will be the provision for salaries and wages, maintenance, stores, coal, and other expenditure in connexion with the commercial transactions of detained enemy vessels used as trading ships. </para>
                <para>Cargo Service. Thirteen vessels are used in this general cargo-carrying service, trading to ports in Great Britain, South Africa, Europe, and North and South America. The expenditure under this head for the past financial year, 1914-15, was £163,000 ; the receipts were £211,000. Final figures are not yet available, as expenditure is incurred and large amounts of freight are collected in London, in regard to which statements of account are not yet to hand. The figures are therefore subject to some variation. For the year 1915-16, the estimated expenditure is £318,000. For the year 1915-16 the estimated receipts are £400,000. These figures are subject also to variation for the reason previously given. </para>
                <para>Transport Service. Beside this class of sea-carrying trade, the Navy Department has also the charge of transport services in connexion with our Expeditionary Forces. Seventy ships have been taken up and fitted out as transports or hospital ships, and, in addition, six detained enemy vessels have been fitted up, and are being utilized for transport purposes. These latter ships have been provided with crews, stores, &amp;c, and are completely run by the Department of the Navy. The cost of transport services, viz., £6,500,000, is included in the vote for Expeditionary Forces, and is made up as follows: - </para>

                </para>
                <para>Of the net amount of £6,500,000 required, it is estimated that £1,000,000 will ultimately be recovered from the Admiralty, reducing the net charge to £5,500,000. Commonwealth transports are frequently taken over for long or short periods by the Admiralty, and the voyages of transports are also subject to deviation on Admiralty account. The additional expense on Admiralty account involved to the Commonwealth is estimated, for 1915-16, at £1,000,000. The total cost, of running these transports is, in the first place, paid by the Commonwealth, and -claim for such portion as is not a Commonwealth charge is rendered against the Admiralty. </para>
                <para>The Season.- The present outlook over -the Commonwealth is in general very favorable, except as regards the greater part of Queensland, where rains have been much below the normal since the beginning of the year. With that exception, since the break in the dry spell in May last, good rains have fallen at frequent intervals throughout all the settled agricultural areas. These have been accompanied by remarkably mild winter temperatures. Reports from Commonwealth observers establish the following position : - In Victoria, abundant and frequent rains over almost all areas give promise of an excellent growth of vegetation. In. New South Wales, prospects in general are exceedingly good, grass and herbage springing well; there are excellent harvest prospects, and stock are fast improving. In Western Australia, the rains have been remarkably good all through this year. In many parts this season promises the best ever known. In Tasmania, prospects are likewise good. In South Australia, throughout all agricultural areas, the prospects could hardly be better, while in the inland pastoral districts, though rains would be welcome, a favorable outlook is taken. Queensland is extremely dry, and the outlook so far rather unfavorable in' general throughout the State. </para>
                <para>Realizing that the prospective good season in Australia during the coming year should be taken full advantage of, the authorities in the various States have taken action to largely increase the area put under crop. </para>
                <para>In 1912-13 the total area under crop in the Commonwealth was 13,038,049 acres. In 1913-14 the total area under crop in the Commonwealth was 14,683,012 acres. In 1914-15 the total area under crop in the Commonwealth was something like 15,700,000 acres. </para>
                <para>During the present season, it is estimated a much larger area has been put under crop. This is largely in connexion with the wheat crop. The area under wheat in the Commonwealth during the year 1912- 13 was 7,339,651 acres, with a production of 91,981,070 bushels. In 1913-14 the acreage was 9,287,398, with a production of 103,344,132 bushels. In 1914-15 the acreage was 10,321,328, but, owing to an unfavorable season, the production fell to 24,843,536 bushels. The prospects of the wheat crop for the coming season are highly satisfactory. A large increase in area under this all-important cereal is reported in all the States. In Victoria - which alone up to the present has made an official estimate - the acreage has increased by no less than 33 per cent. Should the other States show a proportional increase, the total area is estimated to be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 13,500,000 acres. With favorable weather conditions, a record crop, perhaps of 160,000,000 bushels, may be possible. This figure, of course, is merely an estimate. </para>
                <para>Transport of Wheat to World's Markets. In anticipation of a very considerable exportable surplus of wheat and other produce, the Commonwealth Government, acting in co-operation with the State Governments, is now actively engaged in securing freight for its transport to the markets of the world. The problem is complex and difficult, owing to the uncertainty of the tonnage required, the price of wheat in the world's markets, and high rate of freight arising out of the scarcity of deep-sea tonnage - a considerable percentage of the world's mercantile marine is now temporarily or permanently out of action. A scheme of organization dealing with the whole wheat-freight requirements of the Commonwealth has been devised, and every effort is being made to enable the producers of Australia to profitably dispose of their products in the world's markets. </para>
                <para>I have only a few more words to say. Honorable members will see that an additional amount of about £20,000,000 will be required. We shall have to pledge our credit, either to the people of Australia or to the people of Australia and the Mother Country, for this additional amount. As to the Port AugustaKalgoorlie to Fremantle railway, honorable members will agree that to allow a work of such dimensions to begin at Port Augusta and stop at Kalgoorlie would be an insane policy for any Government to acknowledge. I have communicated with the Premier of Western Australia, pointing out how urgent it is that the work of linking up this line for through communication should commence at the western side of Australia, and I expect a favorable reply. </para>
                <para>I take this opportunity at a time of national crisis to speak to the people of Australia concerning the position of this National Parliament and National Government. I  say  no more than that these great transcontinental lines are essential for our protection as well as for linking up the peoples of the continent. We have no time to waste over disputes of any kind, and no words of mine, and certainly no feeling of any kind, will be calculated to ruffle the political temper of any of the States. But national necessities and duties must be attended to by the responsible Government of the Commonwealth, and I appeal to the Governments and people of South Australia and Western Australia to meet us in this great national undertaking. To allow an* expenditure of £5,000,000 of Commonwealth money to begin at one place and end nowhere would not only be suicidal, but show us to be a people incompetent and unworthy to have the representative institutions we possess. There is no use in mincing language in matters of this kind. </para>
                <para>I feel, also, that I should not close before I make mention of the undoubted difficulties that have arisen, and will arise, from the position of Australia, possessing as it does seven Governments, each one of which is piling up a separate national debt. We have inherited this difficulty. We must not complain concerning the parties who are at present engaged in protecting their States' interests, nor can they complain of the action of the Commonwealth in trying to protect the interests of the country as a whole. But we have to face the position. We cannot hide our difficulties, and they will not disappear if we simply bury our heads and declare that they do not exist. These difficulties do exist as a stern reality. The figures I have taken pains to give honorable members this afternoon must bring home to them the fact that there are great difficulties, if not dangers, in front of Australia, unless we have the full and wholehearted co-operation of all the public men of Australia in these matters. </para>
                <para>As regards the resources of Australia, I have not changed my mind in the slightest degree since I have had an opportunity of travelling from one end of the country to the other. I know of no country with greater, or, indeed, with such great resources. I do not limit the possibilities of finding money for ourselves to tens of millions, or even to a hundred millions, if the people so determine; but I do say that the necessities of the Commonwealth demand economy from its people in every walk of life. It is an error, in my opinion, honestly made by many men, to think that frugality is attended by disturbed trade and destroyed industry. The effect is quite the opposite. Mother Nature here is finding opportunities for every one to help to provide the food we need, the raiment we wear, and all that is really necessary to our material well-being. We have a superabundance of produce to export if we have the opportunity. Probably the present trouble is being brought more nearly home to us because of the closing of our credit; but this may be the best thing that has happened to Australia up to the present moment. </para>
                <para>In the meantime our particular business, unhappily, is to impose additional taxation. Different opinions may be held both as to the method and amount, but the necessity for the taxation is obvious. </para>

                <para>Before I mention some leading features of the proposed income tax, may I be allowed to say, on behalf of Parliament, that although this war has, of course, broken and brought grief to many family circles in Australia, it is a proud sorrow that has been bravely suffered. It is not out of place, I am sure, for me, on behalf of this House, to express to all who have suffered on account of the war our sympathy with them, coupled with a determination to see this matter through to a righteous end, whatever it may cost in money or in life. While we are asking all to make some sacrifice in the way of money contributions, what are these compared to the sacrifice of the young men who are nobly coming forward determined to give their all - happy, indeed, to give their lives if the nation need them ! </para>
                <para>Honorable members will see from what I have stated that, even allowing for the amount of £20,000,000 to be borrowed in Australia, and £10,400,000 to be received from Great Britain, the estimated revenue will be short of the estimated expenditure by over £20,000,000. We must do our part in this great war, no matter what it costs us. In these circumstances, it is obvious that recourse must be had to additional taxation. The Government, after very careful consideration, have decided that this shall take, the form of a graduated income tax. The rate of tax will range from 3d. in the first £1 over the exemption - £156 - to 5s. in every £1 over £7.756. The exemption of £156, which will be granted to incomes from personal exertion only, will gradually abate as the income increases, and will disappear when the income is £1,000. There will be an additional exemption of £13 for every child under sixteen years of age, which will be granted to every taxpayer, irrespective of his income. Companies are not to be taxed as such except on their undistributed profits. The rate of tax on these will be determined by a calculation based upon the share of profits allocated to the individual shareholders. It is estimated that the tax will yield a revenue of about £4,000,000. I have to thank honorable members for their consideration. </para>

Had such a motion as this been introduced a few years ago, it might have justifiably provoked some feeling of rivalry; but to-day such a motion has to be regarded in the light of contemporary history. It is not  necessary  for me to dwell upon the position that every newspaper reader knows the civilized world is in. Hardly a question of importance can be discussed in Melbourne, London, Paris, Petrograd, or any other important city, some aspac' s of which have not been materially changed as the result of the war; and I would like honorable members to bear this fact in mind when they are dealing with the motion that I have just submitted. I should not be so deeply interested in the subject if it were not for the gravity of the present situation. In itself, the motion is a simple one, which asks for power to carry out a recommendation of the Public Works Committee. </para>

                            <para>- I will answer the honorable member's query shortly. I quite admit that the financial aspect of the situation cannot be lost sight of. In spite of the political school to which I belong, 1 feel that all questions of this kind must be dealt with as business transactions; but the point that I wish to lay before the House at the present moment is not one of immediate financial concern. I am not going to deal with ancient history; but it is the fact, nevertheless, as was demonstrated in that period which began with the Peninsular War and culminated with the Battle of Waterloo, that a general lack of organization has always been the chief characteristic of any policy adopted by the British people. Thanks to the proverbial British luck, we have always managed to muddle through with whatever we have undertaken, and, despite our troubles at the present time, I have not the slightest doubt that we shall continue to do so. But this policy of muddle is not a wise one to pursue. Responsible Ministers of  His  Majesty, wherever they may be serving, are repeatedly charged - and rightly charged, I think - with the policy of " muddling through," and Australia, unfortunately, has not escaped from that reflection. It is a policy, however, in respect of which no virtue can be claimed, and the sooner we substitute for it a proper system of organization the better. Our enemies, the Germans, do not muddle through. Their present position is due to their splendid organization, but I would rather have British muddling, with honour, than Germany's brilliant system of organization, divorced as it is from almost every principle that distinguishes between man and the beasts of the field. There are two strong reasons why this motion should commend itself to the House. The time has passed when Australians should be content to merely muddle through with any work they take in hand. We should declare for system, and in building the Federal Capital should have some regard for common-sense business principles. It is very desirable that there should be an extension of our Small Arms Factory, and I hold that Canberra is the best situation in which to place it. It is desirable to establish it there, because, in the first place, it is essential that Defence matters should not be under divided authority, but rather under the control of the Commonwealth Government, which can speak for the manhood and womanhood of Australia. It seems to me that in respect of any Commonwealth Factory to be established in the future, our critics in the press and elsewhere should be called upon to show cause why it should not be erected in the Federal Territory. </para>

                            <para>- It is certainly not near the coast. We have reached the parting of the ways. Every additional hundred thousand pounds that we spend at Lithgow will strengthen vested interests there, and make it more difficult to remove this Factory. Public men know very well how difficult it is to secure the removal of any big Government works from a district when vested interests have grown up about it, and every additional pound that we spend at Lithgow will make it more difficult for us to face the situation, and deal with it on its merits. All that I am asking the House to-day <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do is to decide that the time has arrived when additions to our Small Arms Factory should be built at Canberra. That is the policy of the Government; but, speaking for myself, and, I believe, for thousands of citizens, I consider that this will ultimately prove to be but part of a scheme for the creation of an arsenal. Such an undertaking must be faced. The Imperial Government have appealed to us to depend upon our own resources in taking our share in the war, and that means that we must provide for the local manufacture of munitions of war, and everything relating to the equipment of an army. Why should we, ostrich-like, bury our heads in the sand, and refuse to recognise the position ? We have reached the parting of the ways, and must take this step. </para>

The Government simply ask the House to adopt this motion, but I believe that the people of Australia will soon realize that it will be necessary to establish an arsenal.

                    <para>It is hardly necessary to quote such evidence because every one who is familiar with gigantic undertakings knows that the more they can be concentrated and carried on under one business control, the more economically they can be conducted. That is a consideration that will appeal to those honorable members who always regard matters of this character from a financial point of view. If we are going to have Commonwealth Factories scattered here, there, and everywhere, we cannot hope for economy or efficiency. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that it is not. I sincerely hope that it will not be regarded as a party question when a vote is taken. However, without any reflection on this Parliament, no one can dispute the fact that we often do not look at things from a broad point of view. We have many badly situated railway termini in Australia because of the fact that our lines have been built in patchwork fashion, Parliament authorizing a small expenditure upon them from time to time, and this system has resulted in our having railway termini which are a disgrace to Australia. Every one says, " Why has this come about?" It is because in public life in Australia we seldom look at matters from a broad point of view, and thus we sacrifice future interests. The proposal that I am now submitting to the House looks into the future. The Home Affairs Department has the plan and the organization to construct cheaply at Canberra. I direct the attention of honorable members who pride themselves on being keen business men to this fact. There are some people who approve of any work as long as it can be shown to them that it can be undertaken cheaply. I am not one of those who belong to that school. </para>

                            <para>- Not this afternoon. I have nothing further to add in regard to that phase of the question. A little while ago, when addressing myself to this matter, I urged that consideration should be given to it from a military point of view, and that we should stop our muddling policy. To-day we have before us a systematic proposal from the Government in regard to the building of factories for munitions of war.We need to have something like an organized policy. Furthermore, rightly or wrongly, the members of the National Parliament of Australia have made up their minds that Canberra is to be the Capital, and something like £800,000 has been spent on buildings, works, sewerage, and water supply there, while a considerable sum has also been spent in the re-purchase of land. Now, unless we are to continue talking in the abstract about our wonderful Capital, and asking when we are going to get there, and what we are going to do to further that end, and unless we are to continue having the development of our Capital a fruitful source of attack directed from the " outs " against the " ins " on the ground that sufficient money has not been spent ; if we are really anxious to settle Canberra, we have now an excellent opportunity of doing something in that direction. If within a few years Canberra is to be a reproductive place, paying interest on the money expended on it, and providing a sinking fund for the repayment of the expenditure, how is that to come about? Is it to be done by making pretty pictures, by delivering speeches about the grandeur of the place, and what will happen there in the future? How are cities built, and how do nations become great? Is it not by the settling of big industrial communities in their midst? When such communities are settled in any place, their so-called " betters " will follow them - an industrial population will never follow its so-called " betters." A certain trading, parasitic community might follow any other settlement; but do we believe in making Canberra a real city, or are we humbugging the people in regard to it? Why, for sixty years, was Washington untenanted except by members of Parliament, officials, and the army of carpet-baggers and lobbyists? </para>

                            <para>- No one would think of establishing works like these in Sydney. The landlords of Sydney would howl loudly enough to wake the dead if the Commonwealth Government proposed to erect workmen's cottages there. We propose, further, to erect forty cottages of five rooms each, for £580 each, and to let them out at 13s. 4d. a week. This is a subject in which I take a special interest. I believe in settling Canberra as quickly as possible, and that can be done only by bringing a busy working population there. The idea of some honorable members is that Canberra shall be merely a fine place, in which aesthetic gentlemen with eyeglasses will promenade with ladies with beautiful parasols, feeding the ducks on the lakes. Under no circumstances would they have a working man there. But the time has arrived for regarding the matter seriously, and if this question is considered without party prejudice, we shall discontinue our now historic muddling. Canberra will be entirely under the control of the Government, Parliament voting, from time to time, such sums as it may consider wise to spend there. At present you cannot open a newspaper  or take a walk without coming across one of these pestilential quacks of town planners. There are men of another class who, for twenty-five years, have been advocating town planning. Such a man, who has written much and spoken much on behalf of the workers of the Old Country, and of Australia too, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chiozza</inline> Money. Take his works on riches and poverty.  His  idea is that in planning a new city you should aim at providing wholesome conditions for a working population, giving them rooms of ample size, and gardens, and space in which their children will grow up strong and healthy. Where existing cities were concerned, he would build the new city alongside the old, and improve conditions in the way I have mentioned. That is the sort of town planner who is a large-hearted man, the town planner who has a soul that feels for the people for whom he is writing and speaking. The mountebank, carpetbag town planner is quite another person. It is not statesmanship, nor practical politics, nor business, nor common sense, but an outrage on reason, to spend money in attempting to do what we cannot do. We cannot do at Lithgow what can be done at Canberra.' I urge the House to agree to the motion. </para>

                        <para>.- My honorable friend was so overwhelmed with his enthusiasm that, in regard to one aspect of this matter, he would appear to be 'quite inarticulate. We listened to the honorable member speaking on every subject under the sun, including military aspects and military judgments subscribed by persons whose military authority was apparently so obscure that their identity could not be disclosed. In the course of a  perambulatory  excursion 'throughout) the world, the honorable gentleman dealt with other cities and other countries, which, when examined, were found by the Minister not to supply the parallel he attempted to convey. From that, he proceeded to the usual flamboyant appeals to statesmanship and common sens®, and every other attribute which the Ministerial statement seemed to be denuded of. Then he besought us to avoid muddling by engaging in a project which, from a business point of view, the Minister has not yet explained to the House. The 'honorable gentleman told us of the cost of establishing factories, but not one word has he told us of the cost of producing rifles. After all, that is the matter with which this House is concerned. The Factory is only a means to an end ; its cost is a temporary matter, which is reflected in the cost of the output of rifles only in the interest and other charges in connexion with the capital account. But the running charges of the Factory are of vital importance. </para>

He gave us no details whatsoever of the cost of producing rifles at the new site; he did not tell us of the cost of materials, or the accessibility of labour; but he appealed to all sorts of prejudices. The one valid argument he put forward was a very insulting one. </para>

                            <para>- I do not mean that it was insulting to ourselves; but, so far as the national city is concerned, his argument was certainly not complimentary, namely, that unless we take factories to the national city at the expense of the taxpayers of Australia, that city will not be peopled. 1 propose to do what the Minister should have done. Without enjoying the same advantages as the Minister has, I shall examine the cost of producing rifles at Canberra. In the first place, I find that coal will be as much the basis of power at Canberra as it is at Lithgow, and I ask the Minister if it is not a fact that at the Lithgow Factory, in July of this year, 450 tons of coal was consumed in connexion with the output of rifles? </para>

                            <para>- Would it be true to say that 100 tons of coal is used in the Factory every week? I think it would. I understand, from men on the spot, that coal at Lithgow costs between 6s. and 7s. per ton.

                            <para>- I do not know what the evidence was, but I know what the fact was. At that time we had not completed the small branch line of railway. which may have reduced the cost of coal at Canberra by a shilling or two; but in round figures the cost of coal at Canberra to-day will be in the vicinity of £1 per ton. In the course of a year 15,000 rifles are turned out at the Lithgow Rifle Factory. In other words, the capacity of the Factory, work ng one shift of eight hours, is i288 rifles per week. The difference in the cost of coal at Canberra and at Lithgow, respectively, is, approximately, 13s. 6d. per ton against the former. We will assume 114 tons to be the weekly consumption of coal. When that extra coal cost is divided by the output of rifles, the result is an added charge of 5s. per rifle for coal alone. I anticipated that the Minister would have dealt with these particulars instead of giving us a lecture about " muddling through." I am anxious to know what is to be the added cost of the rifles produced at Canberra; and I do not care what secret conclaves the honorable member has in the Ministerial room, or what appeals are made to him by officers not to disclose their identity. The Minister stated that, so far as the Factory building was concerned, the principal building material would be concrete. At present, there is no cement at Canberra, and following the ordinary course of cement manufacture, cement will not be produced at Canberra in less than two years. </para>

If the Government propose to delay the construction of this Small Arms Factory until the manufacture of cement has been started at Canberra, this motion might be submitted to this House eighteen months hence - when, possibly, the war will be finished - without involving the project in the very serious disadvantage to which the honorable member for Macquarie has drawn attention. If Canberra cement is to be used for these buildings, do honorable members recognise what the added charge for cement will be? </para>

                            <para>- I tremble to my fingertips, because the honorable member for Denison is to follow me. I admit that the Public Works Committee did consider the cost of building the Factory. The one thing they did not consider was the cost of producing the articles which the Factory is to turn out. The Lithgow Factory is adjacent to the Commonwealth Cement Works, and to the other cement works that are competing with it. lt is in the midst of the cement manufacture of New South Wales, and, one might almost say, of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It ought to be legitimately exercised where unfair prices are being charged. If the Government wish to establish a cement factory in order to reduce the cost of the article for public works, such a factory at Lithgow would be in the area where all the materials for cement manufacture are to be found. Coal and shale, and everything else required for that manufacture are to be had in the immediate neighbourhood. According to the pamphlet which I hold in my hand, the cost of cement at Lithgow is 75s. per ton, that price being due, no doubt, to the proximity of large cement works. At Canberra, on the other hand, cement costs £5 per ton. According to the estimate made by the Director-General years ago, before the recent increases of wages were thought of, the cost of cement manufactured at Canberra would be over £5 per ton. So that this prime essential for factory construction is much cheaper at Lithgow to-day than it will be at Canberra after the Government Factory has been established. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>But my main complaint is that the running charges have been ignored. Everything used at the Factory at Canberra, even including the labour, must be conveyed there. The ordinary practice when starting a factory is to seek a site where raw materials are cheap and labour is accessible. In this instance, however, the Minister is deliberately proposing to establish the Factory at a place where materials are prohibitively dear, and labour is nonexistent. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I do laugh at the attempt to compare an arsenal, which one defends, with an undefended seaport that Huns have bombarded. The great works of Vickers are at Barrow-in-Furness, right on the sea-coast; and there the heaviest battleships of England are building unmolested every day. </para>

It is the turn-out and cheapness of production that governs the location of such great works. Krupps, however, is vitally close to the western frontier; and from a military point of view the situation is, perhaps, the last that would be chosen. But the cheapness of turn-out, and so forth, make up for the added cost of protecting the works. Any factory, public or private, that is not established where the running charges are light fails in competition. This is to be a Government Factory, and it will not be exposed to this universal law of competition. If it were a private factory, it would, at Canberra, be out of existence in a few years; but are we  prepared  to put an additional burden on the backs of the Australian people for ah time in the turn-out of these munitions? We are told by the Minister that the step, if taken, will be irrevocable; and he supports the change because of an idea which in itself is somewhat incoherent. That is the idea of industrial settlement at the Federal City, though that is foreign to the very meaning of a Federal City as understood in this House up to the present time. It is an idea bolstered up by this or that appeal to prejudice; but every appeal fails on closer examination. Did the distinguished and anonymous military authority that the Minister has quoted have the temerity to say that Lithgow was more in danger from the sea than is Canberra? If so, I ask the Minister to go to the Defence Department and ask the officers there which place they would rather have the duty of defending. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- A few moments ago we were assuming that the place must be protected from some sudden onslaught from the sea ; and yet it appears that it is not proposed to have the defence on the sea coast, but that the troops are to be taken to the Factory that is in danger ! We were appealed to by the Minister not to go on "muddling through"; but I ask the honorable gentleman to get rid of a little of his enthusiasm and become clearer in his vision. </para>

                            <para>- All this really does make one a bit cynical. I came into this House expecting to find a higher and purer atmosphere, where ability and disinterestedness would reign supreme; and yet, after fourteen years, I find my friend, the Minister of Home Affairs. He is in a rarer atmosphere; but I want him to think clearly, and not to become choked by that rareness. I ask the honorable gentleman not to press this motion to-day; but, if he does, I hope he will absolutely accept whatever vote the House cares to give. "If the House supports the Minister, misguidedly thinking that it will be to the advantage of the Federal city, I point out that there will be no advantage at all, but that, on the contrary, there will happen what the best lovers of the Capital would dearly like not to see. Further, there will, for all time, be an addition to the cost of turning out rifles, to an extent in regard to which the Minister can give us no information. I have, however, submitted some figures showing that coal alone will be responsible for an increased cost of 5s. per rifle. </para>

Whatever basis we take, we shall find that the change will add, at any rate, shillings to the cost of production; and I strongly urge the House to turn down the proposal, and continue to manufacture rifles at Lithgow, where material and labour are readily accessible. </para>

                            <para>. - I listened with some surprise to the temperate speech of the honorable member for Wentworth. I cannot understand the absence of his usual fire and the language he generally employs towards honorable members on this side. I do not know whether that is due to the atmosphere of the chamber, but it is quite refreshing to hear him speaking in tones so gentle. I was further surprised to hear the honorable member talk about the atmosphere of the Department of Home Affairs, seeing that he himself left that Department not so long ago. The present Minister has, in my opinion, done remarkably well in office, and I do not think that the ex-Minister has scored by his remarks in this connexion. To me it is remarkable that an ex-Minister should not have made himself more conversant with the facts, considering his long experience in Parliament and in office. The other day he charged us with having no business experience. </para>

I should have thought that an ex-Minister would have had all these things at his finger's end. Why did he bring this gentleman from America to develop the Capital, if he was not possessed of that knowledge necessary to enable him to say whether its administration and development were what they should be? The honorable member should be the very last to speak about the ability of any Minister. What ability did he display when he was in office? Only a brief time ago, when he was at the Department, the Government were paying <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith 7s. 6d. a yard for shifting sand; and when he speaks as he has done this afternoon, he throws himself open to such criticism as I am passing in the presence of gentlemen who have come so far to hear him champion their cause. </para>

                                <para>- The day may not be far distant when the honorable member and myself may be fighting side by side in the defence of Australia; and that is the reason I have let him down so lightly; otherwise, I should have dealt with him in a different way. The Works Committee have gone into this question very deeply, and it has been a very trying time, indeed, to me as a member of that Committee. I have had to oppose one of my dearest friends in this House - one of the most able men here - who taught me much as a young member. I have had to throw all personal feeling aside, and do something, not, as he would like, in the interests of the people of Lithgow, but in the interests of the people of Australia. The Committee were desirous of having the best information ; and at great inconvenience to ourselves we visited Lithgow, and invited evidence from every part of that section of Australia. Any one interested had the opportunity to lay their views before the Committee; and the evidence given was weighed calmly, with the result that we arrived at the decision we did. I have here facts supplied to me by the Department, the officials of which know the details from A to Z. Cement is costing 12s. 9d. per cask at Lithgow, a little more than 75s. per ton. At Canberra the cost is 14s. 7d. per cask. Sand at Lithgow is 5s. a ton. It can be obtained at Canberra for the price of carting, say, ls. 6d. a ton. Aggregates at Lithgow are 3s. per ton; at Canberra it can be obtained for carting, ls. 6d. Notwithstanding that cement for the manufacture of concrete is higher at Canberra than at Lithgow, the lower cost of the other ingredients makes concrete cheaper at Canberra than at Lithgow. Speaking with regard to the future, we find, according to a statement dealing with the subject, that cement for the manufacture of one yard of concrete would cost at Lithgow 12s. 6d., at Canberra 14s. 7d. ; aggregate, at Lithgow 4s. 6d., at Canberra ls. 6d. ; mixing, at Lithgow ls. 6d., at Canberra 2s. 3d.; total, at Lithgow 18s. 6d., at Canberra 18s. 4d. Where is the justification for the high figures that the honorable member brought down in order to throw dust in the eyes of other honorable members? The same result will accrue from an analysis of the cost of power. The figures I quote are figures which have been audited by the Auditor-General, and if I am wrong the Auditor-General is also wrong. </para>

                                <para>- It may be that machinery, such as they are now waiting; for at Canberra, is installed at Lithgow. I know that timber for use at Canberra can be obtained from Tasmania, equal to any timber in the world, at 18s. to 20s. per 100 feet - though very little would be used, because the building would be chiefly of concrete. Now we come to the cost of power. At Lithgow what is known in New South Wales as hill coal is used. I am not a coal miner, and I do not know much about the coal of New South Wales, but can it be suggested that this hill coal is of the same value as other coal for steam-producing purposes ? Has the honorable member taken that into consideration ? He also quotes the price of coal at the pit mouth, and not delivered at the Lithgow Factory. </para>

                                <para>- At Canberra the best coal that can possibly be got is being used. It has to be imported, and it costs £1 a ton, but may I explain the effect? A portable engine might be described as " No. 1 "; giving the minimum amount of efficiency from a pound of coal, " No. 2 " could be quoted in referring to the engine and boilers now working at Lithgow, whilst the plant installed at Canberra might, at the same time, be described as " No. 3," which gives double the power of "No. <inline font-style="italic">2."</inline> About 12 per cent, of the power stored up in the fuel is being obtained at the Canberra powerhouse. No higher percentage of power than this is being obtained in any part of Australia, simply because a most up-to-date system has been adopted and the best possible machinery installed. The boilers are fitted with superheaters and mechanical stokers. There is no waste. Everything is regulated as though by clock-work. </para>

                                <para>- Most decidedly it was, and that power now lying dormant will be made use of immediately the Factory is established. It will be possible when the plant is installed to supply electric power at one-third of the price at which the same power could be supplied at Lithgow. The charge for water for condensation purposes at Canberra will be very slight. All that will be required is a small electrical pump to pump up water from the Molonglo River, and it is obvious that with such up-to-date machinery current will be generated at Canberra far more cheaply than one could ever hope to generate it at a place like Lithgow. We have heard a good deal about the difference in the cost of freight as between Lithgow and Canberra. According to figures in my possession, this difference is only a matter of 17s. 9d. a ton. As there are 200 rifles to the ton, the freight from Canberra will amount to about one penny per rifle more than from Lithgow. The cost of living may be higher at Canberra than at Lithgow, but the figures clearly show that there is nothing to warrant the statement that the cost will be 20 per cent, higher, and I have yet to learn that wages will be higher. This cost will be reduced when the population increases, and, in my view, people will prefer to live at Canberra than at Lithgow. </para>

I have lived at Canberra long enough to know what the climate is like, and I can say unhesitatingly that, outside Tasmania, there is no more beautiful climate anywhere. But in dealing with a matter of this kind, let us get down to a basis of national policy and put on one side all these petty local colloquialisms. </para>

                                <para>- I will tell the honorable member if he cannot understand. I am referring to the men who keep themselves wrapped up in little things, and cannot possibly get outside them ; and, seeing that the honorable member knows a bit about Lithgow, I can quite understand his attitude upon this great question. Would that he could go to some of those bigger countries where things are done in a big way. May I bring to his mind the action of the honorable member for Swan in regard to the railway workshops in Western Australia. When their removal was in contemplation, did the right honorable member hesitate, notwithstanding the enormous cost that their removal involved? I have great respect for the right honorable gentleman as the result of his attitude on that question, and after what he has done in Australia in a big way. By his removal of the railway workshops, in the teeth of very severe criticism, I am informed the right honorable member effected a result that has been very beneficial to the State concerned. If the honorable member for Wentworth could only know the name of the gentleman he is criticising when he speaks as he does of the military expert who has expressed an opinion on this subject, he would probably moderate his view. I cannot give the name. I have pledged my word of honour not to divulge it, but I can say that I was both surprised and gratified when I heard his opinion, and 1 am satisfied that Canberra is the most suitable place for a Small Arms Factory. </para>

                                <para>- I have read the evidence. After the recent experience of older nations, I think honorable members will agree that the time has gone when the great munition-producing arsenals of the world should be in the hands of private enterprise. At the end of this terrible war there can be no more 15 percent, dividends on the manufacture of munitions. I hope each Government will accept the responsibility for the manufacture of its own arms and armaments. Let Australia lead the way by the establishment of a Factory in her own territory, away from all outside influences. No person without direct responsibility can in the future have anything to do with the defences of a country, and the establishment of this Factory at Canberra, over which the Government will have complete control, will be the first step in the right direction. It should also be borne in mind that subsidiary factories, that will be adjuncts to the Small Arms Factory, will necessarily be grouped together in a manner that will eventually create one great arsenal at Canberra. I have not time to read what Engineer-Captain Clarkson said with regard to Lithgow, but I know that he declared Lithgow to be unsuitable for the manufacture of big guns, because the land is not sufficiently level. </para>

                        <para class="block">I come now to the question of land for workmen's dwellings, which considerably influenced me in the vote that I gave as a member of the Committee. I have no desire to speak disparagingly of the people of Lithgow; but land-owners there have been doing what land-owners in Australia and elsewhere have long been doing. I found there workmen's homes built on blocks having a frontage of 25 feet, and abutting on unmade streets, which, at the time of my visit, were ankle deep in mud. These long, narrow, single-fronted cottages are likely to prove but the nucleus to .rows of hovels. Not one of them has a front garden of any size, and there is only a narrow side entrance to each of them ; yet the minimum rental is 14s. 6d. a week. They give a return of 8 per cent. net.

                            <para>About three years ago I recommended the resumption of the land extending from the engineer's cottage to Main-street. The price I had in mind at that time was about f 10,000; but since that date building has taken place, and only about two-thirds of that area is now available, at a price of £11,000. There is about 13 acres in that block. </para>

I questioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright</inline> on the subject, and he said that he had not the information at hand, but would obtain and forward it to the Committee. Later on he sent to the secretary a letter giving the names of employees who had purchased land, and that letter is available to honorable members. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright</inline> said that employees had purchased land at Lithgow, and that fifty-five of them had either erected, or were erecting, dwellings thereon. </para>

                                <para>- We were doing our duty to the Commonwealth. But I used those words because I had in mind the fact that when the Bill which created the Public Works Committee was before the House, some honorable members claimed that the Committee would be the means of saving the Commonwealth thousands of pounds. That is what we have tried to do. We have an unlimited area of land at Canberra, and it has been obtained at No. 1 site at £4 10s. an acre, and. at No. 2 site at £5 an acre. On that land we hope to erect workmen's cottages as they should be erected, and as I saw them, not only in Great Britain, but in that part of Europe where the war is now raging - ideal houses in garden cities. The time has gone by when our workmen of Australia, who produce its wealth, should be housed in poorly constructed dwellings. At Canberra we have the facilities for building a garden city equal to the town of Port Sunlight, where I spent a day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lever</inline> told me that he had not considered the pounds, shillings, and pence that the houses  would return him; but that he had considered the welfare of his workmen. Each cottage there has its beautiful little garden, kept in perfect care at a cost of 3d. a garden by the management. Better workmen and better workwomen are thus secured for the factory, and give a better return to those who were so far-seeing as to house them under ideal conditions. Again, at Bournville, I was told that a child eight years of age was 4 inches taller and 2 inches more in chest girth than the child 4 miles away in the slums of Birmingham. Having seen these garden cities, and realized the great advantages they possessed, I readily grasp this opportunity of attempting to create a garden city in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- No; the conditions are not the same at Lithgow. The country is too hilly; and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> the climate is not nearly so good as that at Canberra. To show how deeply the Public Works Committee went into this question, it actually ascertained the number of frosts that occur, and information in regard lo the climatic conditions generally of the two places. The evidence showed that, from a climatic point of view, Canberra is far superior to Lithgow. I think that I have sa'd sufficient on the land question to prove that, from a business point of view, we cannot entertain the idea of buying land at Lithgow, even at £40 an acre, and making roads thereon. I understand that the Government had to make the road leading to the Factory; and if they had to construct streets over the huge area of land that it would be necessary to purchase, they would have to add the cost of it to the rent of the cottages. We hope to erect workmen's cottages at Canberra that will be ideal ; and the evidence quoted by the Minister plainly shows that we shall be in a position to make them available at about 10s. 9d. per week. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, just as work is now proceeding at Canberra by day labour. In competition with the contractor, the departmental cost was 25 per cent, lower than the contractor's tender, and the work is  being carried  out at a cost which is even lower than the estimate. The Department have the plant on the ground, and I am sure that they will build these cottages well within the estimates. In these circumstances, what a splendid deal it will be for the Commonwealth to build the Factory and these workmen's cottages to form the nucleus of the great city which I hope will be created for the people of Australia. We have to develop that Territory, and the only way in which it can be done is by showing our good faith in it, and establishing our own works there. In my opinion, every Commonwealth-owned factory should be situated in that Territory. Speaking from memory, I believe that in the Senate it was unanimously resolved, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McDougall,  that in future all Commonwealth factories should be erected at Canberra. I have been greatly influenced by remarks which I have heard in the Chamber, even from the Leader of the Opposition, who said 'that if this great city is managed rightly, it will not cost the Commonwealth sixpence. Under the conditions under which we are starting it, I do not believe that it will involve any cost to the Commonwealth. Consider the revenue that will be returned by the occupiers. In twenty years' time the sinking fund on these cottages will make them free so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, and instead of the rents increasing owing to unearned increment given to the land by the people who reside upon it going to the landlords, there will be no such thing, because the Commonwealth will not wish to profit by any value added to the land by the people who develop it. Taking all these things into consideration, I had no alternative, as a member of the Public Works Committee, but to agree to its recommendation. I ask any honorable member sitting on the Government side of the House who is true to Labour principles and true to himself whether he can do otherwise than vote as I intend to vote? If he has any ideals for uplifting and bettering the conditions of the workers of Australia, surely he must vote for their accomplishment. Here in this proposal we are endeavouring to put those ideals into practice without any great' outlay falling upon the Commonwealth, while at the same time we shall be developing our Federal City. </para>

                            <para>.- As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I have followed this discussion with a good deal of interest, and I must confess that I have rarely listened to any debate into which quite so much irrelevant matter has been introduced. I do not intend to follow such examples, and I feel that I am under less necessity for elaboration because it appears to me that the whole matter can be brought down  io  one issue, which very singularly seems to have been lost sight of. I desire, in the first place, to ascertain why this proposal has been brought forward; and turning  to the report of the Public Works Committee, which recommends the extension of the small arms manufacturing plant, and the establishment of a factory at Canberra, I find the clue to their activity in the following words: - "It is the desire of the Government to double that output." The present output is 20,000 rifles per annum, and that expression means that the Government desire an output of 40,000 rifles. We have not been told in the Committee's report why the Government desire to increase the output to such an extent, but that, I contend, is the whole point. I also find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> C. Wright, the late manager of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, stated in his evidence that he also had received instructions some time ago from the Minister of Defence to formulate plans for the extension of the Factory. That is another indication that the Government desire to extend the Factory. But again we are left in the dark as to why they desire to extend it. The motion proposed by the Minister of Home Affairs to-day reads - "That in view of the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, it is desirable that a Small Arms Factory, with necessary provision for housing workmen, be erected forthwith at Canberra." That is to say, the Public Works Committee understands that the Government desire to extend the Factory, and reports accordingly, and now the Minister of Home Affairs proposes a motion, which says, in effect, that because the Public Works Committee recommended this extension of the Factory, the work should be proceeded with. Thus it seems to me we are going round in a vicious circle. </para>

                                <para>- But still we return to the beginning of the circle from which, we started. Again, I would point out that the House has not been given reasons why the enlargement of the Small Arms Factory is desirable or necessary. We are told that the Government desire to increase the output of rifles to 40,000 per annum. I make bold to say that no suggestion to increase the small arms manufacturing machinery would have been made from any quarter if we were not engaged in war. Therefore this proposal is the outcome of the war - an illogical outcome, because we are all agreed that it will be impossible for us to produce rifles with this new equipment in time for such rifles to be used during this war. At least the common hope and opinion is that the war will be concluded before the eighteen months or two years have expired, which will be the time necessary to install the additional machinery. So that the increase of the output to 40,000 rifles per annum has nothing whatever to do with the present war. Then, will the Minister of Home Affairs tell me that when the war is over we shall require to produce rifles at the rate of 40,000 per annum? We certainly shall not. It must be recollected that we shall re-start our home defence with a reserve of probably 100,000 rifles brought back by the troops when they return from the front. </para>

                                <para>- Many of the rifles taken to the front-by the Australian troops will require to be replaced, but not at the rate of 40,000 per annum, even allowing for the future extension of our home defence system. Then, again, by working two shifts instead of one, we can, with the present equipment at the Lithgow Factory, approach very near to an annual output of 40,000 rifles, and we shall be able, witheut the installation of further machinery, to overtake all the requirements of Australia in the matter of small arms. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright,</inline> the late manager of the Factory, has been quoted by the Minister of Home. Affairs as a strong witness in favour of the proposed extension. When that gentleman was before the Public Accounts Committee he was asked what was the probable life of the machinery which, his firm had installed at the Lithgow Factory, and he gave us to understand that, judging from the life of similar machinery elsewhere, that installed at Lithgow would last about twenty-five years. When asked later to state his reasons for opposing the double shift, he stated, amongst other things, that the double shift would wear out the machinery much more quickly. What worth is the evidence of such a gentleman who could put forward a paltry reason of that sort to justify his attitude of hostility  to the double shift. This gentleman declared that the double shift was impossible and impracticable, although it is now in operation, and he, with the tolerance of the Minister of Defence, hindered Australia in regard to the supply of small arms for eight or nine months. I say, without the slightest hesitation, that, in my opinion, the reason why this gentleman has supported the proposal to duplicate the machinery at Lithgow or at Canberra was simply his desire to take back to America an order for that machinery. </para>

                                <para>- I cannot find in that gentleman's evidence any substantial reasons for duplicating the machinery in order to double the output of rifles. By initiating the second shift at Lithgow we have practically duplicated the output already, whereas, by the proposal now before the House, we shall only have the output doubled after the necessity for so doing has passed away. After this war -one of the first things that will be undertaken by the British authorities will be "the substitution of another rifle for that which is now in use. They had almost arrived at a decision on that point when the war broke out, and, in view of what the war has taught us in regard to the necessity for rapid fire, it is more than likely that the British military authorities will turn their attention to an automatic rifle, which, perhaps, will be in the nature of a compromise between the existing rifle and a quick-firing gun. Whatever may be their decision in that regard, it is perfectly certain that the rifle we are now producing at Lithgow, and for an increased output of which we are asked to authorize the expenditure of £150,000, will be obsolete practically as soon as the war is over. Why, therefore, we should spend money on the equipment of a factory to produce an obsolete rifle passes my understanding altogether. I contend that no .nod and substantial reason has been shown why the equipment of the Factory at Lithgow should be duplicated either there or at Canberra, and, that being so, it is quite obvious that this proposal should fall to the ground. We do not desire to" spend this money needlessly, even though it might have the delightful result anticipated by the Minister of Home Affairs of establishing a considerable industrial population at Canberra. The accession of such a population to the Capital city might be very desirable, but it is quite probable that we could establish a population at Canberra, equal in numbers and importance, by some other method than the wasting of money on the equipment of a Factory, the output' of which will be obsolete in a few years. </para>

                                <para>- That is possible. It is an idea that has not hitherto occurred to me, though the honorable member may have some objection on that ground. I am inclined to think that a mixed population would be no disadvantage even to Canberra. However, that is rather apart from the question. Unless the Government can show reason for doubling the machinery in use at present, there is no justification whatever for going to Canberra to erect another Factory, just as there would be no justification whatever for increasing the amount of machinery even at Lithgow. </para>

                                <para>- No one has ever said that the bayonet would be obsolete, except one or two theorists who undoubtedly misled some military authorities in various parts of the world. I am not saying that all rifles will be obsolete, but merely that the particular rifle with which our troops are now armed will be, and, as a matter of fact - though I did not wish to refer to this - it is by competent authorities regarded as the least effective of all the European rifles in the field at the present time. The honorable member for Herbert may not have heard me say that just about- the outbreak of the war the British authorities had all but determined on a new rifle. It is quite certain, therefore, that as soon as the war is over, and in view of what military authorities have learnt regarding the nature of modern warfare, a change will be made. I take it that we should rest on our oars at present in this regard, and content ourselves with turning out the maximum number of rifles at the present Factory to meet our requirements. We cannot in the next two years add, by new machinery, to the output of rifles, even if we spend three times the proposed sum on the equipment of a new Factory, and after the war is over there will be no necessity for any output over and above that of which the present Factory is capable. </para>

                                <para>- I will deal with that at once. So far as the evidence would allow us to make up our minds on the question, we had regard to the natural increase of population, and the development of our Citizen Forces, along with the development of the rifle club system throughout Australia. We believed that it was desirable, not only to have a sufficient output to supply the requirements of such development, but also to build up a reserve that might prove necessary at any time. I may say that, while we believe that three shifts should be worked at Lithgow - and we are very glad that the Government have at last decided to work the machinery full time - the evidence that was tendered to the Committee was generally in support of having machinery sufficient to enable one shift to be worked normally. If the new machinery is purchased and the present Factory is doubled in size, it will enable the production of 40,000 rifles per annum with an eight-hour shift. We understand that that one shift is the usual time worked in the various factories of the United States, Europe, and England. </para>

None of us can foresee how many rifles will come back from the war in good condition; but we know that, with a proper development of our rifle club system, we shall require 55,000 rifles in order to provide those clubs with proper equipment. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. We favour the policy of compelling every member of the Citizen Forces, on reaching the termination of his training at the age of twenty-six, to go into a rifle club as a kind of reserve, and to undergo compulsory shooting practice for a certain number of days per annum. We understand that the Government are favorable to such a policy, which would mean 13,000 or 15,000 rifles a year for members of the Citizen Forces so drafted into the clubs. It will require, as I say, 55,000 to bring our rifle clubs to a proper condition in the matter of equipment; and then we have to allow for a large increase in rifle club membership after the war is over. In Switzerland, at the present time, where there is a population less than that of Australia, there are 220,000 or 230,000 members of rifle clubs, as against a membership of 70,000 or 78,000 in Australia. It will be seen, therefore, that there is any amount of room for expansion in this regard. The two items of 13.000 rifles a year for members of the Citizen Forces who pass into the rifle clubs, and 15,000 rifles to supply the average increase in the Citizen Forces, together with the normal extension of the club system, show us at once that the capacity of the Factory of 40,000 rifles with one shift is not too great. It is no use cheese-paring ; we must look to the future, and even at the cost of a few thousand pounds for machinery, we should have, not only enough for our normal requirements, but some machinery in reserve if we are to use the Factory for turning out machine guns and other armament in addition to rifles. </para>

                        <para class="block">Committee in reference to the Small Arms Factory. 1 am not at all opposed to the Canberra site. I believe that the idea of establishing a Factory at Canberra, and having housing accommodation for the workmen, is a good one; and if no Factory had been built, I should have been inclined to favorably consider the proposal to establish one there. But my objection is that at this time the closest economy is necessary in our public expenditure. It is proposed to establish a Factory, with workmen's homes as an essential part of the scheme; and, according to the Minister, the Government are going to expend something over £250,000 to accomplish what could be accomplished equally well by doubling the size of the present Factory. </para>

                                <para>- A time of war, when we are spending millions, is not the proper time to enter into a great housing scheme such as that proposed at Canberra. Such a scheme can very well wait; and I do not think we ought to launch into experiments of this character under the present circumstances. There is already a Factory at Lithgow employing about 800 hands. The single men are drawn from the present population of 10,000 or 11,000, and do not require to be provided for in the way of houses, while the married men are solving the problem for themselves by purchasing blocks and building their own homes. My personal opinion is that the Government could help to solve the problem at Lithgow a little more rapidly. For instance, we could spend a few thousands in the purchase of land ; and we have it on the authority of the honorable member for Macquarie that 100 acres adjacent to the Factory can be purchased at the small rate of £40 an acre, representing a few shillings a foot. I do not think there is anything to choose between the two sites, both of them being sufficiently inland. But if we take the history of Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, and the United States, we find that in  nearly  every instance such factories are established close to large centres of population. I do not wish to quote evidence too extensively, but merely to give an epitome of that presented to the Committee by those competent to speak on the subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright's</inline> evidence was quite unsatisfactory to my mind. He placed obstacles iri the way of three shifts being worked, and this, in my opinion, largely discounts his evidence on almost every question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright,</inline> however, argued that Lithgow was not a good site, though he had no objection to the climate; his chief objection to Lithgow was that it was distant from large centres of population, where labour could be obtained without any trouble. </para>

                                <para>- That was in reply to a question regarding the working of three shifts; but we now know that the people of Lithgow have risen to a sense of their responsibilities, and have thrown their homes open to workmen in order that rifles may be more rapidly produced in this period of national emergency. But the plain position is this: According to estimates submitted by engineers of the Home Affairs Department, it will cost £92,000 to erect at Canberra a Factory twice the size of that at Lithgow, and it will also cost about £100,000 to erect workmen's homes within the Territory. That is not all. New machinery will cost £40,000. The social and educational requirements of this community will have to be attended to. Schools and places of amusement will have to be established; and in my view the expenditure will not- stop at £250,000. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking of the large expenditure that will be necessary at this stage if we are to attain the results we have in view. The one object of the inquiry by the Public Works Committee, just as the one object of this debate, is to solve the problem of turning out an increased number of rifles. We already have at Lithgow a Factory established at a cost of nearly £200,000, and all that is necessary to double the output there is an expenditure of a further £100,000 or less, in buildings and plant. The cost of enlarging the existing Lithgow Factory to twice its present size will be £56,000; additional machinery will cost £40,000, making, roughly, the £100,000 to which I have just referred. </para>

                                <para>- I am not considering raw material at all. For the expenditure of an additional £40,000 on machinery, we shall have all the equipment necessary to turn out twice the number of rifles that are now being turned out. I am largely in sympathy with the idea that the Commonwealth should establish its own factories at Canberra; and if, in the future, factories of any description are to be established, they may very properly be established in the Federal Territory. The Director-General of  Public  Works has a proposal whereby the Lithgow Factory, if it is abandoned as a Small Arms Factory, can be used for the manufacture of vehicles. </para>

                                <para>- I am not discussing that aspect of the question at all. What I say is, why, if the Government is desirous of establishing a Factory for the manufacture of vehicles, does it not propose to establish such a Factory now at Canberra rather than drag away all the machinery that is now working satisfactorily at Lithgow ? It should also be borne in mind that considerably over 100 men have already made their homes at Lithgow, where there is growing up a mechanically-trained population that can be drawn upon for purposes of the Factory whenever the occasion demands. These people have made their homes at Lithgow. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know whether honorable members propose to look lightly at the vested interests of nearly 150 workmen, most of them married, who have established their homes at Lithgow. , If that is what their policy of State Socialism means, it seems to me that it is a very destructive policy. I have already stated that the witnesses before the Public Works Committee most competent to express an opinion upon this subject were against this removal. Captain Clarkson was one of them. Captain Clarkson said he did not consider Lithgow was a good site, not for the reasons that have been quoted during this debate, but because the site was not near enough to a large industrial population. </para>

                            <para>I further objected to the site because Lithgow is so far away from any large centre of population, and I thought that the labour difficulty would become very acute. Had I had my way, I should have had the Factory near Melbourne or Sydney. There wa"s great difficulty in regard to the supply of labour up to the time I severed my connexion with the place. We were, however, more fortunate than I thought we should have been, because at the time the Factory was started Hoskins' works were closed, and, therefore, we found more labour at our disposal. </para>

                            said very much the same thing - that the site is not a good one chiefly because it is not near enough to some industrial population. If it be a fact that the Lithgow site is a bad one because it is not near to a large centre of population, Canberra must be an even worse site, for the reason that it has no industrial population at all, so that from that stand-point it would be a mistake to move the Factory

                            Canberra. After he had visited the proposed site at Canberra,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright</inline>
                            agreed that in course of time it might pay to remove the Factory.  His  evidence on that point was as follows : - ' lt is very difficult to say whether by the establishment of a Factory at Canberra that would have twice the output of the existing Factory at Lithgow, and which might  undertake also the manufacture of artillery, it would be possible to save in economy of manu- 0 facture and administration an amount equivalent to the interest cost of the buildings at Lithgow. I can say that it would not require a very large increase of staff to run a Small Arms Factory that would have three times the output of the existing Factory. The managerial expenses would probably not bc any larger, and working with larger quantities and increased facilities there might bc a considerable reduction in the cost of manufacture. But to give a direct answer to your question, I should require to carefully weigh the possibilities on both sides. When I am asked whether the establishment of all these Factories at Canberra, with three times the number of hands, would lead to a saving which would compensate for the abandonment of the present building at Lithgow, I may say that I think in course of time it would.

                        <para>That is the only part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright's</inline> evidence that can be taken as in any way showing that he was favorable to the transfer of the Factory from Lithgow, and it is an opinion that honorable members will see is very full of qualifications, one of which is that the Factory must be three times as great as the one it is now proposed to establish at Canberra. Whatever may be our ideas regarding Canberra in the future, whatever decision the Government may come to as to the establishment of factories at Canberra, the present is not the time to incur heavy expenditure by pulling down an existing factory. </para>

                                <para>- If that argument is a good one, why should not the Government establish any new factory it has in mind at Canberra, leaving the Lithgow Factory as it is? The Government, apart from workmen's homes and machinery, are proposing an expenditure of £100,000 in establishing this Factory at Canberra. For this expenditure there is no warrant. It will not lead to a greater output of rifles. On the contrary, the transfer of the Factory for a time will involve, to a certain extent, a cessation of manufacturing. </para>

                                <para>- An arsenal can be established at Canberra without loss even if the Small Arms Factory be allowed to remain at Lithgow. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> McKay, the manager of the Sunshine Harvester Works, gave evidence before the Public Works Committee that a factory employing 1,000 hands is a complete unit and quite large enough for any one administration to manage economically. He stated that his factory employs about 1,000 hands, and that it is quite large enough for one man to manage successfully and economically. To go beyond that limit to any great extent means an increase rather than a decrease in the cost of administration, the larger responsibility being beyond the reasonable control of one administrative staff. By removing the Factory to Canberra we shall incur an expenditure of £250,000 at least in total outlay, at a time when economy should be practised and will not secure any greater economy of management. If other munition factories are to be established at Canberra, they will be separate units requiring separate administration. There is no likelihood of the cost of production being reduced by removing the Small Arms Factory to Canberra; on the contrary, there is a chance of the annual cost being increased. I doubt if it will be possible to supply water there as cheaply as at Lithgow. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so, but I doubt if it will be possible to supply it as cheaply as at Lithgow. Then, again, coal will be dearer at Canberra. It seems rather extraordinary that it should be said to be possible to erect at Canberra a factory double the size of that at Lithgow at one-half the cost. I shall not discuss this question from a party or Socialistic stand-point. </para>

                                <para>- This is  Colonel Owen's  scheme, and naturally he is in favour of it. Those most competent to express an opinion on the subject are men who have had experience in dealing with small arms factories, or similar establishments involving organizing capacity. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> told us that, even if the transfer of the Factory to Canberra meant an increased expenditure of only £28,000, he would not favour it. Leaving out of consideration the cost of the workmen's homes, I believe that the increased expenditure will be between £30,000 and £40,000. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. He visited factories in Germany, Belgium, the United States of America, and Great Britain, and coming back with a vast storehouse of knowledge said that, while he did not consider Lithgow the best site, for the reason that it did not comprise a large industrial population, he held the view that the Factory should not be shifted. He did not think that Canberra was a better site. On the evidence given before the Committee, the proposal to remove the Factory is not sound from a business stand-point. It means an expenditure of £150,000, which is not warranted, and even after incurring that expenditure we should be in a rather worse position than before, so far as the rapid output of rifles is concerned. The transfer will interfere with the manufacture of rifles at a time when a rapid output is demanded to serve the requirements of our troops. </para>

                                <para>- The question raised by the honorable member is rather an important one. Is it to be understood that an honorable member, on becoming a member of a Parliamentary Committee, gives up his right to discuss in the House questions of public interest dealt with by that Committee ? This is not a case in which members of the Committee are disagreeing in the House with a decision that was unanimously arrived at. Our votes are recorded in the minutes of the proceedings of the Committee. Six members of the Committee voted for the removal of the Factory to Canberra, whilst the remaining three members, after failing to carry an amendment that the Factory should remain at Lithgow, and should be increased to twice its present size, voted against the recommendation to remove it. In these days, public economy should be our first consideration. We are expending tens of millions of pounds in the prosecution of the war, and, in the circumstances, seeing that the removal of the Factory .to Canberra will not expedite, but really retard, the production of rifles, I think the House will be slow to vote for the additional expenditure which this proposal will involve. </para>

                            (Hunter) [8.401.- I desire briefly to justify the vote that I propose to give on this question. At the outset I should like to say that Committees appointed by this Parliament must be divested of all party colour. A decision having been arrived at by the Committee, that decision must be submitted to the House, and it is for honorable members to agree or disagree with it. Having had occasion to visit Lithgow as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, which inquired into the financial aspects of the Factory, I am perhaps in as good a position as is any honorable member to deal with this question. I hold the view that any Commonwealth factory about to be established should be erected in the Federal Territory, but a factory having been established outside that Territory, I have to consider very carefully whether it would be wise to remove it.

                            <para>- Not at all; but I believe that we should find employment if we can for the people of the Territory. This Factory having been established at Lithgow, the question we have to consider is whether, by removing it to Canberra or elsewhere, we are likely to reduce the cost of its product. The first consideration that appeals to me in dealing with any factory is whether or not it is manufacturing at the lowest possible cost. That. I contend, is a business consideration which cannot be ignored. Up to the present time the Small Arms Factory has not given the results that were anticipated. I am glad to say that it has improved  considerably  of late, and, I believe, is still improving; but the cost of producing rifles is still greater than it should be. The people of the Commonwealth should not be called upon to pay for rifles manufactured at the Lithgow Factory more than is sufficient to insure to the workmen engaged there a fair return for their labour. We should insure to the workmen engaged in the Factory a fair wage, and, subject to that consideration, should not be called upon to pay more for our rifles than the price at which they could be imported. I have carefully examined the evidence given before the Public Works Committee, and, with the exception of that given by two officers of the Public Works Department, have not been able to find anything that is favorable to the removal of this Factory at the present time. All the witnesses appear to have arrived at the conclusion I formed while at Lithgow, namely, that whether the site was suitable or not at the time the Factory was established, it would be unwise now to make a change. A proposal to extend the Factory is totally different from a proposal to remove it altogether. If we were about to establish this Factory, I should vote against the selection of the Lithgow site, because I do not think it is the best place in Australia for a rifle factory; but, since the Factory has been established there, to remove it to Canberra would mean adding to the cost of our rifles. I have taken from the report of the Committee figures which support my contention. It states that to establish this Factory at Canberra, we should have to expend £92,100, whereas, to extend the Factory at Lithgow, we should have to expend £66,000. There is thus a difference of £26,100 in favour of extending the present Factory. It is accepted by the Auditor-General "that 7£ per cent, should be allowed", as the general average, for depreciation. Allowing for 7£ per cent, on that £26,100, we arrive at an additional annual depreciation charge of £1,892. Further, an interest charge of 4 per cent, has to be borne by the Factory, which would mean an additional annual charge of £1,044. Thus the additional annual charge for depreciation and interest that a new factory at Canberra would have to bear over an extension of the Lithgow Factory would be £2,936. Seeing that the rifles already cost so much, and that it is necessary to reduce that cost, I cannot feel that I would be warranted in voting for a proposal that would make for increasing the cost of these rifles. My desire is to see everything produced from Commonwealth factories at the cheapest possible rate commensurate with the payment of good wages to the employees, but it does not appear to me that we would'be justified in accepting the proposal put forward. Every one with a knowledge of working the Factory who has given evidence says that he cannot recommend the removal of the Factory - that, seeing it has already been established, its removal would not be the right thing to do ; and the only two witnesses who are favorable to the removal to Canberra are officers of a publicDepartment. Very often officers of public Departments do not take the cost of things into consideration. They desire to see certain steps taken, and they report accordingly, and the thing is accomplished, only to find often that the cost has been considerably higher than the estimate. I venture to say that in this case their estimate will be considerably exceeded. The Lithgow Factory has cost double the estimate submitted by the departmental officers, and it is quite possible that if we remove the Small Arms Factory to Canberra we shall have to double the present estimate. Therefore, from the point of view of economy, we are not justified in voting for the removal. These are days when we should cut down expenditure as much as we possibly can. The Minister says that his Department will be in a position to build workmen's dwellings at a cost of £580, and let them at lis. a week. He must have made a mistake, or he is not allowing for sufficient rental on the capital outlay, because it is a recognised fact in connexion with buildings that a return of about 8 per cent, is necessary in order to allow for depreciation, renovation, and interest, and a rental of lis. a week will work out at about 5 per cent. To let a house costing £580 at lis. per week will not provide for depreciation, interest, and renovation. I intend to vote for keeping the Factory at Lithgow. From my own point of view, and from the fact that the removal to Canberra would add ls. lid. to the cost of each rifle, 1 am not justified in voting for the motion. If the output of rifles remains at 30,000 per year, even at the estimate ' submitted by the Department, the increased cost of producing a rifle would be ls. lid. Consequently- I vote in favour of keeping the Factory at Lithgow. </para>

                            <para>. - I am glad that after attention has been called in the House to the matter, and after inquiry has been made by two Committees of the House, the Government have at last decided that, in the best interests of the country, it is necessary 'to make available to the people of Australia a larger output of rifles. There can be no two opinions as to the advisability of doing so. In asking the House to consider this matter, I want to take them back a little to when it was first originated. There are honorable members now in the House who remember the motion which was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, the then Minister of  Defence, for the establishment of a Small Arms Factory. The reason which was given then, and which was adopted by the House at the time, and since bv the country, was that the Commonwealth should be self-contained in regard to the output of small arms, and the Government of the day decided that a Small Arms Factory should be established, and the Minister of Defence selected Lithgow as the site for it. At the time it was felt that for financial reasons it would be impossible to do everything that was desirable to make the plant accomplish all that would be required and as at that time we were only feeling our way in defence matters, it was decided to despatch a responsible officer to make inquiries as to what would be the prospects of establishing the smallest complete factorv, consistent with economy, that would be a self-contained one. It was ultimately decided that a factory with an output of 50 rifles a day would be most likely to meet the exigencies of the case from an economical, as well as an experimental, point of view, and estimates were submitted to the House as to the cost of that factory and as to what it would be likely to produce, and also as to what would be the cost of the output. On the estimates submitted at that time the money of the people was spent, and today, on similar premises, the Minister of Home Affairs asks us to agree to build another factory on estimates. I wish to give honorable members some proof of the value that we can place on some of these estimates, so that we shall not go blindly into the matter or without guidance from previous experience. At that time we were told that a self-contained Small Arms Factory, with an output of fifty rifles per day, could be built for £92,144; but the investigations made by the Committee of Public Accounts show that up to the 30th June last the cost of the Factory was £182,046, or an increase of 98 per cent, on the estimated cost. If the estimates now submitted by the Minister of Home Affairs are no closer to the actual cost than those were, though they should be based largely on the experience gained at Lithgow, I am afraid to venture on the experiment of establishing a new factory. It was claimed that by establishing a Small Arms Factory we could not only produce the rifles in the Commonwealth, but also turn them out at £3 9s. Id. each, as against £4 5s. each that we were paying to import them, the argument being advanced that we would save 15s. lid. on each rifle made in the Commonwealth, and on that argument the people's money was spent; but from that point of view the actual results are very disappointing. I am scarcely at liberty to talk about the output of the Factory at Lithgow, but I am safe in saying that the estimated output has been reached. However, the cost of the rifle is about twice the estimated cost. The Public Accounts Committee made inquiries as to why the rifles should cost so much, and as to whether there was any way in which that cost could be reduced. As put very ably just now by the honorable member for Hunter, who is  Chairman  of that Committee, one matter more than anything else that we should emphasize at the present time is the need for economy. We need rifles, but we want to get them at the cheapest possible price. The Public Accounts Committee devoted itself largely to discovering means by which the rifles could be produced at a price approximating to the estimate. One reason given to the Committee for the high cost of the rifles was that the Factory was too small. We were told by the manager and the assistant manager, both of whom are experts, that a factory, to be complete, must contain a certain proportion of plant which was not required to be used during the whole of the working hours, and consequently, while one side of the Factory is busily engaged, another side is practically idle. Their contention was that the most economical way to extend the output of the Factory would be to increase certain parts of the machinery. These witnesses told the Committee that it was not necessary to duplicate the whole of the plant in order to double the output of rifles, and from their evidence it is clear that the proposal now before the House is not the most economical method of increasing the output. The proposal that seems to be most in the minds of honorable members is to duplicate the present factory, either by doubling the establishment at Lithgow or erecting a second factory at Canberra. According to the experts, neither course is necessary, and I shall occupy the House for a few minutes by the quotation of portions of the evidence bearing on that point. The assistant manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe,</inline> was asked by the  Chairman  - 673. Have all the machines in each section been working eight hours a day since the inception of the Factory, or have some been idle during part of the time? - Some have been idle during part of the time. 674. Would that idleness interfere with the output of completed rifles? - In some cases it would, and in others it would not. The point that I wish to make is that the operations on some components are lengthy, while others are of short duration. Take the case of a component on which there are 100 operations or more. Some of those operations can be done at the rate of 500 a day, while in respect of others only fifty a day can be performed. Then, again, some parts can be turned out at the rate of 1,000 a day. When we have a number of parts to manufacture, we subdivide the work, determine how we are going to manufacture, and lay out a number of machines. In the case of one operation we are able to do, say, only twenty-five a day on one machine, and we, therefore, put down two machines for that job. By-and-by we come to an operation which can be done on the one machine at the rate of fifty an hour; but we cannot subdivide the machine, and we must have it in the Factory, whether we need to use it one hour or eight hours a day. You must observe the ratio of the rate of production to the ratio of the producing unit, which is the machine. What may take a day in respect of certain operations on one machine may be done in two hours, perhaps, in the case of operations on another machine, so that the latter machine must be idle for some part of the day. 675. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Backhap.</inline> - And the men attending upon them must also be idle? - No. We have to transfer the men to some other operation. Where we have a plant capable of producing only fifty rifles a day, there must necessarily be some machines that cannot be utilized to their full capacity, while others have to be used to their fullest producing power. 676. So that the whole plant would not have to be duplicated in order to secure an increased production? - That is so. In putting down a plant you must have regard to such an output as is economical to manufacture. By increasing the capacity of your plant, you keep your machines more fully employed. In factories with a production of several hundred rifles a day, to a large extent, the machinery is grouped by what is known as the component system. </para>

                        <para>The evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe</inline> shows that one section of the Factory is not kept fully employed, whilst other sections are working up to the maximum capacity. He was further asked - 1254. Has the failure to secure that steady flow interfered with the production of rifles'? - It has, to a certain extent. Some components have to run a long way before they can be handed over to another section; so that a machine may lay idle for months before the work relating to it can be reached. </para>
                        <para>By <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atkinson</inline> he was asked - </para>

                            <para>Is there any other cause of delay which you have not mentioned? - The plant is not large enough; the number of machines being insufficient. The wood room and the barrel department are self-contained, and in respect of them there should be no trouble, but where you have components floating from one section to another, the cost of transit amounts annually to a considerable sum. If you were to examine a chart showing the various parts of this Factory over which a component travels in course of manufacture, you would imagine that you were looking at a network of telegraph wires. At Enfield even a stranger can stand at the first machine on which an operation is performed upon a component, and follow that component without any guidance through the factory to the point where it is finished. There a component docs not touch the floor. It is handed from machine to machine, and each machine is numbered. </para>

                        <para>The last quotation I shall make from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe's</inline> evidence is as follows - 1319. You suggest that the plant is too small to permit of a continuous and uninterrupted flow of components? - Exactly. In these charts I have endeavoured to time-table every process. I also produce a chart showing how machine capacities can be utilized. Theoretically, there is a means of providing for a continuous flow of work; but every little contingency, such as a breakage of tools, or some other unforeseen delay, makes it impossible in practice. </para>
                        <para>I turn now to the evidence of the manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright.</inline> He was asked - 1971. If the contract had been for 100 rifles a day, instead of fifty, would not that have enabled you to get better results? - Far better. 1972. Is the smallness of the output a disadvantage in co-ordinating the work? - Most decidedly. </para>

                            <para>Can you suggest anything to reduce the cost? - The first thing I should recommend is to double or treble the plant, and bring it up to 150 guns a day. 2018. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline><inline font-style="italic">Thomson.- Why</inline> do you think the price might be reduced in that way? - Because of the larger quantities going through, and easier organization. A staff for 150 guns would not be much more expensive than a staff for fifty. The plant we had first would not have been sufficient to supply even the cadets maturing from year to year. 2019. Would better grouped machines add to the output? - They cannot be grouped in a different way under present circumstances. If the plant was increased <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> 200 per cent., as I would like to see it, you would get a better distribution of the machinery and better supervision. 2020. Can any material alteration or improvement be made while the Factory is restricted to its present capacity? - I do not think so. 2021. How many additional men would be required to work a double shift? - About 350. 2022. If they could be found, and you could turn out twice the number of rifles, would you recommend that they should be engaged? - I would recommend doubling or trebling the plant rather than working a double shift. 2023. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler.</inline> - Would it not be cheaper to double the staff than to increase the machinery? - If you increased the staff, and kept only the same machines, you would double the wear on them. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">If the Minister is anxious to increase the output of rifles, and to make the best possible use of the money already expended, he should arrange to increase certain sections of the Factory so as to extend the capacity of those portions which are now engaged in major operations, and so keep continuously running the machines employed in minor operations. By this policy a great deal of money could be saved, and we should obtain results at a far earlier date than is possible by any other means. I hope the Minister will seriously consider this matter, and before proceeding with the erection of a factory at Canberra, consider whether the country would not be better served by increasing certain parts in the Factory at Lithgow than by doubling the existing plant at Lithgow, or duplicating it at some other centre, where an additional staff would be required for supervision, thus adding to the already high cost of the article. In the small Factory at Lithgow the expense of supervision is a considerable item in the cost of producing the rifle. The material put into the rifle is worth only about 14s. 6d., and yet the Government are paying over <inline font-style="italic">£7</inline> apiece for the rifles. A factory with a larger output, say, of 150 rifles per day, could be managed and supervised with the same staff as a factory producing fifty rifles per day. Lithgow possesses real advantages as a site for a small arms factory. I am not going to say that it is an ideal place for such an establishment. Nevertheless, the Factory having been established there for reasons which were considered sufficiently good at the time, and having regard to the local supplies of coal and steel, and the accessibility of the place from a strategic point of view, the Government should hesitate about transferring the Factory from that spot. </para>

                                <para>- So far as the extension of the Factory is concerned, there is no doubt that the necessary land is obtainable at Lithgow. At this time we require all the rifles that can be made available, and we need to husband our resources, not only in rifles, but also in finance; and if there is any means by which the Minister can bring about a satisfactory result with the least expenditure of money, it is his bounden duty to adopt it. I have sufficient confidence in the present Minister of Home Affairs to believe that he will thoroughly investigate this matter. If the present plant is supplemented in the manner I have outlined, at a cost much less than the estimate for duplicating the plant at Canberra, a substantial increase in the output of rifles will be obtained. </para>

                                <para>- I think it is. At the same time, it is quite apparent from the statements made by  Ministers,  and from the evidence given before the Public Works Committee by the Government experts, that there was a solid body of opinion on the part of Government officials that this Factory should be transferred to Canberra. If that is so, it is a most unfortunate thing that in the reference of this subject by Parliament to the Public Works Committee the question of the transfer of the Factory to Canberra was not definitely and specifically set forth. I venture to say that had it been proposed to make this reference to the Public Works Committee an altogether different view would have been taken of it. As a general proposition, I believe in the establishment of Commonwealth works in the Federal Territory, so that the expenditure of public moneys may enhance Commonwealth property, instead of adding to the incomes of private persons. At the same time, the Government, in putting forward a proposal which had in it, as they knew, the germ of an idea for upsetting the whole of the arrangements of the working of the present Factory, could not have made a bigger blunder. </para>

A representative committee of the residents have been putting what they call their side of the case before members of this House; and the honorable gentleman must know that the Factory workmen have made arrangements for the purchase of land and the building of homes. He must further know that the youths employed in the Factory have their local family ties, and that the removal of a great Factory like this, employing such a body of men, must create a very disturbed feeling in the town, particularly amongst those immediately connected with the works. For the purposes of the present war we require the greatest possible increase in the output of riflesnow. </para>

                                <para>- Even if it were eighteen months, it seems impossible for the war to last so long. Any one who has looked into the financial aspect of the question must feel almost startled to think of the possibilities for the Allies if the war were to continue for that length of time, with the  present  rate of expenditure. Previous wars offer no parallel; and it would appear that by the end of eighteen months all would be bankrupt. I notice from, the American newspapers that a large order from the Russian Government was refused because the American people were not satisfied as to the means of payment,, and a large order from the French Government was held up for a considerable time for the same reason, showing that there is financial embarrassment even at the present time. </para>

                        <para>As pointed out by the honorable member for Macquarie, there is at present lying idle at Randwick, Sydney, a great plant capable of producing a vastly increased output of rifles. The Government could have utilized this plant, which is idle largely because of their lack of action. We have now to meet an emergency situation; and even if the war did continue for a longer period than two years, there would be plenty of time for us afterwards to make permanent arrangements of the kind now proposed. </para>
                        <para>In  the meantime the employees at Lithgow have arranged to work double shifts, aud the townspeople regard it as an obligation on them to co-operatively make the best arrangements they can for assisting the Government to obtain an increased output. If ever there was a time when this Factory, and the people there, should have been left undisturbed, it is now. </para>

It would thus be possible to obtain an indorsement of some Government scheme by methods other than those provided by law. What redress would honorable members have under such circumstances? </para>

A statement recently made by the Prime Minister left the impression that it was the intention of the Government to have one plant at Lithgow and another at Canberra, but the Minister has now made it clear that this is not the case. When the proposal for the extension of the present Factory came before the Public Works Committee, estimates were submitted showing that the cost would be £45,000. Various matters affecting the Factory were dealt with by the Public Works Committee at that time. The establishment of a second shift and the extension of the plant were considered, and a recommendation was made that further plant should be purchased. On this point may I say, in reply to the honorable member for Perth, who stated that he could not realize why a larger plant should be ordered, that information placed before the Committee showed how necessary it was that the Factory should be capable of turning out considerably more rifles than it had hitherto produced. The Public Works Committee afterwards investigated the proposal to establish an entirely new factory, and a majority recommendation was made that a new building should be erected at Canberra. The main arguments in favour of the removal were contained in statements made by officers of the Public Works Department, who gave evidence that they would be able to build a complete factory at Canberra at a less cost than would be involved by the erection of additions to the Factory at Lithgow, with the purchase of land added. They were also under the impression that the Lithgow site was not suitable for factory extension, and declared that Canberra possessed a better climate and an up-to-date power plant. They pointed out the excessive cost of the land that would be required for workers' homes at Lithgow, and urged the advisability of full control of all industrial undertakings established by the Commonwealth being maintained in the hands of the Government. The departmental estimate of the new buildings at Canberra was £92,000, but in addition to this provision has also to be made for the population of 5,000 people which would become resident at Canberra if this factory were built and the workers transferred. At the present time 750 workmen are employed in the Small Arms Factory, and, according to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright,</inline> when the Factory is in full swing it will give employment to between 1,100 and 1,200 hands. I have worked out the cost of removing this number of people. Honorable members must realize that they cannot be dumped into the bush where there are no conveniences. If a new factory is erected at Canberra, provision must be made for the reception of the workmen who will be employed there. I estimate that, out of the 750 workmen now employed, 450 are married men, for whom homes will have to be built. Three estimates were submitted to the Public Works Committee in respect of cottages that might be erected, and, taking the cost at £480 each, the erection of 400 cottages would involve an outlay of £192,000. Provision" will have to be made for about 240 unmarried men, and this will cost £30,000 more. A water supply will cost £10,000. At the present time the Department is proposing to establish a septic tank for the treatment of sewage, but this system will eventually have to be connected with the main sewerage system, at a cost of £25.000. Schools, institutes, and other buildings for the accommodation of this large population will probably involve an outlay of £20,000, in addition to which roads, footpaths, electric lights, and matters of that sort would account for another £6,000. These items bring the total expenditure involved by this removal to at least £375,000. The departmental estimate was considerably less than this, because provision was not made in it for dealing with the number of people who will be affected. On the other hand, the cost of extending the Lithgow Factory can be limited to about £60,000. It was stated by departmental officials that land will have to be purchased for the erection of workmen's homes at Lithgow, and a sum of £28,000 was given as the estimate of the sum that would be required in this connexion. This figure has been the subject of much argument at meetings of the Public Works Committee. Some time ago I stated in this House that these estimates were grossly misleading. I repeat that statement now ; and I say that it is absolutely impossible for the Department to justify the purchase of an area of 50 acres of land at the price stated, unless they are desirous of actually throwing money away. I believe that the honorable member for the district has in his possession an option for the purchase of all the land that will be required at the price of £50 an acre. This will bring the necessary expenditure down to a sum considerably lower than was stated by the Department. It has been suggested that Lithgow is not a suitable place for the Factory on account of its climatic conditions. As a matter of fact, there is not a healthier community in all Australia, and it is only necessary to look at the railway map of New South Wales to see that Lithgow is now connected, or' will in the near future be connected, with every part of Australia. Situated 100 miles inland, Lithgow is quite secure from the sea and possible naval raids, and yet it is within reasonable distance of a port. It is connected with both Sydney and Melbourne. When the railway to Broken Hill is completed it will have communication with Adelaide. On the completion of the transcontinental railway it will be in direct communication with Western Australia, and a branch railway line is now in progress which will give communication with the Queensland system. Geographically, no place stands out as being so completely suitable for the erection of buildings such as we now have in contemplation as Lithgow. I do not think any argument is needed to show the advantages Lithgow possesses over Canberra in other respects. In a short time the necessary steel will, I think, be manufactured at Lithgow, though at present it has to be conveyed only 100 miles, as against 200 miles to Canberra. Oil is also manufactured in the vicinity. </para>

                                <para>- That may be. I have no wish to mislead honorable members at all, but in any case I think we may take it that the cost will be considerably less at Lithgow than at Canberra. The charge for the water supply at Lithgow is 3d. per 1,000 gallons. The scheme prepared for a water supply at Canberra provides for a rate of ls. per 1,000 gallons. Gas is supplied at Lithgow at 3s. 4d. per 1,000 cubic feet, and a big quantity is required in this work. There are no gas works at Canberra. Another important consideration is that of the supply of labour. Messrs. Pratt and Whitney's specification provided that only 152 unskilled labourers and two skilled labourers would be required for the Small Arms Factory plant. All the evidence given before the Committee has been to the effect that the Factory should be close to a large centre of population. It has been argued that the Lithgow site is not a good one, and I believe that had experts been asked to report at the time they would have recommended that it should not be selected, since the industrial population there was not large enough to enable the manager to obtain all the unskilled and boy labour that he required. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright,</inline> Captain Clarkson, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe</inline> all declared that no advantage would be gained by removing the Factory to Canberra, and that if any change was to be made the Factory should be removed to the vicinity of some large centre of population, where the requisite labour would be available. In what respect shall we improve our position by removing this Factory to Canberra? The conditions prevailing at Lithgow are immeasurably superior to those at Canberra, so that if this change be made our position will not be improved in the slightest degree. The removal would involve a very large expenditure. In an official report submitted to this Parliament when the proposal to start this Factory was approved, we were told that we should be able to produce rifles at a cost of £3 9s. Id. each. I have tried to ascertain what is the actual cost of production at the Factory, but have found it impossible to do so. The general manager stated that for the three months ending 30th June last - and that was the best three months he had had, so far as output was concerned - the cost per rifle was £9 13s. 4d. The cost at Canberra will be considerably more, for everything will be dearer. Our rifles are costing us more than 100 per cent, in excess of the price at which they could be obtained elsewhere. I understand that rifles can be imported and delivered here at £4 5s. each. Recently I asked a series of questions in this House, with a view of ascertaining the actual cost of the rifles produced at the Commonwealth Factory, and was then told that the value of the stock in hand was £111,000. Having regard to the value of the material used in each rifle, that statement would show that the stock in hand is sufficient to keep the Factory going for eight years, whereas we were told that it had not enough material to keep it in full working order for more than seven or eight months. There must be something wrong with these reports. I do not wish to do anything to add to the work of the Department at the present time, but I think that the Minister should insist upon the annual reports and balance sheets of the factories associated with it being issued within a few months of the close of the financial year, so that we may readily learn the cost of production. I should not be surprised to find that rifles manufactured at the Small Arms Factory are costing us something like £1? each. It cannot be denied that an enormous capital expenditure will be involved in establishing the Factory  at </para>

This expenditure is to be incurred merely to gratify the desire of the Labour party that the Commonwealth should have absolute jurisdiction over its workmen. The cost of production will be increased at Canberra. If the Factory be established there, where shall we find the requisite labour? </para>

                                <para>- I do not think he was questioned on this phase of the subject, and I do not regard him as an expert in these matters. The Minister, who says that the labour will follow the work, must realize that if the Factory were established at Canberra we should have to provide for the housing of the workmen, and incur all the expenditure incidental to the building up of the town. An expenditure of at least £375,000 would be incurred in respect of this Factory alone. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. I have not included in my estimate the cost of railway accommodation. At least £10,000 would be expended in putting in a siding at one of the proposed factory sites at Canberra, while in the other case the expenditure would be considerably larger. The Government should take the House into its confidence, and tell us what will be the total cost of this proposal. The Minister, in answer to a question which I recently put to him in the House, admitted that up to the present time there had been a capital expenditure of £178,000 on the Lithgow Factory. </para>

                                <para>- That railway, if the present Administration, aided by the honorable member, is going to continue, will cost us nearly £3,000,000 more than it ought to cost. I am trying to curb honorable members opposite in their desire to indulge in heavy expenditures. Surely, at a time like this, we should not support this unseemly extravagance. The Prime Minister has told us that we must economize, and we know that it is necessary to do so. </para>

                                <para>- I suggested some time ago that the Government could economize in the construction of that railway by calling for tenders. They should not have allowed themselves to come wholly under the control of the union secretary, who was brought over here by the Minister with the object of trying to secure his consent to a proposal to make the men work eight hours a day. There has been extravagance in connexion with the building of that line, and it still con:tinues. I wish to avoid further extravagance in connexion with the Small Arms Factory, and honorable members have now an opportunity to put a stop to this proposed expenditure.. The Minister admits that there has been a capital expenditure of £178,000 in respect of the Lithgow Factory, and if we could obtain a correct  balance-sheet  I think it would be found that the cost has been considerably greater. It has been suggested that if this proposal be adopted, the Factory buildings at Lithgow may be used as workshops for the building of vehicles for the Defence and Postal Departments. Carriages and vehicles of various kinds are to be made there, and transported to Western Australia, as well as to the far north of Queensland. What a magnificent idea ! </para>

                                    No doubt, if that proposal were adopted and £100,000 spent in giving effect to it, there would be an agitation to shift it for exactly the same reason that is now actuating the Government. They would desire to have the workmen engaged in it placed solely under Federal jurisdiction. Is this a fair way of treating a town like Lithgow? Depend upon it, other centres of population will be made to suffer in the same way if this project be adopted. We have factories in various parts of the Commonwealth. Are all of them to be removed to Canberra? I have heard some honorable members opposite say that they would favour the transfer of all Commonwealth factories to the Federal Territory.

                                <para>- Quite so. They wish to build up the Federal Capital at the expense of the States. I visited Lithgow for the first time as a member of the Public Works Committee. I have no friends and no interests there, nor have I any at Canberra. My sole desire is that we shall do what is best in the interests of the country. The Committee was informed that a number of the employees of the Factory had built their own homes at Lithgow, while a number of others had bought land on which they proposed to build. All these men will suffer if the Factory be removed, and so, also, will those who have erected buildings to house the workers. Surely they are deserving of some consideration. The Factory having been established at Lithgow, it should not be removed unless cogent reasons can be adduced for its removal. Having regard to the need for economy, it is almost a scandal to suggest that a factory which had cost £178,000 to establish should be deserted, and an expenditure of £375,000 incurred in building a new factory at Canberra and housing the workmen there. I hope the House will reject this proposition',' and decide that the Small Arms Factory shall remain where it is. </para>

                        <para>. -  It is time the Government arranged matters so that we could do business, or cease calling honorable members here. To drag honorable members over here, or, indeed, to drag those who live in Melbourne to the House day after day, when there is practically no business being done, is unfair. Last week we were dragged over  for  half-a-day's work. It is true that this week we have had a statement from the Prime Minister;but that is really all the important business for the week. </para>

The sooner a decision is arrived  at  one way or the other, the better it will be for all concerned. To have matters going on as they are is not fair to the people of Lithgow. Let us put that town out of its misery one way or the other. In the meantime,  far  more important than the vested interests of the people of Lithgow is the big national question of the production of rifles which is being hung up. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to discuss it. I am merely suggesting it as a reason for facilitating business, and I urge the Government to come to a decision, so that Lithgow may know its fate, and so that we also may know our fate with respect to the Factory at Lithgow, and provide for doing something which will increase the output  of  rifles there. It is too important a matter to play with for personal, private, or party reasons. One consideration only should guide us, and that is the production of rifles at the earliest possible moment. I take it that this matter will be the only business for to-morrow. Meanwhile I ask the Attorney-General to make an effort to bring the business of the House to a completion, and not to bring honorable members here week after week to do practically nothing. </para>

                        <para>. - In  my  remarks this evening, I made reference to the honorable member for Wentworth speaking to people in the gallery.  In justice to the honorable member, I wish to say that I had no intention of implying that he was addressing any particular person or persons in the gallery, or that he was influenced in making the remarks he did under the promise of any bribe from any person within the precincts of the  House.  My intimate relations with honorable members of the House warrant me in saying that I do not believe that there is one honorable member who would allow any person to approach him with a view to' offering him a bribe. </para>
