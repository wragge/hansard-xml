With regard to the question of offences against the Act, I shall see whether there is anything in the regulations which deprives a British-born subject of that right to a. civil trial which was presumed to be safeguarded under regulation 3. </para>

He told me that it was not true that he had given an order at any time to arrest this man Perry, and that it was not true that he had been arrested. The Minister said that the Military Board had considered the case, and Had expressed the opinion that he was not suffering from paralysis, but from hysteria, and they had ordered him into hospital for further treatment. As far as I can gather from what the Minister has told me, it was not contended that the man was not ill. </para>

                            <para>- No. Members of the Army Medical Corps, who are never armed, were sent to convey him to the hospital. According to the Minister, they asked the landlady where Perry was, and she said that he was not at home. Thereupon the Army Medical men went away. That is the statement of the Minister of Defence. I understand that the Minister for the Navy has been furnished with a report by the Department, which perhaps honorable members will permit him to read. </para>

                            <para>- Owing to the great disorganization of country mail services in Victoria through the reduction of passenger trains, will the Postal Department arrange for the continuance of a daily service to the principal country towns, where they have had them for years past, whether the mails have to be carried by trolleys or by road vehicles, or on horseback ? I do not think that expense should be considered in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- The Department is doing its best to arrange with the railway authorities to carry mails where goods trains run daily, or where the people are agreeable to get their mails by trolley service. Though the passenger train service is reduced, the Post Office still has to pay the same for the carriage of the mails, and it is only fair that where goods trains are run the Railway Department should carry mails on them. I do not think that it is a reasonable request that the Postal Department should be asked to run a vehicular service alongside a railway line. </para>

                                <para>- There is no reduction. The arrangement is altogether one-sided, and against the Postal Department. The railway authorities carry parcels at much lower rates than those charged to the Department. They carry newspaper parcels for1s. per hundredweight, irrespective of distance, but they charge the Postal Department per mile. In New South Wales newspaper parcels are carried by the Railway Department at half pre-paid parcel rates, and, if carried at owner&#39;s risk, at a quarter of those rates. The agreement is most unreasonable, and it must be altered next year. </para>

Will the Postmaster-General explain whether the postal service in the camp is conducted by an officer of the Postal Department, and whether some means cannot be devised to have the correspondence and parcels to soldiers regularly delivered ? </para>

I do not think that will interfere with the companies at all. When the Exchange is established, and other conditions have to be observed, I shall be glad to obtain from the honorable member particulars of &#39;any mines or circumstances in Western Australia which the Exchange is likely to affect seriously, and I shall be ready to make any provision for Western Australia that is compatible with the interests of the industry and our present circumstances. </para>

If this be not done, the firms will change their names, and the goods will still be advertised. I wish, further, to ask whether in this list the Attorney-General will include the goods of enemy origin and enemy benefit operated in Sydney by Messrs. George Arnold and Company, and Messrs. J.

                        <para>- The scope of this embargo is necessarily limited. It has relation to those articles which depend for their sale upon extensive advertising. It cannot be effective in regard to drugs, which do not depend upon advertising for their sale. Sanatogen, to take a striking case, depends almost entirely upon advertising. I say nothing of its virtues, for I know nothing of them. If we prevent the advertising of such an article, we, in effect, prevent its sale. I do not know that I can extend the list to the goods operated by Messrs George Arnold and Company. I do not know them. I think that Messrs. J. Blau and Company advertise a preparation called Laxatine. It is proposed to add that to the list, as it falls into the same class. They do not advertise &#34;4711,&#34; so that it could not be included. It relates to a question of importation, which is in a quite different  class. If the honorable member will supply me with a list of the preparations sold by George Arnold and Company, I will see that if they are of this particular class they are added to the list. </para>

                            <para>.- The Minister of Defence seems to have been struck very forcibly by the statement that I &#34; admired his pluck,&#34; which I made in my letter to him regarding the Perry case. My reference was to his plucky flight in an aeroplane, and if it has given offence to him, I can only say that he must be under a misapprehension. I think I can make out a clear case against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in regard to Gunner Perry. I was definitely promised that Perry would not be compelled to return to the Base Hospital. I did not ask for his discharge as a soldier. Can it be imagined that, had I done so, I would have repeatedly made both written and personal requests to the Minister for monetary assistance for him and his poor wife? </para>

                        <para class="block">The inaccuracy of that statement is shown by the answer supplied by the Minister of Defence himself, in which it is stated that the Board visited the man the night before the ambulance was sent for him. This then can be only an after-thought. I think honorable members will agree with me that the intention was to drag back the man to the Base Hospital. I repeat that accusation, and say that the promise made to me was broken, not by the special order of the Minister, but by officials under him. </para>

                                <para>- He went before a doctor, and was tortured and tormented by him. Where is that doctor now? Is he still in the Base Hospital ? Coming now to the report that has been furnished, I desire to say that  Colonel  Cuscaden  is a personal friend of mine, and that I have a great admiration for . him. If I were a woman about to become a mother he is one of the first medical men whom I would call in. As a matter of fact, he is a woman&#39;s doctor. Neither Colonel Fetherston nor Colonel  Cusca&#39;den  have had that experience which alone should entitle a medical man to be at the head of our Army Medical Corps. A proposal to appoint a gynaecologist - a medical man skilled only in the treatment of the diseases of women - to the head of the Army Medical Corps in England would be scoffed at. Why was this medical man appointed to such a position here? Why should not the Department have availed itself of the services of some of the highest consulting surgeons to the Melbourne and Alfred Hospitals, the two great operating hospitals in Victoria ? According to a parliamentary book before me, among the consulting surgeons at the Melbourne Hospital are <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. W.</inline> Moore,  Colonel Ryan,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stirling. Colonel Ryan</inline> is at the front ready and willing to fight ; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Moore</inline> is here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stirling</inline> is in Melbourne, and is possibly the greatest surgeon on the Melbourne Hospital Staff at the present time. Then, again, among the surgeons attending in-patients are <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fred.</inline> Bird, who is also away at the front, and is one of the four greatest surgeons practising in Victoria. I have nothing to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Wilkinson,</inline> but I do not find his name in this list, nor do I find the nam&#169; of <inline font-weight="bold">Major W.</inline> R. Bird.  Colonel Cuscaden&#39;s  name is on the list of consulting surgeons, but he is a woman&#39;s doctor. For the first time in the history of any country, women doctors have been appointed to the head of the Army Medical Forces. </para>

Under the Standing Orders, if a motion shall not have been disposed of two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon must be interrupted, unless the House otherwise orders. It is now nearly 1 p.m., and I should like this question to be settled now, so that we may know exactly whether the honorable member will be permitted to continue when we resume at 2.15. No one desires, I am sure, to limit the honorable member in his speech to-day. </para>

                                <para>- I do not wish to unduly labour the matter. The great point of difference between the Minister of Defence and myself is in regard to the promise that was made to me. I do not accuse the honorable gentleman of having caused the promise to be broken, but, owing to the action of his officials, it was not kept, as I think I shall clearly prove. When I learned of the torture that this man had undergone, and that medical men of repute in this city - one of them an exceptionally good surgeon - had declared that this man was not malingering, I took up the matter purely in my representative capacity as a member of Parliament, and at the request of certain of my constituents. Then I wrote to the Department and asked that this man should not be forced back to where he had been tortured. </para>

                                <para>- The court-martial that was held gave a verdict in the man&#39;s favour; and that fact is not denied by the Minister. On Monday night two doctors, at least, attended the man, and remained with him for a considerable period; and when I went the following day he was again carefully examined - and I supervised the examination myself - by one of the most competent surgeons in Melbourne, who declared that undoubtedly it was not a case of malingering. The wife, shrewd woman as she was, said that previously there had not been applied what are really important tests in cases of this kind. I was astonished to learn from the discussion at the Trades Hall Council, that an armed guard of three had attended at the man&#39;s home; and it is quite possible that any man outside the military would regard three men in uniform as a guard. </para>

                                <para>- On the contrary, that has all along been the fear and dread of the wife. A great point has been made of the fact that the man was away when the uniformed men called, but that was ewing to the cleverness of the wife, who hid him when she saw the uniforms. The next day I had the man removed to a certain place until I could bring the matter before the House. In this, perhaps, &#93;  broke  the law, but I would do the same again and again under the circumstances. I did not know that representatives of the great Labour organization of Victoria had seen this man; but we may take it that, with their experience of persons trying to obtain trade union funds, they have some knowledge of what is and what is not malingering. This man has been a splendid footballer, he fought in South Africa, and has been to China, and I ask whether he is the sort of person to malinger when he could get work? </para>

                                <para>- A woman&#39;s doctor is always apt to diagnose a case as one of hysteria. A tender spot in the spine is well defined, and the reflexes are exaggerated in a way that no mere malingerer could reproduce. This case should be investigated by an independent body consisting of the very highest surgeons in Melbourne, who have offered their services without fee or reward. I do not wish to wrong the Minister, and I cannot admit that he did not say I had asked for this man&#39;s discharge. I ask, however, why they should seek to take him back to the hospital if he discharged himself by his own act ? I have obtained the solemn promise, through the lips of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> that this man will not be forced back to the hospital, and I know the promise will be kept; and on that I have had the man taken back to Iris home. I have been waited on by members of a ladies&#39; organization, who informed me that these people are likely to be turned out to-morrow for the non-payment of rent. Attention is being given to this matter, and I wish honorable members to remember the refusal of this poor woman of any more pecuniary assistance from me. If something is not done for this family I shall appeal to the great-hearted public, to the trade unions and others and suggest that a committee be appointed to investigate the case. If I could only bring this man into the chamber, I am sure there is. not an honorable member who would say there was any sign of malingering. </para>

                                <para>- The court martial, with Captain Cox Taylor in the chair, decided that he was not malingering. I am told that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> has been removed from the hospital, and perhaps the most serious charge made against him last night was that he had forced this unfortunate wife to give up the certificates that her husband brought from Egypt. If that be so, the Minister should compel the doctor to produce the documents. It is a great pity that the Minister of Defence has not a seat in this House, for, if he had, it would be better for all concerned. I ask again why they should seek to take this man back, if he was discharged by his own a:ct? Why should I ask for money if I thought this man had been discharged from the Army ? Why should I appeal for assistance for these helpless people? Does a man lose all his rights, human and civil, when he joins the Forces? Let an independent Board make the necessary investigation, and not Army officers. Let the matter be left to surgeons from the greatest institutions in Melbourne - say the Melbourne Hospital and the Alfred Hospital - who, I understand, have offered their services free to the Department. I say, without fear of contradiction, that in no other country in the world are women doctors permitted to have control of such matters. It is not proposed, I suppose, to have maternity hospitals or other hospitals for diseases of women at the front? </para>

                                    Salmon has been appointed to an administrative position, and I know he is not one to say that he could operate in any way comparable to that of the well-known surgeons of our great hospitals. At present the honorary consulting surgeons at the Alfred Hospital are

                                    is away at the front, but the others have, I understand, volunteered their services. I want now to speak on the subject of meningitis. According to this morning&#39;s newspapers
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline>
                                    Cuscaden  has said that the situation gives no cause for alarm, that the military police have been isolated, merely as a precautionary measure, and that it was not expected that fresh cases would occur amongst the men quartered in Moore-street. The death rate amongst sufferers from this terrible disease is 80 per cent, where no serum is available. With the  Flexner  serum the death rate is brought down to 40 per cent., and the greatest American authority on the subject has stated that rarely does a recovery take place in a sufferer under two years of age. During the small-pox scare, when a supposed case occurred in Melbourne, Sydney was isolated. I speak under correction, but I think nobody actually died from the small-pox, and the chance of infection was considerably less than in the case of meningitis. I have been informed of one man who, after kissing his child in the evening, died in raving agony from meningitis, about 4 o&#39;clock next day. That sort of thing does not occur with small-pox. Meningitis is 600 times more deadly, and I would ask what is being done in regard to it. If any one belonging to me were about to bring a little Australian into the world, I would have the greatest faith in the ability of
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline>
                                    Cuscaden.  In that branch of medical science I do not think I can speak too highly of
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline>
                                    Cuscaden;  but in regard to a matter of this kind, where meningitis is concerned, he is absolutely out of it. Reverting to the case of Gunner Perry, I want to ask the head of the Government, or the Minister acting in his place, to appoint a Committee that will be uninfluenced by military considerations, unaffected by what has been said, or by the fear of injuring any one in the medical profession, to deal with it. Let that Committee decide whether this man is a malingerer or not. If he is not, then let his wife and family have. some of the money that the people of Australia are pouring out so lavishly. If that is done my object will have been achieved. I understand that men eminent in the medical profession have offered their services free. They could settle the matter in an hour. I want to prevent this sort of thing occurring in the future at any- hospital, whether it is a Base Hospital or a hospital at any one of the various camps. I want now to refer to the appointment of Colonel Kirkland to the command of the Liverpool Camp.

That would have done him more good than anything else. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know whether it would or not, but it appears to me that that would have been a common-sense, way of dealing with a case like this. If the man&#39;s peculiar hysteria was that he was being tortured, the simplest way of dealing with him would have been to have permitted him to mix freely with his own people. If it is not a hysterical case, as the honorable member for Melbourne still maintains, but one of paralysis caused by injury to the spine, the man would have recovered much more quickly by being allowed to remain amongst his own people than in any other way. But the point I want to put before the Minister - and I want to put it before him very earnestly - is that, the time has now come when the Government should consider the basic organization of all the big military hospitals. At &#39; the outbreak of the war there were connected with the Military Department a number of medical officers carrying various titles, from General downwards, who had been attached to the Military Forces for a considerable time.: They had served in the various camps, and had gone through a course of training that fitted them for the military service required in the field. The medical organization, so far as it is concerned with field operations, should be conducted more or less strictly on military lines; but where base hospitals are concerned - where there &#34;are a large number of wounded men who will be patients for a more or less protracted period - the basis of the organization no longer requires to be military in character. While I admit the necessity of putting a military officer into these hospitals to deal with the purely military side, I do not think it is essential that the officer should be a medical man. The same basis of organization is required at the base hospitals as at the great civil hospitals scattered throughout the country. If we were to put the Melbourne or the Sydney Hospital, or any other big hospital, under the control of, military officers, calling them Generals and Colonels and so on, everybody would think we had lost our senses, and similarly in the base hospitals, where the medical and nursing sides are of the most importance, military organization is not necessary. We have had from the medical men of this country a most generous offer to come to the assistance of the Government. The gentlemen who have made that offer do not require that they should be called Colonels or Captains. What they desire to do is to give the best services they can to their country in the interests of the men who have done so well by the country. </para>

                                <para>- The whole trouble has been that these hospitals have been organized, first and last, purely on a military basis. In all military concerns control goes by seniority in the ranks. Honorable members may look through the lists of the Army Medical Corps in Australia, and they will find in them scarcely any of the country&#39;s prominent surgeons and doctors, with one or two very notable exceptions. The explanation is that these medical gentlemen have been unable to give their services to the country in the way they would have liked, on account of the calls of their private practices. The result is there are medical gentlemen in the Army Service Corps senior to men who, from the purely professional point of view, would take the higher rank. In connexion with most hospitals s&#62; small paid staff is engaged, but the principal work is done by honorary medical men who are perfectly willing to do the same class of work at the base hospitals, and I suggest to the Government that that point should be very closely investigated by the War Committee, in order to discover whether it is &#39; not possible to reorganize the whole of the Army Service Corps on such lines as I have suggested. While I am dealing with this point, may I also refer to the position of the nursing staff. Before the outbreak of the war there were in Australia a number of ladies who had already joined the Army Nursing Service Corps. There was a principal matron, I understand, in each of the States. These matrons were ladies who had been very highly trained in the large hospitals of the country, and who had occupied positions of high responsibility. In hospital organization, and in making nursing arrangements generally, their opinions would have been of great value; but they were not called into consultation with the Army Medical Corps at all. That was unfortunate. I do not wish to say anything against the management and control of the Base Hospital in Melbourne, but even there there is room for improvement. Things have transpired which I do not wish to mention this afternoon, those in control not having had the necessary experience. The direction of a large hospital requires a highly trained brain and great practical experience, and the requisite knowledge cannot be obtained in a day. The Government have in their service ladies who are eminently capable of advising and assisting them. A few days ago they called these ladies to Melbourne to a conference, but I am informed, on very good authority, that the Principal Medical Officer contented himself with lecturing them on what he had done, and how he had organised the hospital, and then sent them home again. He did not ask them for their advice, although they had been brought from all over Australia. I hope that the statements that have been made here will be submitted for the investigation of the War Committee, and that the Committee will make it its business to ascertain whether the base hospitals are organized  on  righ&#39;t lines. I trust that the persons called in evidence will not be the military authorities, but persons who have had to do with the organization of large hospitals, and able to say what can best be done. </para>

                            <para>.- The statements of the honorable member for Melbourne regarding the treatment at the Base Hospital of a soldier named Perry, by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade,</inline> should be fully investigated, and, if not substantiated, should be apologized for. When the Rabaul trouble was under discussion, Perry wrote to me from the Base Hospital, protesting against his treatment by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade,</inline> and asked me to intervene; but I replied that my hands were too full, and advised him to apply to some one else. Although I did not move in the matter, I saw Perry, and found him to be in a miserable condition; a complete  wreck. He walked with a stick, he could hardly speak, and was trembling and paralytic, and, although a young man, seemed seventy or eighty years of age. To say that he is not an absolute wreck would be untrue. He cannot stand erect, and he cannot speak properly. The case is a pitiable one. The authorities said that Perry was a malingerer; but when I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> asking for a direct statement from him of the way in which he viewed the case, he merely replied that he had no answer to make, the matter having been dealt with. Perry would not stop in the hospital, and escaped from it. He said that he would rather drown himself than remain there subject to the treatment that he was experiencing and under the suspicion of malingering. What the Minister must ascertain is whether he has been badly treated. The case has not been properly investigated. Why should Perry be sent for at 11 o&#39;clock at night merely to be submitted to an examination? When his complaints were first made, they should have been inquired into, and if he were merely slandering <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade,</inline> he should have been punished. The average common soldier cannot get justice from the Defence Department. There are officers who have proved themselves to be heroes, but there are many who have been merely shoved into their jobs. Why has not <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> received a military appointment? Jobs have been found for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon, for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chataway,</inline> and for Grace Watson. You have only to be connected with the Opposition to get anything you want; but on this side you have no chance of anything. Personally, I would rather grease the fat pig for my friends than for my enemies. Recently, at one of the camps, they have been dosing the men with quinine. This medicine suits some persons and not others ; and some of those to whom it was administered had the skin taken off their arms and legs. When they went to see the doctor, they were kept waiting from early morning until late at night. One of these men had to be bandaged up, and could not dress or feed himself, but he was ordered to report for duty; and when he found it necessary to go to bed for a week, his pay was stopped. That is an instance of the kind of treatment to which the men are subjected. The Minister cannot inquire personally into every case, but there should be a committee to investigate complaints. </para>

                            <para>. - I wish to know what is to be the result of this discussion? Is anything to be done? My suggestion is that one of the three Ministers who are administering the Defence Department should, by seeing Perry, settle the questions that have been raised. That would take much less time than is now being wasted upon the case in office procedure and red tape. The Minister must accept responsibility; and if Perry were personally visited by the Minister of Defence or one of his colleagues, or brought to them, the honorable gentleman would see and judge for himself. </para>

                        <para>.- Had the Attorney-General assured the House that this transaction in regard to the export of wheat was a matter which had been undertaken because of the necessities of the war, very little real objection could be taken to the dislocation of trade that has already followed from the agreement that has been entered into, but at no stage has he done so. There may have been need for the Government to be assured that a sufficient quantity of sugar would be imported to make up the deficiency in our sugar crop, but the position in regard to wheat is quite different&#39;. The Attorney-General has not said that it was necessary, in order to provide money for the conduct of the war, that the Commonwealth should undertake the. control of the export of wheat, so that we can regard this Bill as being outside the category of war measures. Even before any chartering of vessels had been done, dislocation of the ordinary channels of trade commenced. </para>

                            <para>- No. The honorable member for Grey has clearly proved that, instead of this action on the part of the Commonwealth doing away with middlemen, it will create super-middlemen. By the wording of the agreement itself the agents of the Government&#39; may charter through other persons, and they are to be paid a super-commission over and above the brokerage to be paid to other agents. All through this matter I have objected to the fact that the Attorney-General has not taken the House into his confidence.  Even to-day we are not given any information. It was only by tracking the Minister from post to post that we could get any from him. He met us in a will o&#39; the wisp fashion, changing his ground so often that we did not know where we stood in the matter, and the position is that to-day we are asked to pass legislation confirming &#38; an arrangement about which we know nothing. In any case, the Attorney-General has entered upon a trading matter about which he could know very little. I do not propose to traverse the qualifications of the two agents whom he has selected. </para>

                            <para>- As wheat brokers they are unknown on the Baltic Exchange. They may have served the Commonwealth in other respects, but why they were selected to act in this matter I do not know. Discussion has already done a considerable amount of good. On the first occasion on which the Attorney-General furnished the House with any details of the commission which is to be paid to the charterers, fie failed to properly interpret what is known as the address commission in the charter party - a survival of an almost obsolete custom by which the shipper of wheat is allowed a rebate of 5 per cent, on the estimated gross freight on the vessel being loaded. The ordinary system is to divide that commission between the charter broker, who usually gets lj per cent., and the shipper, who gets the balance of 3| per cent. At first the Attorney-General said that the brokers&#39; share - 1^ per cent. - would not be disturbed, but when honorable members on this side of the House pointed out that though it might be fair for the brokers to retain 1-J per cent, when freights were normal, and only one vessel was being chartered, it was altogether too high a proportion to allow them when the whole of the chartering was to be in their hands, and when freights are almost double the normal rates. The result of the intervention of honorable members has been to reduce the allowance to the charterers from approximately &#163;75,000 or &#163;80,000 to &#163;25,000. I hope that the House will realize that the action of honorable members on this side has meant a saving of at least &#163;50,000 to the wheat-growers of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The honorable member, from his knowledge of the wheat business, was able to point out that the Government were making a present of an unusually large commission to the super-middlemen, as he called them. The Attorney-General finds his first difficulty in regard to the 3&#39;| per cent. In the ordinary course of events this 3| per cent, forms portion of the basis upon which the wheat shipper, who almost invariably is also a wheat buyer in Australia, fixes the price he pays to the farmer. It is his ability to buy freight cheaper than his competitors that enables him to pay higher prices than his competitors can do. But the Attorney-General, in answer to the question put- by the honorable member for Wakefield as to what the Government proposed to do with this 3| per cent, that usually goes to the shipper, said that the Government proposed to stick to it. It was immediately pointed out by honorable members that neither the Commonwealth nor the States, the partners of the Commonwealth in this matter, rendered any service to the farmers such as would entitle them to make a levy of 3f per cent, on the wheat exported. In fact, &#34;it was very aptly termed a duty on wheat export. As we are likely to have an exportation of over 2,000,000 tons of wheat this year, the 3&#163; per cent, should represent &#163;350,000 which would have been retained from the farmers. </para>

                            <para>- On a freight of 80s. per ton and an export of 2,000,000 tons of wheat with a brokerage of 4d. per ton deducted from the 5 per cent, commission. The Minister will see that I am well within the mark. The Attorney-General, in reply to the remarks of honorable members, said that this was money that had previously gone into the pockets of the shippers, but he has since then abandoned that position. Subsequently he proposed to divide the 3| per cent, between the States and the Commonwealth, but he now says that after defraying any expenses that may be involved in the administration of this matter, the money will be handed over to the States. It seems to me that the States are to accept all the responsibility and odium that may come about as the result of this arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad the honorable member has asked that question. When wheat has been bought by the shipper it is put into great heaps. Some of it is sold to the millers, and is gristed here, but the bulk of it is shipped. However, the wheat, so far as the farmer is concerned, has altogether lost its identity. All of it has gone into a big heap, and how can the Government know which farmer&#39;s wheat has been shipped and which gristed ? The matter has gone too far for anything like an equitable return to be made. </para>

                            <para>- I have never been able to understand why the States were brought into this business, at all. They own no- wheat; they ship no wheat; and they have no responsibility. I have made it my business to see that before a ratification was made the farmers and shippers obtained certain guarantees from the Commonwealth and the States - firstly, that the Commonwealth would not limit exports, and, secondly, that the States  would not withhold the use of their railway systems, or their country railway stations, or their ports, and that they would not fix prices. The whole business seems likely to get out of order. Before  one ton of freight has been secured from the other side of the world, dislocation is taking place. Ordinarily wheat chartering commences in the month of August, 8 per cent, or 10 per cent, of the freight for the coming harvest being speck chartered, and, as a result, forward sales took place as early as September. To-day a certain proportion of the shipping of the world is getting out of position and away from the Australian trade. Yet, notwithstanding that this arrangement was made on the 24th July, not one ton of freight has been secured for the forthcoming harvest. As the harvest is to be a big one, a commencement in securing freights, should have been made at once. When the Prime Minister was asked why the House had not been given an opportunity to discuss this arrangement before it was made, he replied that the matter was urgent. So urgent has it been considered that a day or two ago there had not been a ton of freight chartered under this arrangement. Where, then, was the urgency? Had this business been left to those who usually obtain the freights, a big proportion would have been already secured. The Commonwealth wishes to secure and guarantee freight, but I am .unable to trace in the arrangement with Elder, Smith, and Company and Gibbs, Bright, and Company any undertaking to secure freight or anything as to the price to be paid. The Attorney-General has certainly failed to put the House in possession of reasonable information which would enable me, as a country representative, to say to. the producers that I believed that an arrangement had been made which would best serve the interests of the country. But all we can say now is little better than evidence given at a <inline font-style="italic">post-mortem</inline> examination. The bargain has been made, but the country is entitled to know where the responsibility rests and what financial obligation is cast upon the Government. We are asked in this Bill to vote for the Government a sum of &#163;100,000. For what? We know that freight has not to be paid for as it is ordered - that is not the custom of the trade. Elder, Smith, and Company and Gibbs, Bright, and Company, according to the arrangement which has been made with the Government, have a right to charter, on behalf of the Commonwealth, the necessary freight. That will involve the Commonwealth in a liability, which is being shared by the States, of probably &#163;6,000,000. Who can say that the price of freights will be maintained, and that the wheat shippers will take them off the Government&#39;s hands ? Who can say that there is not a certain element of gambling in this business? We have not been told how much of the liability has to be borne by the States. Whatever loss or profit is made is to be shared by the Commonwealth and the States, but in what proportion? The House is entirely without knowledge of this arrangement. The Attorney-General has just said that he is sending to one of his partners, the Victorian Minister of Agriculture, for information; but the House should have been in possession of that information long ago. Parliament has to accept the responsibility, and vote the necessary money, and it may have to accept a proportion of the loss if there should be a sudden drop in freight. In the very unlikely contingency of this war terminating immediately, the inevitable result would be the release of mercantile shipping, and freights would drop. In that event, if freights had been chartered by the Commonwealth, and had not been requisitioned by the buyers, the Government must make a considerable loss. That is why I am saying that it was unwise for the Government to enter into a business undertaking of this character unless there was pressing necessity for so doing. In the serious position that had arisen on account of the shortage of freights and the increase of prices, the Government had the right to ask for an assurance from those who ordinarily handle this trade that they would be in a position to carry out their arrangements as usual. We know that one result of the action taken by the Government is that the large operators in grain are standing off the market, and to-day farmers cannot sell one bag of wheat for forward delivery, as they have been able to do in ordinary years. There has been a substantial drop in the price of wheat in the world&#39;s markets during the last week or so. Wheat is down to-day to a parity of about  4b.  in Australian ports. A little while ago the price was 7s. to 8s. per bushel on the home market. Australia&#39;s entire export shipping amounts, in round figures, to 10,000,000 tons per annum, and  the import shipping to about 5,000,000 tons a year. Why was wheat, alone, selected for Government interference? If the principle of State acquisition of freights be right, have the Government no concern for other commodities ? Are they not concerning themselves with regard to wool freights? The prevailing custom in regard to the shipment of wool is that the freight is fixed in Australia by the Overseas Shipping Association, and probably the two firms which the Minister has selected for this job are members of that association. My contention in the early stages of this business was that if the Commonwealth &#39; desired to secure any means of bearing down the value of freights as against the shipping rings of the world, the right course of action was not to go to the agents of those shipping rings, and ask them to beat down their principals. Those firms have reached their present position of commercial ascendency as the direct agents and representatives of the big organizations which the Commonwealth now asks them to assist in beating down. If the Government were anxious to adopt the best means of securing cheap freights, they would have gone to the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> brokers, who understand the business, who know every bottom on the waters, and have such an organization that every time even a tub is chartered they are advised. I am afraid it is rather too late to endeavour to remedy the position. The Attorney-General has argued in this House that if there was to be competition by the wheat-shippers from Australia in order to secure freights from the other side of the world, the shipping people would be raising the prices against the Commonwealth; therefore, he thought it would be better to have one buying agency. My answer to that argument is this : Whilst, on the face of it, that contention may look arguable, it must be remembered that Australia produces not more than 3 per cent, or 4 per cent, of the world&#39;s wheat, and we must pay at least the world&#39;s price for shipping. Nothing the Commonwealth may do is going to particularly bear down the price ; but, on the contrary, I believe the arrangement which has been arrived at is likely to increase the price. The largest wheat-buyers in Australia are John Darling and Son, Bell and Company, and Louis Dreyfus, and their mode of operations is this: An inquiry goes forth for freight, and an immediate response is received by their own organization. They set to work to ascertain if they can sell cargoes, and if they have the wheat available business results. If they do not obtain buyers, there is no obligation on them to accept the freights. But in this Government transaction there is an obligation on the Commonwealth to buy, so that when the Government&#39;s representatives go on the market they go as definite buyers - they must buy, and the shipping world knows that. Then comes the opportunity for the great shipping concerns to say, &#34; The Commonwealth is trying to bear down the prices, but we know that the Commonwealth &#60; must buy, whereas the shippers need not buy, and, therefore, we only quote them such prices as will leave them a working margin.&#34; I &#34;think that is a rational view to take of this transaction. There is an entire absence of information as to the basis on which the allotment of space is to take place. How do the representatives of South Australia, for instance, know the proportion in which space is to be allotted to that State? What information have we been given as to what, proportion will be allotted for flour, wheat, barley, oats, or other produce? The bargain seems to have been made in a most casual way. I admit that several times the Attorney-General has changed his ground and altered his arrangements until gradually the business is being licked into shape, but that is mainly the result of the criticism from this side of the House. The whole transaction would have benefited in regard to many of its features by consultation between the Government and the representatives of the interests .involved. I could, if necessary, deal with other phases of the agreement, and point to various anomalies; but I shall confine myself to the statement that there was never any justification for this action on the part of the Commonwealth. There was at no time a demand by the wheatgrowers, by the trade, or by the States; but there was a desire on the part of the Attorney-General to make such an arrangement. That desire found expression in an attempt by him to get his partners in this agreement into line on terms of which all of them did not approve. The honorable gentleman told us that in the action he was taking he had the cordial co-operation of the States and of all the interests involved. For three days, however, many of those interests were at bay; they were bargaining and changing their position. It was only at the point of the bayonet - in order that no further dislocation might be caused by one State standing out while others entered into the agreement - that the bargain was ratified. I hope that in respect of any future bargaining of this character, affecting any exportable product of Australia, the same method will not be adopted; but that reasons will be given for the action taken, and that those primarily concerned - the producers - will have an opportunity to state their case. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to mention that fact. The question was also raised in the press and in every State Parliament, and it was suggested that the State and Federal Governments should take concerted action to secure freights for the forthcoming harvest. The Attorney-General, in his anxiety to meet the public clamour, made a mistake in the way that he proceeded to take action. In the first place, he should have called to his counsel those who were directly interested, not only the shippers or charterers, but those who desired to secure storage for the wheat they purchased. I certainly would have consulted such people. At the same time, 1 wish to compliment the Attorney-General upon having arrived, after some delay, at what seems to me to be a much fairer basis than that of the original proposition. I was amazed when he made a statement in the House that the Governments concerned were going to retain the difference of 3f per cent, in the 5 per cent, rebate allowed. After consideration, he apparently came to the conclusion that there was no justification for such a course. , . </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. Some of the States, according to a press report, seemed to think that the retention of this surplus would be a very fine thing for them. It is idle to complain of what has been done. It cannot be denied that before this agreement was arranged there were indications in every direction of a serious shortage of freights. We also knew that enormously&#39; high rates were being paid, and that there was a possibility of the demand for freights increasing those rates. I thoroughly agree with the honorable member for Wannon that it would have been well to consult large buyers and charterers, who employ some of the brightest men in the trade to secure charters. Had they been approached in the right way no doubt they would have been willing to place at the disposal of the Attorney-General most of the information possessed by them. After all, it will be found necessary to go to these men in order to secure freights. Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Company, and Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company do not propose to provide for all the freight. Acting as a kind of middlemen, they are to make arrangements with others to carry some of the produce. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Having regard to all the circumstances, I think that the Attorney-General is to be complimented on what he has done. &#39;I pay my tribute to his great courage, and to the capacity he has displayed in dealing with a number of very important questions. He has had to deal with the metal exchange business, the question of alien contracts, the arrangements for handling the wheat harvest, and the sugar business. In addition to attending to all these matters, he has been at the beck and call df every other Minister, because he is the only lawyer in the Cabinet. I marvel that he has got out of this as well as he has done. The statement made by him last night, in reply to the Leader of the Opposition, and the reply also given by him to a question which I put last Friday, have eased my mind with regard to the disposal of the surplus of the 3&#163; per cent, of rebate. There may be some charges to be deducted from that surplus, but they will be trifling. I do  not think that in the past the wheat-grower got the whole of the difference, and I am sure that the honorable member for Wannon does not think so. </para>

                            <para>- It sometimes pays a buyer to advance the price of wheat in certain localities, particularly when he desires to make up a cargo. What concerns me mostly is how the Attorney-General is going to return the surplus rebate to those who should receive it. I hope he will be careful. The cooperation of the States should prove valuable, but it seems to me that this money can be returned to the growers only by means of rebates on freights. Care must be taken that such rebates go to the actual producers of the wheat. Even under such a system it will not be possible to reach all the growers, because wheat is raised in many districts where there are no railways, and where it has to be carted over long distances, so that producers there would not receive any rebate. Speaking generally, I think we can congratulate ourselves on the action that has been taken, and that the Attorney-General can congratulate himself that he has got out of the whole business as well as he has done. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the honorable member for Wannon that the questions put to the Attorney-General in this House, and the subsequent Conference which he held with the State Premiers, have had the effect of considerably improving the agreement as originally proposed. This House, however, has not been treated as it should have been. The Attorney-General should have placed before us the terms and conditions agreed upon as between himself and the States. I have a shrewd suspicion that the honorable gentleman agreed with the State Ministers in Conference to rebate to them the whole of the 5 per cent, over and above the 4d. per ton necessary to pay the agents who chartered the vessels- </para>

                            <para>- Other reasonable charges may be added. The main object that we have in view is to make adequate arrangements for the handling of the harvest. Information from the wheat-growing districts of Australia indicates that we shall probably have next season a record harvest, and the largest export of wheat in the history of the Commonwealth. It is highly necessary that complete arrangements should be made for the export of our surplus wheat, not only that we may be better fitted to prosecute the war, but that we may supply the Allied Forces abroad in the event of large supplies of wheat from other parts not being released for that purpose. The provision of the necessary freights was then the all-important consideration. 1 am not very sanguine of any material reduction in rates under any system of agency or brokerage. My experience as a member of the Fruit Commission, which travelled all over Australia, is that freights are generally the same all over the Commonwealth. There are no material differences. It is possible to secure a reduction only by going into the market as some spirited agents in Australia have done, and making arrangements for years ahead, guaranteeing a certain quantity of freight and possessing the ability to fill up any dead space if the particular product arranged for is not available. </para>

Our general experience is not in favour of the view that there is likely to be any considerable reduction; and we should have some information as to how the space is to be regulated. We do not know how far it will be possible to arrange for the filling of space, or what is going to be done where it is ordered and not filled. We might find the shippers, under the latter circumstances, demanding a certain amount of money. We are speaking largely in the dark; and we should have been told who were called into the counsels of the Attorney-General and the State representatives at the conference in Victoria. At the conference with the Ministers of Agriculture, the Attorney-General modified his proposals by stating that all the surplus amount of the 5 per cent, over and above the actual expenses should be rebated to the growers; but, so far as we know, not one grower or representative of the growers was consulted. </para>

                            <para>- I think that, in some instances, the freight will prove to be higher than if it had been arranged by smart and experienced business men. The redeeming feature of the agreement is that there is a possibility now of being able to secure the necessary amount of space ; but, so far as the business side is concerned, it is probable that not the best class of man has been appointed to drive a hard bargain, and, save, perhaps, some portion of the money paid on behalf of the growers. There is no doubt that the producers should have been consulted before the agreement was ratified. Even now we do not know what took place at the conference between representatives of the States and the Commonwealth ; but we do know that, after all, the 5 per cent. usually allowed by the shipping companies is largely the profit that ordinary dealers secure every year on their wheat export transactions. It is possible, with this 5 per cent., for them to go into the market, as they do, and give the full amount for the wheat less the actual freightage, depending entirely on the commission for the profit. If anything less than the full amount, less the bare expenses, is rebated to the growers, there will be an injustice done. I regret that we have had to debate the question without full information before us ; and I hope that, if there are any official papers, we shall have an opportunity to scrutinize them, in order that we may know what interests were represented when the Attorney-General, at the instance largely of this House, had a conference with the States, and brought about a modification of the agreement by affording relief to the growers to the extent of a return of the great bulk of the 5 per cent. </para>

The brokers, agents, and middlemen whom I desire to cut out are those who, in the past, have not, to say the least, been influenced by consideration for the farmers; and I think that the agreement will result in the disappearance of a great number of those undesirables. The honorable member for Wannon said that there was no necessity for this proposed arrangement; but does he know that the mercantile marine has been lessened to the extent of some 30 per cent.? Under the present abnormal conditions, the Government would have shirked their responsibility if they had not taken some action. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member for Wimmera in the hope that the agreement will not be accepted until there has been an opportunity for thorough investigation. There is no doubt that we should have seen the agreement, though I regard it as a start on the right lines, in view of the depletion in our mercantile marine. Under the agreement, the farmers of the country have an infinitely better chance of favorable terms than if they were left to the mercies of what I may call a shipping ring. As to the rebate of 3^ per cent., the Attorney-General said that the Government were going to &#34; stick to it.&#34; With that attitude I do nob agree. </para>

                            <para>- It was brought about owing to representations made by the honorable member for Grey, and others of us, to the Attorney-General. However, the honorable member for Wannon still seems to have an objection; and that is what makes me believe that he is not so much concerned about the benefit to the farmer as about the benefit to somebody else. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it is a little too strong; but, at any rate, there will be a better chance of the rebates going back into the pockets of the producers. The States, of course, own the railways, and this gives a further chance of the money - though not, perhaps, to a penny - reaching the producers. However, as I have said, my great concern is that the growers shall have an assurance that their produce shall be got away, because it would be absolutely dangerous to their interests and to the interests of the community, if the arrangements were in a haphazard way left to the shipping rings. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot allow the debate to close without entering an emphatic protest. I object to the Government entering into huge business arrangements regarding matters of which they have no knowledge. It has been shown that the Attorney-General has climbed down, and, apparently, from beginning to end, has not known where he was. This, of course, is bound, in the end, to react on the producers. In the second place, I object to our being asked to ratify an agreement of which we have no knowledge; such a position is derogatory to Parliament, and there can be no reason why the question should have been submitted at the last moment. There has been ample time since the agreement was first arranged to afford the House the fullest information. In the third place, I object to a monopoly being given to any two firms. The Government might have employed firms to assist them, and have done a great deal of good in providing the necessary space, but there was no need to give a monopoly. I do not regard the agreement as in any sense in the interests of the producers, and, therefore, I am opposed to it. I do not propose to enter into any argument at this stage. I simply protest against the agreement being ratified without honorable members having any knowledge of its contents. </para>

                        <para>.- May I bring this point under the notice of the Attorney-General % An exceptionally heavy harvest is in sight, a portion of which will go abroad as wheat, and a portion as flour. An opportunity now occurs for Australia to increase her output of flour. For the first six months of the wheat season, flour is in demand abroad. In the second half Australian millers are beaten by the Americans. Now is the opportunity to grist more flour in Australia. Extended operations in this direction will absorb labour when there is unemployment, and it will make available offal as well as flour for cheap home consumption. I would suggest to the Attorney-General that he should confer with the flour millers of Australia, and perhaps by making some concession in the matter of freight it may be possible to do something in this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall be quite willing to do what the honorable member suggests, though it must be understood that I cannot move without the cooperation and approval of the States. At the recent conference the question of flour export was considered, and it was agreed that facilities for the shipment of flour should be afforded just as for wheat. The honorable member for Wannon would go further than that.  His  suggestion is that such inducements should be offered as may lead to the production of more flour in Australia, and to the export of flour rather than of wheat. That is a perfectly sound policy, and the Commonwealth Government will be very glad to support it. The adjourned State conference will meet on 15th October or thereabouts. In the meantime I will write to the various State Ministers of Agriculture inviting their opinions on this matter, and asking for suggestions as to how best it can be carried out. I will further suggest that a conference should be held with flour millers. The Government will be glad not only in this matter, but in any other, to encourage the producer, whether he be a primary or a secondary producer. </para>

                        <para>. - May I explain that freight has been allotted to each State upon the basis of its amount of exportable wheat. The same principle will be adopted in regard to the allocation to individuals. Every shipper will be treated fairly, and no preference will be given to a State over an individual. Everybody, whether he be John Jones, or a State Government, will be treated exactly alike. If one man happens to get a larger assignment of freight this month he will get a smaller assignment next. Everybody will be treated fairly and in order. The matter is to be discussed in detail in October, when shippers will be able to bring forward definite requirements. The committee will then deal with them and allocate what ships are to be used. </para>

                        <para>.- The Attorney-General&#39;s statement regarding the allocation of space is reasonable, but I can foresee a little difficulty. The Commonwealth will have bought the freight. Shippers, however, will not have bought the wheat, and will not have requisitioned the space. The market may be drooping, and shippers may be inclined to wait in order to obtain a cheaper freightage. </para>

Space must be ordered in advance, and when so ordered must be filled within a fixed period, or otherwise demurrage will be charged on account of the ship.

            <para>External Affairs) &#91;4.30&#93;. - Judging by statements made in this Chamber, some misapprehension exists concerning the visit of the Secretary of my Department to the Northern Territory. That visit was made expressly at my request, at very short notice, and at considerable personal inconvenience to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> who has done, and is doing, excellent work. He has visited Bathurst and Melville Islands, and Alligator River, and states that he is quite satisfied with the progress made by the mission at the first named place, &#34; considering that the settlement was established among natives previously untouched by white man&#39;s influence.&#34; He then proceeded <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Melville Island to Alligator River, by the <inline font-style="italic">Leichhardt,</inline> and up the river for about 40 miles to Cahill&#39;s Settlement, which place he considered most satisfactory for an aboriginal station. He also says that it offers very fine promise as a centre of possible dairy settlement, and that portion of the original shipment of cows from Queensland was successfully taken across a wide stretch of country between Burrundie and the Alligator River, and are now in most excellent condition on fine flats adjacent to Cahill&#39;s homestead, where first-class butter is being produced with most primitive appliances and with practically no previous experience on the part of Cahill and his wife. He says that the whole place is an excellent illustration of what a man of energy can do. He then travelled overland 160 miles to Burrundie, visiting Mount Well&#39;s mine <inline font-style="italic">en route,</inline> carefully examining the country passed over, which, he says, is of a most varied description. He reports that extensive flats prevail in the neighbourhood of the Alligator River, which are mostly under water in the wet season, but are now covered with abundant grasses of a good quality. He carefully considered the prospects of that particular district as a settlement for returned soldiers, but he says that any proposal of that kind would involve a large amount of expenditure. Then he inspected the settlers&#39; properties on the Daly River. He says generally the settlers are not doing well, but he is convinced that it is due to their own incapacity, as at Stapleton and Daly there are individuals who are certainly making good. He inspected the copper mines at the Daly River, which, he says, promise well. Then he motored to Brock&#39;s Creek and Mount Bonney to inspect a mine, which, he says,  is carrying out developmental work. He also inspected the Iron Blow Mine, now </para>

He proposed to leave on Friday last to inspect construction works and visit the Argentine settlers, and to join the Administrator at Katherine on Monday next, for the purpose of visiting Marranboy and Mataranka and the Roper River. </para>

                    <para class="block">This morning I asked the Postmaster-General if any finality had been reached in the matter. But it appears that he is waiting for a reply from the Letter Sorters Union, while the union is waiting for a reply from him. It looks as if the Minister is a party to a move to sidestep the award of the Court which he was instrumental in establishing, and I think he was, to some extent, responsible for the letter sorters taking their case to the Court. The union went to the Court, and&#39; asked for shorter hours and higher minimum and maximum rates of pay. His Honour fixed the minimum at &#163;150 for sorters at present in the Service, and &#163;168 for future appointees. All the sorters now engaged had passed a certain test qualifying them for their positions, and the Commissioner now says that they must pass a new test before they can enjoy the benefits of the award. I have failed to discover in His Honour&#39;s award that he directed the holding of any such examination, and one cannot wonder that the sorters propose to issue a writ of mandamus to prevent the imposing of this barrier test. If the Commissioner has power to force a test on the men at this stage, he has power to enforce it on them at any other stage, and so prevent officers from getting promotion. I understand that so far no application to undergo the test has been made by the sorters, although such application must be made before the 15th of the present month. Men have been prevented from getting increases to which they would have been entitled under the old order of things from the 1st August, and thus are deprived by this new regulation of increments which they would have obtained had they not gone to the Court at all. I shall read portions of the regulation regarding this barrier test, and I ask the Postmaster-General whether it is reasonable to condition in this way the increments to men already in the Service. I do not think there is any necessity for the test, and I shall show that it is altogether unreasonable. The regulation reads - </para>

I challenge any officer in the Department to do that. The highest heads in the Department are not able to take up 500 letters addressed to various post-offices in Australia and sort them in fourteen minutes with only 10 per cent, of errors.

                    <para>If I were to ask honorable members of this House where the important town of Boonah, in Queensland, was situated, they would not be able to answer. This is a cruel and hard test to impose upon these officers, and although I would not like to accuse the Minister or the Commissioner of deliberately setting up this barrier test for the purpose of depriving officials of their increments-, that will be its effect. &#34;We need not be surprised if, after the 15th of the present month, serious difficulty arises amongst the postal sorters. I hope that some way out of the difficulty will be found, and that the Department will not insist upon applying this test to officers already engaged. We must admit that the postal sorters have done their work remarkably well in the past. Letters have carried to their destination with very little interruption. The officers have many difficulties to contend with in the way of faulty addresses, but, generally speaking, we only hear of their failures, and not of the great amount of good work which they do from day to day. The sorting of mail matter and sending it correctly to its destination is a difficult task, and the small number of errors that comes to light speaks volumes for the efficiency of the postal sorters. </para>

But it is unjust to impose a test like this upon men who have been twenty years in the Service. I understand that junior sorters are to be dispensed with, so that, unless the officers at present in the Service can pass this test, and so qualify to rank as senior sorters, they will not derive any benefits from the award. I regret that the Postmaster-General is not present, but I hope that he will take note of what I have said, and that a way out of the difficulty will be found. </para>

                        <para>. - I have had an opportunity of reading what the Minister. of Defence said to-day in another place in regard to the case of Gunner W. Perry, and I shall explain in a few moments the only objection I have to his remarks. He mentioned the_ paragraph at the end of my letter - &#34; With all greetings re your plucky act, and good luck.&#34; Surely it was a plucky act for the Minister to ascend in an aeroplane! I admire any one who will do a plucky act, but if the Minister objects to that admiration he may consider it eliminated from my letter. On the telephone I asked the Minister if he would allow a medical man to attend on the Board which was to examine Perry. He said he would not. I said, &#34; Will you allow me to be present as the member for Melbourne?&#34; He answered &#34; No.&#34; &#34; Will you allow m&#171; to have a lawyer present?&#34; &#34;No.&#34; Then I asked who would be the members of the Board, but I could not obtain that information. That is the Board which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> sent to examine this&#39; unfortunate man on Monday night. The promise given to me was that the man would not be forced back to the hospital, but could go to some other hospital, where he would get more skilled surgical attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> claims that I have gone behind the privilege of Parliament to call him a cowardly liar. He adds, &#34; Such conduct reflects upon the public life of this country when a politician is enabled to traduce in Parliament the honour of a man merely on the uncorroborated <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements of any man.&#34; Does the. Trades Hall Council enjoy parliamentary privilege? Will the next public meeting I shall call to deal with this subject have the protection of parliamentary privilege ? I tell <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> again that if he says that Perry is a malingerer he is a liar and a coward. That has been said, and will be said by me at every meeting I have addressed or shall address. I had the greatest difficulty to discover to-day where <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> was. The authorities at the Department denied that he was there, and I think a little inquiry regarding this gentleman is advisable. I ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is to be adopted that a Minister shall personally see this man? </para>

                            <para>- If that is done. I shall be very pleased. It is painful to have to listen to these unfortunate stories. Since I spoke this morning, I have been interviewed by a gentleman who drove into the city some of the poor fellows invalided home, who arrived at Port Melbourne this morning. We know how the first party of soldiers invalided home were treated on their arrival here ; and, in passing, I should like to ask whether the doctor who examined this man was one of those who was responsible for the unfortunate hitch that then occurred. The gentleman who waited on me this morning said that among the returned soldiers whom he brought to the city to-day was a man who said that he knew Perry in Egypt and was aware that he had been treated there by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fred</inline> Bird and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Springthorpe,</inline> but had not been, cured. The returned soldier went on to say, &#34; If I am any judge of a man,&#39; Perry is no malingerer.&#34; </para>

One does not like to be constantly hammering away at the Defence Department, but when cases of this kind are brought before us, it is just as well that they should be mentioned in the House. The quotation is as follows: - </para>

                        <para>Did you notice in Friday&#39;s paper a death notice, the name of Private  Prideau,  from Port Melbourne? Well, that was my late stepbrother&#39;s son. He came from Seymour Camp last Monday, ill, and went to the Base Hospital at St. Kilda-road; was there Monday and Tuesday with asthma and bronchial pneumonia. On Wednesday the poor fellow was told to get up by the doctor, and he said he felt too ill. The doctor said &#34;What rot,&#34; and got two soldiers to get his clothes on. How the poor fellow got home to Port we don&#39;t know, for he came home on Wednesday morning, and was dead on Thursday morning. They sent an ambulance on Thursday night to take him back to the Base Hospital, but he was in his coffin. They got the police&#39;s authority, and the Port Melbourne doctor&#39;s; but if he had been sent away from any other hospital there would be an inquiry; but coming from the Military Base Hospital, it will need no inquiry, but will be hushed up, so don&#39;t talk of enlisting, after that. He was only 24 years, and his mother is broken up over it. </para>

My correspondent writes, &#34; No more enlistment after this.&#34; How can a man be expected to go out recruiting when he is brought face to face with facts like these? The Minister for the Navy is, unfortunately, not present; but it would seem that he has no jurisdiction over such cases. I place this letter on record as illustrating once more the horrors that have taken place in connexion with recruiting for our Expeditionary Forces. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to enlist the sympathetic consideration of the Minister for the Navy, and, indeed, of the whole Ministry, for the case of young Lieutenant Patterson, an ex-member of the Permanent Forces in Queensland, whose services have been dispensed with by the Department. I do not wish to pre-judge the case in any way, nor shall I ask the House to do so. Lieutenant Patterson has had a brilliant career. He passed with special credit all the examinations to which he was subjected, and his reputation in the Service was that of a brilliant man of very great promise.  His  services were dispensed with in the following circumstances: He applied for service abroad, and although as a lieutenant in the Permanent Forces he was engaged in instructing other officers who were qualifying for service at the front, he was told that he must submit himself for examination. He was not aware until he received a telegram from the Department whether the examination was to take place at Melbourne or Sydney. On arrival at Sydney he found that he had to present himself there for examination. Before leaving Queensland, he was not even aware of the purpose of the call. He felt that he was more than qualified to pass the examination to which he would have to submit, but having made inquiries from other officers as to the nature and purpose of the examination that he was to be called upon to undergo, he determined to withdraw his application to go abroad. He was led to do this because a previous qualifying examination had not been conducted upon lines such as he and other members of the staff considered to be right and fair. It was in those circumstances that he withdrew his application. Subsequent to his leaving Queensland for Sydney, there was paid into his account money to cover his travelling expenses. Later on, he sent in a warrant to secure the total of his travelling expenses, representing about &#163;5. Those expenses were paid to him. When it was reported to head-quarters that he had not submitted himself to this examination, he was asked to make a refund of the expenses that had been paid to him. He declined to do so. He said that, as a military officer, he lived under the military law and regulations; and finally, after considerable correspondence, his services were dispensed with. No charge was made against him. He was dismissed without having an opportunity to put his case. Part of the examination to which he was to submit was oral, and he had had, practically, no prior notice of it. This young fellow - a particularly skilled officer - believing that he was working within the military laws and regulations, declined to accede to the request for a refund of the money paid by way of travelling expenses. As the result, he was dismissed from the Service; but that dismissal, I understand, has not been confirmed by the Executive. I ask the Minister for the Navy to give his very best consideration to this case, and to cause a full disclosure of the whole of the facts to be made, so that this young man shall have, at least, an opportunity to be heard, and in order that the Commonwealth shall not lose a good officer, and that his future career shall not be blighted . </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to emphasize my opinion that there should be a strict and impartial inquiry into the administration and methods adopted at the hospitals in connexion with the Defence Department. An instance came under my notice recently, and everything I am going to say I can absolutely verify. A young man who had enlisted, and was at Seymour Camp, became ill, supposedly with meningitis, and on Saturday morning he was sent to Melbourne, and conveyed to the Base Hospital in an ambulance. At 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon a friend of his went to visit him, but there being .no record of the patient&#39;s arrival those in charge said they had no knowledge of him. The friend, however, was very persistent, and he was given permission to go through the hospital. From 3 o&#39;clock until 4 o&#39;clock this friend searched the hospital without success, and then he was told that, as there was no record, such a patient could not be there. However, as the friend apparently was not satisfied, he was given permission to look through the quarantine ward, and at half-past 4 o&#39;clock some soldiers who had also come from Seymour that day said there was a young fellow on the verandah. This proved to be the man, and the facts disclosed that, although he had been at the hospital from half-past 12 o&#39;clock, no record of his arrival had been made, and he had been left on the verandah without any attention from doctors or nurses. I can quite understand that the nurses and medical men may be overworked, and that the fault may not be theirs; but, at the same time, I am quite satisfied that there could not possibly be, in any other similar institution, such bungling and maladministration. I do not wish to reflect on any person, more especially as I understood from the officer in charge that the attendants had to work exceedingly long hours; but we know that, without good methods or administration, there is bound to be failure. </para>

                            <para>- There is no organization. This young fellow might have been very ill, though I am glad to say he was not suffering from meningitis, and has since recovered. The complaints that have been made show the necessity for the strictest investigation into the methods of the Department regarding hospitals. There is another matter to which I desire to refer, and in regard to which I am sure I shall receive the support of honorable members representing other parts of the Commonwealth. For the past nine months I have repeatedly spoken of the methods adopted by the Postal Department in Western Australia. The administration in the Defence Department is bad enough, but there is no doubt that the administration of the Postal Department, under the present Postmaster-General, is a good deal worse. The Government of Western Australia constructed a railway running through an area of 190 odd miles, and during its construction the State Government carried the mails to the people within that area. As soon, however, as the Railway Commissioner took over the line, the Postmaster-General declined to pay him his charges ; and from that time on, although, I believe, a train has been running daily, it has not carried mail matter in any shape or form, the Postmaster-General having the mails carried by motor cars, which follow the train. Under proper arrangements, the people within this area could receive their letters perhaps once  a  day, or, at any rate, two or three times  a  week; whereas now they receive them only about once a fortnight. With  a  Labour Government in power in nearly every State, the Postmaster-General should be able to bring sufficient pressure to bear on the State Government to compel the Railways Commissioner, if compulsion be necessary, to carry the mails by train, because it is absolutely absurd that one Government should bear the cost of a train, and another Government should have to provide motor cars in order to carry the mails over the same ground. There are several similar instances in Western Australia, and others in South Australia and Queensland; and if some alteration is not made by the time we meet again, I shall move the adjournment of the House in order that the matter may be discussed, because I feel satisfied that I shall have the sympathy and support of honorable members generally. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to emphasize the remarks made by the honorable member for Moreton, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will give them serious consideration. The officers of the Department, or the officers of the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s office, are really setting up a barrier to some of the most faithful men in the Service receiving their just due; and, unless some remedy is found, there will be seething insubordination amongst a big section of the employees. The treatment of these men seems to me to amount to persecution, and it leads to the belief that some of the officers in the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s office, or in the Post Office, are trying to rob the men of the result of the arbitration award. If that be so, it is a most unjust and unwarranted proceeding. </para>
