                    <para>The Military Commandant, Sydney, who was communicated with by telegraph in . connexion with <inline font-style="italic">this</inline> matter, reports that the removal of main Camps in the midst of training  at  high pressure would dislocate the whole system and cause such delay  as  would affect our obligations  to  the Imperial Government in the most serious manner. The many improvements which have been carried out  at  Liverpool  at  considerable expenditure of public money, the establishment of casual camps on a site universally admitted  to  be admirable, all tend  to  remove causes of dissatisfaction. Federal Territory is, moreover,  a  handicap  to  training and administration, owing  to  its distance from principal recruiting centres. Feeding and equipment are costly, owing to difficulty of transport and  too  far from places of embarkation. Considerable expenditure would also be necessary  to  prepare and fit Federal Territory for use. </para>

                        <para>- A letter is published  in  to-day&#39;s newspaper in which the statement is made that the Customs Department is appointing meat inspectors - &#34; a score or two,&#34; to use the words of the writer - and that preference is being shown to  single  men. When the inspection of meat was under the control of the Government of Victoria, thirty or forty inspectors were employed ; but for the greater part of the time that this work has been under the control of the Commonwealth Government, that is, since September this year, only one inspector has been employed, and he is a married man. Three other inspectors were appointed recently, and they are married, and a fourth was appointed to-day. The man appointed to-day is single, but his qualifications were the main consideration. He will have duties to perform in this State, but will be sent to other States also. These inspectors must possess veterinary certificates, and axe chosen because of their qualifications. The qualifications of the man appointed to-day are infinitely superior to those possessed by any other applicant for the position. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member forwarded to me this morning a copy of his question. I may say that I requested the Inter-State Commission to be good enough to furnish Parliament with a report as to new industries which, in its opinion, could now be established with advantage in the Commonwealth. I have looked through the items with which the Commission have dealt, as well as others affected by the Tariff brought in on&#39; 3rd December last, and under which the new duties are being collected. Under that Tariff, which is operative, although not yet on the statute-book, an impetus has been given to a great number of industries. This is noticeable in connexion with the furniture industry, and more especially in regard to the manufacture of chairs. An impetus has also been given to the confectionery trade. A very large factory, I am informed, is to be established here, at a cost of about &#163;50,000, for the manufacture of chewing gum. The manufacture of rubber goods has been greatly encouraged, and certain drugs are also being manufactured hero for the first time, as well as small metal wares, corrugated boxes, strawboard and other boards, glucose, ladies&#39; hand-bags, and many other articles. The Government have under consideration at the present time the proposal to encourage the manufacture of tops, yarns, and the weaving of wool and fabrics from our own raw material. The Inter-State Commission made a suggestion with regard to the introduction of machinery for that industry. Under a Tariff item the Minister has power, subject to departmental by-laws, to admit machinery as machine tools, and the Government have under consideration the advisableness of admitting under that item certain machinery for the top-making and spinning industry, so as to encourage the working up of our own raw material in Australia. </para>

                    <para>Statement relating to the Scheme agreed upon by the representatives of the commonwealth and the States for dealing with the new Wheat Crop. </para>
                    <para>It gives me much pleasure to be able to announce that the Conference of the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States has agreed upon a comprehensive and workable scheme for dealing with the new season&#39;s wheat crop. </para>
                    <para>The news will be received with very great satisfaction all over Australia. To the producers and others directly interested it will remove a load of anxiety and the growing fear, justified by the circumstances, that much of the new wheat crop could not be marketed, and that in consequence the benefits of the bounteous harvest would be lost. The presage of this disaster, coming on the heels of last year&#39;s drought, which brought ruin to some and plunged thousands into debt, filled the minds of the farmers with gloomy forebodings. And satisfaction that a workable scheme has been devised is not confined to the man on the land, but will be felt throughout financial and commercial circles. Every thinking man realizes what failure to market our products at reasonable prices means. The position was and is one that needs to be driven home to every citizen. As a community, we live on what we produce; largely we live on what we sell overseas. Last year we suffered from a drought, and so had little to sell, and are many millions to the bad in consequence. This year, although we have not our normal quantity ot wool to sell, we have very much more wheat than we ever hnd before; and prices of wool and wheat are high. Yet, unless we can find means to transport our produce to the over- seas markets, these high prices cannot help us in any way. It was to the solution of this problem that the wheat conference of the Commonwealth and States directed its efforts. It accepted without question that the successful marketing of our products was absolutely vital to our national as well as industrial welfare. </para>
                    <para>We must sell our products. That is essential. There is no difficulty in finding buyers. The world is clamouring for wheat - the difficulty is to carry the wheat to those who want it. Scarcity of freight is the trouble. Some 25 per cent, of the world&#39;s tonnage is either locked up in enemy ports, or at the bottom of the sea. Another 20 per cent, has been requisitioned by the Admiralty for transport and war purposes. The British Admiralty, so we are informed, has 800 steamers - not including trawlers - and is requisitioning more every day. The enemy&#39;s submarine campaign, although it has suffered a severe check, is still to be reckoned with. Here, then, is the position: With a greater harvest than we ever have had, calling for nearly twice the tonnage normally required, we find ourselves set an almost impossible task if we are asked to transport our surplus wheat to the oversea markets by the end of June next. By supplementing the freight chartered, and to be chartered, with the Commonwealth fleet (of requisitioned and interned enemy steamers), we entertain no doubt whatever that we can carry all the new surplus wheat crop to market within a reasonable time; but we do not anticipate being able to do this in the first six months of next year. This, of course, is most satisfactory as far as it goes, and it may be said at once that, without the aid of the Commonwealth fleet and the co-operation of the British Admiralty, any attempt to transport the exportable surplus of our new crop would be hopeless. </para>
                    <para>But the question is only half solved. The Conference had to consider the position of the farmer who, with wheat to sell, upon the sale of which he is, in fact, depending to pay his way, who cannot sell for six or nine months - for it is certain that the wheat-buying firms would only buy wheat to the extent covered by the freight actually allotted to them, and they would not buy any more until they were allotted more freight, and had sold the wheat they had bought. Let us see what that would mean to the farmer. In December, January, and February, 1013-14. 615,000 tons were exported. Assuming that we are able to obtain an equal amount of freight during December and the first two months of 1916 - we hope to do that, and even more - less than one-half of the estimated amount of wheat available for shipment during that period would be provided for; the remainder would be unable to find transport, and so could not be sold. This difficulty would continue during subsequent months. Other contingencies, too, may arise which would intensify the difficulties of this situation. </para>
                    <para>We must not forget that the Empire is at war, fighting for her very existence, and every arrangement for transport is contingent upon the exigencies of war. All freight is now subject to requisition for war purposes, and, therefore, there is absolutely &#39;no guarantee that ships chartered for the purpose of conveying our wheat or those of the Commonwealth fleet may not be taken by the Admiralty for war purposes. This being so, if we are to avoid disaster, allay uneasiness among producers which may lead to them rushing their wheat upon a local market, which could not absorb it. and so bringing about disaster, arrangements to finance the farmer and to enable him to get, as far as possible, the advantage of the present high prices must be made. This the Conference has done. </para>
                    <para>The scheme, which, as I have already said, covers every phase of the matter, is practicable, and has enlisted the support of the interests necessary to insure its success. </para>
                    <para>The wheat-buying firms and flour millers have unanimously approved it, and agreed to work under it. It has been submitted to, and approved by, some of the ablest business and financial men outside of the shipping interest. </para>
                    <para>Shortly stated, the scheme is as follows: - </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth and the respective State Governments to control the receiving, financing, shipping, and marketing of the whole of the wheat crop of the wheat-exporting States in excess of seed and feed requirements. </para>
                    <para>Methods of Control. - The internal State organization to carry out the responsibilities as outlined in the preceding paragraph, to be arranged by the respective State Governments co-operating with the interest concerned. A London Board, representing Commonwealth and States, is to be appointed, which is to have the co-operation of the London representatives of the principal Australian wheat-buying firms. Government agents are to be appointed to receive wheat on behalf of their respective Governments </para>
                    <para>Agents&#39; Duties. - The Government agents  to  receive the wheat at various centres, to issue certificates, to store and safeguard it, to consign it to various shipping ports, to ship it, and throughout, from reception of shipment, to be responsible for weight, quality, and condition of the wheat. On receipt of the wheat the Government agent to issue a storage certificate showing quality and quantity of wheat delivered. Certificates only to be issued by firm&#39;s chief office in State. Quality to be stated in certificate. If inferior, value to be marked. </para>
                    <para>Advances to Farmers. - Arrangements to&#39; be made for part payment to holders of certificates on the basis of 3s. per bushel f.o.b. at principal ports of shipment. The difference between the amount thus received and the average price received for all the wheat exported from the States, less expenses, including interest, to be paid to the holders of certificates at the close of the season. </para>
                    <para>London Board. - The selling to be intrusted to a London Board. Selling commission and charges to be paid at the rate fixed. The return from sales of each cargo to be credited to the exporting State. Deliveries of wheat under this scheme to cease on 30th September, WIG, and accounts to be paid up. and final payments to farmers to be made subsequent to the sale of the last shipment, probably not later than 30th November. As soon as possible after the sale of the- last cargoes, the Minister to ascertain the net average price realized for the whole of the wheat shipped by his State, and each farmer to bo credited with this rate on the whole of the amount delivered  to  the Government agent. Provision is to be made for supplying millers with wheat sufficient for their requirements at a price to be approximately the London parity. </para>
                    <para>The control of the whole scheme is to be _ vested in a Committee representing the Com- &#34; monwealth and States, with an Advisory Board of experts. </para>
                    <para>These are the main principles of the scheme, which, I venture to believe, will commend itself to the producers and to the community in general. It has behind it the resources of the Commonwealth and the States. It is practicable. All the wheat-buyers and millers are cooperating under it. They are satisfied it is a workable scheme, and are determined to make it a success. Under it every farmer will get a fair deal, and there will be no scramble; every producer who desires it will get an advance without waiting for his wheat to be shipped. And he will get, at the end of the season, every penny of the difference between the advance and the average price realized for the wheat exported from his State less expenses. The arrangement covers all sales of the new season&#39;s crop, and on behalf of the Commonwealth, as well as the responsible Ministers of the respective States, I appeal with confidence to all concerned to lend it their hearty support. </para>

                            <para>- The Government scheme, to be successful, must cover all wheat and all agencies in connexion with, it. I have not considered the position of contracts made prior to the agreement having been entered into, but I will discuss the matter with the State Ministers of Agriculture. It is obvious that there is a wide opening provided by those forward contracts, and unless we are very careful they may hamper the whole scheme. However, I do not wish to commit myself to any statement at this stage. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see that the newspaper could deduce anything of the kind from my remarks. I said that the &#163;500,000 set down for these pensions was a guess, and I pointed out the difficulties that confronted us in making an estimate. For instance, a soldier may die without leaving a will, and his relatives may at that time be well off; but, subsequently, they may be reduced in circumstances, and, should that be the case, it would be the duty of the Commonwealth to look after them. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Fremantle the other day asked whether it is the intention of the Government to grant old-age pensioners resident in State institutions the balance of their pensions after payment of the amount due to the State for their support. The Government have decided to pay the amount in each case. Where an institution receives 8s. per week, and the pensioner is entitled to a pension of 10s. per week, the pensioner will be paid the difference of 2s. per week. On account of the difficulty of the Commonwealth Bank reaching each individual pensioner, the institutions concerned will receive the full pensions and be asked to pay the balance due to pensioners. </para>

                            <para>Victoria being the only State in the Commonwealth where income tax results are fully analyzed, the estimate was based upon Victorian data, separating incomes into that from personal exertion, from property, from combined incomes, and from companies.. From these particulars, on a population basis, the results for all Australia were calculated. Some difficulty has been experienced because of incomplete knowledge concerning incomes from &#163;2,000 per annum upwards. The Commonwealth maximum rate does not operate until the income of &#163;7,600 is reached, so that in respect of this field of income results are based upon a guess. The estimated revenue of &#163;3,000,000 from income tax may be exceeded, but not, I believe, by a large amount. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a technical Bill, and I think that a few minutes be sufficient for my criticism of its general provisions. I notice that the estimated revenue from the income tax, which was made by the ex-Treasurer  a few months ago, has been reduced from &#163;4,000,000 to &#163;3,000,000; but, considering that the total of the loans authorized, and the amount asked for locally, apart from what has been obtained from the Imperial Government is &#163;38,000,000, no doubt the lesser sum will be sufficient to pay interest and a fair sinking fund in respect of our local loan obligations. To what extent the borrowings from the Imperial Government are affected we have yet to learn; probably the Minister will tell us in due course. Before dealing with the clauses of the Bill, I ask honorable members to consider the question of the taxation of State securities. We are left in doubt as to the policy of the Government in relation to the taxation of State securities, and do not know what will be the decision of the High Court or of the Privy Council on the question, whichever tribunal may finally deal with it. The decision might follow the lines of a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, to which I drew attention when speaking on the second reading of the principal Bill. In America, they have decided, with a fair amount &#34;of consistency, that the doctrine of instrumentalities applies to bonds of a State Government and of Congress, or of any public authority created under a State or Federal Act. In the recent Canadian decision, that doctrine, in so far as it relates to the taxation of Federal officers by provincial assemblies, was not followed by the Supreme Court. But it is not fair to the public of Australia, when we can settle a difficulty of this nature, not to &#39; do so. We should declare our meaning in this matter. If, after an Act has become law, a point of interpretation arises, there is, as a rule, thrown on the taxpayer who &#39;objects to the incidence of a particular tax the obligation of bringing the matter to trial before a Court, and he then has to pay the piper for a good many others, who thus have their affairs cleared up without contributing one penny towards the cost of the solution. We are now in a position to state definitely what the law shall be; whether we shall or shall not tax the bonds of the States. I understand that it is the policy of the Government to leave the matter to the determination of the Courts, but why should not the Attorney-General avail himself of Part XII. of the Judiciary Act, which permits of points of this kind being raised for immediate determination by the Court; that is, before litigation has arisen between interested parties? I ask the Treasurer to put the matter before his colleagues, because it is really one of substance; indeed, with all due respect to the Minister, I think that this matter is of far more importance than some of the proposed amendments. I do not think it fair that taxpayers should not be informed whether they should return income derived from State securities. Any decision on the point will apply, no doubt, to both State and Commonwealth securities; in other words, if it be decided that we have the right to tax State securities, it will follow that the States have the right to tax Commonwealth securities, though in the war loan prospectus and in our War Loan Act wa have assumed that we have the power to tax State securities without the States having the power to tax Commonwealth securities. There is another matter which 1 should like the Minister to consider - the alteration of the date on which returns must be furnished. We are altering the mode of assessment in important particulars, and it will be difficult for many of those who are now preparing their returns to alter them in accordance with the amending Act, and have them ready by the date fixed. In some cases, information will have to be obtained from England. A good many persons are in doubt as to what the position will be, and, unless the date is publicly altered, applications will be received from all quarters asking for an extension of time. The Commissioner of Taxes endeavours to meet the public fairly, and an immediate notification of the alteration of date should be made. The first clause of the Bill . deals apparently with the taxation of companies. There are two defects in the Act as it stands. One provision leaves it doubtful what is the source of income derived from a company. Section 10 provides that income tax shall be levied and paid upon the taxable income derived directly or indirectly by any taxpayer from sources within Australia. When the Bill was under discussion the honorable member for Darling Downs and myself drew attention to the fact that the meaning of source of income derived from a company was doubtful. It was decided that the location of the head office of a company should determine the place whence the income from that company had come, and an amendment is now proposed to declare that where the head office is located abroad, the tax shall fall, not upon the whole of the income derived by the shareholder resident in Australia, but upon that portion which has come from Australia. Similarly, if the head office is here, and some of the income earned has been earned abroad, there will be a fair apportionment as regards the tax. </para>

                            <para>- In this instance, an attempt is made to achieve clearness. Another matter arises regarding apportionment. The proviso in section 14 declares that where a company distributes to its members or shareholders any undistributed income accumulated prior to the commencement of this Act, the sum received by the member shall not be included as part of his income. This provision is to be made so that it shall apply only to income that was undistributed prior to the 1st July, 1914, that being the date of the commencement of the year in respect of which the tax is levied. The fixing of the date is fair enough, but difficulties will arise as to what is meant by the proviso, and the matter should be carefully considered. The section speaks of &#34; income received by any member.&#34; The operative part of the section says that the income of any person shall include profits derived from any trade or business. That applies to income whether received or not. Section 10 says that income tax shall be levied or paid in and for each financial year upon taxable income &#34; derived &#34; - &#34; derived &#34; being the dominant word. I think &#34;derived&#34; is the word governing the interpretation of the other clauses dealing with the levying on income. </para>

                    <para class="block">Sayer, the total revenue &#34; derived &#34; by im shall be taken into consideration, and section 28, that for the purposes of assessment and levy of income tax every person who has a total income &#34; derived &#34; from all sources shall make a return. We create confusion by the wording of section 14 and the proposed amendment. What is meant by dividend received? Do the words mean dividend derived? This is a vital matter. By Acts of Parliament which have been adopted in all the States, dividends are now held to accrue from day to day. When a dividend is declared after the death of a shareholder, the point arises what is the period in respect of which the apportionment between those who succeed to his estate and the remainder men should be made? What part of the income tax should be given over to the executors as part of the general estate or capital of the deceased, and what part should be paid to those who succeed after his death as remainder men? Difficulty arises in respect of the period from which apportionment shall take place. Is it the period between the last payment and the next date of payment, or the period between the one declaration of dividend and the next, or the period in respect of which it is declared ? I shall not deal further with the matter now, but the difficulty should be cleared up. A good many men do not know what the proviso to section 14, in respect to the receipt of dividends, really means. I need not worry honorable members with a discussion of other parts of the Bill, which, fortunately, happen to be clearer. The Leader of the Opposition has asked a question as to indents. I take it that clause 3 deals with indent transactions. It provides that if goods are imported in consequence of sales effected here bv an agent who is paid a commission or salary, then the Act shall apply to them. In other words, the tax will fall upon the income represented by 5 per cent, on the proceeds of the sales. If, however, goods are imported from abroad, not through an agent, or through an agent who receives no pay, then income tax will not fall upon the transaction, since it would have been completed outside the limits of Australia. Clause 5 provides that section 18 of the principal Act is not to apply to the section which declares what deductions may be made by a taxpayer from his gross taxable income. It is provided in section 18 that all losses and outgoings, including commission, discount, and travelling expenses, interest, and expenses actually incurred in Australia in gaining or producing the gross income may be deducted. The amendment declares, however, that these outgoings are not to be in the nature of losses and outgoings of capital. If, say, a man invested &#163;10,000 during the year, and lost the whole amount, he could not make that deduction, because similarly, if, as the re.sult of his investment, he had increased the &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000, he would not have been taxed upon the increase, because it would have been an increase of capital. But let us consider the position of brokers who buy and sell. The law of most of the States at the present time provides that they can make such deductions, because they relate to what is part of their ordinary business; whereas an ordinary investment would not be part of the investor&#39;s ordinary business. This amendment will exclude that practice of the States, and money agents and brokers, in endeavouring to make &#163;250 a year, may lose &#163;2,000. This is not fair. I ask the Treasurer to look into the matter, because, under the Bill as it stands, many of these men would be hit very hard if they were not permitted to make these deductions. </para>

                            <para>- The last&#39; amendment of the principal Act to which I shall draw attention is that embodied in clause 8, which provides that when a taxpayer dies on or after the 1st July before furnishing a return of his income from the preceding year, his executors or administrators shall furnish a return of the income derived by him during the said preceding year, and shall be assessable in respect thereof, and chargeable with and pay tax thereon. That, I think is a fair DOS1.tion. There was a flaw in the Act as originally passed. It merely provided that where a man died, say, last February, the tax should be levied on that proportion of his income which was received by his executors from the date of his death; but that portion of his income which was earned during the preceding months was free from taxation. That, defect this clause attempts to cure; but I do not know that it will. Could it be said that a man who died in February last was a &#34;taxpayer&#34; within the meaning of the Act? This amending clause deals with the &#34; taxpayer,&#34; just as the principal section does. I draw attention to this point, because it would be a pity if this attempt to remove a defect in the Act were not a complete success. There is another amendment of the principal Act which so deals with returns as to make absentees liable to furnish them. I had my doubts as to whether such persons were really liable when the Act was passed. Whatever doubt existed on the point, however, will now be removed. These are the technical considerations that have occurred to me, and I have drawn attention to them with the view of helping the Department. </para>

                <para class="block">We have reached a strange pass when the Treasurer of the Commonwealth feels impelled to make the bald statement that he is not in favour of an unrestricted issue of paper money. Surely the day has long since gone when any one, whether he be the Treasurer or a private member, could for one moment think of speaking in the National Parliament in favour of an unrestricted issue of - paper money. Since the honorable gentleman saw fit to make this announcement, I propose today to deal with a few more or less elementary principles which I never thought would need to be handled in an assembly such as this is. The Treasurer stated that the total Australian note circulation on 13th August, 1914, was &#163;9,854,923, of which the banks held &#163;5,032,149 and the public &#163;4,822,774. He stated, also that on the 20th September last the note issue amounted to &#163;36,288,594, of which the banks held &#163;26,389,849 and the public &#163;9,898,745. In other words, from 3rd August, 1914, to the 20th September, 1915, the Australian notes in the hands of the public a little more than doubled, whereas the banks increased by five times their holdings of the notes. That, in itself, seems to me to indicate a very serious position. We are placing the banks in a position in which they are not fully able to safeguard themselves. The Government are so forcing out paper money that the banks have to absorb it at a far greater rate than they would do under normal conditions, and they are now forced to part with their gold to a far greater extent than they ever intended or would have wished to do under normal circumstances. They have still to part with &#163;2,750,000 more gold to the Commonwealth, and to take Commonwealth Bank notes for that amount. In normal conditions, a bank may safeguard itself </para>

But in this case the Government, forced possibly by unusual conditions, have deliberately taken away from the banks one of their strongest safeguards, and that is a substantial metallic reserve. They are forcing the banks to accept paper and to give gold in exchange for it. The result is that the banks are compelled to raise their discount rates more than they would have done under normal conditions. They are forced to charge their clients more for their money than they would have done had the&#62; been allowed to handle this business in their own way. Money would have been much cheaper in Australia if the Government had not forced this extraordinary amount of paper money into the banks and squeezed gold out of them in return for it. </para>

An issue of bank notes can be excessive in two distinct ways. It can be excessive either as against the amount of metallic reserves, or as against the amount required for trade and commerce. In this particular instance, the note issue is excessive in both respects. As already shown by the Treasurer&#39;s statement, the Commonwealth Bank notes in issue on the 3rd August, 1914, were a little over &#163;9,000,000, whereas to-day they amount to over &#163;36,000,000; and it is estimated that on the 30th June, 1916, the Commonwealth notes in issue will represent &#163;45,783,000. Before the outbreak of war, the note issue was only &#163;9,000,000, and it is very plain, therefore, that our trade and commerce cannot properly absorb &#163;45,000,000 of paper money. The position must be brought about here that has been created in every other country which has had an excess of paper money : The result of this excess is that gold is forced out &#39;of the community - that it goes abroad, and prices rise. That occurred in France 200 years ago. It occurred in Italy twenty years ago, and it has occurred in every country that ever tried to force a paper issue. Not only does the gold go out of the country, not only are the people in the country charged more for the use of money, but prices rise because we have too much of one commodity, and not enough of another. Under ordinary conditions, without the Commonwealth having experienced a severe drought, we should have been able to absorb without any danger considerably more money than we can absorb at the present time ; but our trade has been damaged by the tremendous drought which raged throughout the Commonwealth last year, and which still exists in a most acute form in the north of New South Wales, and practically over the whole of Queensland. Our trade and commerce, and the amount of raw products handled, are very much reduced owing to the bad seasons. Even under ordinary conditions we should have had great difficulty in absorbing what is considered to be the ordinary circulation in Australia, namely, from &#163;12,000,000 to &#163;14,000,000, but when our trade and commerce are reduced, and we yet have to absorb a total of &#163;45,000,000 worth of paper money in addition to other currency, it seems as certain as daylight that the effect will be to force uo considerably further the cost of living. I wish to impress upon the Treasurer and the Government that they should, as far as possible, keep the paper money within bounds, because there are not only the dangers which have been proved over and over again in other countries - the driving out of the gold and the depreciation of the notes - but in the meantime we shall be putting a greater burden on those who already are finding the burden becoming heavier and heavier. These are great days for the single man, but it is a hard time for the man with a family. The cost of living is rising at an alarming rate, and the Treasurer&#39;s War Loan statement indicates that the Government are moving in such a way as will assuredly lead to a further increase. The Treasurer has told us that the reserve of gold amounts now to about &#163;14,000,000, and that by the time the &#163;45,000,000 worth of notes is in circulation the reserve will be between &#163;16,000,000 and &#163;17,000,000. I desire to know if the Treasurer cannot devise means by which there shall be a greater reserve against the &#163;45,000,000 worth of notes when that total is in circulation. Because, -unless we have that greater reserve, we shall be placing ourselves in the unfortunate position, that should a financial crisis come, the Commonwealth will be unable to meet it. It is all very well for people to say that 25 per cent, of gold is a sufficient backing against a note issue, but proof has been provided over and over again that such a reserve is not sufficient. We need only look back twenty years to see how Italy, which had reduced its gold reserve to about 28 per cent., found itself in the greatest financial difficulty, from which it escaped only when it raised the gold reserve to 40 per cent. Some people are under the impression that a strong gold reserve is not necessary in these days of extended credit, and that the money lying in the reserve is idle. In reading <inline font-style="italic">Conant&#39;s History of Modern Banks of Issue</inline> I noticed the following statement, which seems to bear with great force on the present position : - </para>

                <para class="block">Unless we have a strong reserve behind our bank notes we shall raise the rate of discount, interfere with the trade of the community, and force up prices, in addition to the fact that the Government, have already interfered with the ability of the banks to lend their money at reasonable rates. The next point I wish to deal with is the statement made by the Treasurer, that the annual amount of interest returned on the present investments of the Commonwealth note fund is &#163;1,018,280. On paper, that result looks very good, and, no doubt, a great many people would believe that the interest on the debt was reduced by about 1 per cent, on account of the amount the note fund is earning. But an analysis of the situation shows that Commonwealth inscribed stock represents &#163;3,830,000 ; New South Wales funded stock, &#163;800,000; Victorian Government debentures, &#163;784,000 ; Western Australian stock, &#163;590,000 ; Western Australian Treasury-bills, &#163;41,250; Tasmanian inscribed stock, &#163;460,000; advances to banks, &#163;211,000; Commonwealth Treasury-bills in aid of revenue, &#163;311,904; and Commonwealth Treasury, for loan purposes, &#163;2,482,227. The whole of that money, with -the exception of the advances to banks, is merely transferred from one public pocket to the other. No real gain is to be made out of any of these transactions, for the people are only lending the money to themselves. That point cannot be too strongly emphasized. When the Commonwealth lends money to the States, the Commonwealth will profit, but the people of Australia still have to provide the money to pay the interest. So that the earnings of the Note Issue are, to a large extent, mythical. I hope that the Treasurer will make the fact plain that where Commonwealth notes are put into Commonwealth investments they actually earn nothing, although on paper they appear to be earning interest, and that where they are invested in State securities they earn money for the Commonwealth, but that money is provided by the people of the States, who are also the people of the Commonwealth. Later, the Treasurer challenged members of the Opposition to mention any possible economies, and he proceeded to say - </para>

Why should the State apply to the Commonwealth for that amount? Having regard to the whole of those items, is there one which could not stand in abeyance? What is the use of our continuing to spend money in this way at a time when the whole future of Australia is at stake? Unless we put all our efforts into winning the war we may be only building up these works for other people. When the Treasurer challenges us to mention where economies can be practised it is only fair to point to those items which though, no doubt, very right and proper under normal conditions, seem to be at the present time, if not a sheer waste of money, at any rate a misdirection of public funds. In regard to the final item of &#163;120,000 for the London offices, whatever may be said about the integrity of Australia - even though we believe that this country is absolutely safe from invasion by the </para>

On any night bombs may rain from the clouds, and the whole building disappear in smoke. The money might be spent more advantageously in Australia in forwarding our defence preparations or improving the conditions of soldiers going to the front. The Treasurer also made the remark, &#34; There is no large leisured class in Australia; nearly everybody works who can get work to do.&#34; After all we have heard from the Government side about the man who lives on the labour of his fellow man, and about the fat man who does nothing to earn the money he spends, such a statement coming from the Treasurer is most refreshing, and seems to be a happy augury for the future. The Treasurer went on to say - </para>

                <para>It seems to me that a statement such as that would very much better have been left unsaid.

There is only one way in which we can make sure that Australia shall meet her obligations, and that is by increasing production. Trade statistics of late years have been very badly against us. Last year, in the case of merchandise, the imports showed a decrease of &#163;15,000,000, and the exports &#163;23,000,000- a difference of &#163;8,000,000. From 1891 to 1913, the exports continuously exceeded the imports, and in one or two cases, notably in 1904 and 1906, did so by over 50 per cent. In 1913 the exports represented 98.5 of the imports, and last year they represented even less. It will be seen, therefore, that the position is becoming positively serious. It is all very well for the Treasurer to say that Australia will not go back on her obligations; but, unless we look the situation in the face - unless we see that production is increased, and alter our luxurious and expensive way of living - we shall have some difficulty in doing so. There is grave fear on the part of many people that, as soon as the war is over, there will be great financial crisis. It seems to me, however, that when the war is over, some little time must elapse before these crises arise; and I think that, if our affairs are handled properly, there need be no real trouble here. When the ex-Treasurer made the agreement with the banks in connexion with the &#163;10,000,000 in gold on account of bank notes, he gave the banks twelve months after the war in which to settle up ; it was agreed, in effect, that for twelve months the banks should be able to use the credit of the Commonwealth. We in Australia will have, at any rate, twelve months after the war, and possibly longer, in which to have a really good time. There should be a great demand for our pro ducts, for Australia is now being advertised as it never was before. Before our boys proved themselves at the Dardanelles and in other parts of the world, many people would have had to consult the map to find where Australia was; but I fancy there are very few in the civilized world to-day who do not know where Australia is, and for what it stands. Altogether, I think that if our affairs are handled properly, we shall have a prosperous and progressive time after the war, in view, not only of the great demand for our primary products, but of a great influx of desirable immigrants. Only one trouble can assail us, and that is the bad handling of our finances. </para>

                        <para>- We have heard that sort of thing before. After all, the deaths owing to the war, numerous as they appear, are not anything like so numerous as those which occur under conditions of plague and drought in various parts of the world. The deaths from the war are brought before our eyes in all their horror, and we realize them fully; but I think that plague, drought, and shortage of food are, at times, responsible for quite as many. There will still be plenty of people left when the war is finished, and plenty to raise the country to a great height of prosperity under new ideals and methods. We must cut away luxury and waste at the top, and idleness at the bottom; people are now realizing their responsibilities, not only to themselves and their families, but to their country and the world at large ; and I hope that the present Treasurer will realize the responsibility that devolves upon him. He should see that we are placed on a thoroughly sound financial basis, and that when we return once more to the ordinary ways of trade and commerce, we shall be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that will present themselves - to take full advantage of the possibilities of Australia, and the advertisement that it has received throughout the world. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret very much that the Committee stage has been passed. I take it, however, that the whole scheme of Government finance is still open for review, and that the discussion on the principles of this Bill will necessarily and naturally have relation to the whole financial proposals of the Government, so that, after all, not very much has been lost by the steps just taken, which, I confess, were a surprise to me. In connexion with this proposal to borrow another &#163;18,000,000 for war purposes, the Minister submitted to the House a memorandum setting out a general financial statement that, I presume, is to take the place of the ordinary annual Estimates. For the life of me, I cannot understand, even yet, despite all the explanations that have been offered, why the ordinary Estimates have not made their appearance. The only reason offered so far is that certain payments are being made by the Imperial Government, and that no account of these has yet been submitted to this Government. May I say, with all respect, that no excuse for the non-production of the annual Estimates concerning the civil administration of a Government could be more trumpery or less conclusive than that is. Why cannot an estimate be made of the probable outgo in this connexion? Our own authorities surely know what the soldiers at the front are costing. They know what the Imperial Government will probably have to pay. They ought to know it, and they do know it, to a man ; and just why we should wait for this account to be submitted in detail by the Imperial Government before the Estimates are submitted to this House I cannot for the life of me understand. Suppose the Imperial Government renders no account for many months. Are we, then, to have no Estimates at all within the financial year ? To my mind, the whole thing is preposterous. I cannot understand why there should be any obstacle in the way of the production of the ordinary Estimates to this House. Has the Minister any idea when they are likely to be submitted? I take it that when the House rises we shall adjourn over Christmas well into the New Year. I have, indeed, heard March mentioned from that side of the House as the probable date of the re-assembling of Parliament. </para>

There is nothing to prevent our looking into all the Government Departments and scrutinizing their expenditures. Rather by reason of the war is there <inline font-style="italic">greater</inline> need for closely examining our ordinary expenditure, which is going on day after day without any attempt being made to check it. Nothing is being done to cut down unnecessary expense. </para>

What I say is that all extravagance in all civil occupations in this&#39; country, and in all branches of the Government, falls with crushing effect on the working men of the country. If our Estimates are swollen by &#163;4,000,000 or &#163;5,000,000, that is &#163;1 per head of the population. By the time the effect of the increase reaches the working men of the country, the amount is well on to 30s. or &#163;2 per head. If the honorable member thinks it will be a good thing for the working men of the country for extravagance to continue, why does he not double the Estimates, and bring down a Bill for twice the amount now sought ? </para>

Perhaps he does not desire it to be pointed out. All I can do is to discharge my obligation to the country - including the working men of the country - in this matter. If they are content, at all events I shall have carried out my task. But I do protest that the House is losing its control over the country&#39;s finances. </para>

The test of extravagance should not be what we can do with. We could do with many millions more than are being spent in the development of the country. Not- a member of this House but does not want lots of things. But during war time that should not be the test. The only one supreme test to be applied both to private finance and public finance is - What is the minimum that we can do with until we have seen this war, with all its tremendous burden of obligation, financial or otherwise, through? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; and, therefore, we need to re-adjust our point of view in relation to the finances of the Government and to the developmental work that is proceeding - all of which might be quite proper and appropriate in ordinary times. Under this heading come many of the public works that everybody agrees are necessary for the development of the country. But, first of all, had we not better decide whether the country is to be ours to develop before we spend all these extra millions upon it? It is useless our attempting to develop the country if some other power is going to get it at the end of the war. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to say - and I have said it before - that, in my opinion, the man who is making inordinate and unfair profits in war time and keeping them is worse than any extravagance on behalf of the working man. There is this to be said for the working man, that, at the most, he gets nothing but a bare living, whereas the man who is extracting unfair and inordinate profits out of the war is violating the instincts of patriotism, I do not care who he may be. I have yet to learn that this Government have taken any course which is likely to interfere with such profits, though I know that some of those whom Ministers used to set up as bogies - as the representatives of the great capitalistic concerns of the country - are now entering their offices, and on coming out again expressing their profound admiration of them. Only the other day I learned from an Adelaide newspaper that certain gentlemen against whom Ministers have fulminated in and out of this House for as long as I can remember now say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is the finest man they have met. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make it clear that I am here to safeguard, before all other things, the interests of the working man in connexion with Government finance and administration. It is only reasonable that we should have an opportunity to criticise the departmental Estimates. The war account with the Imperial Government could be estimated and re-adjusted later with Supplementary  Estimates. Nothing could be easier. We have been accustomed to Supplementary Estimates from the beginning. I say advisedly that the expenditure of each of the Departments should be carefully scrutinized. I believe that it is swollen, and that the administration is extravagant, having regard to the needs of the country at the present time. A War Committee has been appointed which is supposed to look into matters affecting the country&#39;s financial position, but it has been given little to do. It is not much more than a Red Cross Committee, its efforts being confined chiefly to the mitigation of the consequences of the war. It has little to do with the prosecution of the war, and the consideration of Defence measures or general finance. The House of Commons, on the other hand, discussed the matter of financial administration very thoroughly, and, with the approval of the Treasurer, appointed a special Committee, which is now making an investigation into the ramifications of the Civil Service administration of the Empire. Nothing of the kind has been attempted here. Year in and year out our expenditure and our taxation are increasing. Honorable members opposite forget the economic truth that taxation in the long run always falls in the main upon the working man. No matter who may be hit first, the working man in the long run bears the brunt of all taxation. </para>

                <para>With regard to the Budget speech of the Treasurer, I repeat the congratulations which I offered to him the other day on its perfect- orthodoxy. It could not have been more impeccable, or unexceptionable. Some of its statements must have made the honorable member for Bourke smile, as. for instance, the initial statement that the experience of nations has shown that the sphere of usefulness of a note issue is limited. The Treasurer is not in favour of an unrestricted issue of paper money. He told us that the general public can absorb only a certain quantity of paper money, and that there is no function for the rest except to serve as till-money for the bankers. </para>

Having stated that the public debt of Australia exceeds &#163;300,000,000, he asked in tones of challenge what particular item of State loan expenditure honorable members would have curtailed if they had had the power. He might very well have addressed his own followers in particular when making that challenge, because, if there has been one thing more than another that they have criticised in the past, it has been the borrowing of Liberal Governments. Yet the Treasurer of the present Labour Administration says, by implication, that everything has been done properly and in order, and challenges any one to say that even so much as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> of the money borrowed was misspent, or spent extravagantly. </para>

He is on the opposite side of the table, but after his recent deliverance T think he should be over here. If ever there was a good Liberal, economic deliverance, it was his financial speech of last week. I challenge any member on this side to say that there was a sentence of it which they would have altered. The honorable gentleman told us that &#34; there is no large leisured class in Australia &#34; ; &#34; that the whole of the people of Australia are workers if they can get work to do.&#34; He also mentioned &#34; that valuable assistance had been given by the financial institutions, the stock exchanges, and the press throughout Australia.&#34; The financial institutions and the stock exchanges ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not; but for some years the attitude of the party now in power has been that of keeping the States a little too much at arms&#39; length. If there had been more cooperation, many a time friction would have been obviated, and the consequent waste, financially and otherwise, would have been avoided. Let us remember always that the Federal Constitution is showing itself in these troubled days more than ever to be a flexible instrument of government, capable of meeting every crisis that may arise in our national existence. Where, for instance, could we have a greater triumph of the Federal principle than we have in the financial arrangement that has just been made in regard to the Murray waters? Almost from time immemorial the States have been in keen conflict over the question of navigating the rivers of Australia, and all the while the provision for navigation has been embedded in our own Constitution. This is only one instance indicating the financial friction that has obtained between the States and the Commonwealth to the great disadvantage of the whole. </para>

                <para>Altogether, on the financial side in particular, the Commonwealth Constitution, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> so often declared to be the worst in the world, has shown itself to be a really flexible instrument of Government, capable of meeting the needs even of these times. I welcome the statement of the Treasurer that he is for harmony between the States and the Commonwealth. It was, perhaps, one of the most notable statements he made. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but my impression is that you can be in harmony with him if you seek the point of justice. In all these controversial matters there is a point of justice. My long experience in adjusting differences is that if you seek earnestly for this point of justice - meeting round a table, and in an amicable way, each looking at the other&#39;s point of view - you are likely to secure a proper adjustment rather than by keeping each other at arms&#39; length. That has been demonstrated many a time, I think, in the honorable member&#39;s own experience. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer&#39;s statement relating to the note issue is also to be welcomed. I hope the honorable gentleman has made up his mind that the extension of the note issue cannot safely go very much further. It amounts at present to &#163;45,000,000, and the Treasurer&#39;s declaration that he would not interfere with the statutory gold backing - nay, that he would provide during the war time a reasonable margin, in addition - is very welcome to the House. The matter is one that is beginning to cause concern in many financial circles other than our own. It cannot be too strongly emphasized, as the Treasurer has admitted - and I congratulate him again on the admission, which was&#34; one that we could never obtain from his predecessor in office- that the issue of Australian notes is simply a scheme of deferred borrowing. The honorable gentleman himself admits that the redemption of these notes must come at the end of the war - that the public need at the most only &#163;10,000,000 of them, and that the remaining &#163;35,000,000 will require to be redeemed when the war is over. He should have added to his statement that the public debt of Australia- </para>

Gold, therefore, is better than notes, notwithstanding that the credit of the country is behind them; for, when the gold is there, prices do not appreciate. If prices appreciate when notes are substituted for gold, then, by so much as they appreciate, the notes must be worse than gold. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George went on to say - </para>

                <para>It is an easy and very tempting method to inflate the paper currency of the country. You appear to get over your difficulties in the simplest way, and it is very difficult for any one to point out the way you are going wrong for some time. Looking at it most carefully it is simply an indirect method of levying taxes upon the income of the people. You water the currency and the prices go up. </para>
                <para class="block">The honorable member for East Sydney, who interjected &#34;Stinking fish!&#34; just now, will say, perhaps, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#39;</inline> Lloyd George was crying &#34; Stinking fish ! &#34; when addressing himself in this way to the great financial problem of the Empire. It is a note of caution that cannot be too often sounded in our ears that, while the note currency of the country may tide us over our difficulties, its redemption must always be kept steadily in view. While the notes are operative, no matter whether they are in the coffers of the banks or in general circulation, they all mean, in the last resort, an increase in the price of goods, and are, therefore, a detriment, more particularly to the working people. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that. I know, also, that every nation that is expanding its note issue is paying dearly for it. Germany is the most notorious example of all. True, the gold in her coffers is still practically what it was at the beginning of the war. While it is a little less, the reduction is not material ; but she has flooded the country with paper money. The destruction of her commerce on the high seas having taken place, she is no longer, however, under obligations to finance her oversea commerce, and in that respect she has an advantage over Great Britain. While we purchase hundreds of millions of pounds&#39; worth of goods abroad, we have to finance all these exchanges on a gold basis, and this is giving rise just now to a very serious problem in the Mother Country. The material resources of Great Britain do not suffer, but, temporarily, there is the greatest possible trouble in the matter of this financing. This was seen the other day when, in order to finance their total obligations in America, amounting to &#163;300,000,000 or &#163;400.000,000, they could float a loan of only &#163;100,000,000, and they had to provide collateral security, and to pay for it an amount aggregating, I think, about 5 per cent. This illustrates the difficulties associated with financing our foreign trade. Germany&#39;s foreign trade has been destroyed, and this has had the effect of relieving its finances internally. While Germany is issuing paper money, it proceeds to fix the price of everything in the country, and so maintains the parity of the paper money within the country while the war lasts. But there is a terrible time coming for Germany when the war is over, and T cannot see that there can be anything but financial collapse for that country. It is not interfering seriously with the conduct of the war, because her finances have been relieved by the destruction of her commerce on the high seas, and the necessity for financing it on a gold basis has been obviated. </para>

                        <para>- I have not heard that it depreciated. I only know that America is making immense profits out of this war. She is doing better out of it than any other nation, but that is a point, which I do not wish to stress. I welcome the Treasurer&#39;s declaration that he recognises the danger of financing by means of paper money, and that every care will he taken to keep the issue within a moderate and reasonable volume until thu war is over. I welcome particularly his declaration that at the end of the war these notes must be redeemed, and redeemed at the earliest possible moment. All notes issued over and above the immediate requirements of the circulation of the country are so much deferred borrowing on the part of the Government. </para>

                    was always telling us that he was financing all the requirements of the Commonwealth without borrowing.  His  successor in office as Treasurer has frankly told us, however, that the note issue is simply a system of deferred borrowing,
                </para>
                <para class="block">And it means borrowing just as much as if he put a loan on the market to-morrow. He relieves himself in this way of payment of a little interest, but, as to the capital, the redemption of these notes must take place at the conclusion of the war. It will be seen that the public debt of the Commonwealth is as follows : - Total debts, as stated by the Treasurer, &#163;57,802,861; money yet to be raised for war purposes, &#163;24,000,000; total, &#163;81,802,861. Adding to that amount the &#163;30,000,000 worth of notes to be redeemed when the war is over, and, therefore, only deferred, but to which the Commonwealth is committed, we arrive at a total Commonwealth debt of &#163;111.802,861. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but it does not reduce the capital. I am speaking of the total loan obligations. I should say, however, that we must deduct the &#163;18,000,000 lent to the States, leaving the net indebtedness of the Commonwealth, deferred and actual, at an amount of &#163;93,802,861. If we now add the towering State debts of &#163;355,000,000, which seem to be ever taking their course upwards regardless of the war, and of which there seems no curtailment or cessation, the total public indebtedness of Australia at the present time works out at about &#163;448,80,2,861. * </para>

                        <para>- I am not analyzing the debt, but I am pointing out that it is a debt to be paid at some time or other. There are assets backing the whole of the sum borrowed by the States, and the Treasurer has challenged us to point to one sixpence of that money which ought not to have been borrowed. He has given for ever the answer to all the statements we have heard from the Government, and the party they represent, inside and outside of Parliament, as to the borrowings by Liberal Governments in past times. According to the Treasurer, every shilling of those loans is justified. I welcome a statement of that kind, because I think it is of use to the country. </para>

                <para>I prepared those figures relating to our indebtedness in order to indicate the need that exists for caution and scrutiny regarding the financial operations of both State and Federal Governments at this time. In recent years there has been an alarming increase in the borrowings of Australia, apart altogether from loans for war purposes. In the State of New South Wales we&#39; have the shocking example of an increase of &#163;37,000,000 in the public debt during the last four years for the purposes of State development alone. I wish I could be sure that the whole of that money has been spent according to strictly commercial principles, and all I am contending for now is that for every pound we spend, particularly in these strenuous war days, we should see that we get full value. That is one of the principles laid down so admirably by the Treasurer in his statement. I think our taxation has pretty well reached the end of its tether for some time to come. </para>

                        <para>- When we have two land axes, two income taxes, two probate taxes, super taxes to boot, absentee taxes on the top of them, increased charges of all kinds, and a high Customs revenue, we have gone to nearly the full length of our resources. We could go further, I admit. I am not suggesting that our taxation resources have been exhausted, but I do say that we have pone as far as we ought to go for a long time The other day I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth</inline></para>

                    a statement on British finance, by Edgar Crammond, one of the best financial writers in the Old Country, and he gave the Imperial taxation at &#163;3 5s. per head. The Prime Minister, \ whAn introducing the Income Tax Bill recently, grouped all taxes in the Old Country, municipal and all other imposts, and endeavoured to show that the total was very high indeed. I think he made the total between &#163;5 10s. and &#163;5 15s. per head; but
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crammond</inline>
                    shows that &#163;3 5s. per head is the total amount of the taxation of the Old Country at the present time. In Australia, we are far beyond that amount; and I say that I do not think this double taxation can go much further in the ratio in which it is proceeding. It is not as if relief were being afforded in other directions. I could understand some of this taxation being in substitution of some other form of impost which was being remitted, but there is no proposition of that kind. The Commonwealth still collects &#163;3 per head through the Customs, in addition to the high taxation which is piling up continuously until the people are beginning to wonder where it is all going to end. All the States are spending more, and the trouble is that the
                    <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline>
                    cost of governing Australia is increasing at an alarming rate. I find that, in the year 1909-10, the total expenditure of the States and the Commonwealth was &#163;55,561,372, equal to about &#163;13 6s. per head. The total expenditure last year was &#163;91,689,625, an increase from &#163;13 6s. per head to &#163;18 10s. per head, or 40 per cent. Most of that increase relates itself to the cost of government. An increase in expenditure of 40 per cent, in six years should give us all pause. It is time for a scrutiny of all expenditure; it is time for economy, and for shearing down instead of multiplying our out-goings as we are doing from time to time. I understand that when storms arise&#34; at sea ships shorten sail, and steamers heave to until there is calm weather. Financial storms are blowing* over us in Australia, but our ship of State takes in no sail ; our steamer continues to go full steam ahead in the face of the gale..
                </para>
                <para>The application of all these facts, from my point of view, is simply that increased taxation and extravagant government must inevitably express itself in the higher cost of living, and that is where the problem comes home to the working man. They mean, also, impoverished and inefficient industries. In the form of loan money, we are drawing from the working capital of the Commonwealth, and that is a serious step to take in any country, more particularly in a young and undeveloped one. As to our capacity to bear the burden, I hope I shall not be understood to be casting any doubt. With the Treasurer, I believe that our capacity is equal to any burden in prospect, and the more we investigate the figures the more we find ourselves able to stand the strain. But remember, always, that we use this money in war time at the cost of the development of the country in the final resort, and also at the cost of the working man, because to him it expresses itself in the higher cost of living. I thought it well to call the attention of the House to these facts, and to stress the need for economy. That is the outstanding requirement of the moment. The great imperatives are, and will continue to be until the war is over, more men and money. We must continue borrowing from our working capital, and our surplus. There is no other source of money in Australia. As the Treasurer has said, there is no large leisured class in the Commonwealth, and there are no large vested funds of wealth on which to draw. All the money for the prosecution of the war must be drawn from the working capital or from savings, which, in a new country, ought always to be utilized in development. In this country, as in every other country, more particularly every young country, we are living from day to day, and from month to month, and there are limits to even the idea of taxing the wealth of the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mallock,</inline> in discussing, in the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century,</inline> recently, the limits of super taxation even in Great Britain, showed that if the aggregate of all incomes in Great Britain over &#163;700 . a year were applied to war purposes they would cover the expenditure on the war for only four months. If those incomes were taxed at 10s. in the &#163;1, it would cover the war expenditure for two months, and if taxed at 7s. in the &#163;1, for six weeks and a half. It will be see&#187;&#62; therefore, that to prosecute the war at Home, although wealth may be taxed, it is still necessary to draw on the ordinary income of the country, and extract a great sum from the working capital and the enterprise of the people. Here we are taxed up to 5s. in the &#163;1, and from that taxation on wealth we get only &#163;3,000,000. I direct attention to this, because it is often said that we ought to conscript the wealth of the country for the purpose of carrying on the war. We are conscripting the wealth to the extent of 5s. in the &#163;1 ; and yet that only gives us an income of &#163;3,000,000 with which to meet our obligations arising out of the war. </para>
                <para>I am afraid that we are carrying on this war with a light heart, even &#34;yet, in Australia, particularly from a financial point of view. Earnest minds in other parts of the world, and particularly in Great Britain, are devoting themselves to the consideration of the finances as these will present themselves, and as they are related to the aftermath of the war. One writer has pointed out that we should aim at an ideal which will give us, when we have beaten the German, still a million men with which to reap the results of the war. If we bleed ourselves white in the matter of finance, and bleed ourselves to death in the matter of manhood, the fruits of victory may slip from us even when we have won the war. We saw this in the case of Bulgaria, which, when it had beaten the Turk, was so exhausted that the fruits of the victory were taken away. Therefore, this writer points out that we ought to have a million men left, or we shall not be able to avail ourselves of the full advantages of victory. The same may be said in regard to our finances. London is the financial centre of the world, but if London is bled white in the effort to prosecute the war, there is danger of the financial supremacy passing to America, or some other neutral country whose financial resources are intact. Clearly, therefore, the more vigour we can put into the prosecution of the war, the more money we shall save in the end and the better position we shall&#39;be in to reap the results of victory after winning it fairly in the field. </para>
                <para>I shall not trouble the House further with regard to these matters, which I regard as of first importance, and to which I refer in order to stress the need of both private and public economy. We ought to get it firmly fixed in our mind that the more we can save in our ordinary outgoings the better we shall be conserving the financial interests of the Empire at large. We should, therefore, stop all waste, both private and public - private waste in the shape of luxuries and comforts, holidays, sports, household expenses, and superfluities - and, if there ought to be that curtailment in the case of the individual, there is an equal obligation on the part of the Government to stop all waste and to observe national thrift. </para>

Under such circumstances, there ought to be no unemployed problem in Australia, and I do -not believe there is any serious problem of the kind at the present time. With the harvest coming on, there ought, indeed, to be a shortage of men instead of a surplus. Why, therefore, should we be so squeamis&#34;h about a little money, which otherwise would go in this, that, or the other operation, as for instance, in building a house ? Let us build all the houses we can; but let us take care that the money is not needed for war purposes before we do. If I have shown the need of economy, I shall have done what I set out to do. I emphasize the fact first, last, and always, that what we need to-day in our Commonwealth and State finances is economy, thrift, enterprise, increased production - anything that will add to our material resources, and assist in bringing the war to a speedy and successful end. </para>

                        <para>- I had intended to move the- adjournment of- the House to-day, had I. been here, im order to refer to. this matter int detail; but,, under the circuntstamces, I shall allow it to&#62; stand, over. In a. genera1! way, however, I may say that the Defence- Department- undertook to have- these men brought back into, camp almost immediately after their- desertion. Steps were*. taken the moment it was heard they had escaped;- and, before one1 train reached Melbourne, a number of them were arrested at Caulfield. Prom then until now, in spite of threats: of publication, of their names - and it: is- nearly three weeks ago - the&#39; bulk of the men are still at large-. L shall say nothing further now, except; to impress; on the Treasurer and the* Government: that the House, ought: to be more- liberally supplied with&#39; information&#39;, concerning- the administration of the Defence1 Dep&#39;aEtmenit, so that helpful criticism might be forthcoming at a. time like this, when every man is- anxious to assist. At the; time this: occurred! at Langwarrin,, a suggestion, of mine would.,, 1 think, have proved effective in securing the return of the men.. Instructions ought to have been given to every Camp Commandant to&#62; recall all the men on leave, beause, had) this been done,, the civil and military, police could have been directed to arrest any one* found at large in uniform). </para>

                    <para>.- I also wish to offer my congratulations- to the honorable member for Capricornia on his accession to office, and also on the able report he has placed before the House. The honorable gentleman,, in the course of his remarks, said that we in Australia are floating, our loans at par,, and that if 20,000,000 of a British population, could carry a. national debt of &#163;900,000,000 in. 1816, our Australian population, of about 5,000,000 should be able to raise and carry a. national war. debt, of a fourth of that amount. . The honorable gentleman evidently expects that Australia will be able to go on borrowing and raisin? loans to an amount of &#163;225,0.00,000, but he does not point out. to the House that Australia is already indebted to the extent of &#163;350.,000,000Hnder the circumstances, his argument does- not come with any great- force-. However, what I am most anxious about is the manner in which the Government is spending- money. When we find that their- expenditure, over and above- their revenue, is something&#39; like &#163;3,500, 000: - ordinary peace* expenditure&#39; - it is high time to call a- halt. We are told that we require men, money; and munitions, and that we- ought to- keep intact all- reserves for the purpose of raising money for the prosecution of the war. In answer to the honorable nj&#187;mber for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition said that, in his opinion, money would be better invested in a war loan than in buiTdi-nsr a house, and I say that the men who would otherwise be employed&#39; on that house would be better employed in the prosecution of the war. Instead of these men being- engaged in building houses- the industries of the country should have been mobilized for the purpose of successfully prosecuting th&#169; war, and they ought to have been employed in the manufacture of munitions. In this respect we are a long way behind1 other countries. Canada, a country similar to our own, has manufactured munitions to the extent of &#163;50,000,000, Africa has done the. same to the extent of &#163;8,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- The statement was made, in a leading Sydney newspaper-; and I think the: figures caxu be substantiated. In-, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> of last Saturday, in an article on the Japanese Budget, Dr. Bryant pointed out that the Japanese finances last year showed a deficit of 10,000,000 yen. This was being met by the postponement of public works and the acceptance of contracts for the manufacture of munitions. So far, the article stated, contracts have been accepted to the extent of 100,000,000 yen. Japan realized that she must cut down her public works expenditure and go in fox the manufacture of goods mostly in demand. No factory in the Commonwealth could be better employed at the present time than in the manufacture of munitions, because no item of manufacture will produce a bigger revenue. If we could manufacture munitions on a big scale, there would be a steady flow of gold into the land, and with this we could discharge all our obligations overseas. In her trade relationships with America, the balance is now against Great Britain, because of the demand for munitions from America;and if we could follow in the footsteps of Canada and South Africa, we should be helping forward the cause of the Empire better than in any other way. Quite recently the Government introduced -a proposal to spend &#163;800,000on new works. In my view, these works should be suspended. It is all very well for honorable members to say we must find employment; but, as the honorable member for Parramatta pointed out, 170,000 of our manhood have already been withdrawn from the various avenues of industry. The labour market has, therefore, been relieved to that extent, and, under these conditions, I think we ought to slacken off our public works. What particular advantage is it to this country, for instance, to continue that railway in the Northern Territory? </para>

                        <para>- I should say so. But, judging by the experience of the Brisbane, the construction of a new vessel - I think it is to be namedthe <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide -</inline> is the last thing that we desire at the present juncture, as it will be of no assistance in the prosecution of the war. The other day 3,500 railway men in Sydney offered to the Government their services for use in the manufacture of munitions. Their offer was turned down because as the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> said, he could not accept it as it would interfere with the labour market. Some months ago 12,000 men in London made a similar offer. Their services were gladly accepted. These people are now hard at work helping the cause of the Empire, but in Sydney the unions would not let the men work. We must be earnest about this matter. Every hour wasted is an hour given to the Germans ; every bushel of wheat lost through lack of labour in the country districts is a bushel of wheat given to the Germans; the labour of every thousand men who go on strike is so much labour given to the Germans. We must look this matter earnestly in the face, dropping all our differences, and make a unanimous effort to successfully prosecute the great undertaking to which we are committed. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not going to allow this opportunity to pass without, to some extent, repeating what I said a little while ago regarding the Government&#39;s attitude towards the supply of armaments. In this respect, we are not doing at all what we could. I hope some of the money we are now voting will be spent in expediting the output of arms and ammunition, that are required even more than men at the front. Hitherto this Government, by its lethargy and its absolute subservience to the officials, who, rather than be told what they ought to do, will persist in doing the wrong thing------ </para>

                        <para>- I am just coming to that point. It is because we have a new Government, or a Government new in parts - the old Government re-patched - that I wish to impress upon it the feeling of the country, so far as I have been able to gather it, as to what the Government ought to be doing. Sending men to the front is not sufficient; we all know that, and it is high time the country was regimented to a greater extent than it has been for meeting the demands of the war and the employment of men on work for which they are best fitted. The other day the Minister of Defence issued a pious edict intimating that private firms would be required, as far as their plants were capable of turning out munitions, to give first place to that trade. This sounds very well, but what are the Government doing to back it up? By its own folly, by its own innate lack of initiative, the Government have, to my own knowledge, deliberately left idle for two years works that could have materially assisted our output. I have hammered at the subject time and time again without anything having been done. To-day, I admit, a Commission has been appointed to settle a dispute that should have been settled two years ago. The output lost as the result of this would have placed us in a much better position than we are for fighting the battles of the Empire. In regard to the Small Arms Factory, the acme of folly was reached some time ago by an entirely premature announcement about shifting it, and that has done more to retard the output of arms than anything else. That action still stands to the discredit of the Government, and some definite pronouncement is yet required in order that the position may be cleared up. The town of Lithgow is now in a state of congestion, and the public health is being affected as a result of that condition, because people are not prepared to accommodate the extra hands engaged at the Factory until they know what is in contemplation. The Factory ought to be working three shifts, not two. It is idle for the Minister to say that it is impossible. Here, again, he is under the control of his superior officers - I use the words advisedly - who will brook no interference, and, because they are military men, seem to think that they know everything from A to Z in business matters. Only the other day, I had to communicate with a military officer in regard to something which I thought was under his control, but was not, and he told me that he was disgusted with the position of affairs. &#34; I have spent my lifetime,&#34; he said, &#34; in qualifying to train men to fight as soldiers, and I have now got to look after a camp, to see that men arc fed and washed, and to do work that any business man could do, but for which I am not fitted. My talent is therefore being wasted.&#34; Those in authority will not brook interference. The Small Arms Factory should be working three shifts a day ; but there is not at Lithgow accommodation for an extra shift, because the townspeople have lost heart. They cannot be expected to speculate in house property when a change such as has been announced by the Government is hanging over their heads. The value of their property has been decreased by the announcement of the Government that the Factory will oe removed to Canberra. It behoves Ministers to repair the injustice that has been done, which has not only injured the citizens of Lithgow, but has also materially interfered with the output of munitions of war at the Factory. The Government should let it be known definitely that it is not going to remove the Factory from Lithgow. When that has&#39; been done, the townspeople will resume their wholehearted attitude towards the assistance of operations, and will facilitate the&#39; accommodation of those who are to be employed there. There is no valid reason why three shifts should not be worked at the Factory, and why temporary accommodation should not be found there for the extra machinery that has been ordered; though I doubt that that machinery will arrive in time to be of use during the war. When it does arrive, however, it should be installed immediately, wherever it can be used to the greatest advantage, and all machinery for the manufacture of small arms should be under the same roof and the same management. I urge the new members of the Ministry to display their business acumen by getting the best results possible in this time of stress from the machinery and resources available, and not to waste time in building castles in the air, and in speculating as to the future construction of a paradise which, if we do not get busy in other directions, we shall never inhabit. </para>

                        <para>- A short time ago I was  chairman  of a meeting which was addressed by a young fellow who had returned wounded from Gallipoli. He devoted two hours to an interesting account of his experiences, in which he spoke highly of his officers, and said that the doctors and nurses were doing magnificent work, and found little or no fault with anything. As to the serving out of equipment on the return voyage to Australia, his statement was that so far as the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat</inline> - the vessel on which he returned - was concerned, everything was in first-class order. But, he said, &#34; There is one thing I should like to emphasize. I do not know whether I should mention the matter, because I am still in uniform : but, in my opinion, many of the fellows who go are too young.&#34; Subsequently, in conversation, having asked him to dinner, I learned that there were many things which he could not say publicly, and he told me that a great reason why boys should not be taken was that the corruption and iniquity at Cairo were so great that they ought not to be allowed to face the temptations awaiting them there. In my opinion, at eighteen a boy is not sufficiently developed physically to make a good soldier. The honorable member for Balaclava savs that boys enlist in the British Army at eighteen years of age; but, generally speaking, a recruit of that age undergoes some years of training before being sent into the field. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In any case, they move slowly in Great Britain. I understand that the list of contraband goods published by the British Government at the beginning of this war is the same as was published during the Napoleonic wars, and eighteen may have been fixed &#34;as the age for enlistment many years ago. In any case, lads of that age who join the British Army usually receive some years of training before being sent to the front. The honorable member for Flinders has stated that at eighteen a lad is too young to serve in the field, and I agree with him. We should have some definite statement from the Government on this subject. It is a shame that young fellows under twenty-one years of age should be sent away when there are many considerably under forty-five years of age who stay at home. </para>

                        <para>- This question of the age of enlistment has been raised once or twice by honorable members, but the Government are still calling upon young men of eighteen years and upwards to volunteer. I should be glad if the Treasurer would give us the views of the Government on the subject. If they are determined to allow lads of eighteen to enlist I do not know that we can do more than we have in the matter. Another question to which I wish to direct attention is that of the delivery of letters in Egypt. The delivery is not yet by any means satisfactory. Among others deputed to visit Egypt and report on the subject of mails was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keith</inline> Murdoch, an Australian journalist who was proceeding to London, and I should like to know whether a report from him has been received. The question is of great importance, especially to our men in Egypt. A friend of mine who occupies a high position in one of the battalions at the front, wrote to me as follows regarding the position in Egypt - </para>

                    <para class="block">Extension Company &#39;or of the Egyptian Post Office. I only wish I had the job for a month. Letters are more important than anything else  here- -even than food or rest. &#39;To see the fellows -on mail day would gladden the eyes of the senders. It brings back thoughts of home. There are many cases where men, . after spending . some time in Egypt, have left  for the -front without receiving -even -one letter from home. This is very hard, not only &#39;on the soldiers at the front, . but on their fr-iends in Australia.. A wounded soldier who recently returned from Egypt told some of my friends that -a leading officer in a battalion to which he belonged had not received one letter from Australia. This officer one day asked him whether he had. received -a letter by a certain mail, and on being told that he had, wept almost like a child, saying, &#34; I have not received a letter since I left home. I am forgotten.&#34; As a matter of fact, his wife and children have been writing to him regularly, but none of their letters have been delivered. The wounded soldier to whom I have referred, and who took part in the landing at Gallipoli, said that since returning home he had learned that fifty or sixty letters were sent to him, although not one had reached him. He also mentioned that on one occasion he saw twenty-seven or eighty-seven bags - he gave me the exact number, but I forget for the moment whether it was twenty-seven or eighty-seven - of mails from Australia lying unsorted. The men offered to sort them, but were not allowed to do so, and there they remained. I wonder that . young Australians do not seize the mail ba,gs in such circumstances and sort them . for themselves. We should have from the Government some statement as to what is being done in this matter as the result of &#39;the reports that have been furnished. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murdoch</inline> and others have reported on the question, and the Treasurer, I am sure, will agree with me that it is very hard on those concerned that letters to  &#39;soldiers at &#39;the front should not be delivered. I know that in some instances the fault does not rest with any Department. In one case quite a number of mail bags were -lost from a ship, but it seems strange that some men . should be in Egypt for months without receiving a letter from Australia, although many have &#39;been addressed to them. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to say that my boy wrote &#39;to me just &#39;before he was leaving Egypt for the front, to the effect that he had received -all ray letters. The mother of . a young man from Broken Hill who went to the front wrote to me recently that she had received a -letter from her son saying that he had had no word from home, although she and her daughters had been writing regularly to him. Something ought to be done to bring about an improvement. If we find that the fault rests with the Imperial officers, I think that in placing our troops under the direction of Imperial officers we have a perfect right to say that we desire that Commonwealth officials -shall attend! to the &#39;delivery . of the mails. The only other subject to which I desire to allude is that of war pensions. Will the Treasurer state whether the mother of a private who is killed on active service is entitled to the -full war pension of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per week if she is in receipt of an old-age pension, or whether the war pension would, in such -circumstances, &#39;be reduced to 10s. ? </para>

                    <para>. - I read the statement of the Treasurer with interest; but I find that it was, to a . large extent, a repetition of the statement delivered on the -12th . August by the ex-Treasurer. That statement I fully criticised at the time, and it would serve no good purpose to repeat my observations to night. I can only say -that members of the Opposition desire to give the new Treasurer every assistance to pass this measure,, because we know that it is necessary.* in order to enable the Commonwealth to assist the Mother Country in prosecuting the war to a successful&#39; issue. I notice that the- revenue estimated by the present Treasurer is the same as the estimate given by the ex-Treasurer , <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> except that the receipts from income tax are expected to be &#163;3,000,000 instead of &#163;4,000,000. As far as I can. judge from the figures, the- revenue for the current year is estimated to be about &#163;4,000,000 more than for the- previous year. I regret to have too say again- to the Treasurer that a great deal of confusion, arises, and will continue to arise, and honorable members will, be very much inconvenienced, owing to the fact that the revenue and expenditure for the. war are mixed&#39;, up with the&#34; ordinary revenue and expenditure on current account. This grouping of the two classes of expenditure? may be more convenient for the Treasury, but it: is hot. so convenient for* honorable1 members, or the- public. In all the States* loan expenditure, is; kept- separate from ordinary expenditure,, and Parliament is. able <inline font-style="italic">to&#62;</inline> understand clearly the financial operations- of the&#62; country;- but it is not easy to distinguish loan- expenditure from- ordinary expenditure under- the system- of bookkeeping at present in operation in the Commonwealth. I am surprised at the Treasury officials- combining the expenditure in this way; because when I was in. office I was determined that it- should not be done. There is nothing to indicate what is meant by the item &#34; Treasury-bills in aid of revenue, &#163;311,905.&#34; . Does this represent a deficit from last year ?&#39; If it does, why not &#171;ay so?&#39; The absence of any explanation of the item only causes confusion. In regard to new works,. I notice that an expenditure of &#163;3,627,629 is estimated, as against an actual. &#34; expenditure of &#163;2.^670,236 last year. I do think that, in this time of danger and difficulty, when money is so. much required, we ought to try to. live within, the same amount as was expended! last year&#62;, when the disbursements were the- greatest in the history of the Commonwealth. I am not saying a- word&#39; against the present Treasurer, because- he has not yet had an opportunity of grasping the- financial requirements of the country; but I do hope that he will thoroughly investigate- all exr penditure. He&#39; has&#62; the power to curtail disbursements, because all Departments are subject to-the Treasurer - they cannot operate without money - and if he keeps a strong- hand on the expenditure- he will be. rendering-- good service. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the honorable member does not think that I wish him to waste money anywhere. My desire is that he shall exercise economy wherever it is possible. I&#39; notice that one of the principal, items of increase in the Estimates of expenditure for the current year is &#34; Naval, and Military Ordinary Services, &#163;1,186,000.&#34; That, expenditure is in no way connected with the war. One would expect that this year expenditure on ordinary Defence services would be less than last year.,, ber cause, many items would be charged to loan, which in past years were charged to revenue.. Of course, the special war expenditure cannot be avoided. We can only hope that care and economy will, be practised . Another increase, is- &#39; &#39; Military Stores, including field guns, small arms0 ammunition, &#38;c, &#163;310,000.&#34; That, expenditure may be justified. With, <inline font-style="italic">ifr</inline> gard to items of. increased expenditure like. &#34; Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, salaries and contingencies, &#163;367,000; conveyance of mails, &#163;125000; lighthouses, &#163;10&#39;4,000&#34;; lighthouse steamers, new lighthouses, &#38;c.., &#163;72,000; Navigation, &#163;80000;. Public Works staff, &#163;3.2,000; and railway, working expenses (transcontinental; railway., Port Augusta to. Kalgoorlie), &#163;45, 000,&#34; there seems to have been no attempt to keep the expenditure this year within the limits of the previous year. That is very regrettable. The expenditure, on the war is estimated by the present Treasurer, as it was by his predecessor, to be about &#163;46,000,000&#39;. When discussing this matter in August last, I urged that there should be better control of the war expenditure. I said then, that I did not think the military and, naval officers could be reasonably expected to exercise a proper supervision of that immense expenditure. Of course, I have no id&#176;a of imrjai&#39;ring efficiency, but care and economy- do not necessarily lead that result. I&#39; say, again, that some specially qualified persons ought to be intrusted with the control of the expenditure of such a vast amount as &#163;46,000,000-. </para>

                <para class="block">It must be remembered that, in addition to the trials of the war, the Commonwealth has passed through a terrible drought. It is necessary that we should make an effort to live within our means. We intend to pay our debts, and at this period we ought not to spend on current account more than we receive. We are not likely to cavil at the Treasurer&#39;s personal views regarding the Note Fund and the note issue, even if we do not agree with the high-sounding phrases which he gave to the House. I very much regret that the House was not asked to pass the Estimates. Members on this side told the Government in August that the statement then made to the House by the Treasurer represented the best Estimate that could then be given, and that it would be better to accept them, even if they were a little imperfect, rather than wait till the end of the financial year, when the more complete Estimates will be passed in such a hurry that no member will have an opportunity of dealing with them. I conclude my few observations by expressing the hope that the Treasurer will have a very successful year. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to refer briefly to a matter of some interest in connexion with the administration of the Defence Department. This is a case which, I think, will secure the consideration of honorable members on both sides, because it affects that political liberty of conscience which is supported by all of us. There was until quite recently a position in both Victoria and New South Wales known as that of Brigade Bandmaster. In New South Wales this officer was not merely the bandmaster of a brigade, but he looked after all the military bands, buglers, and all musical arrangements throughout the State. This man, Captain Bentley, was paid for his services &#163;50 per annum; in other words, he was a militia officer.. He had to find all his travelling expenses, with the exception of his railway fares. At the time he was appointed there were ten bands in New South Wales, whereas now there are twenty-four, with ten others forming. He was a member of the State Professional Musicians Union, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> O&#39;Brien is secretary. I think, though I speak without absolute knowledge, that that union came before the Court in connexion with some of its rules. However, this man Bentley committed the crime of trying to form another union, and also the crime of using his name and rank  in  connexion with a band which he used to tender the agricultural show and other shows. Immediately after he had held the inaugural meeting of the new union, which was duly registered, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Brien</inline> wrote to the Minister as follows - </para>

                    <para>I have just received a communication from the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales stating that the tender of Captain Bentley to supply a band for the Royal Show has been accepted by the council of the above society. Captain Bentley is Brigade Bandmaster of the Defence Forces, New South &#34; Wales, and presided at a meeting at the Queen&#39;s Hall last week over a small number of recalcitrant members of the union with the object of forming an opposition musicians&#39; union. I respectfully suggest for your consideration that Captain Bentley should bc relieved of his duty as Brigade Bandmaster if he enters into controversial politics and industrial disputes with organized industrial unions. </para>

                <para>Honorable members opposite have always expressed themselves before the country as being the determined advocates of political liberty of conscience for all persons in the Public Service; and here we have the case of a brigade bandmaster and a militia officer. No question of unionist <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> non-unionist arises, nor is the question of preference involved. This man&#39;s individual right to indulge in political or industrial controversy is what is called  in  question. </para>

                        <para>- I shall endeavour to be as brief as possible; and I shall not argue the question; indeed, the point is so abundantly clear as to admit of no argument. There is the greatest feeling in military circles in New South Wales about this business; and it will not help the Defence Forces if the sort of thing of which I complain is allowed to continue. The Minister of Defence asked for a special report, and particularly pointed to the paragraphs I have read. The Adjutant-General reported, not against this man participating in the way to which exception has been taken, but expressing a doubt whether the position was really necessary in the interests of the Forces. Following that, the Minister gave Captain Bentley notice that his engagement would be terminated, Thereupon the Commandant in New South Wales wrote to the Minister strongly protesting, in the interests of efficiency and economy alike - these are his words - that the position should be continued. In spite of this, however, the services of Captain Bentley were dispensed with. I merely state, without comment, that this man has been &#34; fired &#34; because he exercised individual liberty of conscience; and I suggest that such an occurrence ought not to be possible if we are to have anything like cohesion in the Military Forces of the Comm on wealth . </para>

                <para>The amendment of the Act has been necessitated by the partial failure of the formula which some honorable members were unable to appreciate, but which, I am glad to say, they heartily indorsed. It has been found that in applying the formula. - which was admittedly perfect - to the circumstances of a mixed income, there results a set of conditions incompatible with the principles of equity and logic which underlie the measure. Practically, what the Bill proposes is to remove an anomaly under which a man who has an income derivable from property and from personal exertion pays less tax than does a man who derives an income wholly from personal exertion ; whereas it was intended that the man who receives income from personal exertion should pay at a lower rate than one who derives his income from property. In short, what the amendment does is, in the case of a mixed income, to tax each class of income at the rate at which it would have been taxed if the whole of the income had been derived from personal exertion or from property, as the case may be. There are no departures from the principles of the Act. The amendment is recommended by the Commissioner as one that, he assures me, will very greatly facilitate the work of the office. The staff finds itself pressed by continual labours in reducing the formula to a shape in which it can be comprehended by the taxpayer; and this amendment will enable that work to be done quite simply. I have been asked whether it is necessary to differentiate between income derived from personal exertion and income from property. That distinction is maintained in every income tax in the world. Certainly, it is in all the Australian States and in Great Britain, and it is not proposed to depart from that principle here. </para>

                        <para>- What I wanted to say is preliminary to what we are about to do; because the practice has lately been that when proposals of this kind have come forward, they have been rushed through before honorable members really knew what had transpired, and the Government have had to come along with .  an amending Bill afterwards. We hope the House will rise this week, and -I presume there will be no further meeting for a considerable time - until the greater portion of the income tax has been collected. We want, therefore, to be reasonably sure that what we are now proposing will meet &#39;the situation, and not be inequitable to anybody. I made these few remarks in order to ask the Prime Minister to furnish us with some concrete examples of how the proposal will work-out. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand the object of &#39;the Attorney-General is to meet the case of where an income is divided - say, an income of &#163;1,000, of which &#163;600 is derived -from property and &#163;400 from personal exertion. At present;, one would be taxed on the scale of &#163;600 and the other on the scale of &#163;400 without regard to the total of &#163;1,000, and that applies only to a case where the actual learning is mixed. But it is not. possible really to differentiate between earnings from property and from personal exertion. For the future, . an income made up. in the -manner I have suggested will be taxed at the &#163;1,000 rate in respect of the &#163;600, and . at the &#163;1,000 rate in respect of the &#163;400, and the taxpayer will have to pay more than he would have to pay if the thing -were left alone. It will be a mixed result, but, : as the problem is . a mixed one,- I suppose it <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> logical that (the result should also be mixed. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to rise to a point of order at this stage. It seems to me that we are developing a practice that is absolutely prohibitive of intelligent discussion. Before a Bill has been introduced, and before we know anything whatever about it, we are asked to suspend the Standing Orders for the purpose of enabling that Bill to pass all its stages. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that it was in the wrong place altogether. The proper time to move the suspension -of the Standing Orders is when the House has the Bill before it, and knows what it is suspending the Standing Orders for. It seems to me to be an unintelligent proceeding for us to suspend our Standing. Orders before we know what we are suspending them for. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difference when the procedure relates to&#34; theCommittee of Supply or of Ways and Means. Theusual . course would &#39;be. for the adoption of the report to be. taken on the following day, but it is desired that this Bill should pass through all its stages to-night. Under -such circumstances, it -would be necessary to secure the suspension of -the Standing. Orders before the report is -adopted, otherwise that stage would be postponed until to-morrow. The honorable member will see, however, that the question of method has nothing to . do with the Chair. That concerns the -Government. I quite understand what the honorable member . means,but I think he will see my point; - the. point that, does concern, the Chair - which is- that this motion could only be taken to-morrow unless the Standing Orders had been suspended. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to have this: matter settled. I am still not clear about, it. I take it that, in accordance with the Standing Orders, the utmost that can be done at this stage is to so far suspend the Standing Orders as would prevent the introduction of the. Bill. Then would come the further proposition to suspend the Standing Orders, relative to the remaining stages. Otherwise, the position is that we have actually declared to be urgent a measure, abo&#39;it which we know absolutely nothing. </para>

                    <para>It has been found! that under the Act as it-, stands a person whose income is derived partly from personal exertion and partly from property will pay less taxation, than he would pay were his income derived wholly from personal exertion. For example, a man whose income is &#163;5,000,. half of which is earned by personal exertion and half derived from property, will pay less than a man whose income is &#163;5,000, wholly derived from personal exertion. It was intended, however, that the taxation on incomes derived from property should be at a higher rate than that of income from personal exertion. It is now proposed ,  &#39; therefore, that in the case of a mixed income - take again, by way of illustration, the income of a man who earns &#163;2,500 by personal exertion and receives &#163;2,500 from property - the charge on so much as has been earned by personal exertion shall be at the rate which would be levied had the whole income been so earned, and that the rate levied on what was derived from property shall be that which would be levied had the whole income been derived from property. The tax on a mixed income will thus be greater than that on an income of the same amount earned wholly by personal exertion, but less than that on an income derived wholly from property. </para>

                        <para>. - It is a wonderful thing that propositions founded on mathematical principles which are supposed to be unerring and incapable of terminological or other inexactitude, should have gone wrong on the first application. Can we be sure that the mathematician is right in what is now proposed ? I am inclined to think that it would be better to abandon the curves referred to in the schedule, and revert to the old methods of calculation. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> the curves are right; but, apparently, the application of them is wrong. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash,</inline> of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> has shown that the formula when applied does not give the result set out in the tables, and I have been given to understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> has some secret method of applying it, which may or may not be in accordance with the known principles of mathematics, but which brings in some element other than that which has been made public, in order to achieve the results set out in the tables. In other words, the formula: and the tables do not agree.  <inline font-style="italic">4</inline></para>

                            <para>- The formula which relates to incomes derived from personal exertion could be worked out by a boy capable of passing the junior public examination. As to the curve of the second degree, the Statistician himself worked out the examples that have been given, and is prepared to vouch for their accuracy. He says that when he explained the matter to the Professor of Mathematics in the Sydney University, the latter admitted that he had been in the wrong. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that if a man has an income of &#163;5,000, earned wholly by personal exertion, he will be taxed at the rate set out in the first schedule of the principal Act, and at the rate set out in the second schedule if his income is derived wholly from property. I understand further that, under the Bill, a man who has a mixed income, earning, say, &#163;2,500 as salary and getting &#163;2,500 from property, will be charged according to a third rate; that is to say he will be taxed on the &#163;2,500 which he earns as if the whole &#163;5,000 were derived from personal exertion, and on the &#163;2,500 derived from property as if the whole income were derived from property. Thus we have the personal exertion rate, which is the lowest, the mixed income rate, and the property rate, which is the highest. We must take it for granted, on the assurance of the mathematician, that this method will work correctly. </para>

                        <para>.- Before the clause is passed I should like to have some illustrations of the manner in which it will work, as I am doubtful as to its actual effect. I know what the Prime Minister wishes to do; but I am not clear as to the result. In providing the extraordinary method of calculation provided for in the Act, the Commonwealth Statistician seems to have adopted a set of more or less arbitrary figures approximating to a curve of the second or third degree. From what I have been able to read, I do not think that the mathematical calculation is scientifically correct, and I do not know what induced the Government to adopt this abstruse method of calculation. If the Government desired particularly to provide for a much higher rate in respect of incomes over and above a certain amount, they could have done so by almost any method of direct calculation. The position now is, however,, that no one who has not had a first class University education, and a particularly good course in mathematics, is able to calculate what is the rate of the tax payable on income from property. I suppose that it is too late now to ask the Government to recast their schedule, but if, in regard to income from personal exertion or property, they had adopted the simple method of a curve in the first degree, they might have expressed thp rate in clear terms. They could have provided for a definite increase at a certain point, taking another curve of the first degree, and finally, for a still higher jump if necessary, so as to secure all that they desired without putting taxpayers to the great trouble to which they will be put under the system now in force. Every one is under the impression that he is being &#34; taken down,&#34; and none of the skilled mathematicians in the country seem to agree as to the results obtained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> calculation. I have not gone into the question very carefully, beyond reading statements on the subject in the public press and in some of the journals, but I am informed that the general impression among those best able to judge is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> has adopted a purely arbitrary calculation, which is not mathematically or scientifically correct according to the formula? expressed in the Bill. It seems to me that the Government are causing immense trouble by the method adopted. I would suggest that if they desire to derive a considerable amount of extra revenue from the larger incomes they should adopt the direct method instead of attempting to get the exact gradation on every pound from fi of taxable income up to the point at which all income carries the maximum rate. They could provide for a gradation on every pound up to a certain sum, and then take a definite step upwards, fixing a higher rate. They could then have finally a gradation on every pound up to the next step. The merest schoolboy could then calculate to a penny what tax had to be paid on any income. Under the existing circumstances very few taxpayers can do so. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry that the honorable member for Richmond does not agree with the method adopted by the Government for determining the rate of tax. There seems to be in this Assembly an archaic prejudice against science and the advancement of learning. This I regret. It is a most melancholy portent for our future when science and scientific men are spoken of in these terms, and when that which is apparent and within the reach of the schoolboy is preferred. It seems to me to be a halting back to the stone age. I shall not, however, waste any time in discussing it. I shall tell honorable members what the result of the amendment will be. That, after all, is far more important to the man outside, who, I venture to say, would rather be taxed fairly, even if the rate has to be worked out by mathematicians, than have the simple method to which the honorable member has referred. It is simple because it is inequitable, and has nothing to recommend it except that it is the plain, common, ancient method of highway robbery. </para>

                            <para>- Then they get an inscription on their tombstones which they also cannot understand. I shall give the Committee the calculations made by my mathematical staff. The tax on an income of &#163;1,000 from personal exertion amounts to &#163;28 2s. 6d., and from property to &#163;43 17s. 9d. That is the rate of tax, and it is not affected by the&#39; amendment. Under the Act as it stands, a man with an income of &#163;1,000, &#163;600 of which is derived from personal exertion and &#163;400 from property, would pay &#163;21 15s. 10d., as against &#163;28 2s. 6d. that he would pay if the &#163;1,000 had been derived wholly from personal exertion. Under the Bill he will pay &#163;34 8s. 7d., as against &#163;43 17s. 9d. that he would pay if the whole of his income had been derived from property. Thus you get the application of the three schedules in this- way : If the whole &#163;1,000 of income is derived&#39; from, personal exertion, the taxpayer- pays &#163;28 2s. 6d. Assuming that- the principle of: the Bill is approved, on a mixed income of &#163;600&#39;&#39; from personal exertion and &#163;400 from property he will pay &#163;3.4 8s. 7d., and if. this &#163;1,000 were wholly from property &#163;43 17s. 9d. Under the Act as it stands&#39;, he would pay only &#163;21. 15s.10d. if he had a mixed income of. the- amount stated, whereas he. would, pay &#163;28. 2s. 6d. if he had an income derived wholly from personal, exertion. It is to remove that injustice and that departure from the principle of the Act, which is to tax incomes derived from personal exertion at a lower rate than incomes from property, that this amendment is proposed&#39;. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not see how. it would be possible to avoid, this amendment of the principal Act,, considering that that Act is progressive along pounds, and that this inconvenience will arise, therefore, with every pound that is taxed. In the case- of an income of &#163;1,000 from- personal exertion,, the rate increases with every pound,, whereas- in the case of such an income from property it runs, along a series of. increases. Under the State laws, there is a very considerable interval between the progressive rates as compared with that for which the Commonwealth law provides, so that the inconvenience under the existing Commonwealth law occurs very often-, and only infrequently under the State systems. We must, it seems to me, make this amendment, and I do not know what system other than that adopted by the Attorney-General could1 be followed. The rate of tax that a man will have to pay will be determined first by the total of his income. Under the law as it stands that is not the position where income is derived from two sources - personal exertion and property. The tax must be determined by the total of the taxpayer&#39;s income, and by the amount derived respectively from property and from personal exertion. </para>

                            <para>- It does seem large. When building the railway through new country in. the State of Texas, no stations are made. Ballasting is. estimated at &#163;66,598 - that also seems high - telegraphs, &#163;7,149; miscellaneous, &#163;88; contingencies, &#163;15,238; total &#163;320,000, or &#163;4,938 0s. 2d. per mile. As I told the House last week, there are at present between 500 and 600 men employed in completing the original section of the Katherine River railway. The idea is that if this railway is built to the good country about Bitter Springs, those people will be settled on the land. Up till . the present . time they have been getting acclimatised and strengthening themselves to stand the climate. There is hope of a big settlement taking place, on the good country when . the railway reaches it. We are dealing with a great territory sparsely populated, and it seems to me that if Parliament intends to ever build that railway and settle the country, the line . ought not to . stop at the Katherine River., but should be continued to Bitter Springs, where we may expect settlement to follow. Recently a large number of people have been taken to the Territory, with their wives and families. The idea was to -give them employment on railway construction, and afterwards, when they had become accustomed to the climate, to settle them on the land, I am informed that if the line is carried south from Katherine River to Bitter Springs it will reach a better class of country, a good deal of which will be suitable for settlement, and the terminus will also be much nearer to the existing settlement beyond the Roper River. The line will facilitate cattle traffic from Elsie Creek and Hodgson Downs, and probably other grazing leases in the vicinity. It is stated that there is plenty of good cattle-ranching country to be developed, and that this line will enable the stock to be brought to market. Bitter Springs is a generally recognised centre, and is on the main road leading to the settlement along the Roper River. There is also a very fine water supply for purposes of settlement, travelling . stock, and locomotive requirements. I must admit that the estimated revenue is very small, but these developmental railways are not built for revenue; they are built for settlement. The estimated working expenses, exclusive of interest on capital cost, are &#163;11,800, and the estimated revenue, &#163;12,000. </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen the surveyor, but the engineers say that the land is much better than any other land there. I do not know the quality of the other land. I suppose it does not comprise what would be called valuable loamy soil, but even if we decided to let the whole of the Northern Territory as a great cattle ranch, carrying 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 head of cattle, it would still require a railway. </para>

                        <para>The barren, rock-outcropping country for a great distance between Pine Creek and Katherine River gives way to good country about 10 miles north of the Katherine, and with the exception of a belt of limestone outcrop a few miles south of the Katherine there is a very large area of free, open, chocolate-coloured soil of a sandy character, somewhat thickly timbered. This country, with slight changes here and there, extends to Bitter Springs, and also on to Daly Waters. The appearance of the chocolate-coloured, sandy loam rises just after the first rains is very attractive, and is not unlike the Pine and Belaar country round Mildura, Victoria. It is probable that, with railway communication, a portion of this land would be profitably situated for settlement. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable member that it took years and years in America to get Congress to vote a few pounds to run the first transcontinental line, because, as it was said, a crow would have to carry his water-bag across the country. As a matter of fact, there are now twelve transcontinental railways across the continent, and in the country south of the Rockies 19,000,000 people have settled. Further, un land which it was said would not grow anything, the settlers are now raising 40 bushels to 50 bushels of wheat, and 100 bushels of corn, to the acre. That land had not such encomiums passed upon it as are passed on the land which the proposed railway will traverse. It is wonderful how settlement pushes on, and how, by growing trees and by other methods, rain <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> brought into a district. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> goes on to say - </para>

                        <para>Bitter Springs is on the Roper River, which, at this point, turns and runs thence east to the Gulf of Carpentaria, emptying into Limmen  Bight. The Roper River country was thoroughly examined by the Scientific Expedition in 1011, consisting of Professors Spencer and Gilruth, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Brcinl,</inline> and their report was very optimistic regarding its possibilities. Coming back along the proposed line again, there is good country along the King River southwards through Dugan&#39;s holding towards the junction with the Katherine, and also easterly until the mining area is reached, which is now known as Maranboy Tin Field. </para>

                            is very sanguine of the permanency of these lodes, . and predicts a prosperous future for the field. The Government have already spent large sums of money in roadmaking, battery provision, and erection, &#38;c, but concentrates will still have to be carted 40 miles to Katherine River station, unless the railway is extended. At 2s 6d. to 3s. per ton per mile, it is apparent that much of the lower-grade ore will have to be discarded; whereas Maranboy is only 12 miles from the proposed extension to Bitter Springs.

                        <para>Whilst the rainfall decreases in a recognised proportion from Darwin&#39;s 62 inches to Daly Waters&#39; 17 inches, the climate is noticeably better in the interior; the humidity is greatly reduced, and there are several months in the dry season when night temperatures on occasions fall 40 degrees Fahr. This means much in recuperative effect compared with the country closer in to the seaboard, where humidity is so severe. Every mile of constructed railway brings nearer the boring and settlement of the fine Barclay Tableland, with its great productive possibilities. (Sgd.) Norris G. Bell, </para>

                        <para>. - The procedure we are adopting is most extraordinary. We passed an Act of Parliament prescribing a method for the carrying out of public works; and at considerable trouble and expense a Committee of Public Works was appointed, with the special function of making inquiry in every case where a certain amount of expenditure was involved. That Committee has to report to the House, and, on the receipt of the report, the House, by resolution, must declare whether or not it is expedient that the work proposed shall be carried out. In the present case, without plans or specifications - without any investigation or report whatever - we are asked to authorize a work representing an expenditure of &#163;320,000. This means that we are practically setting aside the provisions of the Act by which the Public Works Committee came into existence; and I do not think that this meets with the approval of the House generally. The Public Works Committee Act was supported by both sides in order that there might be some control over expenditure on public works. We are asked to pass exactly the same kind of Bill that we were asked to pass to authorize the construction of the transcontinental railway between the east and west. A Minister came down with a Bill asking for a blank cheque to meet an expenditure which now promises to be something like &#163;6,000,000 or &#163;7,000,000, without submitting plans, specifications, or giving any information whatever. Subsequently the House was asked, from time to time, to vote money towards the completion of the scheme. The idea of the Public Works Committee Act is that we shall have most carefully prepared estimates in order to enable the House to exercise reasonable discretion. Already a part of the proposed transcontinental line has been recently constructed, but we do not know what the cost per mile has been, or whether the estimates have been exceeded, or whether the figures now before us are based upon those previous estimates. I know that&#39; no Railway Department has a more competent engineer than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell;</inline> the Commonwealth is fortunate in possessing such an officer, and his judgment may be trusted, but I am sure that the sum of &#163;14,000 set down for stations cannot mean the construction of station buildings. </para>

                            <para>- The difficulty is that we are acting absolutely in the dark, and it amounts almost to a public scandal to authorize expenditure in this way ; the only value of the report that is to be presented is that it may give some guidance to the Minister; but such reports were intended, not for the guidance of the Minister, but for the guidance of the House and the public generally. Of course, the present Minister has only just assumed office, but he is a member of a Cabinet which takes the whole responsibility in a matter of this kind, and that responsibility is a serious one. . Surely, during the term of office of the present Government, some railway policy should have been evolved ? They had three years of power with an interregnum, during which the honorable member for Angas, as a member of a succeeding Government, laid on the table a memorandum showing full details of a railway policy. There was a distinct policy in view; and during the last thirteen months there has been ample time for the consideration of a definite policy, as well as for the preparation of estimates and surveys for the construction of the railway. I want to enter my protest against this continuation of the old system of sanctioning expenditure without knowing what it is we are committing ourselves to. The House is quite in the dark. It is asked to authorize the Minister to construct a railway which he says will cost &#163;320,000; and when the bill comes in we shall probably find ourselves in the same position that we have been in with regard to other works. I hope the Minister will pay due regard to economy in carrying out this scheme, and that he will not sanction expenditure that is not necessary. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the Minister will keep a strict eye on every part of this work. Heavy obligations are facing the country in connexion with the war. We have committed ourselves to a policy in connexion with the rivers, so that this is not the time for extravagance in any direction. Private individuals are being asked to exercise economy, but it seems hypocrisy to advise people to practise that which the Government itself will not practise. Therefore, I hope the Minister will exercise the business acumen for which he is credited and keep the cost of this railway down to the greatest extent possible. I do not see how we can do other than allow the Bill to go through;  but I hope, before work is commenced, that . the Public Works Committee will make a thorough investigation, and present . something more than the academic report the Minister has Just put forward. I hope the Committee will insist upon having . definite plans and specifications from responsible officials, so that a specific estimate of the cost of the work will be available. </para>

                        <para>.- I think the House should enter its protest against the manner in which . this railway proposition has been introduced, and I think it would have been better if the Bill had contained a clause stipulating that the Public Works Committee Act should not apply to this work, because, to refer the proposition to the Committee after already having . sanctioned the railway seems to be nothing less than a farce. Even if the Bill were made operative, . subject to the Committee&#39;s report, that report, to be valuable, would necessitate the members of the Committee going over the country and seeing where the railway is being laid out. In Victoria, . every Railway Bill contains a schedule setting out the . route and giving the Minister limited power of deviation. It is true this Bill -follows on . the lines of the last Bill, !but there is no definite route stated. . Members . are . simply told that the line will run from one . place to another, and are asked to &#39;sanction tha proposal &#34; as surveyed on the ground.&#34; What does this House know about such a survey ? We do not know where the survey pegs are. We do not even know., and I &#39;do not know whether the Minister can tell us, whether the railway has been surveyed. All we know is that the&#39; railway will begin at the Katherine River and end at Bitter Springs. The Minister told us that the Bill did not include provision for the bridge across the Katherine. When the Bill authorizing the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine was passed, no provision was then made for bridging the river, and the railway stopped on the north side. This railway will commence on the south side of the river. What is the good of that if the railway is to be continuous ? We were &#39;told on a previous occasion &#39;that the bridge -would cost &#163;170,000. Now we are asked to spend &#163;320,000; and before the proposed railway can be -connected with that already constructed, another &#163;170,000 will have to be spent. </para>

                            <para>- Every railway in Victoria has had a temporary bridge constructed over rivers for the purposes of the -work, but&#34;we know very we&#39;ll &#39;that passengers are not carried until a permanent bridge is constructed. At the present time this railway is quite incomplete. There is no authorized service across the Katherine either of a temporary or permanent nature, and the fact that the only information we have is that -this is to be a railway from the Katherine River -to the Bitter Springs without any route being laid down, -or any information given regarding a survey, and the fact that the Public Works Committee &#39;have not reported on the proposal at all, renders the introduction of this -Bill about as unsatisfactory as any such proposal could very well be. Were it not that &#39;there are a number of railway men waiting for the continuation . of &#39;this work, the House would be . compelled to hold up &#39;this proposal pending a submission of better information. I hope that &#39;in future no Minister will ever introduce a Railway Bill intothisHouseinthe way in which this Bill has been introduced. </para>

                        <para>. - From the statement made by the Minister himself in introducing this Bill, I think it would be much better to let the whole matter go before the Public &#39;WorksCommittee. The only excuse for its introduction in its present form is that there . are 600men likely to be thrown out of employment. It would be cheaper to find . these men other work ; it would . even fee cheaper to pay them for doing nothing, rather- than construct the railway on- this system. The Minister stated that it would cost &#163;1,000 per mile to ballast the line, and if it is going to involve such an amount, it would be cheaper- to find these men employment somewhere else. Then &#163;141,000 is to be spent on stations. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps we had better get an aeroplane to take the trains across. From the statement made by the Minister himself, I think the House would be very foolish if- they passed this Bill to-night. It would be far better to find these men something else to do whilst the Public &#34;Works. Committee makes its inquiry. We have been shown a map upon which the Katherine River and&#39; Bitter Springs are marked, but no details are given regarding the railway, and,, as I said . before, it would be better to pay these men and keep them out of employment rather than pass a Railway Bill on such information as we have before us. When the proposal has been examined by the Public Works Committee. Parliament can deal with it by resolution. </para>

                    <para class="block">Territory cannot be developed without railways; but, in my opinion, the Minister of External Affairs should have charge of the Bill, because the construction of railways is part, of the policy for- the development of the Northern Territory, for which he is responsible, the Department of Home Affairs being- merely the constructing Department.. If the Minister of Home; Affairs were in charge of the Bill merely because of the illness of his colleague, I should have nothing to say against the arrangement, but from the beginning this Bill has been in charge of the Minister of Home Affairs. Having been. Minister of External Affairs, I know that the post is. not one of which the holder is overworked. Any Minister who goes from another Department to the Department of External Affairs is aware that the latter post is not an overworked one, whereas the Minister of Home Affairs occupies a very busy position. Naturally, because of my association for a time with its administration, and because of my visit to it, I take a considerable interest in the development of the JJbrthern Territory. Its settlement is one of the . biggest problems that this Parliament has to face, though it is a problem that we can solve. The construction of this railway by the Home Affairs Department is quite a proper thing. The extension of the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River was proposed in this House by the Minister of External Affairs, and commenced by his Department, but it was wisely determined by the Cook Administration to hand over the work of construction to the Home Affairs Department. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall support the honorable member for Corangamite in &#39; his objection to the Bill. No honorable member believes more than I do in having a comprehensive railway policy for the development of the Northern Territory which, from what I can gather, has a great future from both the miner&#39;s and the stockman&#39;s point of view. But the proposal has been wrongly introduced, and introduced at the wrong time, and the data is insufficient to enable us to come to a proper conclusion. We have had a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> whose engineering abilities are beyond question; and one from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler,</inline> who is also, I believe, a good railway engineer. But what we need are reports from men who could speak as to the stock-carrying capacity of the country, and its mineral possibilities. </para>

                            <para>- He may have given some little information regarding the mineral wealth of the country, but I heard nothing concerning its stock-carrying capacity. It is said that the country is limestone in conjunction with chocolate soil; and we know that such country is suited to lucerne, the king of &#39;fodders. But we do not know what its rainfall is. Lucerne will stand any amount of heat, but needs a good deal of moisture, and we require to be told, not only the annual rainfall of the district through which the line will pass, but also the distribution of the rain, before we can know the value of the country. We are asked, also, to sanction the use of timber sleepers for the construction of the railway; but from what I have heard, such sleepers would not last any time.

                    <para>.- As I found it rather difficult this afternoon to convey to the House my impressions regarding a subject on which I addressed a question to the Prime Minister, I desire now to put myself right. In the early stages of the negotiations for the acquisition of wheat freights, I felt it my duty to put before the House the difficulties that presented themselves to my mind, and to show, as I think has been conclusively shown now to the Prime Minister, that the arrangement he had entered into would fail to provide a continuous market for our wheat, and would create such a dislocation that the coming harvest could not be financed and transported. I believe that the arguments that were put from this side of the House had good weight. I believe that they have borne good fruit, and I am now prepared to say that the arrangement which has ultimately been made will provide successfully for the wheat harvest. </para>

                        <para>- I did take the view that the Government should not have interfered, but shall not at this late bour touch on that point. I still have every reason to believe that the arrangement that was made in the first instance would not have pruved satisfactory. The present Prime Minister was so convinced as to that that he has abandoned it altogether, and has accepted a new one. I do not propose to say whether the new arrangement is his own creation or that of some one else. Honorable members, no doubt, will inquire for themselves on the subject. It is sufficient for me to say that the arrangement now entered into and accepted by the Prime Minister and the various States is altogether different from that which honorable members opposite were originally lauding. So much is it so that I believe that all the interests now concerned in wheat will be found assisting the Prime Minister and the States, who have entered into the new agreement to carry it through as expeditiously and as smoothly as possible. </para>

Many honorable members would like to be present at the demonstration of the third-rail system which is to take place at Tocumwal on Friday next. A special train will run from Sydney, reaching Tocumwal a little after 3 on Friday afternoon, and upon its arrival the demonstration will take place. </para>

A special train will also leave Melbourne at 10.40 a.m. on Friday to take those who wish to go to Tocumwal to witness the demonstration. The representatives of New South Wales will be able to travel by that train, and to journey from Tocumwal by the special train, which will reach Sydney at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.

                    <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Government a question relating to the arrangements made for the delivery of letters to our troops in Egypt. I received this morning a letter from the mother of a young man who has been fighting at the front, and I have been considering all day what I should do in regard to it. In the absence of the Postmaster-General, who is visiting another State, I thought of leaving the letter with the Department of Defence, but the Defence authorities say that they do not want to have anything to , do with it. Although the mother of this young man, who has now been invalided to England, has been writing to him regularly while at the front, he has not received any of her letters. Members of his family have also been writing to him, but he received only one letter, and that was as far back as 5th July last. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that it is; but there is something more serious to be told. The mother of this young man, by every mail leaving Australia for Egypt since his departure, has sent him a parcel of comforts. These parcels consisted, not of eatables, but of necessaries for a man at the front, including buttons, thread, and needles, to enable him to keep his uniform in good repair. She paid in freight and stamps on these parcels 7s. 6d., but not one of them has been delivered. I know that this is not an isolated case. Many men at the front have had a similar experience, and I hope that something will be done to put the mail arrangements in Egypt, and particularly in regard to . the delivery of parcels, on a proper footing. </para>

Even money orders which she has seat to him have not been delivered. She tells me that another son, who is fighting in Flanders,, receives letters from her regularly, and that be says. that, a letter from, home is what every man over there looks for. It helps to keep them cheery and bright. I brought, this letter under the notice of the Department of Defence,, and the Defence authorities, are cabling, to. Egypt to ascertain particulars. The fact mentioned by the honorable member for. Corangamite is hy no means singular. My correspondent wrote scathingly of the treatment that her son has received in this respect, and asks, what encouragement is thus offered other mothers to let their bays volunteer. Money orders and drafts sent to Egypt have- not been delivered as addressed. There is. something very wrong with the system. The stereotyped reply that &#34; the matter will be looked into &#34; is not sufficient. - I hope that something will be done to insure that parcels and other mail matter gent to our boys at the- front -reach them. If we are to recruit as we hope to do, we must eive the men who enlist, an assurance that they will at least be afforded- ordinary facilities to keep in touch with their friends at home,, and to reserve from them whatever little comforts they choose- to send. It is up to the Department to do something- to. improve the existing system. </para>
