The honorable gentleman may be assured that there is no tinge of personal feeling on this side against his acceptation of the office of Prime Minister. I hope that we may find it, at least, as pleasant to work with him in his new capacity as it was in his old, and he may be assured of all the help that we can give to him in the discharge of his high and, ' at the present time, particularly onerous duties. The other Ministers, too, I cordially congratulate, wishing them good health, good luck, and strength for the discharge of their duties. May we hope that their accession to office may lead to an even more efficient discharge of Ministerial functions, to the benefit of the country as a whole. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to make a personal explanation. When the House adjourned some few weeks ago I was absent because of illness. I had not been able, unfortunately, to attend for some days, but the present Prime Minister, then Acting Leader of the House, moved that I be granted leave of absence " on account of urgent private business. " </para>

        <para class="block">That statement was the result of a misunderstanding. I had written to the secretary of the party, and had telegraphed to the Government  Whio  that I was sick. I make this explanation because, as I was one of those who objected to the House adjourning at the time, it might seem peculiar that I could not. attend because of urgent private business at a time when I was protesting against the proposed adjournment. The fact that I was sick probably was not brought under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister, and his statement was made under a  misapprehension,  but I thank him for the precaution he took in my behalf. </para>

          <para>. - Touching on the question raised by the honorable member for Wentworth, I should like to point out that in the opinion of the chemists and druggists of Australia - and their opinion on such a matter should be entitled to great weight - by issuing licences to certain people to manufacture aspirin and other patent medicines under their old trade names, we are perpetuating in Australia the German trade names that we do not desire to be continued. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. I join with the honorable member in asking the Prime Minister to  seriously  consider the position. There are many ways out of the difficulty. This objection applies not only to aspirin, but to veronal and a number of other patent medicines, the constituents of which are well known. We might' give to aspirin some Australian name, under which it could be manufactured and sold here, and become widely known. </para>

            <para>- That is true. My reason for suggesting the giving of a new name to this drug is that great importance is attached by many people to a particular brand or name, and that they seem to think that aspirin is the name of the sole constituent of this patent medicine. I hope my suggestion will be adopted. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to bring before the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a matter of some urgency. I refer to the fact that officers are being sent away in charge of troops from New South Wales in preference to others who have attended a school of instruction, who have passed the necessary examinations, and who have had previous experience. The officers who are being sent away have not passed any such examination, have never been in camp, and cannot drill the men on the green. This is a serious state of affairs, and has arisen for the second time in connexion with the departure of contingents from New South Wales. </para>

            <para>- That may be so; if the honorable member's statement is correct it serves to make still more serious the position which I have explained. It is time this matter was taken up seriously by the Ministry. We have lost many lives, and probably many more will have to go, but for Heaven's sake let our valorous Australian soldiers have a chance of being led by men who know the game. I have before me the facts relating to a case where competent officers, who had drilled the men and brought them to a state of efficiency, were superseded by others who could not put the men through "fours" on the green. It is a positive scandal, and should be rectified at the earliest possible moment. </para>

          <para>.- I have much pleasure in indorsing the remarks made by the honorable member for Newcastle. Undoubtedly, fair play is not going on at the camps. Men who know their work ar© being ordered about by young officers who do not know their duties. Further than that, in this time of stress and trouble I wish to raise  a  note of warning in regard to the expenditure that is taking place. I do not think it is the desire of the people of Australia that public servants, whether in the employ of the State or the Commonwealth, should receive double pay on entering these military camps - their pay as soldiers as well as public servants. Unless care be exercised in this respect, great expense is likely to be incurred in connexion with the appointment of officers. As to the statement made by the honorable member for Wentworth regarding the continuance of German trade names in Australia, I think it an infamy that such a state of affairs should be allowed to continue. This Parliament can require that every patent medicine shall have its formula shown upon its label. Such a provision would be welcomed by every medical man and chemist throughout Australia, and would also prevent the people being robbed and plundered as they are by the unjust -prices charged for many patent medicines. The Minister .of Trade and Customs did good service in reprinting the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons in regard to secret remedies. The House, at the instance of the Minister, ordered that report to be reprinted and circulated in Australia. I hope that every Australian who loves the land that has given him his language, if not his birth, will say, " From this time forth I shall never buy a thing made by Germans or imported from Germany." </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">. -r-tn</inline>reference to the matter referred to by the honorable member for Maranoa, I can only say that it is the intention of the Government to ask the House, so far as concerns the business it is intended to bring forward, to adjourn on Friday week. It therefore follows that whatever is to be done must be done in that time. Honorable members will be able to ventilate the matter on Supply, and I do not think that any further opportunity is required, so far as that is concerned. The question of German trade names raised by several honorable members is not quite so simple as it might appear. There are some names that offer no difficulty, because they are only trade marks on sufferance, and, as a matter of fact, any parson can use them with impunity. All are, however, not of this kind. I granted a licence to two Australian chemists to manufacture and sell aspirin after it had been demonstrated that their product was the purest on the market, and fulfilled absolutely the requirements of the British pharmacopoeia. I think that if aspirin were sold under any other name', it would be a long time indeed before the people would accept the drug under the new designation. Whether that be so or not, that is the opinion of medical mon. Such a disability does not apply to goods in general, but to a large extent it applies to drugs. A test case is now being heard by the Commissioner of Patents in regard ' to sanatogen, and I shall be . largely guided by the decision in that case as to the formulation of a general rule to apply all round. Broadly speaking, however, the Government's policy is by every means to  substitute Australian or British goods and names for German goods and names. I might mention that by an order recently promulgated it will be possible to prohibit the importation of certain classes of goods, which, under the law as it stood, we were compelled to admit. With the power we have now, I think we can deal with enemy trade sufficiently, providing we have the co-operation of the people of the country; but I do complain, and wilt good reasons, of a tendency on the part of some people to still purchase, and to insist on facilities being given to purchase, enemy goods. </para>
