            <para>Over a . period of  years; by speeches and questions without notice in this House, and by corresponddence with Ministers,I have endeavoured to persuade the Government to take a practical interest in the prevention of the spread of the buffalo fly down the southern coast of Queensland. Honorable gentlemen opposite maylaugh,but this is pot a matter for hilarity. It is causing the graziers of southern Queensland and northern New. South Wales a great deal of concern.I now ask the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Researchwhether he will take steps to ensure that adequate supplies of DDT shall he, made available to producers through a government department or otherwise, and alsowhether, through the council, he will ensure provision of. a. suitable dip to deal simultaneously with the buffalo fly and cattle tick. Will he also take steps to provide that the whole or a part of the coat of the DDTwill be borne by the Government; in view of the fact that the fly entered Queensland from the Northern Territory ? </para>

            <para>It is true that this subject has been raised from time to time by the honorable member. I believe that on one occasion ho moved the adjournment of, the House in order to discuss it. Thebuffalofly has been in Australia for a very long time. During the period that Governments supported by the honorable gentleman were in  office,  no steps were taken to deal with it. The Queensland Government, on which responsibility rests inthis matter, is doing everything it can do to retard the spread of the fly. The responsibility of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is to undertake: research into the problem) and this has been done onan extensive scale. The council has elaborated a method to deal with the buffalo fly on dairy farms and that method is now being extended to cattle stations: I hare visited the affected areas in Queensland on two occasions, and have made inspections of the station being conducted by the Councilfor Scientific and Industrial Research. I found that all the farmers  were  loud in their praises of the efforts of the council to deal with the pest. The honorable gentleman seems to consider that the council is a trading organization which should acquire supplies of DDT and make them available to farmers. That is not one of its functions. In fact, the Commonwealth Government has no power to produce or acquire DDT for sale to farmers. The honorable member may rest assured that this Government is taking all the necessary steps to make good the deficiencies of previous governments in the matter. </para>

                            <para>- The decision to discharge those men who were absent without leave before the 31st December, 1945, was made some time ago by the AdjutantGeneral. As the result of that policy, about 8,000 men were discharged <inline font-style="italic">in absentia</inline> and their discharge certificates, if themen apply for them, will be so endorsed. A decision was also made that all. those who were undergoing detention, should be discharged after they had served one-third of the period of their sentence. As a result, the number in detention camps - I am not able to give the exact figure offhand - and the personnel required to guard them have been considerably ##"##reduced. I assure the honorable gentleman that the Government has carefully considered this leniency,  having due regard to the fact that the war has ended and the necessity for maintaining discipline among those still serving in the forces in Australia and the islands. </para>

If an individual has sustained any injury during the war, and as a result of the disability is unable to follow his pre-war occupation,if any, he is entitled to reconstruction training, regardless of his age.

But one does expect that the national broadcasting stations will refrain from making comments which might be regarded as providing fuel for attacks on the Government by the Opposition, no matter what government is in power. Perhaps all this is a part of the political game. I shall have, inquiries made, and request national broadcasting stations to refrain from doing things of this character, or being a party to their being done. </para>

If that be so, it did not seem to me to be appropriate matter for broadcasting over the national stations. The issues raised are the subject of constant controversy in this House.. I can. understand that if a person is slandered in any way he would feel aggrieved. I would not stand for that kind of thing for a moment. As to other criticism, it seems to me that we are becoming far too sensitive. </para>

                        <para>- Last April, there were extensive floods on the lower north-coast of New South Wales, and the fencing of many farmers was washed away. I understand that supplies of wire and wire netting, were made available from Army stocks to the -flood- relief committees set up by the Government of New South Wales, and were distributed among the farmers. I have been informed, however, that the Army has repossessed a considerable quantity of the wire and wire netting that was released recently from its stocks, and has diverted it to the use of the occupation force in Japan. If that has been done, will the Minister for the Army ensure that further supplies will be provided as soon as possible - to those farmers who. for more than four months, have suffered damage because of##"## floods, and have not been able to obtain their requirements ? </para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, relating to the payment of subsidy on sweet cream. I appreciatethe information which the honorable gentleman has already supplied to me, governingthe position in the butter-producing districts. This question concerns the position in the districts which supply whole milk to the metropolitan area. By way of explanation, I point out that when the original arrangement was made for the payment of a subsidy to the suppliers of whole milk, nothing was done in regard to sweet cream. Evidently, because of the prohibitionof the use of cream, so little was being used that it was not thought to . be worth troubling about. Since then, however, the use of cream has increased as people have, and quite rightly, become aware of the conditions under which cream can be obtained by medical prescription. Thus, an item which was previously unimportant, has now assumed importance for those who supply whole milk. Can the Minister say why a subsidy should not be paid on sweet cream, seeing that it costs as much to produce the milk from which it comes as to produce milk sold in the form of whole milk, and seeing that the farmer does not know from week to week how much of his milk he will have to separate ? Finally, seeing that sweet cream is used for the benefit of those requiring medical treatment, is there any reason why farmers should be penalized in respect to that part of their product which is used to help the sick?. Should not the burden be borne fairly by the whole of the community through the payment of a subsidy? </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave-</inline> Earlier in the week the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehan)</inline> asked a question relating to the issue of Commonwealth electoral rolls. Under the standing ministerial##'## authority a member of the House of Representatives is authorized to receive without charge fifteen copies of each new print of the electoral roll for his division, while a senator is authorized to receive fifteen copies for each division of his State. Under the same authority a non-member candidate contesting an election for the. House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> authorized##'## to receive six copies of the roll for the division concerned, and a nonsenator candidate contesting a Senate election six copies of the roll for each division of the State. In the case of senators and candidates at a Senate election the existing issue appears to be adequate, but in the case of members of the House of Representatives and nonmember candidates at House of Representatives elections, an increase of the number of rolls supplied is, I believe, warranted. I have accordingly approved of increases of from fifteen to 21 copies in the case of a member of the House of Representatives, and from six to nine copies in the case of a non-member candidate at a House of Representative##'##s election. Arrangements will be made by the Chief Electoral Officer for the distribution of the additional copies upon request. </para>

                    <para>- In the absence of the Minister for Labour and National Service I address a question to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. The absence of the former Minister makes it necessary for me to make a short explanation of the question. ft is, however, one in which the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, as the Minister responsible for the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, is vitally interested. During the debate on the Tradesmen##'##s Rights Regulation Bill, I moved an amendment which, if carried, would have had the effect of extending the period during which amember of the forces who desired to receive training as a probationary tradesman or a trainee tradesman could make application forsuch training from six months after the 22nd March, 1946, or six months after his discharge, to the 30th June, 1947, or twelve months after discharge, whichever was the later. I then stated that I believed it to he a fact that the period of eligibility under the reconstruction training scheme had been similarly extended. The Minister for Labour andNational Service stated that the Government would examine the proposal fully with a view to the introduction of a suitable amendment when the bill was before the Senate. Was such an amendment made when the bill was before the Senate? If not, did the Minister examine the proposal fully, as he undertook to do? Is it not a fact that the period of eligibility of applicants for benefits under the , reconstruction training scheme has been extended to cover the dates I have mentioned, and will the same principle be applied under the Tradesmen##'##s Rights Regulation Bill? </para>

                        <para>- I have received from the Secretary of the New South Wales Railways a letter replying to questions about railway transport from the central west, in which he told me that he was having great difficulty in supplying immediate demands. A statement appeared on his behalf in the press that the New South Wales railways would have great difficulty in lifting wheat from the Australian Wheat Board and the  difficulty would be aggravated by the need to supply transport for starving stock.  In  view  of  that position, will the Prime Minister consider the purchase from the Australian ##"##Wheat Board by the Government of that wheat in order that it might be retained in the district for use as stock feed? The railways may not beable to lift the wheat until half way through next year, by which time the rice crop will be coming forward in Eastern countries, whose present demand  for  wheat will accordingly diminish. As it is impossible otherwise to feed the stock the possibility exists of stock losses equal to those incurred during the drought two years ago when 10,000,000 sheep were lost. The value of the wool lost then was equal to ##£##10,000,000. </para>

It is. usual, on the occasion of the introduction of a Supply Bill for honorable members to criticize Government administration and various departmental actions. I do not propose to follow that course to-day, for it is recognized that supply must be granted to cover the election period;##'## but there is ample justification for criticism of the extravagance and unsound financial practices of the Government, and other honorable members may wish to speak on those subjects. </para>

The inquiry was ordered following charges which the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and I had made regarding the operations of the Salvage Commission and with##'## regard to the disposal of refrigerators, motor cycles, motor vehicles, army foodstuffs, tools and equipment.

Strange as it may seem, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> did not interview the members of the Advisory Board on the Salvage Commission, who had specifically asked for an opportunity to give evidence on oath. My statements in the House, and the correspondence which I read in relation to this matter, he brushed lightly aside.

He did not even attempt to ascertain from me what information I had to support my charges. At no time during the inquiry did he establish contact with me and I do not believe that he interviewed the Leader of the Australian Country party. </para>

                    <para>Departmental records and documentary evidence tendered enabled me to examine closely the allegations which are the subject of the foregoing terms of reference. On the other hand, however, the statements made by the right honorable A. W. Fadden, M.P., and the honorable E. J. Harrison, M.P., were not specific in detail, and because of their generalization the task of verification or otherwise is ex-##'## tremely difficult, ifr. Conde was appointed to inquire into charges which were made in general terms in this House. Obviously, when honorable members make certain allegations here, they do not desire to reveal the source of their information. However, we were prepared to give the necessary evidence on oath before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde,</inline> so that the persons whom we held responsible should have an opportunity also to testify on oath in an attempt to refute those charges. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> complained that we did not give specific details, and that because of our generalizations, the task of verification was extremely difficult. He could have verified every one of the charges which we had made in the Houseif he had complied with his terms of reference and taken evidence on oath from the Leader of the Australian Country##'## party and myself. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> did not call any witnesses. It is. true that he visited certain firms which I had mentioned, and I had to give instructions to. the employers to insist that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> decided to ask questions of them they should claim the right to be sworn. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>My company, as one of the largest textile waste merchants in Australia, had a considerable amount of dealings -with the- commission and I consider that the treatmentdoled out to this company and other waste firms by the commission was most unreasonable. </para>
                    <para>My reason for making this statement is that in July, 1945, my company purchased from the commission a quantity of old hosiery at ##£##102 13s.. 4d. per ton and again in September, 1945, purchased a quantity of wiper material at ##£##102 13s. 4d. per ton. At about this period the commission sold by contract at least 1,500 tons of rags to the Melbourne Syndicate at a flat rate of ##£##17 per ton. It is not possible to reconcile the action of the officers of the commission in these sales. </para>
                    <para>Whilst I was in Brisbane in October last ##]## found that the syndicates were using the commission##'##s store, Army personnel and vehicles to handle the waste.

                <para class="block">That is a clear indication as to how far this firm had progressed in its relations with a government instrumentality. If, the Minister was not satisfied with a  statement of that kind- he should have advised the commissioner to call evidence on oath. He was empowered to do so and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans</inline> was desired to give sworn evidence. It seems, however, that the commissioner was not intent on unravelling the facts; he feared what might be brought to the surface. That is the reason why no evidence was called, why the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and myself were not approached to disclose what evidence we could offer, and why this man went snooping round the firms concerned in an endeavour to get information without calling for evidence on oath.

                <para class="block">Honorable members will recall that. I asked in .this House, whether this gentleman- had been given a <inline font-style="italic">visa</inline> to go overseas and that I was informed that he was then on his way back to Australia. To say the least it seems strange that the principal figure in the case should be allowed to leave the Commonwealth at a time when the inquiry was proceeding; The terms of reference were quite clear. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baron</inline> was called ; I venture to say he was not. If he was. called, was his evidence taken on oath? Again, I venture to say it was not. A commissioner was appointed by the Government to investigate serious charges made by responsible members of this Parliament who are associated with the leadership of the two parties in opposition. Is it likely that we would have made loose charges or idle statements? .By the. documentary evidence I have produced this morning I have already proved that the charges were based on facts supplied to me by members of the Minister##'##s own advisory panel. I could do no other than bring those- facts before the House and the country; I could do no other than bring before the House the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerry,</inline> disposals officer of the commission. If the Government thought those charges of sufficient importance - and it did, po, because it appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> to investigate the matter- it had a responsibility to call all evidence that that would establish- the truth or otherwise of the allegations. After sifting the evidence <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> should have made recommendations upon which the Government could have acted. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> did not do that ; he interpreted his terms of reference as giving him authority to whitewash the charges and he immediately proceeded to do so. </para>
                <para>I turn briefly to another matter. I again direct attention to the serious position in which country people are placed as the result of the imposition of sales tax on freight charged on goods transported from the. metropolitan area to country centres. This practice imposes an unfair, burden on country people and on wholesale firms which have branches in country centres. In order to illustrate my argument I <inline font-style="italic">propose to give one</inline> or two examples of how this surcharge places country consumers at a disadvantage by comparison with city dwellers. As honorable members are aware, under the sales tax procedure,, goods purchased by merchants in a country town from the##'## branch of a wholesale, warehouse attract sales tax not only on the goods##'## themselves, but also on the freight, whereas, if they are bought direct from the main warehouse in the city, sales tax is paid only on the cost of the goods, and not on the freight. The situation is well illustrated by the following examples : The freight on a ton of good? carried by rail at the second-class rate of freight to a point 300 miles distant from Sydney is ##£##8 16s. Sales tax on the freight on those good##'##s is ##£##2 4s., if they are taxable at 25 per cent, or ##£##1 2s., if taxable at 12##£## per cent. The tax on the freight on 1 ton- of fine salt sold at. Inverell, the wholesale price of which is ##£##6 14s. 6d. a ton, on rails, Sydney, is 8s. lid. In this case the salt is taxable at. 12$  per cent., and the freight on it to Inverell is ##£##3 Ils. 3d. per ton. Here are two other examples. The first, is iri respect of a ton of fine salt purchased direct from a city wholesaler and shipped to Glen Innes. The initial cost of the salt is ##£##6 14s. 6d., the freight costs ##£##3 8s.. 6d., and sales tax at T2i per cent, on ##£##6 14s. fid##'##., adds 1Rs. 10d., making the total ##£##10  I  As-. I0d. Wow consider the same ton of salt, purchased from the country wholesaler, who is forced to pay tax on the cost, plus freight, by rulings of. the Taxation Commissioner. The cost, as before, is ##£##6 14s##'##. 6d., the freight ##£##3 Ss. 6d., and the sales tax, on cost plus the freight, at 12^ per cent., ##£##1 5s. 5d., making the total, ##£##11 8s. 5d. This represents ##"## an increase on the first example of 8s. 7d. a ton, or 6.4 per cent., directly attributable to what must be conceded to be an unjust impost. I ask the Minister for Works and Housing, in his capacity as deputy to the Treasurer, whether consideration will be given to the correction of the anomaly, which bears unduly on the country trader. It debars him from purchasing from the branch warehouse in his own town because the sales tax on the freight from the city as well as on the actual cost of the goods makes the cost so much higher. </para>

I do not intend to take up much time replying to the honorable member, because every allegation made to-day by him has been made and refuted on four or five occasions. It is amazing to hear the honorable member one day asking questions about reflections made by Ministerial supporters on people outside who cannot defend themselves, when he makes more use of this chamber than any other honorable member as a coward##'##s castle from which to attack people who cannot reply. The irony of it is that Opposition members, tongue in cheek, endeavour to make it appear to the people that we on this side of the House take advantage of the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament to attack people, whereas the truth is that this offence is committed mainly by honorable gentle:men opposite. Both the honorable member for Wentworth, and the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> have made the most irresponsible accusations against the. Commonwealth instrumentalities - the honoraWe member for Wentworth against the Salvage Commission and the Leader of the Australian Country party against the </para>

                <para>Commonwealth Disposals Commission. The -accusations against the Salvage Commission have already been effectively answered by me. The full story appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the newspapers have published a condensation; and, through both, members of the public have been able to ascertain the facts. The honorable member for Wentworth ##"##was able##"## to substantiate only one detail of his otherwise wild and mischievous accusations and the practice that he complained of was stopped ##'## immediately it came to my notice. He knows that as well as I do, but that does not stop him from coming here and uttering more baseless slander? of people who are powerless to defend themselves in this chamber. With reference to the allegation of the Leader of the Australian Country party in regard to the sale by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission of household refrigerators, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> G-.

                <quote>
                    <para>In my opinion, the transaction referred to relates to refrigerator cabinets and not to refrigerators.

                <para>That disposes of the alleged refrigerators. They were refrigerator cabinets. </para>
                <para>The truth about the sale of the material referred to by the honorable member for Wentworth is that Millar Ezzy and Company and one or two other unsuccessfully tried to compete with the purchasers, who are successfully tendering for nearly all the lines the-, commission sells. Ezzy and Bolton had submitted tenders.  I  have them before me to prove that. Because they were beaten in a business deal they scuttled off to the honorable member for Wentworth to get him to make charges in this House. My private secretary, a public servant of many years standing and with a very high reputation, is sitting in the gallery behind me. He was present when Bolton came to see me and remained the whole time that Bolton was there. If Bolton says - and I do not believe that he does, for the honorable member only read a letter that was not signed by Bolton, I understand - that  there was any acrimony in my talk with him, he is not telling the truth. </para>

                        <para>- Then he is telling an untruth. I had a witness present; there was no acrimony. In fact, Bolton shook hands with me after the interview and said he hoped that as a result of our conversation things would be straightened out. He made no charges. He admitted that he had been an adviser of the Salvage Commission, and that his main complaint was that, although he had worked in an honorary capacity, his advice had not been sought on one occasion when he thought it should have been. Neither Bolton nor I had notes taken. What I have said is the plain truth.. I will match my reputation against his at any time. My standing in the communityis at least as high as his. Moreover, I have the benefit of a witness, who is known in his private and official life as an honorable man. I do not want an argument with Bolton. All I can say is that he is using his position as  president  of the New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers, and Airmen##'##s Imperial League of Australia to play at politics. I believe that he is to be a candidate at the forthcoming general elections. I warn him that, if high officers of the league use their official positions for political purposes, the league will be smashed, because the rank and file will not stand for it. That is all I have to say. I categorically deny the honorable gentleman##'##s statements. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bolton</inline> met me in my office and told me that he was in trouble mainly because, as honorary adviser of the Salvage Commission, he##'## claimed that his advice was not sought on some occasions when it should have been sought.

I admit that the Auditor-General was correct when he said that the company was not registered at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brilliant</inline> signed the contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brilliant</inline> signed on behalf of the company, not for the company. The Auditor-General came into my office and asked me about that.I intended to make a statement in the House on the matter on the motion for adjournment or at some other time. The point is that the Auditor-General did not find that there was anything wrong. He said that there was never anything ethically wrong. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> knows something about company law, and I am sure that he would agree that there was nothing wrong in what was done. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Wentworth has referred constantly to refugees, and, in my opinion, hasattempted to distort the##'## meaning of the word. He desires to leave the impression that these people came to this country very shortly before these transactions occurred, and that there was something unsavoury about them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the honorable gentleman has repeatedly used it in the House. The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brilliant</inline> is a naturalized British subject who took out his naturalization papers in 1920, when a government of the political complexion favoured by the honorable member for Wentworth was in office. The honorable gentleman also said that Baron was given a passport and went away to Jerusalem. The fact is that he went away on only a short visit. He took out his naturalization papers in the 1930##'##s, also when an anti-Labour government was inoffice. The citizenship of these men is recognized in this country, but the honorable member for Wentworth is using this House, as a coward##'##s castle and is continually suggesting that there is something wrong with what these naturalized citizens have done in certain business transactions with which they have been connected. In one breath honorable gentlemen opposite say that we should be doing everything possible to bring immigrants to Australia and thereby increase our population, and in the next breath, for the purpose of trying to gain a paltry political advantage, they charge person##'##s who become naturalized citizens with improper practice. I have dealt with this subject on three- or four -occasions, as may be ascertained from reference to. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and the evidence in regard to it has been, published in1 our -official records.. </para>

A contract- was signed for 1,000 tons of salvage, and the quantity was afterwards increased to 1,500 tons.##'## An attempt has been- made also to lead people to believe that certain materials were improperly included, as rag. I ordered: an inquiry to be made into this##'## matter as soon as the allegations came to my notice, and it was -also subsequently investigated by the Auditor-General. </para>

                        <para>- That was admitted long ago ; but since then tenders have been called in every instance. There has been no attempt to deny that tenders were not called in this particular transaction. The Auditor-General has reported that there is not the slightest evidence of any dishonesty in. this matter, though he also said that he considered that the  chairman  of the Salvage Commission had participated in what had been disclosed as a bad business deal. I cannot remember his exact words at the moment. I have.. the report before me, but I do not intend to ##"##weary honorable members by reading long extracts from it. When the Auditor-General and the officer from the Treasury went to Queensland to examine and sort the goods that had been  sold, they had to wear gas masks at the work because the- smell was so bad. That fact indicates the quality of the goods. Since this particular transaction occurred, all sales by the Salvage Commission have been conducted by public tender. Advertisements have been inserted in the newspapers in various capital cities when salvage has. been available for sale: As the honorable member for Wentworth obtained permission to incorporate matter in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I also intend to ask for permission to incorporate certain tables relating to tenders received by the Salvage Commission for certain goods that were offered for sale. In one of these tables reference is made to a tender of ##£##135 by Associated Salvage Distributors. That was the highest tender; the next highest one was ##£##134. In respect of one parcel of goods, McLeod, Bolton and Miller,   Ezzy,  and Sydney Waste Industries Limited, submitted exactly the same tender, ##£##28, for certain goods. These were the only tenders received. These documents reveal that Associated Salvage Distributors Limited sometimes, offered prices 60 per cent, higher than other tenders. It is clear evidence that the three firms to which the- honorable member for Wentworth referred are deeply concerned because Associated Salvage Distributors Limited  outbids them. They may desire to con- . tinue to do what, no doubt, they did in the past. Apparently they ##"## put their heads together ##"## and decided that they, would not bid beyond certain prices. In that way, they could get materials at prices below their real value. With the consent of honorable members I shall incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> details of tenders submitted by Associated Salvage Distributors Limited and other firms - </para>

                    <para>. - I support and confirm the views expressed by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> regarding this alleged inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cond6</inline> into our statements about the maladministration of the Salvage Commission. When I raised this matter, I referred particularly to the sale of refrigerators, and emphasized that the inquiry should be conducted by a judge of the Supreme Court who would be able adequately to sift and assess the evidence. The report submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> reflects the greatest attempt to white-wash a government department that I have ever known. The Government appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> to inquire into the statements which I made. I use specifically the word ##"## statements ##"## because I do not desire any honorable member opposite to accuse me of having used##'## the word ##"## allegations ##"##. I made no allegations. I stated that I could not verify the statements and . claims which had been made to me, and I considered that I executed my trust as a representative of the people when I raised the matter in this House and pressed for a most searching inquiry. What has been the result ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> never interviewed me. or asked me whether I had any evidence to support by statements, who my informants were, or whether I could produce any material which might assist a proper investigation. I have in my possession the duplicates of receipts and warrants issued by the Salvage Commission regarding refrigerators. The Department of Supply and Shipping supplied to me the ledger-sheet as well as copies of warrants or receipts which were certified. What do they reveal? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> could have got this information. What the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley),</inline> stated to me in reply to a question which I asked in the House was an untruth. He said, when I raised the matter, that ten refrigerators only were sold to Fostars Foundry at ##£##10 ,each. Receipt No.- 62324 states that ##"##the price includes##"## two cases of parts. The Minister did not mention this fact. There is a big difference between selling a refrigerator at ##£##10, and selling a refrigerator with two cases of parts at the same price. The stock ledger lists one refrigerator sold by auction at ##£##4 as being a ##"## six hole display type ##"##. It is fairly good buying at ##£##4 ! But evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> was satisfied without making any inquiry or investigation. Certain receipts are endorsed by the purchaser, ##"##for my own personal use and not for re-sale ##"##. If those were junk items selling at ##£##9 10s. each, why is the admission made that they could be used and were. consequently serviceable, and why was the restriction placed on their re-sale? A. Simmick  is described in pencil on the stock##'## ledger as a carrier, and consequently, the real name of the purchaser does not appear. The prices of these items to  Simmick  are ##£##9 10s., ##£##7, ##£##7, ##£##2, ##£##7, ##£##7, ##£##7, and ##£##7, respectively. Nine refrigerators were sold to Army officers, and one was sold to a woman in Adelaide for ##£##7; Surely she . would not have paid the cost of transport from Brisbane to Adelaide if the refrigerator was- junk. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde</inline> .used the white-wash brush ##'##too thickly and too crudely. He could have been even a little subtle in his investigations, called for the evidence and arrived at something approaching a reasonable decision based upon a proper investigation by a man of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conde##'##s</inline> reputation. It is a scandalous state of affairs when the white-wash is used in an attempt to discredit the honorable member for Wentworth and myself. We are not irresponsible. We have a duty to perform, and when people make complaints to us about wilful waste and extravagant maladministration, we must raise the matters in this House. We did so in this instance. We asked for a searching inquiry, and the result is this nebulous white-washing document which purports to be findings based on searching investigation to elicit the truth. This Parliament and. the country should not tolerate that. </para>

                <para>This bill provides for the granting of supply until the 30th November next. The amount which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> seeks is ##£##45,030,000. That amount approximates the estimates that, the right honorable gentleman gave in his Financial Statement on the 12th July last. I direct particular attention to the method pf finance which the Government proposes to adopt during the next twelve months. The Treasurer stated that the provision of ##£##30,000,000 for war services represents the amount which, it is estimated, will be available from revenue receipts for the period of .three months, after allowance is made for other obligations. Therefore, of the total amount of ##£##302,000,000 which will be required for war services this financial year, the Government plans to##'## expend ##£##120,000,000- from .revenue, and the balance of ##£##180,000,000##'## will be. raised by loan. . I direct particular attention to that fact. </para>
                <para class="block">The Government##'##s plans for this financial year contemplate the borrowing of at least ##£##180,000,000. Let use examine some of the items for which we are asked to make provision. It ##'## is interesting to note the trend##'## of the Government##'##s financial policy. The amount which the Parliament is asked to provide includes the sum of ##£##3,500,000 for air-  craft equipment and stores. The inference to be drawn is that in this financial year, the Government will expend about ##£##14,000,000 in that direction. An amount equal to ##£##1,800,000 a year is provided for standard ship construction. I shall connect that matter with some remarks which I propose .to make on the Auditor-General##'##s report on that particular venture. My point is that provision is made in the Government##'##s financial proposals ##£##or giving effect to its socialization ideals. I also direct##'## attention to an amount of ##£##8,7 60 provided for the next three months for the . Investigation Branch of the Attorney-General##'##s Department. That is equivalent to an expenditure of ##£##34,000 a year on that activity. ##"##We must consider the . Government##'##s financial requirements in the light of the Auditor-General##'##s report. What has the Auditor-General said of the public accounts since this Government took office.?  His  report was laid on the table of this House last March, but copies were not. available for some time. The report is a scathing .document containing on almost every page examples of Government squandering, maladministration of every kind, bungling and inepitude.  The comments regarding government departments call for a most searching examination, and, in many cases, stringent action, against those responsible for the inefficiency and wasteful expenditure disclosed in the report. I emphasize that these criticisms are not made by the Opposition. They are not the observations of a political party on the eve of the elections. They are made by a public official who is appointed to safeguard the interests of taxpayers. The Audit Bill was one##'## of the first measures ##'##passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth when it was constituted 45 years ago.The importance of his office is beyond question. He can be described a.##«## ##"## the watchdog of the public purse ##"##. When a Minister i##»## :worn in a3 the head of a </para>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth department, he is required to assume complete responsibility for its administration.  His  duty is toensure that full value shall be received, for the money which the department expends. Yet, within the last four years,. with the Labour party in office, one report after another by the Auditor-General has criticized the administration in the most scathing terms. This officer, has reported that his strictures have been ignored, and that there has been little or no improvement of the position to which he has directed attention. In fact, repeatedly he has had to revert to criticism in his previous .reports. When other Opposition members and I have sought an explanation of the waste, extravagance and maladministration disclosed by the Auditor-General, the invariable##'## practice of the Minister concerned has been to present a report prepared by a public servant ; in other words, a ##"## whitewashing ##"## report. In the main, such reports are prepared by an officer of the department, the administration of which has been criticized by the Auditor-General. When the report has been given to the House, the whole matter has been shelved, and frequently the Auditor-General has found himself obliged to reiterate his criticism in his next report.  His  report##'## for 1943-44 was tabled on the 13th June, 1945. Even the Prime Minister and Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> had to admit that he had not had an opportunity to peruse it. Subsequently, I suggested that immediate action should be taken to investigate the highly unsatisfactory state of affairs that had been revealed by the report. The Auditor-General had strongly criticized inefficiency in accounting and stock-taking methods, as well as wasteful expenditure, particularly in the Departments of Munitions, the Army, and Aircraft Production. I suggested the appointment of an independent com- ##'##mittee of practising accountants, to investigate and report upon methods for improving the position, especially as some qf the transactions at which criticism had been directed had extended over three or four years. The Prime Minister replied that the matters relating to costing which had been brought under notice in the report would be considered. He said - </para>

                <para>In the circumstances, it is most regrettable that the Minister for Munitions, referring to the 1944 report,. should have  seen  fit to observe that the Auditor-General was not a production man and had only a rather theoretical knowledge, for which reasons he, the Minister, would prefer to he guided by production men. That a Minister should regard so lightly such an. important document as the report of the Auditor-General, is a serious matter. </para>
                <para>I have abstracted from the latest report of the Auditor-General a few classic examples of the squandering of public money which should be devoted to other purposes in a much higher priority group; for example, the re-establishment and rehabilitation: of ex-servicemen. Unfortunately, the report is twelve months old, because it refers to the year ended the 30th June, 1945. The extravagance to which. it refers has doubtless been aggravated in the year that has recently closed. Here are examples of disastrous maladministration - </para>

One would have thought that some regard would ,be paid to the criticism that had been offered, when plans were being made for the future and an expenditure of nearly ##£##2,000.000 was involved.

                        <para>- I now draw attention to an item of ##£##8,756 to cover expenditure by the Commonwealth Investigation Branch for a period of three months; proportionately the expenditure for the full year would be about ##£##34,000. It is opportune to call attention to the fact that, during the war, the Commonwealth Security .Service was set up to carry out important functions associated with the security of Australia. When the war ended, the Government appointed a committee, which included the then Director General of Security, now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Simpson, to make recommendations concerning the future of the department. I understand that that committee recommended to the Government - that the security service should he terminated. When-the matter was raised in Parliament earlier this year, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> gave an assurance that it was not intended to have a permanent security service, such as was necessary in war-time. Nevertheless, he added, there would have to be in the Investigation Branch of ##'##the </para>

                <para>It appears, however, that there is in Australia to-day, - at a time when we are not at war - an organization which is described as ##"## Evatt##'##s gestapo ##"##. , This organization is under the control  of a Colonel Jackson, who, I understand, was formerly Deputy Director of Security Service in Sydney. Two well-known. and experienced New South ##"##Wales detectives, Detectives Wilks and McDermott, who were seconded to the Commonwealth for security work during the war, are, I understand, to-day associated with this gestapo. Side by side with this organization, we have the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, which cost ##£##33,182 in 1943-44, and ##£##35,804 in 1944-45, and provision was made for an expenditure of ##£##38,800 in the financial year 1945-46. The security service cost ##£##121,579 in 1943-44 and ##£##134,184 in 1944-45, but the provision was cut down to ##£##40,000 for 1945-46. I am unable to say what the security service actually cost in the last financial year, but I do say that Parliament and the people are entitled to know how an estimated expenditure of ##£##40,000 was justified on a security service, while the Commonwealth Investigation Branch was functioning. , </para>

Are they under the control of  Colonel Longfield  Lloyd, or under the direct control of the Attorney-General?

                <para>In connexion with this subject, I have recently received details of the moneys expended out of two secret funds by the Labour Government during the past few years.

The sum ##'## of ##£##8,662 lis. 4d. was spent but of this fund on security matters, including subversive activities. It is. the successor, except in name, to the fund known as the Australian Democratic Front Fund, established for similar purposes under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Knowles, the Solicitor-General at the time. Besides this##'## fund, there is another government secret fund known as the Investigation Branch Special Fund, from which the Government has spent ##£##9,185 during it? term of office. A portion of these  money* ##'## was used in investigating subversive activities in all States. It took a good deal of questioning on my part to obtain information about expenditure from these funds. I persisted in my endeavour to get the Government to admit that it had a secret fund similar to the one which uninformed members opposite have called a ##"##slush##"## fund. I asked on the 19th July a series of questions, No. 4 of which was as follows : - </para>

                <para>On more than one occasion I have been called##'## a unificationist. I believe in the National Parliament being clothed##'## with full powers. I do not desire that the State parliaments should be .abolished, however, until either cantons or local governing provinces with clearly defined powers are created to take their place. This Parliament should be clothed with supreme authority, the cantons or local governing provinces being- vested, with delegated powers to give effect to decisions on matters of. national policy made by this Parliament. A written constitution is- not sufficiently flexible to meet the changing conditions of our times. Our Constitution was based on the American model, and ##'## the greatest difficulty has been experienced in altering it to meet changing circumstances, because the people have been swayed too much by opposing factions in the National and State parliaments. Irrespective of what government has been in office, I have supported every referendum of the people which has had for its object the clothing of this Parliament with additional powers. In ##'## every State the capital city is the centre on which every thing converges. It is true that some attempt has been made in Queensland to decentralize- governmental activities, but not much has yet been . achieved in that direction. With the exception of a- break of three years, Labour governments have been in office in that State since  1915.  For economic and other- reasons##'## the- State governments will not easily yield to the Commonwealth the powers they now possess. I regret that, because I believe the time has arrived when there should be- a complete redesigning of our legislative machinery.

                <para>Some time ago, an Australian traveller mentioned, on his return from a visit overseas, the excellence of the amenities provided for members of the legislature1 of the countries which he had visited, and the comparatively generous allowances paid to members. Few people realize the enormous expense which members of Parliament incur in looking after the needs of their constituents.. Some people believe, that members are served with meals at the refreshment rooms free of charge, and that the parliamentary allowance of  ##£##1,000  a year represents the net return to the member. Nothing could be further from the truth. After eighteen years membership of the national Parliament, I leave, it no better off than when I- joined it..

I trust that when the new Parliament assembles improved amenities will be provided in. this building and that consideration will he given to an increase of the parliamentary allowance.  Consideration might also be given to the granting of special zone allowances to those members who represent large constituencies in which they have to travel many thousands of miles to contact but a. small proportion of their electors. I understand that members of the United States Congress ##'## are paid an allowance equivalent to ##£##2,000 per annum, and that a move -is now being made to increase the allowance to the equivalent of ##£##3,150 per annum. I do not suggest what would be an appropriate allowance to pay to members of the national Parliament of this country, but I do urge that, whatever rate may be fixed, an additional allowance should be paid to members who represent the larger electorates. The electorates of the honorable members for Kennedy (Mr! Riordan) and Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Adermann)</inline> cover 300,000 and 200,000 square miles respectively. The greater part of those electorates is not served by rail and their representatives are compelled , to travel many thousands of miles by motor car, yet they receive no allowance to compensate them for the running and upkeep of their motor vehicles. \ </para>
                <para>I am glad of this opportunity to say a word or two to the people of Herbert. Fortunately the proceedings in this House are being broadcast to-day and thus my words will be heard by many more people than they could otherwise reach. To those who elected me to this Parliament in 1928, I give##'## my sincere thanks. I was returned in that year with a majority of 154. At the following election in October, 1929, my majority had grown to over 3,000. Since the preferential system of voting was adopted, I have been returned with majorities ranging from 14,000 to 19,000. The major portion of the work of a member of Parliament is done outside this building - interviewing electors, dealing with complaints, answering .correspondence, endeavouring to have anomalies -adjusted, and undertaking all the work associated with the conduct of election campaigns and the like. A parliamentary career is a .full time job, and after twenty years as a member of the Parliament, I must confess that I am a little glad to be on the eve of retiring. From the bottom of my heart I thank the people of Herbert for the trust and confidence they have reposed in me and for having given to me the opportunity and privilege to represent them in this Parliament for such a long period. </para>
                <para>I propose now to say a few words about the parliamentary staffs. In the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff we have a body of men whose worth we all recognize; they write very good speeches for us, and invariably express our thoughts in polished language. Every new member coming into this House has received the greatest assistance from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, from the Principal Parliamentary Reporter down to the newest recruit. Their courtesy and- the excellence of their work are helpful to all of us. We are fortunate to .have a highly skilled library staff which never fails to supply the information that we seek. The officers of the House of Representatives have invariably been most helpful to honorable members. In my dealings with##'## departmental heads in the Public Service - often referred to as  bureaucrats  by honorable members opposite - I have always received the utmost courtesy and consideration. To you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I pay tribute for the assistance that you have always rendered to me and the courtesy that you have shown to me. I also thank honorable members generally for their kindly co-operation throughout my association with them. I have found that my opponents hit hard but always, or nearly always, above the belt. In turn they have been hit hard, but have borne no rancour. It is a glorious recollection that I have clashed with opponents many times but have found them big enough to accept my hand of personal friendship after the heat pf the political battle has waned. I shall leave parliamentary life with no feelings of regret at my stage in life, knowing that 1 have been given a ##"##fair go##"## by practically everybody in the Parliament. I leave it at that, saying a political goodbye to all. </para>

                    <para>. -  I take this opportunity lo refer to the impending##"## departure from our ranks of at least two honorable members - the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens),</inline> a stalwart of the Labour##'## movement industrially and politically since, I think, 1893, and the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart),</inline> a staunch adherent of Labour##'##s political opponents. Neither honorable gentleman will be a candidate at the forthcoming general elections. The honorable member for Herbert, in his unswerving championship of the cherished ideals and policy of the Labour movement in  both the political and industrial spheres, has formed a great many lasting friendships.  His  popularity is not confined to members of his political and industrial fraternities. Indeed, his high principles and loyalties have won him the esteem and friendship of people in all walks of life. With his retirement he will end  18  years of continuous membership of this House, during which he has given splendid service not only to those with whom he has been directly associated in his constituency and in the other fields of his activities outside this Parliament^ but also to the Parliament itself and the country at large. In expressing to him . our goodwill and best wishes for a long, healthy and happy retirement, I speak not merely as the Leader of the Australian Parliamentary Labour party but also as the Prime Minister voicing the sentiments of all shades##'## of political opinion here represented. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta has served this Parliament since 1931. He has had a distinguished career not only as a member of the Parliament but also outside this House. He has served the community well. He brought with him into the House, particularly in regard to matters concerning social services and public health a broad vision and a desire to benefit his fellow men.  If  his parliamentary career ends without his having achieved all that it was his ambition to achieve on their behalf, that is not in any way due to lack of vigour or enthusiasm on his part. Like the honor able member for Herbert, the honorable member for Parramatta goes into retirement from active politics with his record of public serivce recognized by political friend and foe alike. He too by the breadth ##'##of his vision and his kindly spirit, as well as his enjoyment of a political battle, has won a host of lifelong friends. We wish him the best of everything in his retirement. </para>

                    <para>.- The debate on. Supply has a .historic significance for the parliamentary institution because it provides private members with the opportunity to voice grievances before voting money out of the Consolidated Revenue for the service of the Crown. It also enables the Parliament to protect the rights of individuals which, after all, is the supreme function of the parliamentary institution. It is customary on the last day of a sessional period - to-day is more than that, for it is the last day of meeting of the Seventeenth Parliament before the prorogation, after which honorable members must submit themselves , to the judgment of the electorate - to say nice things about each other and the parliamentary associations- that have been formed. . It is. with regret that  1  am impelled by my sense of responsibility to the Parliament to make some comments about the Seventeenth Parliament, because I am not .prepared to see it dissolved without issuing a final challenge to some of the developments we have witnessed in the three years of its life. I have always felt as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament that the .first responsibility of a member is to the Parliament, and through it to the people - not to the political party to which he belongs, or to the Government that he has. helped to maintain in office. He has ##'## a primary responsibility to the Parliament as an institution, because it is1 the instrument of the democracy that elects him.  He should adhere ##'## firmly to the principle that the Parliament should at all times control the Executive, which derives its authority from the Parliament.  It is my sad belief that the Seventeenth Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will be written down in history as having failed in its duty to democracy by having  weakened##'## the authority of the Parliament, and thereby weakened the protection of the rights of the subject that the people of the British Empire have fought for through the centuries, first to achieve, and then to hold. </para>

                        <para>- I do-; and before I finish, my loud-mouthed friend, the honorable . member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> will. have been discomfited, by my recital of the reasons why the Seventeenth Parliament has so dismally failed democracy: The Labour Government was returned from the polls with an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. One would have expected members of a party enjoying such a huge majority to regard as their responsibility to democracy to be critical of measures brought before them from time to time - not critical so as to embarrass the Government or. endanger its life, but critical in the sense of letting the people realize the- imperfections of bills. But though they saw the imperfections of many a measure they kept undemocratically  silent about them. The unprecedented docility of government supporters has led them so far in the reverse direction that, far ##"##from daring to show the slightest semblance of rebellion against legislative proposals that they deep down knew were not- just defective but an offence to their inherent democratic  instincts  they joined together at the -crack of the whip to present a - solid phalanx against most##'## reasonable and constructive amendments proposed by honorable members .on this side. Not all the wisdom of the Parliament reposes in the mind##'##s of Ministers and their  too  faithful adherents. And the Government of##'## to-day might easily be the##'## Opposition of to-morrow. No political party in the history of the British Empire has monopolized the allegiance of the people. So the Government of the ##"##last three years owed it to itself as well as to the electorate to hear and heed constructive criticism and advice offered##'## in the interests of the- Commonwealth by the Opposition. Instead, however, we found ourselves- swimming against the tide: The party behind the Government was regimented. What caucus decided behind closed doors was .what the Parliament willy-nilly approved, despite our. most earnest entreaties to honorable members opposite not to- be so caucus-  ridden- as to brush aside with  ill-bred scorn everything we suggested. When the party in power- regards the Parliament so contemptuously as to make it merely a rubber stamp to endorse everything put before- it, it must bring the Parliament into contempt in the judgment of the people-. A weakened parliament breeds a weakened democracy and undermines the principle that the rights of ##'##the people must be protected at all costs. Recklessly and carelessly honorable gentleman opposite have allowed##'## the traditional control by the Parliament of the Executive to pass into a regrettable decline: Worse even than that though is the fact that the Government has been so disloyal to British parliamentary practice as to allow the powers, and authority that it should fearlessly exercise in the interests of all the people pass into the hand##'##s of a political pressure group; outside the Parliament - a group which is not answerable to any one as the Parliament is answerable to- the electors, but dictates and enforces matters of policy in the interests of a select but powerful minority. </para>

But lawlessness such as we are victims of to-day and have been for years, with##'## repercussions, national .and international, of the utmost gravity is worse than condoned; action against the guilty is shirked by a Ministry too timid to enforce the law against industrial desperadoes.- Without inspired leadership we cannot have competent government, and without that we cannot have a fixed course for the Australian nation to follow to prosperity. So, because the majority that the Labour party commands in the Commonwealth Parliament has failed- to meet its obligations to the people, the Seventeenth Parliament has let Australia down. The opportunity arises ##'##for .the people to say what they think of a Government that has allowed them to be placed in the plight they are in to-day through industrial lawlessness. Last year, not this year, though unless desirable changes occur we shall have as had .or worse,  3,000,000 working days were lost, despite the Labour rule in the Commonwealth, and in five of the six States, through 945 industrial  disputes-an  all-time record, and an inglorious one, in the history of Australia. </para>
                <para>A question that must occupy the attention of every ##'##one whose thoughts dwell on the ills that##'## beset Australian economy under current conditions is whether Australia is over-regulated or under-governed. That it is over- regulated is obvious from the mass of laws and regulations that have spawned like,mushrooms since the war began and has been little lessened since it ended. That it is under-governed -is equally -obvious. .The Commonwealth Government has failed to lead the people as a true government would lead them from war into peace.  Lt  has failed to enforce its own laws designed to ensure continuity of production, with the result  that Australia isfaced with -##'##economic /disaster unless abetter spirit prevails, especially on thecoalfields. To .what degree .the  difficulties that  confront :us are due to pur being: the highest taxed people in the world, <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> requires .little thought. I assurehonorable members that what I have saidis not said by me merely as a partypolitician. I have spoken as an  Aus-tralian  citizen .disquieted by the courseevents are taking. Unless the calibre of my fellow Australians is smaller than .1 believe it to be, on the 28th September they will register their disapproval of the Labour party##'##s . maladministration and take  the  opportunity to return to power the .party that will :truly -govern the country. I am not .so ##'##much concerned, about .whether . the government comes from the ranks -of .the Labour party, .the Australian ##'##Country .party, or the Liberal party. I am concerned that a government .shall be returned to power which f will respect .and enforce the law, support the democratic institutions which have ,Deen .established in this country, respect the rights of individuals, regard the responsibility of government seriously, and guarantee freedom to the people in place of .regimentation by bureaucrats. I desire a government to be returned which will give ;yo.ung Australians the chance they should have in this great country for which they have fought so well. This is a young and . growing nation, and: it should not- be  harrassed  by quotas here and licences there, barriers in front and impediments- on .every hand. This is a pioneering country. The election .slogan- of the Labour party is ##"##.Chifley for security##"##, but this is a country of enterprise .and adventure. We .should##'##1 be more concerned about .developing a spirit of freedom and adventure than in seeking security.

                <para class="block">Holt) who, in the closing hours of this Seventeenth Parliament, has seen fit to strike a note of discord and indulge in totally unwarranted criticism, of the Government. The honorable gentleman is not accustomed to display so  much vigour; he is usually temperate in what he says. ##'## The charges that he has levelled against the Government to-day are without any basis in fact, and lack both truth and justice. He said that the Government would come to an inglorious end because of its policy of regimentation. There has certainly been no  regimentatation  among honorable gentlemen opposite, for they lack even the slightest sign of unanimity. The law of the jungle operates among them, and their parties are in a chaotic condition. They are without a. common thought or a common interest. Honorable gentlemen opposite are incapable of a united effort on any subject, and I am sure that on the 28th September the electors will indicate##'## what they think of them in no uncertain way. How could honorable gentlemen who are so disunited in their own ranks form a government which could assist in the development of this country? This lack of unity has been- manifest for a considerable time. -Some years ago two independents who were- elected to this Parliament were responsible for forcing the anti-Labour parties, out of office, and by so doing they saved this country from invasion- by the enemy. There can##'## be little doubt that but foi- the regimentation effected by this Government, our people would##'## have been regimented by a foreign aggressor, In the early days of the war, when the Japanese struck against this country, this Government took prompt steps to marshal all the resources of ##'##the nation for resistence.  At least##'## it can be said that the Government can make up its mind, and prepare and operate a plan. </para>
                <para>We cannot close our##'## eyes to the fact r.hat through the centuries it has been proved, in the Mother of Parliaments, that the party system, with all its imperfections, is the best system of government, for it gives effect to the principle of the greatest good for ##'## the greatest number. The Labour party hammers out its internal problems, and decides questions of policy in a clear-cut fashion. It then implements that policy by democratic and parliamentary means. This party is prepared to stand or fall by the policy it will present to the  electors in the next, few weeks. </para>
                <para>So far from the Government having an inglorious record, it must be said that never before in our history has a single Parliament put so much legislation of a beneficial character on the statute-book. The Seventeenth Parliament has been one of achievement. All classes of ##"##the people have benefited by its enactments. Honorable gentlemen opposite may make a clatter with##'## their interjections, but the truth of my statement cannot be denied. Nor can it be denied that Australia has never known greater prosperity than##'## it if at present enjoying. We have no unemployed people. It is true that some restrictions are still being enforced, but that is not because the people lack the money to buy goods. Indeed it is because there is a surplus of money and a shortage of goods. That is one of the major reasons why some controls still remain in operation. In reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Fawkner regarding the alleged shortcomings of this Government, I direct attention to the tribute paid to it in the press a few days ago by a disinterested observer, who explained how much better conditions were in Australia, where controls have been preserved to the degree to which they were necessary to meet the circumstances of the country, than are conditions in some other countries where no effective action has been taken to counteract the perils of inflation. The statement to which I refer was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> G. Cameron, the managing director of the Dunlop Perdriau Company, who has no axe to grind and is under no obligation to pay this tribute to the Government. He did so because he believes that the affairs of Australia have been administered better than those of any other country. Such results do not occur b4y accident. They are due to careful thought, careful planning, and the careful execution of plans. Honorable gentlemen opposite have not been able to make any plans, and I doubt whether they would be able to execute  plans if they could make them, because between the Opposition parties there is a line of demarcation as clear as is the aisle down the centre of  this chamber. . They have uo tiling in common in regard to industrial matters. When questions affecting country interests arise Australian Country party members deal with them, and Liberal party members disappear. There has never been either unanimity or cohesion in the parties opposite. I do not believe, therefore, that the people of Australia will be so unwise as to return a sufficient number of them to enable them  to form a government. </para>
                <para>Complaints. have been made about the industrial unrest in Australia. It is true that we have had to face industrial troubles, but there is industrial trouble in every country in the world. The fact remains that we have been able to expand mi- production in a remarkable way, hough we have not been able to meet all the demands for food made upon us by other countries. </para>

                        <para>- It is nothing of the kind; it is the. effect of six years of war. The Government has had to carry tremendous responsibilities during the war years. . Restrictive regulations of one kind and another have been necessary. It is not to be expected that all controls can be released within a few months of the end of the greatest war the world has ever known. To expect all controls tff be removed even twelve months after the cessation of hostilities is to expect the impossible. When production is possible in sufficient volume to meet all demands, controls can be removed. The people will then have both the spending power and the supply of goods to provide for all necessaries of life and some of the luxuries to which they are justly entitled. Human nature being what it is, unrest is inevitable. The Government, in spite of all that has been said by the honorable member for Fawkner, has a great record of achievement, and it has done a great deal to bridge the gap between the people who have and those who have not. A few years ago, an anti-Labour government declared that it had not sufficient money to provide work for the unemployed. The shops were full of goods, but people were hungry because they did not have any money with which to purchase them. This Government has wisely taken -action to prevent a repetition of that state of affairs by introducing unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits, increasing pensions and rehabilitating ex-servicemen. No one suggests that there have not been some weaknesses and imperfections in the work that has been clone. Last Monday, I had the pleasure of attending the annual conference of a certain organization in the city of Launceston. This was a non-political body, but J. believe that the members of it are not supporters of the Labour party. When moving the toast of ##"##Parliament##"##, one of the members said that he had met the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> only once, but that he was greatly impressed with him. He said, ##"## <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> is a man who. keeps his word ##"##. What greater tribute could be paid to the Prime Minister than that? Some people are wearing in their lapels to-day a small badge bearing the slogan ##"## Chifley spells security ##"##. </para>

                        <para>- I have personal reasons. I do not wear badges of any description. I believe that Chifley stands for security. I base that##'## statement on our experience since he has been the Treasurer and on his record as Prime Minister. At the forthcoming elections, the people will . decide in favour of Chifley, the Labour party and the Labour Government. They will endorse the remarks of the  speaker  at the Launceston conference that Chifley is a man who can be trusted and who keeps his word. Quite contrary to the statement of the honorable member for Fawkner, I believe that the Seventeenth Parliament of the Commonwealth will go down in the annals of Australia as one which displayed great legislative activity, foresight and anility, and which conferred great benefit upon the .. people. </para>

                <para>Although that comment is now more than six months old, it is full of point. The position is that in the normal course, a high commissioner is appointed for a certain term of years. By the device which has been used in this case, an appointment for the normal term is only about to begin, although the occupant has, in fact, been exercising the functions of the office for the greater part of a year. I do not need to underline that. This is not the time for a lot of underlining. This is the time for a simple and dispassionate statement on these matters. I have been very exercised in the last few days to read in the cables what I can only hope are most ill-founded speculations about the appointment of si Governor-General. </para>

                <para>I turn from that to say a few words about a matter which I raised a week or so ago in relation to the peace conference which is now taking place in Paris. We read a great deal in the press abou it, and we have been told from day to day that the great thing to be fought for in the peace conference is a democratic settlement of the issues between nations. I am at a loss to understand bow we can have a democratic settlement between nations if one of the nation* participating in the conference - I refer to Australia - has not had an opportunity in discuss or##'## think about the matters which will bo determined by the conference. I have read in the press, as other honorable members have, that a fight has been waged on behalf of a simple majority in the decision of questions which arise. Here is a major procedural problem. Shall all nations at the peace conference have the same voting strength, or shall there be a two-thirds majority so as to impose, some restriction upon ordinary democratic decision? </para>

                        <para>- I want to know something about it. My mind is inquiring. I am old-fashioned enough to consider that the members of the Australian Parliament should be told something about this matter, instead of having to pick up the news through the press, and that those honorable members, to whatever political party they belong, might be able to contribute something to the subject. I have before me a list of the nations. which are represented at the conference. It may very well be - I say nothing about it- that Ethiopia is  i - fi  t i ti eel to as large a voice in the peace settlement as. the United- States of America. The reasons are not very obvious to mc; but, no doubt, they are good ones because they are being expressed on behalf of Australia. I would have been assisted if the Acting Minister for External Affairs - if there be one - could have explained to us why Ethiopia should have as much power at a peace conference as the United States of America has, or why Brazil should be able to speak at the peace conference with as powerful a voice i.= the United Kingdom has. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> need not Hart talking to me about other people other events. The great event to which T direct my mind now is. the -peace conference in Paris - the conference at which, presumably, peace treaties arc to he settled, between Australia and Finland. Italy, Yugoslavia, and others. I am not. going to say dogmatically that the views which are being expressed are wrong. That would be very foolish. All I say is that I have an inquiring condition of mind. 1 should like to understand, and so. would other honorable members and  thoughtful people throughout Australia, why those views are the correct views, and why Brazil and Ethiopia should stand on equal terms with Great Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States of America. On the face of it, I had thought that those great powers and communities made an infinitely greater contribution to the deliverance of man than was made by those small countries. However, we have been told nothing about it. So far, I have spoken only about matters of procedure. Those are merely the preliminary skirmishes. After all, the value of the peace treaty will largely turn upon its terms - the essential justice of its terms - and once again we are confronted with this point, that the peace conference is apparently meeting in an atmosphere of great publicity but the only thing that wo in this Parliament know about the subject being discussed is what we read after the event in the cables from Paris. That is an intolerable position for  a  national parliament##'## to be in. In the circumstances, whoever undertakes to -peak for Australia at a foreign conference can speak the mind of Australia only by accident, because no steps have been taken to determine what that mind is, or to ascertain the joint view of this Parliament. All that we know ##"##is that some one is abroad. He has been in Australia, it, is bound to be admitted, so little that he is completely out of touch with whatever the currents of opinion here may bc. Being abroad, he says, ##"## This is what (Australia wants##"##. He may be right; he may be wrong; but there is only one way in which can bc determined what Australia wants on political problems, and that is by finding out from this Parliament what its view is. </para>

The broadcasting people cannot alter the composition of our speeches, but they do extraordinary things with them, nevertheless.

In character as in stature he was always straight. He held deep convictions, and very few persons in the Labour movement have done more pioneering work for the cause of trade unionism than he did.

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave- As</inline> T indicated earlier, the Government has been in communication with th.United Kingdom Government with a  view to  ascertaining whether the dollar position and the petrol supply position warranted the abolition of##'## rationing in Australia. We explained that to enable rationing to be abolished Australia would need an assured supply of 100,000 tons monthly to meet consumption and maintain, an adequate stock cover. The United Kingdom Government has now advised that it is still  necessary for the sterling area as a whole to obtain a large portion of its supplies from dollar sources, and that it is on account of the need to limit dollar expenditure for petrol and oil that rationing is being continued in the United King-, dom. I would also explain that significant dollar expenditures are incurred even in respect of sterling area petrol, in that it is still necessary for sterling area countries to employ foreign tankers for the transport of some part of sterling. production. The passing by Congress of the loan to the United Kingdom Government has, of- course, eased the dollar position, but it is still necessary to conserve the sterling area##'##s dollar funds. If the loan had not been made available to the United Kingdom it would have been necessary to make drastic new##'## cuts in dollar expenditure. In order to economize in the use of shipping and in the expenditure of dollar freights, each sterling area country in the main draws its . supplies from those sources which involve the shortest possible hauls. Australia therefore derives the major part of its supplies from the Persian Gulf, a sterling source. But this means that the United Kingdom supplies are obtained largely from dollar sources. As a participant in the. sterling area dollar pool Australia must take account of the overall position. In addition, the United Kingdom Government has advised that there has been a strike at Abadan, one of our major sources of supplies, and that the labour position there and in Iraq is still uncertain. No assurance could therefore be given that additional supplies could be made available from these sources in the immediate future. This also effects the overall dollar position in relation to petrol. On the grounds of foreign exchange policy and of the possibility of interruption of shipments, and consequent running down of stocks, in the event of further troubles in Australia##'##s particular sources of supply, the United Kingdom advises that it would be prudent to limit any increase in consumption to a minimum. The United Kingdom has undertaken to keep us informed of any changes in the general position and will give early advice as soon as events so shape themselves as to make possible a change in rationing policy. In the meantime the United Kingdom Government hopes that we will agree to maintain rationing. In the circumstances, the Government regrets that it is unable to abolish, rationing for the present. The existing ration to private users of 240 miles a. month will be continued, and the Government will keep in close touch with the position overseas so that rationing may be abolished as early as possible. I may add that the needs of all essential users are being fully met. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Since my statement to this House on the 5th April, 1946, when I presented details of agreements between the Australian and Unite##'##d Kingdom Governments providing for free and assisted passages for British subjects desiring to migrate to Australia, a good deal of organization has been carried on, both in Great Britain and Australia, in preparation for the commencement of the.se schemes. For the information of honorable members, I am now able to furnish some further details of the Government##'##s immigration arrangements at this more advanced, stage. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>A survey that was recently completed at -Australia House, London, showed that at the 15th June, 1946, applicants for passages to Australia totalled 33,184 British residents of the United Kingdom - representing a- total of approximately 90,000 persons, including wives, families and their dependants - and 5,212 aliens, mostly resident in Europe and representing approximately 14,000 people. These totals are small in proportion to .the number of applications likely to be received when the date oi##'## the opening of the free and assisted passages schemes is announced by the two Governments. </para>
                    <para>In the British list 95 different avocations were shown, ranging from doctor;  of medicine to unskilled labourers, with an overwhelming majority of applicant? in skilled trades and professional occupations. Only 1,500 are described as unskilled labourers and 810 have no stated occupation. The aliens, of course, are outside the scope of the British free and  assisted passages agreements, but most will be admitted readily, after establishing that they are desirable immigrants, when they are able to##'## get a passage to Australia.  </para>
                    <para>While the Government is negotiating for the means to transport new citizens to Australia on a large scale, steps are being taken to maintain the interest of these people in Australia, by providing them with information about this country and advice covering some of their individual problems. </para>
                    <para>One of the means used is the publication in London of a monthly news-sheet, edited by the Australian News and  Information  Bureau and distributed free by a mailing list compiled, on an occupational basis, from potential migrants registered at Australia House. ##'##The publication, which contains up-to-date material written in- Canberra, is called <inline font-style="italic">Australia and the Migrant. .</inline> To cope with the implementation of the full scale plans, the Immigration branch at Australia House has recently been reorganized and augmented by the appointment of expert officers sent from Australia. Included among the additional officers is an industrial ##'##expert to advise potential migrants on industrial conditions and employment prospects in Australia. The Australian authorities dealing with immigration in London are working in close co-operation with the British Ministry of Labour and National Service, which has offices throughout the United Kingdom The State Agents-General in London are also associated with, immigration, in a co-operative and consultative capacity, as members of an  Immigration  Advisory Committee, under the chairmanship of the Australian Resident Minister. </para>
                    <para>Negotiations are proceeding with the United Kingdom Government and shipowners in England, on the subject of the basic fares to be paid to the shipping companies for each migrant coming to Australia under the official schemes, and on the provision of shipping accommodation for them.

                    <para>The Government##'##s immigration programme has been endorsed in Australia by practically all responsible sections of the community.

                    <para>The Government has made its plans on the basis of our carefully measured capacity to absorb new citizens with all the advantages of the standards of living at present prevailing, which the Australian Government is pledged to maintain and improve. </para>
                    <para>Discussions have taken place between representatives of the Department of Immigration and the- Commonwealth Employment Service of the Department of Labour and National Service, in regard to surveys which are to be made by that service to establish the trades and industries in which openings exist for the absorption of migrants. Preliminary estimates in respect of certain trades are expected to be available at an early date. Arrangements are- being made for intending migrants to furnish full particulars of their skill, training and industrial background on a special form, which will be completed by the migrant and sent to the Commonwealth Employment Service in Australia prior to departure. This advance information will facilitate the placing of migrants in suitable employment immediately on arrival in this country. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members will be interested in some of the recent statements on immigration that have been made by spokes^ men of widely representative industrial and commercial bodies. The general secretary of the Australasian##'## Council of Trade Unions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Albert</inline> E. Monk, issued the following statement on the 5th June,##"## 1946:- </para>
                    <para>Not only do I welcome the recent statement of the Prime Minister that 35,000 migrants will probably arrive from Britain next year, but I go further and express the hope that ultimately##'## our full target of 70,000 migrants a year will be reached. Through ite own organization and various publicity channels, the trade union movement of Australia plans to enlist the aid of every Australian worker in  welcoming accepted migrants as co-workers and fellow citizens, assisting to build up the Australian democratic institution. They will realize that Australia##'##s immigration programme is not a haphazard venture, and that those who come here are to be absorbed on a sound vocational and economic basis. </para>
                    <para>There must 110t be any repetition of the misunderstandings of earlier immigration, when too many of those who came to Australia found themselves square pegs in round holes. </para>
                    <para>As a member of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Committee which visited Great Britain and European countries, I was pleased to see the number of British workers, and their families, who were eager to come here, and I was particularly impressed by the Swiss, Dutch, Norwegians and Swedes, as types who would make good citizens. These included highly-skilled workers as well as accomplished professional men. </para>
                    <para>In particular, this applied to the Swiss, who have a very high standard, of education. In their own country there are not positions carrying salaries commensurate with  their  qualifications, and such people would bc an asset to this country, in addition to the British migrant, who will always find a warm welcome amongst us. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>Australian employers will welcome immigrants with the qualifications already stated by the Minister for Immigration. For the benefit of industry and commerce these should include, not only highly trained artisans arid technicians, but, wherever possible, family units of such migrants. The Immigration Advisory Committee found unparalleled interest in Australian possibilities, arising from which there are vast opportunities, not only for migrants in the##'## categories mentioned, but -also for the establishment of new industries in Australia. </para>
                    <para>Employing interests throughout Australia will co-operate to the full, not . only with the Government, but also with all sections of the community in facilitating the early satisfactory absorption in Australia of all immigrants. It must be apparent to everybody that Australia must have substantially increased population. Recent investigations disclosed that migrants of the highest character : and calibre were available. To lose the present opportunity ##'## would be most unfortunate for Australia. </para>

He said that a big proportion, both men and women, ##"##must find their opportunity in manufacturing industry, and the manufacturers##'## ability to maintain continuous employment, with larger staffs, must depend upon a positive policy of long term industrial expansion. </para>
                    <para>The 1946 conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia held in Brisbane adopted the following resolution:- </para>

                    <para>The Australasian Council of Trades Unions, in giving practical expression to its views on immigration, has through its general secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monk,</inline> offered to establish liaison machinery in ##'## an advisory or consultative capacity to facilitate the transfer to Australian industry of workers from other lands. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monk</inline> has discussed liaison machinery of this sort on several occasions with representatives of the British trade unions movement, and has secured the full support of British unionists, to set up a liaison arrangement to work with Australian unions and the Australian Government on immigration. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monk</inline> has also offered to act as liaison between Australian unions concerned and myself as Minister for Immigration, covering the arrangements foi- 1,000 building tradesmen to be brought to Australia immediately. These men will be readily absorbed into industry and while presenting no major accommodation problem themselves because of the work upon which they will be engaged, will contribute materially to the solution of our housing problem. </para>
                    <para>I mentioned on the 5th April that all State governments were represented at a conference of departmental officers thai had just been held in Canberra, at which many aspects of -immigration were discussed. These officers have since reported to their Ministers, who have now. accepted##'## invitations to meet Commonwealth Ministers at a conference on immigration in Canberra on the 19th August, the day preceding the opening of the Premiers Conference. This conference will deal with the report on the matters arising from the Ministers##'## con:ference. Reception, accommodation and ##"##after-care##"## of migrants brought to Australia under the programme of encouraged migration will be among the many important matters to be resolved at these meetings. Already a good deal of progress has been reported but there are several aspects yet to be dealt with. Other important matters awaiting the attention of State Ministers in Canberra on the 19th August relate to youth and child immigration schemes, ##"## nomination ##"## and selection of migrants, priority categories for early passages to Australia, financial arrangements, and the industrial needs and absorptive capacity of the States in relation to distribution- between the States of immigrants brought to Australia under official schemes. </para>
                    <para>To carry out the. Commonwealth##'##s immigration functions in the States, and to maintain  liaison  with State government immigration, authorities, the Commonwealth Department of Immigration has been expanded by the establishment of State branches in every State capital. </para>

An important item of legislation submitted to the Commonwealth Parliament during the present session dealt with the legal guardianship of all children brought to Australia under the auspices of any governmental or non-governmental migration organization. The legislation does not apply to immigrant children who  came to Australia with, or to live in the care of, their parents or relatives. </para>

Of these, 3,545 are from the Royal Navy, 258 from the Royal Air Force, and 156 from the British Army. </para>
                    <para>The Government has, during the life of this Parliament, laid the foundation of a long term immigration plan calculated to build Australia in a comparatively short time to a powerful nation - one capable of standing on its own feet against any eventuality that might arise - a land inhabited by a happy and independent people with an assured future. The population problem in Australia is one above the interests of any section of the community, and it is from this point of view that the present Government has approached the subject. </para>
                    <para>We need a much bigger population if we are to hold this land for ourselves and our children, and we can get it by a greatly increasd birth rate and a greatly increased flow of immigrants. This is a land inhabited by a free, proud and democratic people. </para>

                        <para>Any purchaser of Bren gun carriers not in a position to obtain spare parts should contact the regional manager of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission in the Statein which, he is located. The Commonwealth Disposals Commission does not sell retail, but is in a position to advise inquirers of any firm which carries stocks, or when the next auction sale of Bren gun carrier spare parts will take place. Stocks of Bren gun carrier parts, mainly surpluses from uncompleted contracts, arc vastly in excess of any needs by purchasers of Bren gun carriers, and the commission##'##s normal method is to quit such stocks by public auction. If the honorable member for Corangamite will advise me of the name of the primary producer concerned.I will arrange for the Commonwealth Disposals Commission to fully inform him of sources of supply for such parts ashe might require in the future. </para>

Further, additional price reductions will be made as soon as reductions of the cost of motor cylinder oil indicate that such are justified, as has already been done with other petroleum products. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The question of the  deduction of overpaid allotments from the estates of deceased mcn has been under consideration from time to time, and on 10th April last I furnished a detailed reply in the House .to questions raised by the honorable member for Lang and the honorable member for Balaclava. It was then stated that no recoveries were effected in any instances from dependants, or from allottees who, though shown by the soldier concerned at the time of making the allotment to be non-dependent, were able to produce proof that they were in fact dependent or partly dependent on the soldier. I have given further careful consideration to the position of other  nondependants,  but regret that I cannot see my way to depart from the decision already given. </para>
                        <para> On the subject of pay in lieu of recreation leave due at the time of the death of a member of the forces, this question is atpresent under consideration,but due to the fact that records of recreation leave of members of the forces which were maintained in the earlier years of the war are not in a satisfactory state, it would be difficult to determine the amount of pay in lieu of such leave that would be due to the estates of such members, if approval were, given to making this decision retrospective. The honorable member will be informed immediately a decision is given. </para>

                    <para>- On the 26th July, the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> referred to questions which had been asked by him on several occasions as to the need for payment of subsistence allowance of 3s. a day to men who were captured by the Japanese and held as prisoners of wor for three  and a half years. I advised the honorable member that I would further investigate this matter, and now desire to state that, as a result of the further investigations that have been made, it is not proposed to authorize the payment as suggested by him of a subsistence allowance to prisoners of war while in enemy hands. </para>

                    <para>The representations that were made by  the honorable member in the House of Representatives on the 12th July, 1946, and the further representationsmade by him on the 26th July, 1946, were specially considered before arriving at this decision. </para>
                    <para>Thehonorable member in his representations on this subject has referred to the payment of field allowance to officers, and has suggested that, because of such payment, a subsistence allowance of 3s. a day is justified for other ranks. There are a number of factors which must be taken into consideration in dealing with this case, but the most important one is the necessity for ensuring that no special privileges are extended to one section of the forces that would create an injustice or inequality of treatment. When the position of members of the Australian fighting forces held in cap- . tivity by. the Japanese was considered by the Government, it was decided that the pay and allowances of these members should be continued at the daily rate applicable to their rank, and that no debits should be raised against their pay during the period of their captivity. Under this decision, as field allowance was an allowance in the nature of pay which was credited to an officer##'##s pay account throughout the whole of his service, it was automatically continued during the period of the officer##'##s captivity, in the same way as it was continued to officers while taking part in active service operations against the enemy. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member has suggested that, because of the payment of field allowance, other ranks should receive a subsistence allowance of an equivalentamount. Careful consideration has been given to his representations, but such an allowance cannot be approved, because it would automatically involve##'## the payment of subsistence allowance to all members of the forces, whether in captivity or otherwise, who because of military operations, or for any other service reason, could not be provided with meals and rations under conditions which were normally applicable when those forces were at rest in base areas or at their nome stations. </para>
                    </continue>
                    <para>Honorable mem##'##bers will be aware that, under active service conditions, it was not always possible to provide the troops with service rations, and that this situation existed throughout the whole of the period of the war in North Africa. Greece, Crete, Syria and in the South - West Pacific area, and I quote from a communique received while the fighting was in progress in the Owen Stanleys in the early stages of the New Guinea campaign:- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>During this campaignin the Owen Stanleys our troops were supplied by aircraft by free dropping. Their supplies were calculated at 5 lb. per man per day - <inline font-style="italic">2%</inline> lb. of ammunition and21/2 lb. of dry rations - and they had to live and fight upon it. They had to climb over precipitous mountains; mostly ankle deep or knee deep in mud. It rained continuously and they were seldom dry. At times they were 7,000 feet up in the mountains where the nights were bitterly cold, with half ablanket to protect them. They carried weights up to 00 lb. on their backs, but they never grumbled. On the contrary, they carried on with that spirit of self-sacrifice which has always dis tinguished our Australian soldier. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It would be illogical and unjust to pay a subsistence allowance to prisoners of war and not pay a similar allowance to. members who fought under conditions such as these. As already indicated,it is the view of the Government that the  treatment that has been accorded to prisoners of war in relation to their pay accounts is not illiberal, and it is not proposed to depart from the payments now authorized under the Regulations and existing conditions. </para>

                        <para>y.- On the 6th August the honorable member for Flinders(Mr. Ryan) asked me whether it is intended to make special concessions to candidates in. the forthcoming elections in respect of petrol and tyres. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In reply, I inform the honorable member that it has been approved that any necessary tyres and tubes should be made available for fitment to a motor vehicle owned and operated by any candidate for the federal elections or a member of a State legislature, as well as for fitment to a motor vehicle on loan or on hire to such a member or candidate for use in connexion with the election and referendum campaigns. Individual applications for such tyres and tubes should be made through the local transport advisory committees to the tyre distribution branch ineach capital city. </para>
                    <para>In regard to petrol, special rations will be provided for each candidate for the House of Representatives and the Senate. The rations issued will, of course, be greater for candidates for the Senate and country constituencies, in view of their greater travel obligations. Those special rations will be made avail- able on the submission of applications by present members, or in the case of candi- dates who are not sitting members, upon their receiving the nomination or endorsement of a recognized party. An indepen dent candidate will receive the ration as soon as definite proof of his candidature, i.e., a lodging of a nomination, is received. These special rations are being granted for joint election and referendum campaign purposes and, as in the case of the 1944 referendum, certain rations will also be issued to members of State parliaments. The Minister for Supply and Shipping is arranging for full details of these arrangements to be conveyed to all members of State and Federal legislatures, and to prospective candidates as quickly as possible so that use can be made of the special rations at the earliest opportunity. </para>

I am now in a position to furnish the following information to the honorable member :  - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>On the 6th June, 1946, an area of about 117 acres of land atRegents Park was acquired by the Commonwealth for defence purposes. </para>
                        <para>The acquired area, which has been held under National Security (General) Regulations since 1941, is used as a storage depot by the Army and Royal Australian Air Force. As large Commonwealth expenditure has been incurred, and the depot is required for defence purposes indefinitely, the acquisition was necessary in the Commonwealth##'##s interest. Part of the land was formerly owned by Hume Steel Limited, and Babcock and Wilcox, two large industrial concerns. Although the acquired portions of their properties were vacant scrubcovered land before being occupied by the Commonwealth, representations, have been made to the effect that each company wishes to embark on an expansion of its works on to the land acquired by the Commonwealth. There have been several preliminary conferences between some  of  the owners affected and departmental officers who were examining the owners##'## representations with a view to reaching some suitable compromise, which, while meeting Commonwealth requirements, would cause a. minimum of disturbance to the development of the companies concerned. Although no finality was reached before the acquisition was effected, it did not appearpossible that certain parts of the land taken by the Commonwealth but not actually occupied by Commonwealth buildings of importance could, perhaps, be released. I recently took this up with the Minister for the Army, to ascertain whether in fact and without detriment to Commonwealth requirements, any of the acquired land could be released. A decision on this aspect of the matter has not yet been reached, and it must be appreciated that a fairly exhaustive examination of post-war defence requirements, particularly in respect of storage accommodation, will be required before such a decision is given. I have, however, assured each of the companies mentioned above that, as soon as finality is reached on the question of whether or not any of the acquired land can be released, I will arrange for a senior officer of the department to confer with them to examine the##'## proposals they have submitted, with a view to arriving at a satisfactory arrangement. In view of the Government##'##s policy of assisting industrial development it may be assumed that the department will give most careful consideration to the companies##'## proposals and endeavourto cause as little disturbance as possible to the plans for the expansionof their factories. The honorable member forReid is assured therefore, that his consistent representation##'##s will receive careful and sympathetic consideration. </para>

                        <para>Personnel who were sentenced by court martial prior to the 31st December, 1945, for illegal absence will have their cases reviewed forthwith, and the balance of sentence will be remitted in each case, provided conduct while in detention has been good. The cases of those who were sentenced after 31st December, 1945, who have served three months or more of their sentences will be similarly reviewed with a view to the remission of the balance of the sentences. The sentences of those who are at present undergoing detention, but who have not yet served three months of such sentences, will be reviewed on a similar basis on completion of a period of three months in detention: The policy to be followed in future in regard to the remission or otherwise of sentences of members undergoing detention or imprisonment for military offences other than illegal absence, is at present under review, and a, public announcement will be made as soon as a decision is arrived at. </para>
